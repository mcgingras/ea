It covers why we recommend each skill, how to get started learning them, and how to work out which is the best fit for you.</p><p>Each article looks at one of eight skill sets we think are most useful for solving the problems we think are most pressing:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/political-bureaucratic/\"><u>Policy and political skills</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/organisation-building/\"><u>Organisation-building</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/research/\"><u>Research</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/communication/\"><u>Communicating ideas</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/software-tech/\"><u>Software and tech skills</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/emerging-power/\"><u>Experience with an emerging power</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/engineering/\"><u>Engineering</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/specialist-knowledge/\"><u>Expertise relevant to a top problem</u></a></li></ul><h2>Why are we releasing this now?</h2><p>We think that many of our readers have come away from our site underappreciating the importance of career capital. Instead, they focus their career choices on having an impact right away.</p><p>This is a difficult tradeoff in general. Roughly, our position is that:</p><ul><li>There\u2019s often less tradeoff between these things than people think, as good options for career capital often involve directly working on a problem you think is important.</li><li>That said, building career capital&nbsp;<i>substantially</i> increases the impact you\u2019re able to have. This is in part because the impact of different jobs is heavy-tailed, and career capital is one of the primary ways to end up in the tails.</li><li>As a result, neglecting career capital can lower your long-term impact in return for only a small increase in short-term impact.</li><li>Young people especially should be prioritising career capital in most cases.</li></ul><p>We think that building career capital is important even for people focusing on particularly urgent problems \u2014 for example, we think that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#phd-timelines\"><u>whether you should do an ML PhD doesn\u2019t depend (much) on your AI timelines</u></a>.</p><h2>Why the focus on skills?</h2><p>We break down career capital into five components:</p><ul><li>Skills and knowledge</li><li>Connections</li><li>Credentials</li><li>Character</li><li>Runway (i.e. savings)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We\u2019ve found that \u201cbuild useful skills\u201d is a particularly good rule of thumb for building career capital.</p><p>It\u2019s true that in addition to valuable skills, you also need to learn how to sell those skills to others and make connections. This can involve deliberately gaining credentials, such as by getting degrees or creating public demo projects; or it can involve what\u2019s normally thought of as \u201cnetworking,\u201d such as going to conferences or building up a Twitter following. But all of these activities become much easier once you have something useful to offer.</p><p>The decision to focus on skills was also partly inspired by discussions with Holden Karnofsky and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bud2ssJLQ33pSemKH/my-current-impressions-on-career-choice-for-longtermists\"><u>his post on building aptitudes</u></a>, which we broadly agree with.</p><p><strong>If you have more questions, take a look at&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/#frequently-asked-questions\"><strong><u>our skills FAQ</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2>How can you help?</h2><p>Please&nbsp;<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/skills/\"><u>take a look at our new series</u></a> and, if possible, share it with a friend!</p><p>We\u2019d love feedback on these pages.

As John Ray III, who took over as chief executive during the bankruptcy, put it, \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re not going to be able to recover all the losses here.\u201d He was countering Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s repeated claims that he could get every customer their money back.</p><p>Well, it turns out, FTX lawyers told a bankruptcy judge this week that they expected to pay creditors in full, though they said it was not a guarantee and had not yet revealed their strategy.</p><p>The surprise turn of events is raising serious questions about what happens next. Among them: What does this mean for the lawsuits FTX has filed in an attempt to claw back billions in assets that the company says it\u2019s owed?</p><p>Will the possibility that customers could be made whole be raised at Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing? Will potential relief for customers help his appeal?</p><p>[...]</p><p><strong>Some of the clawback cases involve allegations of fraud, but not all do. </strong>Before fraud claims are argued, there is typically a legal fight over whether a company was insolvent at the time of the investment or that the investment led to insolvency. If every FTX creditor stands to get 100 cents on the dollar, the clawback cases that don\u2019t involve fraud wouldn\u2019t serve much of a financial purpose and may be more difficult to argue, some lawyers say. \u201cIn theory, clawbacks may go away there,\u201d said Eric Monzo, a partner at Morris James who focuses on bankruptcy claims.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24408442-ftx-trading-ltd-013124-2\">Court proceedings</a>:</p><blockquote><p>we can now cautiously predict some measure of success. Based on our results to date and current projections we anticipate filing a disclosure statement in February describing how customers and general unsecured creditors, customers and general unsecured creditors with allowed claims, will eventually be paid in full. I would like the Court and stakeholders to understand this not as a guarantee, but as an objective. There is still a great amount of work and risk between us and that result, but we believe the objective is within reach and we have a strategy to achieve it.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "Samin"}}, {"_id": "rBvNeq2h3HaEPdNeP", "title": "EA and Judaism Intro Fellowship ", "postedAt": "2024-02-14T03:01:53.717Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>The EA and Judaism Intro Fellowship is an 8-week virtual program you can do alongside school or work that explores the core ideas of effective altruism and their relation to Jewish tradition, texts, culture, and history.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The fellowship will explore questions such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>What do Jewish texts and tradition have to say about our obligations to the global poor, animals, and future generations?</li><li>How much better are the best options to do good compared to others?</li><li>What can we do to most effectively address pressing global problems like global poverty, pandemics, and risks from emerging technologies?</li><li>Is there a uniquely \u201cJewish\u201d approach to doing good?</li><li>How should we balance concern for Jewish priorities vs. global priorities?</li></ul><p><br>It\u2019s an opportunity to deepen your understanding of global issues and their relation to Jewish texts and tradition; increase the impact you achieve through your career, donations and other projects; and connect with other Jews pursuing high impact paths in a diverse range of fields.</p><p><strong>In addition to providing a structured format for reading and discussion, we also connect fellows who are interested in particular areas of social impact with relevant people, resources, and opportunities to help them achieve the impact they are excited to achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The fellowship is open to people of all Jewish backgrounds and does not adopt the perspective of any particular Jewish denomination or community. <strong>It will start the week of March 17th and last for 8 weeks.</strong> Each week, fellows will read ~2 hours of carefully curated texts and participate in a 60-minute small group discussion with other participants and a trained facilitator.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The deadline to apply is March 10th.</strong></p><p>We look forward to reading your application!</p><p>For any questions, reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:Shalom@eaforjews.org\">Shalom@eaforjews.org</a>.</p>", "user": {"username": "EA for Jews"}}, {"_id": "ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq", "title": "Location Modelling for Post-Nuclear Refuge Bunkers", "postedAt": "2024-02-14T07:09:58.065Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>The proposal was written in collaboration with Aria Puri (ariapuri8@gmail.com)</i></p><p><i>If you have any questions, suggestions or ideas for collaboration to take this further, we'd love to hear so feel free to reach out at (bleddynmott@gmail.com)</i></p><p><i>Additionally, are currently looking for mentorship/guidance within the field of engineering/physics, particularly related to Effective Altruism, so we would love to talk if you have experience within this field.</i></p><h1>Executive Summary</h1><p>This research paper addresses the strategic deployment of refuge bunkers for nuclear winter, aiming to enhance logistics and efficacy through the development of a mathematical model that determines which locations are suitable for a bunker. The model, based on a multi-criteria evaluation approach, incorporates four critical parameters\u2014population density, seismicity, shear strength of soil, and temperature\u2014assigning weights based on their relative importance. Through the analysis of sample data, the paper evaluates the model's applicability and effectiveness. The study also provides policy framework suggestions to ensure the successful execution of the model in determining optimal bunker locations, providing valuable insights for enhancing societal resilience in the event of a nuclear catastrophe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><u>I. THEORY</u></h1><p>The concept of a nuclear winter refers to the climatic and environmental aftermath that follows a large-scale nuclear war, characterised by the injection of massive amounts of soot into the Earth's stratosphere, blocking sunlight and causing a significant drop in temperatures. The resulting conditions could lead to widespread crop failure, food shortages, and devastating consequences for ecosystems and human societies.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/kyuckuaz8qs7ygyyc1kg\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/jexov5izrbprmpydlnvi 96w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/hihiuzz5n1xwkxmqcunr 176w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/rnaxv7jer4qck8fttyqq 256w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/qxyxrsgxoap7aku2ct0z 336w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/pqnkanzoz5a2z2xl9krd 416w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/k16q9pmqjbjqbevdj4zd 496w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/vxbqvwzsytzxkdqx9jcz 576w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/fg1rd72qvrxdq6hus63f 656w\"><figcaption>Fig. 1.

Prevention focuses on averting the initiation of a catastrophe, while response aims to halt its escalation into a global catastrophe. Resilience addresses the question of how society can effectively cope in the aftermath of a widespread disaster, ensuring a capacity for recovery and rebuilding.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/dmlhfw6gegi4urmd9ivb\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/syufn8p2cjd876qwxtal 105w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/ocg4euumdy4ai0gyysuy 185w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/f0mwjw1ooo3v6nbvhfzc 265w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/o0xhoyn7w5zmymsi2e2l 345w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/fu9vqalwvwvarvgnk8us 425w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/g8bso5gvonxu4a50klbp 505w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/vbebbzeaxtwiravoi7hi 585w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/z5vnibfwsa0kashyji5d 665w\"><figcaption>Fig. 2. The Three Layers of Defence of Catastrophic Risk [2]</figcaption></figure><p>Given the potential catastrophic consequences of a nuclear winter, bunkers serve as a key component in the response and resilience layers, safeguarding a portion of the population from immediate dangers and offering a foundation for recovery. Envisioned characteristics of bunkers, based on existing research, are a subterranean refuge a few metres below the ground, as that is enough distance to have suitable protection but also allow ease of exit in the case of collapse, offering a slight chance of survival rather than a certain death far below the soil. Many other considerations go into the bunker design, such as minimum viable population to sustain genetic diversity - with there being a range of values[3] from around 80 up to 160. Bunkers, designed with these criteria in mind, contribute significantly to the overall goal of enhancing civilisation resilience in the face of a nuclear catastrophe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>II. PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1><p>In today's complex geopolitical landscape, the proliferation of nuclear capabilities poses urgent challenges that require innovative solutions. China's expanding nuclear arsenal introduces a \"Three Body Problem,\" disrupting orbital dynamics among major nuclear powers like the U.S. and Russia, challenging traditional deterrence strategies rooted in duels.</p><p>Advanced technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, bring both threats and opportunities to strategic stability, especially in the context of nuclear dynamics. Financial constraints worsen the situation, with major foundations withdrawing from the nuclear field, leaving a significant funding shortfall compared to other sectors.</p><p>The nuclear problem's structure involves recognising the disproportionately devastating effects of large-scale nuclear wars and uncertainties in critical areas like nuclear winter science and escalation control. Deep uncertainty and unforeseen events add complexity, with constant concerns about accidents and potential rearming trends.</p><p>Historical precedence, exemplified by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, serves as a stark reminder of nuclear weapons' catastrophic consequences. Recent geopolitical concerns, including Russia's potential use of tactical nuclear weapons, highlight the persistent threat and the need for global risk mitigation.</p><p>Nuclear war's potential for unprecedented devastation, including widespread loss of life, environmental devastation, and long-term health consequences, makes it a unique and interconnected global concern. The looming existential threat necessitates immediate attention, emphasising the urgency to address and mitigate this global risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>III. LOCATION MODELLING</h1><p><strong>Model Overview:</strong> A Multi-Criteria Evaluation model will be used, resulting in a suitability index for each location that allows comparison between different locations. The first step in setting up this model will be choosing both the factors and constraints that will govern this model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A. Assumptions</strong></h2><p>This model makes a number of assumptions due to the convolution that could be introduced by certain parameters. It is assumed that a full scale nuclear war has broken out, so the model does not include a parameter regarding distribution of the radioactive fallout to find a place that is potentially not radioactive, as the model is also meant to be able to be used in specific areas, not just finding the single best worldwide. Additionally, the lack of clear climate modelling as a result of nuclear winter means potential effects like flooding have not been included, however the model does include a parameter of temperature that demonstrates how they could be incorporated in future. Primarily, it is vital to reiterate the focus for this model is the best place for a bunker to survive the nuclear winter, rather than the best location for civilisational rebuilding which would have different factors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>B. Factors and Constraints</strong></h2><p>In the following, the definition of factors used will be \u201cparameters for the model that express varying degrees of suitability for the decision under consideration\u201d, and constraints will be the Boolean variables that \u201cserve to delineate area not suitable for consideration\u201d[4]. One factor from four key areas of social, geological, structural and weather have been chosen, based on what would have the greatest impact in that category and providing an example of how further, location specific parameters in each of these may be incorporated into the model.</p><h3>1) Social - Population Density</h3><p>For social parameters, the chosen factor is population density, which is measured in people per km^2, and will have a significant negative correlation with bunker suitability, as suggested by Turchin et al., (2019).[5] Firstly, as the model\u2019s goal is to save only the 100-150 people required for the minimum bunker population, any increase in occupants would drastically decrease the chance of survival. Existing populations around the bunker would compete for resources, and hostile groups would attempt to gain access to the bunker in order to save themselves, jeopardising everyone\u2019s chance of survival. Additionally, the population density will have a positive correlation to the chance of being a potential attack target\u2014aggressors will likely look to inflict the most possible damage on a country.</p><h3>2) Geological - Seismicity</h3><p>In terms of potential geological impacts, earthquakes undeniably would inflict serious damage on the structural integrity of the bunker. To measure this as a parameter, the Gutenberg-Richter b-value is used, which expresses the relationship between the magnitude and total number of earthquakes in any given region and time period, and is a critical parameter for probabilistic estimation of seismic hazard.[6] Most importantly, it means only a single parameter is required for the incorporation of seismicity and hazard from earthquakes in the model, rather than both frequency and magnitude.</p><h3>3) Structural - Shear Strength of Soil</h3><p>Shear strength of the soil/rock that makes up the ground has been chosen as the primary structural factor of this model, and relates to the ability of the soil/rock to resist deformation under stress, measured in kPa within the model. Although shear strength is a good overall indicator of the ground\u2019s suitability for construction to minimise risk of catastrophic structural failure, it is acknowledged that there are many more potential measures that could also be incorporated, which will be discussed at the end.</p><h3>4) Weather - Temperature</h3><p>As described previously regarding the impact of nuclear winter, one of the major changes will be in climate, specifically the mean temperature drop globally. Modelling by Coupe et al. (2019)[7] simulates the injection of 150 Tg soot injection into the atmosphere, and has resulting data for the mean temperature anomaly, which varies across different regions in the world [See Figure Below]. Combining this and current mean temperature will create the predicted mean temperature, which is an important factor to consider - having temperatures too far from the ideal is likely to shorten the lifespan of occupants, as well as requiring far more energy to counteract, which may make long term survival impossible.<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/i0xtawf4kak9dojyroe4\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/y2fkyap3emq8tgmqxrfs 102w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/dtakv79so5jfqvtg1i6h 182w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/kbx0dhvdlvn7xzueq40q 262w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/zetokwmlafygl1k9s3pd 342w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/tdm9zzz6fmptii7sfac6 422w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/jbqgo9bwpobstslqcion 502w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/noqogfnv2hesup7woll4 582w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/rrxbn5ml9psxkjxqm3hl 662w\"><figcaption>Fig. 3. Modelling by Coupe et al., 2019 [7]</figcaption></figure><h3>5) Constraint - Blast Radius</h3><p>A constraint applied to this model is that the location cannot be within the blast radius of likely targets, and is treated as a Boolean constraint rather than a factor as it is either inside or outside. Initially this model chooses the major cities within countries that have a nuclear weapon arsenal, as they would be likely targets and models blast radius based on the largest warhead currently in the US arsenal (the 1.2 Megatonne B-83) in order to future proof the model for further nuclear developments, using the NUKEMAP by Alex Wellerstein.[8] All locations within the thermal radiation radius of this warhead (13.2 km) are deemed unsuitable - a suitable bunker may still be within the \u201cLight Blast Damage\u201d radius outside this thermal radiation radius, but this would have negligible direct structural effects for a subterranean bunker, as only 1 psi of overpressure is expected, which correlates with the breaking of glass windows at a maximum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>C. Mathematical Modelling</h2><p>Ultimately, the goal of this model is to compute a suitability index for each given location based on its specific values for the factors and constraints. This computation enables the ranking of locations, with higher indices indicating better suitability. The underlying principle guiding this model is the concept of a fuzzy set, which accommodates degrees of membership within a set, represented by a decimal value ranging from 0 to 1. This approach allows for the calculation of a suitability index and subsequent ranking of locations. The entire process involves four steps: standardisation, weighting, calculation, and decision-making, which may include an optional logic check.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>D. Standardisation</h2><p>For the constraint of blast radius, standardisation is simple due to its inherent Boolean property, and all that needs to be done is specify that:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Within the 1.2 Mt Thermal Radiation Radius = 0</li><li>Outside the 1.2 Mt Thermal Radiation Radius = 1</li></ul><p>Membership functions must be formulated in order to best reflect the ideal behaviour of the factors, and their data distribution. A membership function is used to specify the degree to which a given input belongs to a set [9], by outputting the value for the degree of membership (between 0 and 1) discussed earlier.\\par<br>In setting up membership functions, it is important to consider what input values should correspond with maximum suitability (1), which should correspond with minimum (0), and use these as anchor points of the function.</p><h3>1) Population Density</h3><p>For the consideration of population density, the selected membership function is&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"f(x) = e^{a-bx}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

Instead, it is advisable to choose points where the factor begins to exert an effect and where the effect becomes negligible on suitability.[4]</p><p>In the context of seismicity, specific thresholds are relevant. Values less than 1.0 correspond to seismically active regions, while 2.0 tends to represent the least seismically active areas. Beyond these thresholds, the factor has little impact as the region is either highly active or not active. To accommodate this, the membership function should be adjusted so that these values align with the asymptotes.</p><p>To achieve this, anchor points are set at suitability values of 0.05 and 0.095, allowing for slight improvement beyond these points.

Temperature Membership Function</figcaption></figure><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>E. Weighting</h2><p>After standardisation, the next crucial step involves assigning weights to each factor. This stage often introduces substantial bias and inconsistencies in terms of the weights\u2019 interrelations. To address this issue, our model employs a pairwise comparison process developed by Saaty (1977)[11], known as the Analytical Hierarchy Process, for developing weights. In this process, each factor is systematically compared to every other factor on a 9-point reciprocal scale, as illustrated in the table specifically designed for this model (see below). One particularly challenging comparison was between seismicity and population density. However, population density was determined to be twice as important, given that locations with the potential for severe seismicity have already been accounted for through the membership functions. It is recommended to compute the weights from the pairwise comparison matrix using the principal eigenvector, a process implemented through computational programs in our model but can also be estimated through a variety of shorter processes.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/gvmcs8nwp3vzjjouhch2\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/zaragfctor2n4xmgza2o 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/frvkgmf6r3zk4h9kces4 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/anpgvgn8prkd1cqxg7vs 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/fihjpnzfmmyoo6fww0zk 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/elj9ctj2m8qmppkscw7g 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/m6vvgtougxj5hdodaffj 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/pu4rmtdkqb5uvaob7yn3 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/x2fbzqb2jaxvju4jgiqx 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/nnesiddg5imufwtpb7nm 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/xqualewbynwj2vqiagcf 1110w\"><figcaption>Fig. 8.

While this yields a suitability index, it necessitates the application of a Boolean constraint. The calculation of this constraint involves a T-Norm, a method for determining values at the intersection of two fuzzy sets.</p><p>Multiplying the Boolean value by the suitability index ensures that suitable locations remain unchanged, while unsuitable ones are set to 0. This is illustrated in the provided formula, where the sum of the weight multiplied by the standardised score is further multiplied by the Boolean constraint, resulting in the final suitability index.</p><p>The earlier introduction of the Weighted Linear Combination introduces the concept of trade-off, where a low score on one factor can be offset by a high score on another.[4] However, in the ultimate calculation involving the Boolean constraint and an intersection T-norm, there is no trade-off. This ensures that an unsuitable score for blast radius renders the entire location unsuitable, without the possibility of compensation by any other factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>G. Decision-Making</h3><p>The presentation and decision-making process for the final data can vary based on the data and format used.</p><p>Spatial coincidence offers one approach, involving overlaying map layers with different colours, akin to the steps in the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC). This visually highlights the most suitable areas. Alternatively, the final suitability index can be directly calculated, and areas can be shaded accordingly, as demonstrated in our example.</p><p>Once the suitability index is established, an efficient computational method for decision-making involves ranking the locations. Fulfilling any area demand, such as selecting the top 10 locations, becomes straightforward by starting with the highest-ranked locations and working down the list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>H. Logic-Check</h3><p>Finally, it is advisable to conduct a logic check on the final ranking to address any parameters not considered in the model. For instance, if the ranking suggests an ideal location that is inherently inaccessible, and accessibility is not a parameter within the model, such results can be excluded from consideration. Recognising that no model can comprehensively cover all factors, this logic check ensures that the final rankings align with practical considerations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>IV. ANALYSIS</strong></h1><p>The model was used to analyse a 10 x 10 sample grid of raw data (refer to APPENDIX I). The values underwent weighting and processing, as illustrated in Figure X. Subsequently, the resultant suitability values were translated into a grayscale map using python (refer to APPENDIX II), emulating the data presentation format commonly used in GIS software as shown in the figure below. The cells were ranked, indicated by the number within the cell, with rank 1 being the most optimal location for bunker placement. As seen, preliminary testing would suggest the model can successfully identify areas suitable for a nuclear refuge, how further testing is required.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/yzqrlan8d7wdwxagm6op\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/w8t4kawx1megkry2ciig 124w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/z1sskde1wg1wnv7rdayw 204w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/iih9icrtaqnybylngvmz 284w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/xiau0drxijpfbyopffea 364w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/snkcr1jxs5ri1trdni1m 444w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/qrzyhuoh50rris4vwren 524w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ze8EYwwxgBfwWL6Jq/t6tmbvta6bnruv4khrlo 604w\"><figcaption>Fig. 10. Map of Suitability of Sample Data</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>V. Theory of Change</strong></h1><h2>A. Impact</h2><p>&nbsp;Amid global challenges, nuclear war stands among the top three most pressing issues, according to 80,000 Hours.[13] Our work focuses on the resilience stage, con- tributing to preparing for and mitigating potential fallout scenarios. The \"Pragmatic Preservation\" approach aims to save 1% of the global population after a nuclear catastrophe,[14] recognising the challenges in preventing nuclear war entirely. Additionally, our project aims for immediate impact and recovery by preserving the minimum viable population in each bunker. This approach provides an essential opportunity for humanity to recover and rebuild after a catastrophic nuclear event for the first 100 years post- catastrophe, acknowledging the urgency of the situation and ethical considerations surrounding potential consequences.</p><h2>B. Tractability</h2><h3>1) Creating a Tractable Model</h3><p>Instead of conducting a region-by-region analysis, we found feasibility in developing a mathematical model grounded in the fundamental principles of geography and engineering.</p><ul><li>Ease of Implementation: The model is designed with simplicity and practicality in mind, making it straightforward to implement. Its structure allows for easy application by larger authorities equipped with extensive databases, streamlining the decision-making process for bunker site allocation.</li><li>Reasonable Assumptions: The model is built on well- founded assumptions, enhancing its reliability and reducing complexity. This ensures that decision-makers can trust the outputs of the model as it navigates through the intricate considerations involved in identifying suitable bunker locations.</li><li>Flexibility and Adaptability: The model\u2019s flexibility allows for the customisation of weights and factors, catering to the specific needs and nuances of different regions. This adaptability enhances its utility, making it a versatile tool that can be fine-tuned for diverse geographical settings.</li></ul><h3>2) Alignment with Long-Term Goals:</h3><p>&nbsp;This project aligns seamlessly with our career ambitions in engineering and physics. Both disciplines heavily involve mathematical modelling as a cornerstone for problem-solving. For instance, in engineering, modelling structural integrity or fluid dynamics relies on advanced mathematical frameworks to derive solutions. It provides an opportunity to develop crucial skills in data analysis, GIS software utilisation, and the critical assessment of database reliability. These skills are not only fundamental in our current project but also form the bedrock of numerous STEM-related fields. Given our keen interest in mathematics, we aspire to enhance our model by implementing more technical and potentially more accurate mathematical models.</p><p>Looking ahead, we aim to delve into research, whether in private ventures or academia. We envision reaching out to high-impact engineers and researchers for collaboration, thereby expanding the scope and impact of our project. The ultimate goal is to contribute valuable insights and tools to authorities involved in decision-making processes.</p><h2>C. Neglect</h2><p>Interaction with a high-impact engineer specialising in nuclear bunker design highlighted a significant gap in research focus. Extensive work has been done on construction and design, but strategic planning and logistics lack attention.</p><p>A comprehensive literature review unveiled a neglect in the field. Most papers briefly touch on parameters for bunker placement or perform rudimentary subjective comparisons between regions.</p><p>Existing research often explores survival on islands during nuclear winter but tends to focus on food-related aspects rather than specific bunker planning. Our project fills this gap by offering a comprehensive model for strategic and optimal bunker locations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>VI. LOGISTICS AND POLICY</h1><h2>A. Exclusion of Parameters</h2><p>The exclusion of certain parameters in our model is driven by specific considerations. For instance, variables like wind and precipitation were omitted due to their non-uniform variations in a global nuclear winter sce- nario, where comprehensive global predictions are cur- rently unavailable. Additionally, soil fertility and energy considerations were excluded, as our model is designed to prioritise the survival of humanity rather than the reestablishment of civilisation. Notably, the latter would necessitate a distinct model, where the optimal locations identified by our model could potentially serve as valuable input for further analysis.</p><h2><strong>B. Integrated Policy Framework for Bunker Logistics</strong></h2><ul><li><i>Secrecy as a Key Element:</i> The policy implications for bunker installation emphasise the critical necessity of maintaining secrecy regarding bunker locations. This measure is deemed essential to prevent unauthorised access by the public, given the finite capacity of bunkers, and potential interference from international governments, such as targeting bunker sites alongside metropolitan cities during nuclear war.</li><li><i>International Collaboration for Optimal Placement:</i> The proposed policy framework explores the possibility of international cooperation in determining bunker locations. This collaboration could involve placing bunkers in foreign less-developed territories, facilitated by more developed nations contributing resources for construction and maintenance. This approach optimises resource utilisation and contributes to the overall resilience of bunker systems, particularly when more developed nations lack secure locations for local bunker installations.</li><li><i>Military Involvement for Enhanced Security:</i> The policy also considers the potential involvement of the military in bunker-related initiatives. This involves exploring the proximity of bunkers to military bases, enhancing security measures and readiness, especially in the context of geopolitical uncertainties and potential wartime scenarios. The strategic placement of bunkers near military installations aims to ensure the safety and security of these critical infrastructure elements.</li><li><i>Sustainability and Long-Term Resilience:</i> While not directly related to our project, it is evident that for the success of the model, authorities must deliberate on the ideal size and quantity of bunkers, alongside their placement. Moreover, a minimum viable population should be maintained in proximity to the bunker at all times, potentially engaging in research or military operations, with the option for rotation over time, accounted for by the deliberate neglect of ease-of-access constraints in our model.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>VII. CONCLUSION</strong></h1><p>This research offers a methodical approach to bunker location modeling, employing a Multi-Criteria Evaluation model and examining factors like population density, seismicity, soil strength, and temperature. The subsequent steps of weighting, calculation, and decision-making con- tribute to a comprehensive evaluation, concluding with a logic check for practical relevance. The Theory of Change emphasises potential impact, feasibility, and addressing gaps in strategic bunker planning. The proposed logistics and policy considerations underscore the need for international collaboration, military involvement, and sustainable long-term resilience planning. Overall, this study aims to provide a scientific framework for addressing the complex challenges posed by the looming threat of nuclear catastrophe. Further improvements are necessary to increase the effectiveness of the model, including incorporation of more parameters and more thorough testing, however the intention of this is a preliminary, proof of concept model for the goals outlined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>References</strong></h1><p>[1] Sean Lawrence (2023).

This is focused on animal advocacy, but many of the tools are general to EA / activism more broadly.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I've struggled in the past with compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress. I've put a large amount of thought and energy into looking after myself while I do this work. I'm fortunate to have had the privilege to take care of myself in this way (which not everyone has), and I'm fortunate to have a manager who really cares about looking after ourselves too (which not everyone has).</p><h1>1. Understanding compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress</h1><p>Many animal advocates find \"compassion fatigue\" and/or \"secondary traumatic stress\" to be pretty serious challenges. I'd say that ~60% of my self-care focuses on addressing these challenges.</p><p>There are some short articles to help you understand these concepts here:</p><ul><li>\"Tips for Animal Advocates: Treating Secondary Trauma\" by Dawn D\u2019Amico (<a href=\"https://prime.peta.org/news/tips-for-animal-advocates-treating-secondary-trauma/\">online on PETA's website</a>)</li><li>\"Veterinarians And Compassion Fatigue, AKA Secondary Traumatic Stress\" (<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/veterinarians-compassion-fatigue-aka-secondary-traumatic-stress/\">online on Faunalytics</a>, which summarises a longer article)</li></ul><h1>2. Sustaining yourself</h1><p>There are some books on how to sustain yourself as an animal advocate (or social justice advocate). With these books, your mileage may vary, but they may have some useful tidbits.</p><ul><li><i>To Save a Starfish: A Compassion Fatigue Workbook for the Animal Welfare Warrior</i> - Jennifer A.

Resisting overcommitment</h1><p>\"The Comprehensive Guide to Resisting Overcommitment\" by &nbsp;Katrina Spenver (<a href=\"https://www.uproot.space/features/the-comprehensive-guide-to-resisting-overcommitment\">online here</a>) is a total banger. This is a really thoughtful and empowering article that has helped me stay within my limits. I particularly like this table, which I keep bookmarked:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/zvejmnzekjllmdmj3hm1\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/ecxcnopim1ivaja5tyoj 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/kwdys4hcvfotf2e14ucl 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/fxjxm83uyfzuntfudn25 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/gpq5y3s3pakxzmt0zh3e 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/b1z8msq5q3qcspypzihd 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/on9hyvzdskhozawmbjir 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/q76u54ku76naj1rrjzzy 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/u5nyswva5hrvhriw8kt3 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/k7hiwtavjdkjiezm11fd 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FFae7MGJjz2She6qL/j6mtxw7cmfnzcf1wftah 1178w\"></figure><p>That article will probably have the most value for you if you already have a decent grasp of what your \"theory of change\" is, i.e. the broad strokes of how you intend to have impact (or, if you're in the student or career-capital stage of your life, how you intend to figure that out!).</p><h1>4. Intersectional animal advocacy</h1><p>I think \"intersectional animal advocacy\" brings a really cool mindset, as long as one maintains a focus on impact. Much of the writing from this perspective brings a focus on self-care etc.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://sanctuarypublishers.com/home\">Sanctuary Publishers</a> has a number of books, and I highly recommend them all. And I dig the trans/queer content!</p><h1>5. Therapy, antidepressants, etc</h1><p><a href=\"https://www.mentalhealthnavigator.co.uk/ea-mental-health-programme\">EA Mental Health Program at MentNav: </a>In late 2022 / early 2023, I had regular, remote therapy sessions with Krist\u00fdna \u0160\u0165astn\u00e1 (whose details are listed on that page). This really helped with both the animal suffering side + some of the AI-related anxiety (+ also the invasion of Ukraine which was around that time). I've had therapists before, but it was really useful being able to talk to a therapist who was already familiar with the key concepts of the EA movement. Would strongly recommend.&nbsp;</p><p>If your mental health gives you trouble, I'd also strongly recommend giving antidepressants / anti-anxiety meds a go. This isn't always a complete solution, but (especially when combined with therapy and a lifestyle where your other needs are met) it can really help take the edge off and put you in the best position to thrive. I spoke to my GP and he put me on Zoloft, which has been a big help. We also recently added a small dose of mirtazapine, which is usually prescribed for people with sleep issues. Since then, I've been sleeping <i>so</i> well, and that has had a positive impact on my work.</p><p>Lastly, I've had regular blood tests. This let my doctor identify random problems I may not have otherwise caught, e.g. low vitamin D. Easy fix and really helpful.</p><h1>6. Finding community</h1><p>I've also found a lot of value in meditation + being part of a spiritual community. There are lots of spiritual communities online, and they've all been very welcoming. I've enjoyed being parts of both Christian and Buddhist communities that emphasise social engagement and activism.</p><p>I'm quite inspired by the work that Thich Nhat Hanh, Sister Chan Khong, and their community did during the Vietnam War; the work by Dietrich Bonhoeffer and his community when the Nazis were in power; the work by Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr, and their community during the American civil rights movement; and the work by V\u00e1clav Havel and his community during the Communist and post-Communist era in Czechoslovakia. Those folk are 100% honest badasses - they really did walk the walk and put their spiritual and/or social beliefs into action, even despite the occasional personal shortcoming. I often read their autobiographies/memoirs when I'm feeling in need of inspiration!</p><p>Lastly, I've recently started playing soccer, and this has been a huge improvement - this is because soccer has brought me regular exercise, a totally unimportant but enjoyable task to engage with, and a great bunch of friends.</p><h1>7. Recommended EA Forum articles</h1><p>As I've been working in an EA-aligned org for a few years now, it has occurred to me that my plan for impact is: do solid work, and keep doing it for another ~50 years (or however long you expect your productive lifespan to be).</p><p>To that end, I've been finding myself returning to these two EA Forum articles quite often:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vmyP88FKkvtbRedaj/trade-heroism-for-grit\">Trade Heroism For Grit</a><ul><li>\"Think through the big decisions carefully, but get things done.

On one side, the bridge begins in a realm of pure forms, where abstract geometry, forcefields, neon glass, and fractals dominate the landscape, creating an ethereal and surreal atmosphere. This side is characterized by its vibrant colors, glowing elements, and a sense of otherworldly beauty. The bridge itself is an architectural marvel, with no support pillars, appearing to float effortlessly. As it spans across, it transitions into the Roman Empire, where the environment shifts dramatically to a more down-to-earth setting. Here, the landscape is adorned with marble structures, classical Roman architecture, and lacks any form of abstract geometry. The bridge seamlessly blends these two contrasting worlds, symbolizing a connection between the mystical and the tangible. The overall scene is depicted with the lush, dramatic lighting and emotional depth characteristic of Romantic era oil paintings, capturing the viewer's imagination and inviting them to ponder the bridge's symbolic passage between the abstract and the concrete. The painting's wide format enhances the grandeur of the scene, emphasizing the vast distance the bridge covers and the profound impact of its existence.\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GgdtHNoeT9EcCXBPY/qmucwrqzoqlyj6stp4qx 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GgdtHNoeT9EcCXBPY/f7qxxk9sb25blu9xyjjs 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GgdtHNoeT9EcCXBPY/jlmedrrfmqozzqm7zecs 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GgdtHNoeT9EcCXBPY/izcrxfcbbn3dbp3r0lvu 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have been a practising Stoic for over 10 years. I adopted Stoicism before I encountered <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/\"><u>the sequences</u></a> and LessWrong-style rationalism. To me, Stoicism and rationalism serve complementary purposes, tackling different aspects of life.</p><p>Rationalism, to me, is related to getting a better understanding of the world, and how the mind functions. It\u2019s generally descriptive, attempting to make models that accurately describe aspects of existence.</p><p>Stoicism, to me, is all about the nitty-gritty aspects of self-improvement.&nbsp;<br>It\u2019s more about instruction than explanation, featuring perspectives and explanations that are conducive to embodying a set of character traits commonly referred to as \u201cvirtues\u201d.</p><p>This post will start by analysing utilitarianism, the most common ethical approach among rationalists, followed by a pragmatic integration of utilitarianism, Stoicism, and rationality.</p><p>But first, a bit of background.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Stoicism vs Utilitarianism</h2><p>Stoicism is a type of Virtue Ethics, focused on the workings of your cognition \u2014 an action is \u201cgood\u201d if it develops a set of desirable character traits (virtues). A bad action, on the contrary, is an action that builds bad habits (vices). In this view, committing genocide is bad because you don\u2019t want to train yourself to be a person who commits genocide.</p><p>Consequentialism is all about the consequences of your actions \u2014 an action is \u201cgood\u201d if its positive consequences outweigh its negative consequences. An action is bad if the downsides outweigh the upsides. In this view, committing genocide is bad because you cause a lot of suffering to a lot of people, robbing their agency by killing them, and causing a bunch of negative secondary effects.</p><p>At first glance, these are two very different ways of looking at ethics. Stoicism is sometimes presented as incompatible with utilitarianism. Let\u2019s illustrate this gap through a story I heard from a friend. My friend attended an ethics course at university, and told me about his professor\u2019s view of virtue ethics (paraphrased):</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cUtilitarianism is about looking at the result of actions and judging the outcome. Virtue ethics is about acting like a \u2018good person\u2019, whatever that means!\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Arguing for the superiority of one view over the other misses the point. Why argue about \u201cwho is right\u201d, when you can aim for an integration, getting the upsides from both views? Let\u2019s move on to a pragmatic integration!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Implicit Virtue of Utilitarianism</h2><p>You are an expert utilitarian. You have trained your predictive capacities, turning yourself into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecaster\"><u>superforecaster</u></a>, able to accurately model the outcomes of most decisions you make. You have decided on how you want to aggregate values, how you want to weigh negative vs positive outcomes, researched population ethics and done due diligence on all the relevant desiderata.</p><p>Your ability to weigh courses of action is unsurpassed amongst your kin.</p><p>QED? Not really.</p><p>Knowing the right course of action is meaningless if you don\u2019t act on your knowledge. Without action, utilitarianism is nothing but a reduction of real-world issues into ivory-tower logic puzzles.</p><p>Utilitarianism carries an implicit virtue \u2014 acting to make the most good happen. The implicit virtue of utilitarianism is out of scope for consequentialist ethical reasoning. Utilitarianism can tell you that it is a good idea to become such a person (high expected value), but it doesn\u2019t give you a roadmap for how to get there.</p><p>Knowing what to do without being able to get to it is all too common. I think of this as the intention-action gap. Let\u2019s see what we need to add to the mix if we want to get something going.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Some Complimentary Virtues</h2><p>We start with the implicit virtue of utilitarianism \u2014 being a person who acts to make the most good happen. This virtue is about having a direction/target, a sense of how we want things to be. For reasons that will be obvious soon, let\u2019s call this virtue <strong>Justice</strong>.</p><p>Besides embodying Justice, we need to know a lot of things about the world and ourselves. If we don\u2019t, we risk fucking up our expected value calculations. We need knowledge of the world if we want to act in it. We need knowledge of ourselves to work on motivation, biased thinking, and hang-ups that block our way. This is the domain of LessWrong-style rationality practice. Let\u2019s call this virtue <strong>Wisdom</strong>.</p><p>Besides Wisdom, we need a bit of oomph. We need to be able to commit and push ahead, acting according to our ethics even if it\u2019s uncomfortable, dangerous or <a href=\"https://honestliving.substack.com/p/dealing-with-awkwardness\"><u>awkward</u></a>. We need to cultivate a \u201cgo get them\u201d-attitude, a primal energy that helps us get shit going, make a move, and enjoy action. Let\u2019s call this virtue <strong>Courage.</strong></p><p>Besides Courage, we need to be able to resist temptations. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_drive\"><u>Eradicating malaria</u></a> is tempting, but so is netflix and chocolate. We can force ourselves to go against our immediate preferences by shaming and \u201c<a href=\"https://honestliving.substack.com/p/subtle-self-coercion\"><u>shoulding</u></a>\u201d ourselves into the right course of action. This is likely to backfire, causing friction and wasting processing cycles on <a href=\"https://honestliving.substack.com/p/strategy-of-inner-conflict\"><u>inner conflict</u></a>. A better approach is to <a href=\"https://honestliving.substack.com/p/the-discipline-of-assent\"><u>reprogram our desire/aversion</u></a> responses so that we desire good things, and feel aversion towards things that distract us. The Greeks had a nice word for this virtue, calling it <strong>Sophrosyne</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Stumbling Upon Stoicism</h2><p>The virtues presented in the last section are the traditional Stoic virtues. You can reshape your cognition to embody these virtues through Stoic practice. Stoicism has inspired <a href=\"https://dailystoic.com/stoicism-pop-culture/#:~:text=The%20names%20of%20the%20three,famous%20playwright%20and%20political%20adviser.\"><u>great people throughout history</u></a> to achieve their goals. One of the main Stoic Philosophers had a side-gig as Roman Emperor.</p><p>There is much material written on Stoicism, both primary materials and derivative takes. There are mental models, practices and techniques, mindsets and frameworks. Reading Epiktetos\u2019 <a href=\"https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\"><u>Enchiridion</u></a> changed my life. He is a grumpy/prude old guy, but I can heartily recommend him anyway.</p><p>Stoicism is all about cultivating virtue, integrating thoughts, emotions, value judgements and actions into a <a href=\"https://honestliving.substack.com/p/on-virtue\"><u>better-functioning cognitive machinery</u></a>. The virtues all tie into each other, forming a coherent system focused on navigating life with skill and grace.</p><p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Philosophy\"><u>inspired by/derived from</u></a> Stoicism. It has been the dominant therapeutic modality for a long time at this point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Paradoxical Perspective Shifts</h2><p>Stoic practice involves a reframing of experience that shifts your \u201cethical focus\u201d. When engaging in Stoic practice, you stop putting moral weight on the consequences of your actions. Instead, you shift the moral weight to being a person who acts virtuously.</p><p>This is a paradoxical stance, captured perfectly in a classic Stoic maxim:</p><p><i>\u201c1. Virtue is the sole good\u201d - Paradoxa Stoicorum by Cicero</i></p><p>This outlook is paradoxical because <strong>Justice</strong> usually involves things that are external to your cognition. If you base <strong>Justice</strong> on utilitarianism, you put moral weight on acting according to utilitarian expected value calculations.</p><p>Stated simply, the paradox is:</p><ul><li>Focus not on the world, but only on becoming a good person.</li><li>Part of being a good person is wanting to do good in the world.</li></ul><p>Personally, I resolve this paradox by treating \u201cVirtue is the sole good\u201d as an invitation to shift my focus. My cognition, my actions and their consequences form a system. It\u2019s natural to focus on the action/consequence part of this system. Stoicism invites us to shift our attention \u201cupstream\u201d, focusing on the cognition/action part of this system.</p><p>This ethical perspective shift highlights the role of our conditioning in the outcomes of our actions. Shifting ethical considerations to target the state of your own cognition is a key stoic practice.</p><p>This perspective shift doesn\u2019t mean that you grow apart from the world, far from it! Since the early days, Stoics have been engaged with society, working to make the world a better place. Stoicism emphasizes action aligned with Justice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In this post, I\u2019ve shown how Utilitarianism, with its focus on <strong>what</strong> to do, needs a complementary answer to <strong>how</strong> we go about the actual \u201cdoing\u201d. I\u2019ve shown how Stoicism is one such answer, deriving the Stoic virtues out of utilitarianism\u2019s implicit commitment to action.</p><p>Here are some resources for getting into Stoicism:</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\"><u>Enchiridion by Epiktetus</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://dailystoic.com/\"><u>The daily stoic</u></a></li><li>This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PTCMptc-y0\"><u>talk</u></a> on the stoa (no relation)</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Jonathan Moreg\u00e5rd"}}, {"_id": "wN63yuyCnurwfAfCy", "title": "How to set up a career advising system for your local EA group", "postedAt": "2024-02-13T18:54:07.825Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Or at least, how we did it at EA Finland.

We understand the local Finnish (or Nordic) situation, sometimes to a great detail (eg. when the advisor has attended the same university than the advisee).</li><li>Local connections. Could be to the local EA community (for advisees new to EA) or to local professionals.</li><li>Lower threshold to apply. Some of our members don\u2019t feel confident to apply for 80k\u2019s advising, wondering if they are effective or outstanding enough. In this case we could use the call also to encourage them to contact 80k as well.</li><li>Familiarity. In some cases, especially for urgent decisions that our community members have to make, they might get more out of scheduling a call with a person who is broadly aware of their situation than someone in EA they don't know.</li></ul><p>Career advising can also be a way for local new people to get interested in EA, in addition to intro programs and other newcomer-friendly activities.</p><p>Ultimately, we believe that most people don\u2019t spend enough time planning their career, so most efforts that go to supporting altruistically motivated people to reflect more on their career plans are probably a good use of volunteer time.</p><h2>Setting up the career advising system</h2><h3>Vision</h3><p>We wanted EA Finland\u2019s career advising to be a service where altruistically motivated people get compassionate help in thinking about their career choices in a structural way with the help of volunteers who are equipped to help them by their knowledge of EA tools and frameworks.</p><p>This means our services are open to everyone who is interested in doing good, regardless of their agreement of EA principles - but we are open about coming from an EA background ourselves and being able to help better if the advisees are more in agreement with us. For example, if someone is mostly motivated to help Finnish children be healthier, we can try to help come up with personal career steps to make this happen, but we won\u2019t have that much information on eg. the effectiveness of different organizations working on that.</p><p>Some people in our advising team have felt we should in some cases try to \u201ctalk people over\u201d to a more EA-like prioritizing, because from an utilitarian point of view it is valuable to have more people spend their time on the most effective causes. I however think being a trusted service that people safely can come to with their own values and ways of thinking is too valuable to be traded against the quite limited possibility of persuading someone to a huge change in their values. We do direct people to EA materials but they can decide themselves what they think about them.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p>I started setting up our career advising system when EA Finland got its first funding, starting in May 2022. This allowed me to work 1 day / week for the organization, with a focus on career advising. Most of the necessary set-up to actually start advertising our career advising services was ready after a couple of months (corresponding to 2\u20133 weeks of full-time work). Then I spent the rest of the funded months iteratively developing the service, on other career-advising related things, and on other community building things.</p><p>It helped to have someone who can actually dedicate time to think about how to run the service \u2013 I think we would be worse off if the whole set-up had been done on pure volunteer work. At the same time, we knew that we might not get continued funding, and that I personally might not be able to continue doing paid community building work.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe29jcrxuix\"><sup><a href=\"#fne29jcrxuix\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>This is why one important design principle was to make up a system that can be run on volunteer-basis only and that can easily be handed over for others to manage. I didn\u2019t want a set-up that works by having me doing all the advising calls, or otherwise would depend on me personally to a large extent.&nbsp;</p><p>Another reason to emphasize the role of volunteers was that we didn\u2019t want paid employees to take over volunteer roles but to make volunteering easier, thus amplifying our organization\u2019s impact. Of course this was only possible since I knew we had many motivated volunteers interested in giving career advice.</p><h3>Advisors</h3><p>The career advising training sessions were open to all interested EA Finland volunteers. In addition to the people I organized the training for, there were some individuals who had advising experience from other sources, and with whom I only talked through the principles of our advising system, but didn\u2019t make them practice advising in the same way as the less experienced advisors. As a result, EA Finland currently has 13 people available for giving advising sessions.</p><p>There are some benefits in having many advisors:</p><ul><li>People from different professional and backgrounds</li><li>People with interest and expertise in different cause areas</li><li>People with different advising styles</li><li>More flexibility; more likely somebody is always available</li><li>Presence in some different geographic locations can be a plus for in-person advising</li><li>Sustainable and resilient to having some people drop out or become low availability for a while</li></ul><p>There are also some downsides on having many vs. few advisors:</p><ul><li>Some advisors don\u2019t get to do that much advising and might grow uncertain in their ability to give advice</li><li>With less practice, it takes longer to learn from your successes and mistakes</li><li>Requires a person who is responsible for coordination (picking an advisor to each person who has applied for advising) since the advisors won\u2019t be able to negotiate that on the spot every time a advising request comes in</li></ul><p>We are countering the learning aspect by asking people to share a couple of sentences of how their advising session went after each session in a group chat where all advisors are present.</p><h3>Trainings</h3><p>Most of our volunteers went through a 1-day training organized on a weekend day. The training has a theoretical and a practical part.</p><p>The theoretical part includes stuff like:</p><ul><li>The purpose and philosophy of the career advising service at EA Finland</li><li>Personal reflection on good moments of advice you have yourself gotten (if possible, related to career stuff) and why it was important to hear that at that time</li><li>The concrete outline of a 1-1 session</li><li>How the whole EA Finland career advising workflow works</li><li>What are some things to do when giving advice (such as active listening)</li><li>What not to do when giving advice (such as downplaying the advisees concerns)</li></ul><p>The practical part, which I think is the most important part, is trying to give advice to a \u201cpractice advisee\u201d on the spot. This works in the following way:</p><ul><li>Find a person (or if possible, several, so that you can repeat the exercise) who is up to taking the role of a model/practice person receiving advice on their career. A perfect person for this is someone who is vaguely aware of some EA principles, but not very involved and does not know all the jargon and has not spent tens of hours reflecting on their career already, since that\u2019s also what your typical advisee is going to look like. They should also be willing to talk about their real career situation in this kind of a weird setting. We have found that friends of organizers who state they \u201cdon\u2019t want to bother your advisors by applying to the actual advising because they aren\u2019t really EA\u201d make great volunteers for this exercise.<ul><li>If you can\u2019t find anyone (or they get sick on the same day), you could also role-play as an advisee, but it\u2019s much better if you can find a real target person.</li><li>The practice advisee should not expect to get that much out of the advising session, since it\u2019s going to be a bit different from usual \u2013 but all our practice advisees have said participating was actually useful for them as well</li></ul></li><li>Have one of the advisors in training try to give advice to the practice advisee for around 5\u201310 minutes while others observe the interaction</li><li>Pause and analyze how the advising session is going<ul><li>Let other advisors in training try to give feedback first</li><li>You can also ask the practice advisee directly how they felt about a certain piece of interaction \u2013 sometimes all the future advisors think something was a great comment or exercise, but the practice advisee didn\u2019t actually understand or like it</li></ul></li><li>Switch advisors so that everyone gets to practice<ul><li>It\u2019s better to do multiple short rounds if only a few people are present</li><li>Around 1,5 hours is a good maximal total time for this exercise, limiting the maximal amount of advisors in training to ~6</li></ul></li><li>After letting the practice advisee go home, recap the whole advising \u201csession\u201d with the future advisors</li></ul><p>I recommend having 2 different practice advisees if you can just find volunteers for this exercise. It shows how different things work for different people, and that no two advising sessions are the same.</p><h3>Maintenance</h3><p>Currently, our career advising system is maintained completely by volunteers \u2013 that is, we can take in advising requests and give advising sessions completely on a volunteer basis when needed. However, it has been valuable that Vesa Hautala has been able to spent paid work hours for occasionally helping with maintenance (in addition to other career activity related responsibilities, mostly related to development) and that both he and Karla Still has been able to do advising calls on work time when needed.</p><p>We have one volunteer whose only responsibility is to follow the sign-up form and redirect the advisees to advisors based on their application form answers. The advisors are responsible for making sure they are actually available or if they aren\u2019t they need to decline the request to give advice. If they accept, they contact the advisee themselves, decide on a time, have the session and log the session in our logging sheet. Afterwards, they share something about their experience in the advisor group chat, so that we can learn from the experiences of others.</p><h3>Advertising</h3><p>People usually find us</p><ul><li>by already being an active member of EA Finland. (These calls are sometimes about making a specific career related decision, sometimes about general long-term career planning.)</li><li>by being interested in EA and noticing it mentioned on our website/newsletter/social media or getting a direct recommendation of an active member. (Here the topic is often \u201cI would like to come up with some ways of having an impactful career\u201d.)</li><li>by noticing the advising our website or getting it mentioned in an event where EA Finland advertises (These calls are often about \u201cI work/want to specialize in X and care about causes Y and Z, how could I have a job that does more good than harm\u201d.)</li><li>by just trying to find career advising \u2013 luckily for us, we come up on the first results page when someone searches for \u201curaneuvonta\u201d (Finnish for \u201ccareer advising\u201d) on Google</li></ul><p>The last two groups are quite likely (my estimate is 30%) to never answer the scheduling email, even if they have taken the time to fill in the application form, which is not trivial although not super heavy either. We have a policy of contacting them 2 times, after which we drop it. On the other hand, we don\u2019t have almost any last minute cancellations, so when we actually manage to schedule a call, our advisees tend to show up.</p><p>We currently have more capacity than advisees, so it seems clear that advertising (and maybe also interest) is a bottleneck. Things we have done to get more attention to our services:</p><ul><li>try out 15 minute speed career advising calls where you don\u2019t have to fill in the form, just book a time</li><li>keep mentioning the career advising service in our newsletter and on our Telegram channel</li><li>attending events and marketing our services to secondary school study advisors (teachers responsible for helping youngsters to figure out their way towards a career or their next place of study)</li></ul><p>We\u2019ve been a bit wary of trying a very broad outreach to people who haven\u2019t heard of EA before, because if advisees have a very different understanding from \u201cdoing good\u201d than us, we are also less likely to be able to help them.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Aside from various advertising strategies, we sometimes try to develop the advisors\u2019 skills in advising. Part of this is also just upkeep to ensure advisors stay motivated and learn from each others\u2019 experiences.</p><p>Doing advising helps us identify spots where we\u2019d need more knowledge to help our advisees better. For example, not many of our advisors know a lot about effective ways to fight climate change, but it is a common area of interest for our advisees. We have tried to counter this by sharing information and just generally being open about our weak spots to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>We are also experimenting with additional training for advisors, but it is often hard to get many advisors to attend at the same time. In this sense asynchronous communication seems to work better for us.</p><h2>When is it better to not have your own career advising system?</h2><ul><li>if you don\u2019t have members who are able to give compassionate and educated impact-oriented advice - this could be both hard for people who are very prone to being overconfident or underconfident</li><li>if your members cannot reliably reply to career advising requests in a reasonable time</li></ul><p>But other than that, I think a career advising system can be valuable for many groups. I believe students are perfectly able to provide career advice to others, especially other students, since even without in-depth knowledge of different career situations you can help others by giving them space to reflect and asking clarifying questions.</p><h3>What I find difficult in EA career advising</h3><p>The most scary part in giving advice is the fear of giving unhelpful or straight up wrong advice, especially to people who are quite young or otherwise uncertain about their situation but put a lot of value on EA type of thinking. I\u2019m afraid they put too much weight into \u201cEA career advice\u201d, while it\u2019s actually just me, a normal person trying to give advice to them. I try to mitigate this by being very open about my own uncertainties, and sometimes I explicitly say that there are no secret EA truths, and even if the career advising comes under the EA Finland \u201cbrand\u201d it still represents my personal knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Another difficulty falls almost in the opposite direction: it\u2019s the complexity of keeping up with the difference between my personal opinions, some opinions popular in EA materials and the advisees opinions in the context of an advisee who is relatively new to EA. The typical example here is a recent intro program graduate who has heard that AI safety is an important topic and would like to explore it further. I want to be open about the fact that I personally have significant uncertainty regarding AI safety, but I also want to encourage people to read more about it and form their own opinions. However, just stating this can sometimes confuse advisees, and I worry about both discouraging them from getting more interested in AI safety and seeming dishonest with my own views on the topic.&nbsp;</p><h2>Feedback we\u2019ve gotten and what makes us stand out in comparison of non-EA career advising services</h2><p>Estimating how people actually like our career advising is sometimes difficult, because we don\u2019t get almost any negative feedback, even if probably not all advisees largely benefit from the advising session. We both collect informal feedback by just asking advisees how they felt after a session and also ask for structured feedback by sending them an anonymous feedback form and lately also another follow-up form after 6 months.</p><p>I guess most people get a lot of benefits from just taking 45 minutes or 1 hour to think about their careers and discuss it with somebody, almost regardless of the advising quality level (unless the advisor says something upsetting or discouraging).</p><p>Some people we have advised seemed really excited towards the end of the session and said things like \u201cthis is the best career advice I\u2019ve ever gotten\u201d and \u201cthis was way more helpful than the advice I received at [university / public career services / etc]\u201d. Culturally, these kinds of reactions are not expected in Finland, so I think these feelings are genuine.</p><p>This is obviously flattering but also kind of alarming with regards to those other non-EA career advising services. I am not a trained psychologist or educator of any kind, much less with expertise in career guidance, so by default I would expect people who are motivated to try out many different services to get the best service from someone with the right education and who gives career advice as their full-time job.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, anecdotally, it seems many people also don\u2019t benefit from public/university career advising services at all. In some ways, our job is easier and more tailored towards our audience. We don\u2019t have to offer advice to people in all kinds of situations (even if we really rarely turn down requests in practice), and in each session, we already know that both the advisor and advisee share the passion for doing good. This gives us a common point of focus even if we\u2019d have very different views on the best ways of doing good.</p><h2>How I run a career advising sessions in practice</h2><p>Or \u201cwhat I think might be the thing making us different from other career advising options\u201d. This is more a description of the mindset I find useful for giving career advice than a list of concrete tips. For a very good introduction of concrete tips and timing, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qyG6YrxTAnRGkBhRT/guide-for-conducting-career-consultation\"><u>this post</u></a>. The mindset as described in the post is similar to what I use.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, I always trust the person seeking advice to be the expert of their own situation. I often start the sessions by outright stating something like: \u201cI don\u2019t know that much about your field of study/work, could you explain typical options for a person in your situation to me\u201d:</p><ul><li>I find this helps the advisee also to shift their thinking to a wider perspective</li><li>If the answer seems too narrow or surprising to me, I\u2019ll follow with asking further questions, such as \u201cis working in the academia really the only option for people with this interest\u201d</li><li>I learned to do this after once spending a lot of time trying to figure out impactful job options for a person with disability I didn\u2019t know much about, only to later realize I should have started with asking \u201cwhat kind of jobs are people with this disability usually able to do\u201d, only to have them answer \u201cmost people with my disability are not able to work at all, however I expect to get slightly better in several years\u201d. This information of course helped me to narrow down the feasible short-term options for the advisee significantly, since the options available right then were quite limited.</li></ul><p>I try to identify points of uncertainty and hopefully figure out ways to get more information to reduce uncertainty:</p><ul><li>This is nothing novel and to my understanding 80 000 hours advising is mostly based on this, but it is surprisingly rare how many other career advising services spend time doing this</li><li>Sometimes the uncertainty is something we can just figure out on the spot. A concrete example was \u201cI\u2019d maybe be interested in research but I\u2019m not sure if being a PhD student pays enough to cover my living expenses\u201d. We did a small napkin calculation of their living expenses, googled typical salaries for PhD students and figured out the money was enough. The advisee seemed slightly embarrassed for not having done this earlier, but I reassured them that people often just don\u2019t think about verifying their assumptions, so it was very good we had done that now.</li><li>Sometimes the advisee comes with a question that seems really big for them, such as \u201cshould I take X as my major and Y as my minor subject or vice versa\u201d, and when I try to ask them what influence the decision actually has, they figure out it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much for their later plans.</li><li>As a counterexample to trying to reduce uncertainty, I recently got good feedback for explaining to an advisee that my analysis of their situation is that there is real uncertainty involved and that I also cannot see any obviously right or wrong decisions they could be making in their current situation. I think this reduced the pressure of \u201cfiguring out the right choice\u201d and just trying out reasonable options to see what works, which was in some way comforting.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I generally try to be encouraging and reassuring:</p><ul><li>Most people come to career advising because of some uncertainty, otherwise they\u2019d just do whatever they want to do anyway.</li><li>I am by nature not a very optimistic or positive person, but most people I speak with underestimate their potential, especially in the long term. So most of the time I can just try to be realistic about it with them.</li><li>Most people we advise who are newer to EA have not really considered that they could actually try to impact the issues they care about. Often this is because they don\u2019t see many options for landing in a job that has real effects right away, so they just think it would be impossible for them to do so in the future either. In these cases I try to talk about long-term career planning or sometimes outside-of-work impact options (if both me and the advisee cannot figure out how to connect their current field to any of their preferred cause areas and bigger career changes don\u2019t seem possible in the foreseeable future).</li><li>Some people who are very involved with EA are worried about their impact compared to others and often look for ways to optimize their impact in every decision they are making, including minor ones. I think for some people this kind of early optimization can become harmful if it comes at the cost of exploring low-cost opportunities that the advisee finds interesting. In these cases I often encourage the advisee to just spend some time doing fun things (such as taking a minor subject just because it seems interesting), because that also gives them information on what kind of work they\u2019d enjoy.</li></ul><p>In a nutshell, I just try to listen to the advisee, make sense of what they are telling me and try to find out what they are actually seeking advice for. Often this is enough to figure out some reasonable next steps.</p><h2>Getting started</h2><p>I hope some of you found this post informative or inspiring, especially if you have been considering setting up a career advising service for your local group (or just trying to give out career advice to group members in a less structured setting).&nbsp;</p><p>To get started with that, I would probably just start by</p><ul><li>either trying to figure out your group\u2019s needs and how to fulfill them by your career advising service</li><li>or just getting together with a couple of people who want to learn to give career advice and start practicing (and figure your set-up later)</li></ul><p>If you have any questions or would just like to talk things through, you can always contact me by a EA forum message or by e-mail (<a href=\"mailto:ada-maaria.hyvarinen@altruismi.fi\"><u>ada-maaria.hyvarinen@altruismi.fi</u></a>). I will try to help you.</p><p>Career advising can be really rewarding. It is one of my favorite volunteering formats: I get to focus completely on a person trying to solve important problems for them, and sometimes really help them with that.

They organised a protest, with the messaging centred on OpenAI changing their documents to \"work with the Pentagon\", while OpenAI only collaborates with DARPA on open-source cybersecurity tools and is in talks with the Pentagon about veteran suicide prevention. Many participants of the protest weren\u2019t aware of this; the protest announcement and the press release did not mention this. People were misled into thinking OpenAI is working on military applications of AI. OpenAI still <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies\">prohibits</a> the use of their services to \"harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property\".

They changed only the usage policy: a document that describes how their publicly available service can be used. The previous version of the policy would not have in any way prevented OpenAI from, say, working on developing weapons for the Pentagon.</p><p>The nature of the announced work was also, in my opinion, beneficial: they announced a collaboration with DARPA on open-source cybersecurity, and said they\u2019re in talks with the Pentagon about helping prevent suicides among veterans.</p><p>This differs from what people understood from both the initial announcement to protest OpenAI changing its charter to work with the Pentagon and the subsequently changed version that corrected (and acknowledged) the \"charter\" mistake:</p><blockquote><p>Join us and tell OpenAI \"Stop working with the Pentagon!\"</p><p>On January 10th, without any announcement, OpenAI deleted the language in its usage policy* that had stated that OpenAI doesn\u2019t allow its models to be used for \u201cactivities that have a high chance of causing harm\u201d such as \u201cmilitary and warfare\u201d. Then, on January 17th, TIME reported that OpenAI would be taking the Pentagon as a client. On 2/12, we will demand that OpenAI end its relationship with the Pentagon and not take any military clients. If their ethical and safety boundaries can be revised out of convenience, they cannot be trusted.</p><p>AI is rapidly becoming more powerful, far faster than virtually any AI scientist has predicted. Billions are being poured into AI capabilities, and the results are staggering. New models are outperforming humans in many domains. As capabilities increase, so do the risks. Scientists are even warning that AI might end up destroying humanity.</p><p>According to their charter, \u201cOpenAI\u2019s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u2014by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at all economically valuable work\u2014benefits all of humanity.\u201d But many humans value their work and find meaning in it, and hence do not want their jobs to be done by an AGI instead. What protest co-organizer [name] of [org] calls \u201cthe Psychological Threat\u201d applies even if AGI doesn't kill us.</p><p>*an earlier version of this description incorrectly referred to the usage policy as a \u201ccharter\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The usage policies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/16/us_military_openai/\"><u>still</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies\"><u>prohibit&nbsp;</u></a>the use of their services to \"harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.\"It is technically true that OpenAI wants to have the Pentagon as a client: they collaborate with DARPA on open-source cybersecurity and are talking to the Pentagon about veteran suicide prevention. But I think, even with \"charter\" changed to \"the usage policy\", the resulting phrasing is deceptive: a reader gets an impression that diverges from reality in ways that make the reader disagree with OpenAI\u2019s actions and more likely to come to the protest. People understand it to mean that previously OpenAI couldn\u2019t work with the Pentagon because of the policy, but now can. Which is, as far as I\u2019m aware, false. Previously, it wasn\u2019t clear whether the Pentagon could sign up on the OpenAI website, just like everyone else, and use the publicly available service; but nothing would\u2019ve prevented OpenAI from making an agreement with the Pentagon outside their public terms of service. (Also, mostly the usage policies were changed to increase readability.)</p><p>A housemate realised all that after a short conversation and said they stopped wanting to attend the protest after it, as the messaging was misleading and they didn\u2019t want to contribute to spreading it. (I told them it\u2019s fine to go and protest<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"rekz3w6nhl\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrekz3w6nhl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrekz3w6nhl\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;reckless OpenAI actions without necessarily supporting the central messaging of the protest organisers.) 3 or 4 pro-Palestine activists attended the protest because they saw the announcement and decided to speak out against OpenAI working with the Pentagon on military uses of AI, which might be helping Israel. They, possibly, wouldn't have come to the protest if they knew OpenAI wasn't actually helping the Pentagon with weapons.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not normal. If you\u2019re organising a protest (or doing any public comms), you want people to be more likely to attend the protest (or support your message) if they become more aware of the details of the situation (such as OpenAI only working with DARPA on open-source cybersecurity tools and being in talks with the Pentagon about veteran suicide prevention, and still having \"no use for weapons or causing harm to humans\" in their public policies), not less likely.</p><blockquote><p>If their ethical and safety boundaries can be revised out of convenience, they cannot be trusted.</p></blockquote><p><strong>These were not OpenAI\u2019s ethical and safety boundaries; these were a part of the policy for their publicly available service. Whether or not OpenAI can, e.g., develop weapons is not affected by this change.</strong></p><p><strong>I think when the organisers become more aware of the details like that, they should change the protest's message (or halt or postpone the protest: generally, it's important to make sure people don't decide to come for the wrong reasons, though in this case simply fixing the messaging to not be misleading would've been fine)</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"yt1vhim1pig\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyt1vhim1pig\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyt1vhim1pig\">[4]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, the organisers edited the press release at the last moment before sending it out, replacing \u201ccharter\u201d, and went on with the protest and IMO deceptive messaging.</p><p>Even the best-intending people are not perfect, often have some inertia, and aren't able to make sure the messaging they put out isn't misleading and fully propagate updates.</p><p>Not being able to look at previously made plans and revise them in light of new information seems bad.

[They] quoted the charter early on when drafting it, and then, in a kind of word mistake that is unfortunately common for [them], started using the word \u201ccharter\u201d for both the actual charter and the usage policy document. It was unfortunately a semantic mistake, so proofreaders didn\u2019t catch it. [They] also did this verbally in several places. [They] even kind of convinced [themself] from hearing [their] own mistaken language that OpenAI had violated a much more serious boundary\u2013 their actual guiding document\u2013 than they had. [They] was horrified when [they] discovered the mistake because it conveyed a significantly different meaning than the true story, and could have slandered OpenAI. [They] spent hours trying to track down every place [they] had said it and people who may have repeated it so it could be corrected. [They] told the protesters right away about [their] mistake and explained changing the usage policy is a lot less bad than changing the charter, but the protest was still on, as it had been before the military story arose as the \u201csmall ask\u201d focus to the \u201cbig ask\u201d of pausing AI.</p></blockquote><h3>My reply</h3><p>I felt confused about first their private messages and then their comments until I realised they simply didn't understand the problem I'm talking about in this post. I\u2019m concerned&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> about the \u201ccharter\u201d, which was indeed an honest and corrected mistake, but about the final messaging. The message remained \"OpenAI changed some important documents to enable them to work with the Pentagon\", which creates an impression different from reality: people think OpenAI did something to be able to work on military applications of AI. The day after the protest, I talked to three participants who were surprised to hear OpenAI is only working on open-source cybersecurity tools and is in talks about veteran suicide prevention, and the change of the usage policies didn't impact OpenAI's ability to separately work with the military. They agreed the messaging of the protest was misleading. (All three would've been happy to come to a more general protest about OpenAI's recklessness in racing to develop AGI.) Some people told me that actually, initially, a more general protest against OpenAI was planned, and a more specific message emerged after the news of the change of policies. I would have no problem with the protest whatsoever and wouldn't be writing this post if the protest had fallen back to the original/more general messaging that wasn't misleading people about OpenAI's relationship with the Pentagon. I encouraged people to attend despite the messaging of the protest being misleading, because it's possible for people to attend and communicate what creates a truthful impression despite what the announcement and the press release say.</p><p>The point that I want to make is that the community needs to design mechanisms to avoid unilateral actions leading to something deontologically bad, such as spreading messages the community knows are not truthful. Making decisions under pressure, avoiding motivated cognition, etc., are hard; without accepted mechanisms for coordination, fact-checks, strong norms around preventing deception, etc., we might do harm.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"9ro144a71ye\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9ro144a71ye\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"9ro144a71ye\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9ro144a71ye\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>One of the protest organisers&nbsp;is a <s>high-status</s> member of the EA community with a lot of connections within it who spoken about organising protests at the recent EAG conference. <s>I expect many members of the EA community might feel like they shouldn\u2019t criticise actions talked about in an EAG talk, even if they notice these actions are bad.</s> (I no longer strongly expect that people would be intimidated to criticise actions in this case.)</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"rekz3w6nhl\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrekz3w6nhl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"rekz3w6nhl\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrekz3w6nhl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>Participating in a protest that's happening anyway can be positive, although I wasn't entirely sure; it also didn't feel right to reduce the number of people going to a protest that someone with similar goals was organised.</p><p>To be clear, in general, protests can be great, and I wouldn't be writing this post and trying to get the community to pay attention to this protest if not for the misleading messaging.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"yt1vhim1pig\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnyt1vhim1pig\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"yt1vhim1pig\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefyt1vhim1pig\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>I think the protest went mostly well, except for the message in the announcement and the press release.

However, I thought it might be interesting for newer EA Forum readers, and for folks who are more left-wing/progressive than average (like me), to see what arguments are compelling to someone of that worldview.</i></p><p>In November 2022, I took the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\"><u>Giving What We Can pledge</u></a> to give away 10% of my pre-tax income, to the most effective charities and opportunities, for the rest of my life. I\u2019m very proud of taking the pledge, and feel great about finishing my first full year! I wanted to share some thoughts on how it\u2019s been for me, as well as some concrete places I donated to.&nbsp;</p><p>Broadly, I feel like I\u2019ve been committed to doing the most good (<a href=\"https://jamesozden.substack.com/p/tensions-between-different-ways-of\"><u>whatever that means</u></a>) for several years now, but it took some time for me to get going with my donations. One big factor is that I haven\u2019t been earning too much, especially when I was working full-time with Animal Rebellion/Extinction Rebellion, where people used to get paid between \u00a3400-1000 per month. Otherwise, I thought it would be a significant financial burden, even when my salary increased, that would make it difficult for me to build a financial safety net. But primarily, it\u2019s a reasonably big commitment, so I think taking some time to stew on it can be useful.</p><p>Despite this, I\u2019ve been surprised by how quickly the Giving What We Can (GWWC) pledge has become a part of my identity. Now, I\u2019m so happy that I\u2019ve pledged, and feel amazing that I\u2019m able to support great projects to improve the world (you can tell because I\u2019m already preaching about it \u2013 sorry not sorry).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Importantly, I don\u2019t think donating is the only way for people to improve the world, and not necessarily the most impactful.

Rather, I think one can both pursue a high-impact career and give a lot, as donating often gives you the ability to have a huge impact with relatively little time investment. Tangibly, I\u2019ve probably spent between 5-10 hours to donate around \u00a33,000 this year, which I think will have a lot of positive impact with a relatively small time investment on my side (this was helped partially with the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-GB/why-we-recommend-funds\"><u>expert funds</u></a> and my prior knowledge in a given area, but more on that later).</p><p>However, I want to speak about some of the key points that convinced me to give 10% of my income for the rest of my life, namely:</p><ol><li><strong>I am better off than 98% of the world, for no great reason besides that I grew up in a wealthy country</strong>, and it is a huge travesty if I don\u2019t use some percentage of this luck to help others.</li><li><strong>Donations can have very meaningful impacts on the issues I care abou</strong>t, often far more than other lifestyle choices I might be already making.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>I think the world would be a much better place if everyone was committed to giving some of their income/wealth</strong>, and there\u2019s no reason why it shouldn\u2019t start with me.</li></ol><p>(If you just want to see where I donated to in 2023, skip to the bottom).</p><h2>Why I decided to take the pledge&nbsp;</h2><h3>Most people reading this are in the top 5% of wealth globally, and we should do something about it&nbsp;</h3><p>As someone who has been fairly engaged in progressive political activism, I often hear lots of comments attributing some key problems in the world, whether it\u2019s climate change, inequality or poverty, to the richest 1%. However, I think most people in wealthy countries underestimate how close they are to being in the top 1% of rich people globally.&nbsp;<strong>Specifically, my current annual earnings (approx. \u00a348k, post-tax of \u00a337k) puts me in the richest 2% globally.</strong> I would encourage folks to do this exercise for themselves, with the useful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i?income=37000&amp;countryCode=GBR&amp;numAdults=1&amp;numChildren=0\"><u>How Rich Am I calculator</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/prS8qwSisiR4XgrqB/sngxlbokmdkkuwvbmdfi\"></p><p>For me to have an income which is almost 15x the median income seems absolutely bonkers, not to mention unjust.

It talks, bluntly, about how people in Sub-Saharan Africa and other poor parts of the world are living, and dying, in extreme poverty, whilst most of us in the Global North spend our money on frivolous things. The classic thought experiment involves a child drowning in a pond: If we directly see a child drowning in a pond, would we run in to save them? The answer (hopefully) is yes \u2013 we might sacrifice our expensive iPhone, clothes or other items, but the life of a child is worth more than this. The reality is, we are faced with this decision every day, when purchasing things in our day-to-day life and not giving away much, if any, to worthy causes.&nbsp;</p><p>One way I\u2019ve found to cope with the demandingness of this argument is to simply commit to giving 10% of my income, as otherwise it can feel like you should live the most ascetic lifestyle possible, and give away everything else to someone more in need, which was certainly weighing on my mind in unhealthy (but probably important) ways.</p><p><strong>Important note:&nbsp;</strong>I talk a lot about giving to humans above, as this is what most people think of when it comes to charity, but I strongly believe we should extend our charitable considerations to other sentient beings, particularly farmed animals who experienced terrible lives full of suffering in factory farms and industrial agriculture.</p><p><strong>If you want to learn more about how the 80+ billion land animals that are farmed each year are often treated, and the impacts it has on the environment/climate change, I would recommend reading</strong><a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/what-is-factory-farming.html\"><strong>&nbsp;<u>this explainer</u></strong></a><strong>,</strong><a href=\"https://muddyclothes.substack.com/p/what-the-fuck\"><strong>&nbsp;<u>this short story</u></strong></a><strong> or this (graphic but important)</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko\"><strong>&nbsp;<u>documentary</u></strong></a><strong>.&nbsp; </strong>Additionally, the food system is responsible for approximately<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#:~:text=used%20for%20agriculture.-,Food%20is%20responsible%20for%20one%2Dquarter%20of%20the%20world's%20emissions,of%20global%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.&amp;text=This%20includes%20emissions%20from%20land,transport%2C%20packaging%2C%20and%20retail.\">&nbsp;<u>26% of global greenhouse gas emissions</u></a>, with most of that being from animal products, so a global shift from animal protein to plant proteins has important environmental and health benefits.</p><h3>Donating is one of the most impactful personal lifestyle choices you can make</h3><p>The dominant thinking within the modern progressive climate movement (at least, the bits I\u2019m involved with) emphasises the importance of systemic change over individual lifestyle changes. I broadly agree with this, and I think many people (especially mainstream politicians and \u201cinfluencers\u201d) over-emphasise the importance of changing lifestyle habits to help the climate, whether it\u2019s recycling, reusable bags or skipping plastic cutlery. An example of this is shown below, stolen from Hannah Ritchie\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/453652/not-the-end-of-the-world-by-ritchie-hannah/9781784745004\"><u>new book</u></a> (and a tweet of some of her graphs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/s8mb/status/1745393153874579574/photo/4\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/prS8qwSisiR4XgrqB/o0l8xv0omilo91sk4sgk\"></p><p>Despite this, I still think some individual lifestyle choices matter enough to be worth taking, both for their direct impact on emissions and the value of them becoming a widespread norm. Specifically, I think this is true for not eating animal products, minimising long-haul flights (especially for pleasure) and avoiding internal combustion engine cars. In addition to Hannah\u2019s research above, there is some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/climate-and-lifestyle-report\"><u>useful research from Founders Pledge</u></a> that evaluates the climate impact of these various lifestyle changes, which you can see below (I have cropped out having a child, which makes the graph less helpful to look at).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/prS8qwSisiR4XgrqB/lsthcnzaj0ife7cdzmcj\"></p><p>Interestingly, Founders Pledge also evaluates the impact of climate donations on the same axis, and the results are pretty surprising. The emissions reduction of donating $1000 to a high-impact (according to them) climate nonprofit dwarfs the other lifestyle choices, by around 5-1000x. Obviously, not everyone is going to donate $1,000 but the point still stands for a $100 donation: An $100 donation to effective climate charities is estimated to be around 67x better than recycling, 7x better than switching to green electricity and 6x better than thoroughly insulating your house in terms of carbon emissions averted.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/prS8qwSisiR4XgrqB/plhibxhcs7souqfnhtuj\"></p><p>Founders Pledge includes the necessary caveats on this page, specifically around the uncertainty in the exact climate impact of donating to climate nonprofits that focus on policy advocacy. However, I\u2019ve had a look at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/downloads/fp-climate-change\"><u>underlying report</u></a> and it seems relatively reasonable, and they are in a similar ballpark to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/industrious-labs%3A-deep-dive\"><u>estimates</u></a> by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/\"><u>Giving Green</u></a>, a climate charity evaluator. Even if you apply a reasonably big discount to Founders Pledge\u2019s number, I think the point stands:&nbsp;<strong>donating to high-impact organisations is one of the most significant ways you can have an impact as an individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I think the same holds true across other social issues as well, for example:</p><ul><li>Giving&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\"><u>$5,000 to the most effective global health charities</u></a> will likely save someone\u2019s life (in expectation). I can\u2019t think of many other ways that the average person in a rich country could save someone\u2019s life, each year.&nbsp;</li><li>Corporate campaigns against large companies that confine chickens in cruel conditions could avert about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/corporate-campaigns-affect-9-to-120-years-of-chicken-life-per-dollar-spent\"><strong><u>41 years of chicken suffering</u></strong></a><strong> per dollar spent.&nbsp;</strong>This number seems absurdly high, and the campaigns are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PTHskHoNpcRDZtJoh/gwwc-s-evaluations-of-evaluators?commentId=dzkEMmMYozwopWjs8\"><u>likely much less cost-effective now</u></a>, but to even think you can avert one year of a chicken suffering in a cage for $1 seems like such an obvious thing to do.</li></ul><p>I think what\u2019s doing a lot of work in Founders Pledge\u2019s calculations, and my writing above, is that this is the estimated impact if you\u2019re giving to \u201ceffective\u201d charities. There is a huge amount of disagreement on what that actually means, and it requires various empirical and values-based judgements to arrive at what you think is an effective charity. I\u2019ve covered some of these disagreements in my previous post on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamesozden.substack.com/p/tensions-between-different-ways-of\"><u>Different approaches to doing good</u></a>, so won\u2019t do so again for the sake of brevity.<strong> In short, my recommendations (for most people who aren\u2019t thinking or working on this stuff full-time) are to go with charities identified by a rigorous and impact-focused charity evaluator</strong>, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\"><u>GiveWell</u></a> for global health,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/\"><u>Giving Green</u></a> for climate or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators</u></a> for animal advocacy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Again, this isn\u2019t to say one shouldn\u2019t do any of the above lifestyle choices, or other important things such as political activism or organising.</strong> Rather, it\u2019s to highlight how much impact we can have if we simply add donations to our idea of important personal actions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The world would be a much better place if everyone gave away more</h3><p>This principle is fairly simple, but I believe that the world would be a much better place if everyone were just a bit more generous. Sure, we can say that the most elite 0.1% who own most of global wealth should be the ones to act first, but that\u2019s not actually helping anyone. We can\u2019t simply will them into doing so, and it doesn\u2019t seem like our political system is going to do anything serious about it either. If anything,&nbsp;<strong>I think this is a lazy excuse by (often very progressive) people who don\u2019t want to take meaningful action with their own wealth and want some justification for not doing so</strong>. I find this particularly frustrating as it often comes from people who are relatively privileged and in the top 5% of global rich people, putting them closer to billionaires in terms of wealth percentiles than the poorest 50% of the world who live on less than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/half-global-population-lives-less-us685-person-day\"><u>$6.85 per day</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you\u2019re interested in reading someone else\u2019s take on why the GWWC pledge is great, I would recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23976937/charity-giving-tuesday-givewell-ten-percent\"><u>this piece by Vox</u></a>.

Here is where I donated in 2023, both within my pledged donations and outside of them, as well as my reasoning for doing so. From my largest donations to my smallest:</p><ol><li><strong>Yet to be decided / Waiting for a good opportunity \u2013 \u00a32,000</strong><ol><li>This seems slightly like a cop-out after moralising about the importance of donations but the main driver is that I now have a new job, where I manage a philanthropic grantmaking portfolio at a family office (<a href=\"http://mobius.life\"><u>Mobius</u></a>) focused on positively transforming the food system to reduce animal suffering and environmental harms. As such, I get to play a meaningful role in where our donations are allocated, and obviously these amounts are much greater than my personal giving. This means I want to think extra hard about where to spend my personal donations, given I can support great nonprofits I think are doing highly impactful work through this new role. This likely means I will try to donate to things my employer can\u2019t or won\u2019t, which might include political donations, grassroots activism, or simply niche projects that I feel could be impactful but others are less excited about (suggestions welcome!).&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Political donation \u2013 \u00a31,500</strong><ol><li>Following on from the above, someone I know was fundraising to run to be an MP in the UK, and I wanted to support his campaign as I think he would do a great job on a variety of issues. I think political donations are one of the few ways where individual donors can have a big impact, as foundations and major donors often can\u2019t or won\u2019t get too involved here. This was my first political donation and in some ways, it feels a bit icky, but I stand by this as a neglected and important way for individuals to have an impact on our political system.</li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charity-fund/\"><strong><u>Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) Recommended Charity Fund&nbsp;</u></strong></a><strong>- \u00a3452</strong><ol><li>ACE conducts research and recommends the most impactful charities that help animals each year (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/announcing-our-2023-charity-recommendations/?utm_source=ACE+Announcements&amp;utm_campaign=52b4284d21-2023-charity-recommendations&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-d33b1a2431-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D\"><u>their 2023 recommendations</u></a>). I wanted to donate to their matching challenge for this end-of-year donation campaign where my donation would get doubled (although I am still quite unclear if the donation was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/the-counterfactual-validity-of-donation-matching\"><u>counterfactual match</u></a>). Overall, I think ACE has a very important role to play in the animal advocacy movement, and I\u2019m excited about their recent direction, which is focused on attracting more donations towards farmed animals from people who who support generic animal welfare charities (e.g. by showing how farmed animals outnumber cats and dogs by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/why-farmed-animals/\"><u>upwards of 100,000x</u></a> so it makes sense to focus your donations there if you want to help the most animals).&nbsp;<i>Conflict of interest: my partner recently started working there!</i></li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://animaladvocatesinternational.org/\"><strong><u>Animal Advocates International</u></strong></a><strong> \u2013 \u00a3235</strong><ol><li>For Animal Advocates International and Animal Welfare League below, this was the product of an interesting exercise that I did with some friends from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation Program</u></a>. Long story short, around 6 of us (who all work in the animal advocacy movement in some way) wanted to donate to some animal advocacy nonprofits. We wanted to pool our money together as we\u2019re all relatively small donors, to lessen the burden of all of us doing separate evaluations of charities, and able to contribute a more meaningful amount of an organisation\u2019s budget.&nbsp;</li><li>Using this approach, we landed on two charities, one of which is Animal Advocates International. Animal Advocates International works in Zimbabwe to support caged-egg farmers in transitioning to cage-free systems, where the suffering inflicted on hens is much less.</li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org.uk/\"><strong><u>The Humane League (THL) UK</u></strong></a><strong> \u2013 \u00a3220</strong><ol><li>I took part in a triathlon in September 2023 where I fundraised for two charities, The Humane League UK and Hamlin Fistula UK. I wanted to both push myself physically but also encourage people around me to flex their generosity muscles. I committed to match funding all donations up to \u00a31000, and this \u00a31000 would be outside of my standard 10% GWWC pledge (such that the match was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/the-counterfactual-validity-of-donation-matching\"><u>counterfactual</u></a>). I raised \u00a3440 in the end so I donated half of that to each of the charities I was fundraising for. The fun surprise was that my partner decided to also match fund everything that was donated, so she also gave \u00a3220 to both charities. The power of generosity!&nbsp;</li><li>For context on THL UK, they\u2019re an amazing charity that is relentlessly focused on reducing the greatest suffering experienced by animals. As such, they campaign against major food businesses (e.g. supermarkets) whose egg or chicken products&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/video-eggs-arent-cruelty-free-heres-why#:~:text=Each%20hen%20has%20only%20the,the%20other%20hens%20living%20inside.\"><u>confine chickens to tiny cages</u></a>, or whose genetics lead to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org.uk/Chickens-deserve-better\"><u>lives full of suffering</u></a>. Globally, The Humane League already managed to secure over 3,000 commitments from food companies to free millions of hens from cages and they are one of the most impact-focused organisations in the animal movement. I also know members of the THL UK team personally and think highly of their work and plans for the future.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://hamlinfistulauk.org/\"><strong><u>Hamlin Fistula UK</u></strong></a><strong> - \u00a3220</strong><ol><li>As above in terms of the amount.</li><li>Hamlin Fistula UK is a charity that\u2019s pretty new to me, which I found when trying to figure out the organisations I wanted to support for my triathlon. A not particularly well-known injury, an obstetric fistula is a hole between the birth canal and the bladder or rectum due to obstructed labour without adequate healthcare. Its health and social impacts are massive. It leaves survivors leaking urine or faeces \u2013 and sometimes both \u2013 through their vagina. Sufferers of obstetric fistula are often subject to severe social stigma due to their smell and perceptions of uncleanliness. Almost all sufferers of fistulas are in very low-income areas with poor healthcare, so they often receive little medical treatment to cure this. You can read more about the condition&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fistulafoundation.org/what-is-fistula/\"><u>here</u></a> and I picked this group due partially to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/best-charities/fistula-foundation/#Fistula_Sources\"><u>The Life You Can Save\u2019s positive evaluation</u></a> of a similar charity and some of my own research.</li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://www.animalwelfareleague.org/\"><strong><u>Animal Welfare League</u></strong></a><strong> \u2013 \u00a3202</strong><ol><li>As above for Animal Advocates International in terms of the deciding process. We thought Animal Welfare League was doing impressive work in Ghana to build a network of cage-free farmers, to slow down the intensification of egg farming. In addition to this, they also conduct campaigns against companies that are using caged eggs, encouraging them to transition to cage-free eggs.</li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/\"><strong><u>Giving Green</u></strong></a><strong> - \u00a3100</strong><ol><li>Giving Green is a US-focused climate charity evaluator that I think does great work to find and promote effective climate charities. Honestly, it\u2019s crazy to think this service didn\u2019t exist before Giving Green as the climate nonprofit field is filled with so many organisations, receiving large amounts of donations, that probably have a negligible impact on reducing carbon emissions. Overall, I think they have a great team that conducts extremely thoughtful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/climate-change-mitigation-strategies\"><u>research</u></a> and I found their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/post/top-climate-nonprofits-2023-best-bets-for-your-climate-donation\"><u>2023 recommendations</u></a> quite interesting, finding several promising charities that I would never have heard of otherwise.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p>If anyone wants to chat or get more information about the charities above, suggestions for other impactful places to give, or about taking the Giving What We Can pledge, please reach out and I\u2019m happy to be useful if possible.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "JamesOz"}}, {"_id": "pRAjLTQxWJJkygWwK", "title": "My cover story in Jacobin on AI capitalism and the x-risk debates", "postedAt": "2024-02-12T23:34:15.823Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Google cofounder Larry Page <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/09/artificial-intelligence-industry-future#:~:text=While%20Page%20stays,soon%20as%20possible.%E2%80%9D\"><u>thinks</u></a> superintelligent AI is \u201cjust the next step in evolution.\u201d In fact, Page, who\u2019s worth about $120 billion, has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/technology/ai-openai-musk-page-altman.html?searchResultPosition=8\"><u>argued</u></a> that efforts to prevent AI-driven extinction and protect human consciousness are \u201cspeciesist\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://time.com/6310076/elon-musk-ai-walter-isaacson-biography/\"><u>sentimental nonsense</u></a>.\u201d</p><p>In July, former Google DeepMind senior scientist Richard Sutton \u2014 one of the pioneers of reinforcement learning, a major subfield of AI \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgHFMolXs3U\"><u>said</u></a> that the technology \u201ccould displace us from existence,\u201d and that \u201cwe should not resist succession.\u201d In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=sQu-xCb-Agzj0wCR&amp;t=1851&amp;v=3l2frDNINog&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><u>2015 talk</u></a>, Sutton said, suppose \u201ceverything fails\u201d and AI \u201ckill[s] us all\u201d; he asked, \u201cIs it so bad that humans are not the final form of intelligent life in the universe?\u201d</p></blockquote><p>This is how I begin the <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2024/01/can-humanity-survive-ai\"><u>cover story</u></a> for <i>Jacobin</i>\u2019s winter issue on AI.

Some think that the idea itself causes more harm than good:</p><blockquote><p>Some fear not the \u201csci-fi\u201d scenario where AI models get so capable they wrest control from our feeble grasp, but instead that we will entrust <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262548328/more-than-a-glitch/\"><u>biased</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03013-5\"><u>brittle</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)\"><u>confabulating</u></a> systems with too much responsibility, opening a more pedestrian Pandora\u2019s box full of awful but familiar problems that scale with the algorithms causing them. This community of researchers and advocates \u2014 often labeled \u201cAI ethics\u201d \u2014 tends to focus on the immediate harms being wrought by AI, exploring solutions involving model accountability, algorithmic transparency, and machine learning fairness.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Others buy the idea of transformative AI, but think it\u2019s going to be great:</p><blockquote><p>A third camp worries that when it comes to AI, we\u2019re not actually moving fast enough. Prominent capitalists like billionaire Marc Andreessen <a href=\"https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/\"><u>agree</u></a> with safety folks that AGI is possible but argue that, rather than killing us all, it will usher in an indefinite golden age of radical abundance and borderline magical technologies. This group, largely coming from Silicon Valley and commonly referred to as AI boosters, tends to worry far more that regulatory overreaction to AI will smother a transformative, world-saving technology in its crib, dooming humanity to economic stagnation.</p></blockquote><p>Billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen (who blocked me long ago) writes that slowing down AI is akin to murder! He may be the most famous proponent of effective accelerationism (e/acc):</p><blockquote><p>In June, Andreessen published an essay called \u201c<a href=\"https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/\"><u>Why AI Will Save the World</u></a>,\u201d where he explains how AI will make \u201ceverything we care about better,\u201d as long as we don\u2019t regulate it to death. He followed it up in October with his \u201c<a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/\"><u>Techno-Optimist Manifesto</u></a>,\u201d which, in addition to praising a founder of Italian fascism, named as enemies of progress ideas like \u201cexistential risk,\u201d \u201csustainability,\u201d \u201ctrust and safety,\u201d and \u201ctech ethics.\u201d Andreessen does not mince words, writing, \u201cWe believe any deceleration of AI will cost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from existing [are] a form of murder.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>While this debate plays out, the vast majority of the money spent on AI is going into making it more capable, autonomous, and profitable. A compliant artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be the worker capitalists dream of \u2014 no need for bathroom breaks, no risk of unionizing, and no wages \u2014 just the cost of the computation.&nbsp;</p><p>But many AI researchers expect that building a true AGI (the goal of leading AI labs) will lead to an explosion in capabilities, ultimately resulting in systems far more powerful than humans:</p><blockquote><p>The October \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17688.pdf#page=2\"><u>Managing AI Risks</u></a>\u201d paper states:</p><p>There is no fundamental reason why AI progress would slow or halt when it reaches human-level abilities. . . .

Additionally, they can be scaled to use immense computational resources and can be replicated by the millions.</p></blockquote><p>Even systems that remain at human-level would likely be wildly profitable to run.</p><blockquote><p>Here\u2019s a stylized version of the idea of \u201cpopulation\u201d growth spurring an intelligence explosion: if AI systems rival human scientists at research and development, the systems will quickly proliferate, leading to the equivalent of an enormous number of new, highly productive workers entering the economy. Put another way, if GPT-7 can perform most of the tasks of a human worker and it only costs a few bucks to put the trained model to work on a day\u2019s worth of tasks, each instance of the model would be wildly profitable, kicking off a positive feedback loop. This could lead to a virtual \u201cpopulation\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined/#fnref6\"><u>billions or more</u></a> digital workers, each worth much more than the cost of the energy it takes to run them. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=1tZQyCeH5RxkG5rW&amp;t=620&amp;v=9iqn1HhFJ6c&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><u>Sutskever</u></a> thinks it\u2019s likely that \u201cthe entire surface of the earth will be covered with solar panels and data centers.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>(Where would we live? Unclear.)</p><p>As AI systems become more valuable, it will be harder to rein in their developers. Many have theorized about how a superintelligence could resist efforts to turn it off, but corporations are already plenty good at continuing to do risky things that we\u2019d really rather they didn\u2019t:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cJust unplug it,\u201d goes the common objection. But once an AI model is powerful enough to threaten humanity, it will probably be the most valuable thing in existence. You might have an easier time \u201cunplugging\u201d the New York Stock Exchange or Amazon Web Services.</p></blockquote><p>So why do some people think superintelligent AI would pose a threat to humanity?</p><blockquote><p>The fear that keeps many x-risk people up at night is not that an advanced AI would \u201cwake up,\u201d \u201cturn evil,\u201d and decide to kill everyone out of malice, but rather that it comes to see us as an obstacle to whatever goals it does have. In his final book, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Stephen Hawking articulated this, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/16/17978596/stephen-hawking-ai-climate-change-robots-future-universe-earth\"><u>saying</u></a>, \u201cYou\u2019re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you\u2019re in charge of a hydroelectric green-energy project and there\u2019s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>By and large, the left isn\u2019t seriously engaging with AI and in so doing, we\u2019re giving up a chance to shape a technology that could unmake (or remake) society:</p><blockquote><p>After years of inaction, the world\u2019s governments are finally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59b9ef36-771f-4f91-89d1-ef89f4a2ec4e\"><u>turning their attention to AI</u></a>. But by not seriously engaging with what future systems could do, socialists are ceding their seat at the table.</p><p>In no small part because of the types of people who became attracted to AI, many of the earliest serious adopters of the x-risk idea decided to either engage in <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/\"><u>extremely theoretical research</u></a> on how to control advanced AI or started AI companies. But for a different type of person, the response to believing that AI could end the world is to try to get people to stop building it.</p></blockquote><p>We may be entering a critical period akin to the drafting of the constitution for a new country with the potential to be more powerful than any that came before. Right now, that constitution is being drafted by unelected techno-capitalists:</p><blockquote><p>Governments are complex systems that wield enormous power. The foundation upon which they\u2019re established can influence the lives of millions now and in the future. Americans live under the yoke of dead men who were so afraid of the public, they built antidemocratic measures that continue to plague our political system more than two centuries later.</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s ironic given how similar the problem is to another thing that leftists tend to think A LOT about! When my lefty friends point out that capitalism is the real misaligned superintelligence, it\u2019s not exactly reassuring:</p><blockquote><p>We may not need to wait to find superintelligent systems that don\u2019t prioritize humanity. Superhuman agents <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/11/a-public-option-for-food#:~:text=My%20friend%20Sarah,destroyed%20the%20world.\"><u>ruthlessly optimize</u></a> for a reward at the expense of anything else we might care about.

She forwarded me an email chain from 12 years ago in which we all pretended we left the EA community, and explained why. We were partly thinking through what might cause us to drift in order that we could do something to make that less likely, and partly joking around. It was a really nice reminder of how uncertain things felt back then, and how far we\u2019ve come.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the emails hadn\u2019t led us to take any specific actions, almost everyone on the thread was still devoting their time to helping others as much as they can. We\u2019re also, for the most part, still supporting each other in doing so. Of the 10 or so people on there, for example, Niel Bowerman is now my boss - CEO of 80k. Will MacAskill and Toby Ord both made good on their plans to write books and donate their salaries above \u00a320k<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffl04svkoso\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfl04svkoso\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;a year. And Holly Morgan is who I turned to a couple of weeks ago when I needed help thinking through work stress.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\u2019s what I wrote speculating about why I might drift away from EA. Note that the email below was written quickly and just trying to gesture at things I might worry about in future, I was paying very little attention to the details. The partner referenced became my husband a year and a half later, and we now have a four year old.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>On 10 February 2012 18:14, Michelle Hutchinson &lt;michelle.hutchinson@exeter.ox.ac.uk&gt; wrote:</p><p>Writing this was even sadder than I expected it to be.</p><p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Holly\u2019s and my taste in music drove the rest of the HIH<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8lho4uciao9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8lho4uciao9\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;crazy, and they murdered us both.</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The feeling that I was letting down my parents, husband and children got the better of me, and I sought better paid employment.</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toby, Will and Nick got replaced by trustees whose good judgement and intelligence I didn\u2019t have nearly as much faith in, so I no longer felt fully supportive of the organisation \u2013 I was worried it was soon going to become preachy rather than effective, or even dangerous (researching future technology without much foresight).</p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I realised there were jobs that wouldn\u2019t involve working (or even emailing co-workers) Friday evenings :p</p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I remembered how much I loved reading philosophy all day, and teaching tutorials, and unaccountably Oxford offered me a stipendiary lectureship, so I returned to academia.</p><p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; [My partner] got lazy career-wise, and I wanted a nice big house and expensive food, so I got a higher paid job.</p><p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I accidentally emailed confidential member information to our whole mailing list / said the wrong thing to one of our big funders / made a wrong call that got us into legal trouble, and it was politely suggested to me that the best way I could help the EA movement was by being nowhere near it.</p><p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it became clear that although I rationally agreed with the moral positions of GWWC and CEA, most of my emotional motivation for working for them came from not wanting to let down the other [team members], it was decided really I wasn\u2019t a nice enough person to have a position of responsibility in such a great organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [My partner] got a job too far away from other CEA people for me to be able to work for CEA and be with him. I chose him.</p><p>10.&nbsp; When we had children I took maternity leave, and then couldn\u2019t bear to leave the children to return to work.</p><p>11.&nbsp; I tried to give a talk about GWWC to a large audience, fainted with fright, and am now in a coma.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>When I wrote the email, I thought it was really quite likely that in 10 years I\u2019d have left the organisation and community. Looking around the world, it seemed like a lot of people become less idealistic as they grow older. And looking inside myself, it felt pretty contingent that I happened to fall in with a group of people who supported me so well in living up to my values. It seemed very plausible that that wouldn\u2019t stick.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I\u2019d have liked, at the time I wrote the email, to see that there were others who had been doing it for a decade with no sign of stopping. Particularly if they were people for whom effective altruism felt hard in various ways, and not their obvious calling. That\u2019s why I thought people new to the community, wondering how viable it is to stick with over the long haul, might enjoy reading my \u2018premortem\u2019 and knowing that in fact I\u2019m still a member of Giving What We Can, still spending my day job on figuring out how we can most effectively help others, and still doing it alongside many of the people I set out with.&nbsp;</p><p>I also thought it might be useful for me to think through some of what\u2019s helped me avoid the pitfalls I sketched out in my email. Below describes some of the things I found useful over the years.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, the EA community has changed in various ways which make sticking with my convictions much easier than I expected it to be.</p><ul><li>When I was offered a job at GWWC, the initial salary was \u00a315,000 a year<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4sq5fg8cods\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4sq5fg8cods\">[3]</a></sup></span>. The fact that salaries at EA orgs are now much more in line with what I\u2019d make elsewhere makes me much more confident I won\u2019t leave simply to get a better salary. (Despite the fact that my husband does, as predicted, only work part-time and that I\u2019m still a sucker for a nice home and good food.)&nbsp;</li><li>There are now effective altruists all around the world, and it\u2019s easier than it used to be to contribute remotely. If my husband needed us to move to another country, I no longer think I\u2019d fall out of touch with other EAs.</li><li>I\u2019m a big fan of how the growing size of the community has allowed it to professionalise. More pairs of eyes can check emails that go out to large numbers of people, and what I used to have to try to figure out from legal textbooks, like sending out a job offer, we can now consult lawyers on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On specific items, and what\u2019s helped with those:&nbsp;</p><p>2. Surrounding myself with people who share my values has made it easier to feel that sticking to them isn\u2019t letting the people around me down. I think it would have been easy to feel that what I was doing was weird and therefore somehow wrong, particularly when it meant not making as much money for my family as I could. But it doesn\u2019t feel weird - it\u2019s what many of my friends are doing. Thankfully, it\u2019s also exactly what my husband thinks I should do, so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m letting my family down (though we\u2019ll see how my son sees it when he\u2019s old enough to have opinions about my career!).</p><p>4. I was somewhat joking with my comment about working on a Friday evening. But I did then, and do still, find it hard to strike the right balance on how hard to work. I think I\u2019d have worked fairly hard whatever I was doing. But feeling that your work is aimed at helping others, and that the world needs a lot of fixing, makes it tempting to think you should be working all the time. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to always have supportive colleagues who have helped me figure out a good balance. Some of the things that have been useful to me are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Spending time intentionally setting out my schedule and how much I feel good about working.&nbsp;</li><li>CBT techniques to try to get myself closer to reflective equilibrium about how hard to work, for example:&nbsp;<ul><li>Thinking through what I would say to a friend or someone reporting to me if they were saying the things I was&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.mindmypeelings.com/blog/challenging-cognitive-distortions\"><u>Challenging automatic thoughts</u></a> through things like doing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/stopp/\"><u>STOPP routine</u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>5. and 11. were both, somewhat flippantly, about the idea that a job I might take in EA wouldn\u2019t be one I\u2019d particularly enjoy. How much to take my enjoyment into account when choosing and crafting roles is another thing I\u2019ve struggled to find the right balance on. I still don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve found it, but I have found that I can work significantly longer hours in roles I enjoy than those I find very stressful. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always worth avoiding the stressful roles, but it is worth taking into consideration. I also think that I\u2019ve found having a role I think has a genuine shot at helping others pretty satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>8. Looking back at this, in large part I just feel really grateful for how much kindness and how little judgement I\u2019ve found in the community. I actually can\u2019t right now think of a single example of someone else telling me I wasn\u2019t doing things for the right reasons, or anything approaching not being a good enough person to be here.</p><p>Thinking about this now, the real risk captured by this point is that I might feel inadequate and imposter-y and therefore not enjoy being in the community and end up drifting away. I think us being supportive to each other rather than noticing and judging all the ways we aren\u2019t optimal seems important for making sure it\u2019s a community we all enjoy being part of.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, it really helped that I talked to people explicitly about this worry (and similar ones). It\u2019s meant that people could provide reassurance they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise thought to. I also think that finding the right niches of the community has helped me. Sometimes some particular part can feel more ambitious than I\u2019m willing to be, or just have no-one in it who I get on particularly well with. I like that there are now so many different groups - on and offline - so that you can find the people you feel at home with.&nbsp;</p><p>10. Of course there has also been plenty of chance and contingency involved in none of the things I wrote coming to pass. For example, after three months of maternity leave it was clear I was not at all cut out for full-time mothering - there\u2019s another version of me which would have loved it.&nbsp;</p><p>1. I\u2019d like to say that Holly and I tried hard not to annoy others with our music taste, but that would be false.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfl04svkoso\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffl04svkoso\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Adjusting by inflation</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn8lho4uciao9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref8lho4uciao9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>High Impact House - a fictional share house which never came to be</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4sq5fg8cods\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4sq5fg8cods\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Inflation explains some of why that sounds so low \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t that long ago, so it doesn\u2019t explain much!</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "RXFcmrf7E5fLhb43e", "title": "Things to check about a job or internship", "postedAt": "2024-02-12T20:20:42.907Z", "htmlBody": "<p>A lot of great projects have started in informal ways: a startup in someone\u2019s garage, or a scrappy project run by volunteers. Sometimes people jump into these and are happy they did so.</p><p>But I\u2019ve also seen people caught off-guard by arrangements that weren\u2019t what they expected, especially early in their careers. I\u2019ve been there, when I was a new graduate interning at a religious center that came with room, board, and $200 a month. I remember my horror when my dentist checkup cost most of a month\u2019s income, or when I found out that my nine-month internship came with zero vacation days. It was an overall positive experience for me (after we worked out the vacation thing), but it\u2019s better to go in clear-eyed.</p><p>First, I\u2019ve listed a bunch of things to consider.

See a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c5wgvkt2CfCCciggR/things-for-grant-applicants-to-remember-about-living\"><u>fuller list here</u></a>, including<ul><li>Medical insurance and unexpected medical costs</li><li>Taxes (including self-employment taxes if they're not legally your employer)</li><li>Any loans you have</li></ul></li><li>Will medical insurance be provided?</li><li>Maybe they\u2019ve indicated \u201cIf we get funding, we\u2019ll be able to pay you for this internship.\u201d Will you be ok if they don\u2019t get funding and you don\u2019t get paid?</li><li>Maybe they\u2019ve indicated you\u2019ll get a promotion after a period of lower-status work or \u201cproving yourself.\u201d If that promotion never comes, will that work for you?</li><li>If you need equipment like a laptop, are you providing that or are they? Who owns the equipment?</li><li>If you got a concussion tomorrow and needed to rest for a month, what would the plan be? If not covered by your work arrangement, do you have something else you can fall back on?<ul><li>Medical care</li><li>A place to stay</li><li>Income</li></ul></li><li>If you need to leave this arrangement unexpectedly, do you have enough money for a flight to your hometown or whatever your backup plan is?</li></ul><p><strong>Predictability and stability</strong></p><ul><li>How long have they been established as an organization? Newer organizations are likely more flexible, but also more likely to change direction or to close down.</li><li>How much staff turnover has there been recently? There are various possible reasons for high staff turnover, but one could be a poor working environment.</li></ul><p><strong>Structure and accountability</strong></p><ul><li>Will someone serve as your manager? How often will you meet with them? If there's not much oversight / guidance, do you have a sense of how well you function without that?</li><li>Is there a board? If so, does the board seem likely to engage and address problems if needed?</li><li>Are there established staff policies, or is it more free-form? If there\u2019s a specific policy you expect to be important for you, like parental leave, you may want to choose a workplace that already has a spelled-out policy that works for you.</li></ul><p><strong>If living on-site</strong></p><ul><li>Will you have a room to yourself, or will you ever be expected to share a bedroom or sleep in a common area?</li><li>Is it feasible to get off-site for some time away from your coworkers? How remote is the location? Living and working with the same people all the time can get intense.</li></ul><p><strong>Work agreement</strong></p><ul><li>Is there a written work agreement or contract? If there isn\u2019t one already, you can ask for one. For example, in my state anyone employing a nanny is required to write out an agreement including<ul><li>Pay rate</li><li>Work schedule</li><li>Job duties</li><li>Sick leave, holidays, vacation, and personal days</li><li>Any other benefits</li><li>Eligibility for worker\u2019s compensation</li><li>Process for raising and resolving concerns (typically the option of a weekly meeting)</li></ul></li><li>Get things in writing. If you discuss your work arrangement verbally, and they haven\u2019t sent you a written agreement, you can send a written message afterwards along the lines of \u201cI want to be sure we\u2019re on the same page. In our conversation just now we agreed on X, Y, and Z. Is that right?\u201d</li><li>Spell out the rate at which days off (holidays, sick days, etc) will be paid. If room and board is normally part of the package, how does that work during your holidays, vacation time, and sick time?</li><li>Are there specific times when you\u2019re not allowed to take vacation/holidays because of events or busy seasons at work?</li><li>Is this an arrangement with set hours, or can you set your own hours, or is the expectation \u201cwork whatever hours needed to accomplish X\u201d? What kind of hours do other people work?</li><li>Are you expected to attend work-related functions in addition to normal work?</li><li>Consider asking someone you trust (and who has had several jobs before) to look over the contract.</li></ul><p><strong>Communications</strong></p><ul><li>Will you have permission to list this work experience on your LinkedIn, etc? There may be good reasons for not allowing this \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a startup in stealth mode, or works in a sensitive area \u2014 but consider if you\u2019ll be able to use the job for resume-building.</li><li>Are there restrictions on your social media use? Will you need to avoid posting spicy takes on work-related topics? Will they expect you to take down any existing material you\u2019ve written? (This may be more likely at more established organizations.)</li></ul><p><strong>Unpaid or barely-paid arrangements</strong></p><ul><li>In some countries you can volunteer or intern at nonprofits and not be paid minimum wage. If you\u2019re a volunteer, are you genuinely excited about contributing to the project\u2019s work? If you\u2019re an intern, are you gaining useful skills and experience? Or are you just very cheap labor?</li><li>In EA, many (most?) projects pay their interns / fellows. If this project doesn\u2019t have money to pay you, it might be a genuinely promising project that just hasn\u2019t caught on with funders, or funders might have a reason for not being excited, or the project might not have tried to fundraise for these roles.</li></ul><p><strong>Travel</strong></p><ul><li>If you need to move for this job, will any moving expenses be covered?</li><li>Will you need travel medical insurance?</li><li>Can you get items that are important to you in that location? (food to meet your diet, medicine?)</li><li>If you see a therapist or other healthcare provider remotely, many of them have restrictions on operating across borders.&nbsp;</li><li>Will you be able to interface with locals if you don\u2019t speak the local language?</li></ul><p><strong>Legal</strong></p><ul><li>Will you be on a proper work visa, or are you expected to do work on a tourist visa?<ul><li>If you don\u2019t have the legal right to work in that country, how bad would it be if you get in trouble for your visa and are never be able to enter this country again?</li></ul></li><li>Does your status (as a contractor vs employee) match the kind of work you\u2019ll be doing according to the country\u2019s labor laws, or are you doing employee work but being called a contractor?</li><li>Will you be expected to drive (including in a country where driving rules are different from what you\u2019re used to)? Are you licensed to drive? Will you be expected to drive a type of vehicle (like a large van) you\u2019re not experienced with?</li></ul><p><strong>Outside view</strong></p><ul><li>Talk with someone who has worked for this organization or manager before, maybe especially someone who has left the organization.</li><li>Is there someone you trust, ideally someone with related work experience, who you can talk over your decision with? What questions do they have about the arrangement?</li><li>Once you\u2019re at the project, do you have a social anchor outside that group you can stay in touch with?</li></ul><h2>Advice from a few EAs</h2><p><i>This is a combination of lightly-edited thoughts from a few EAs who have worked both at small less-structured projects and at larger organizations.</i></p><p><strong>A small project might be a better fit than a big one</strong></p><p>I feel a bit on the edge about focusing so much on the informal projects \u2014 I am personally very unsure about my fit for a larger organization and my first year working at one has been challenging. I sometimes feel the meme spreading that working at a larger EA organization is better on so many dimensions, and even though it does provide some perks, I have had amazing times working at small informal projects and for me, one is not clearly better than the other one. Especially when you are in a time that you are more ok with taking risks I think it might be a good choice for proactive and problem-solving individuals. I learned so much at small projects and created super valuable friendships, and generally love the dynamism and sense of ambition.</p><p><strong>Be picky</strong></p><ul><li>Treat the choice of where to work (including within the space of \u201cEA orgs\u201d) as an extremely serious decision. For most EAs, the stakes are much(!) higher than the stakes for their donations.&nbsp;<ul><li>Take your time to figure this out, including e.g. calendar time delays to talk to potential references.&nbsp;</li><li>Err against rushing this decision.

Jack was selected as our inaugural Executive Director for our formerly volunteer-led organization in 2019. Since joining, he has grown One for the World\u2019s annual donation volume more than 7 times. He built One for the World into a global organization with chapters in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia.</p><p>He created our corporate fundraising strategy from the ground up. When Jack joined, we\u2019d not made a single corporate presentation. We have delivered more than 100 at some of the most prestigious companies in the world, with corporate donors contributing over $1 million in donations in the last year. Jack has done the unglamorous but vital work to transform a volunteer network into an established nonprofit with an international reach.&nbsp;</p><p>Jack boldly steered One for the World through the COVID-19 pandemic when our core program had to effectively stop completely across campuses worldwide. Jack prioritized the organization\u2019s internal culture and fostered an inclusive environment for our team. His tremendous success advising our donors on their philanthropic legacies here at One for the World will undoubtedly serve him well in his next opportunity.</p><p>Building on his experience at One for the World, Jack is launching a consultancy offering bespoke donation advice for large donors.

I am highly confident about my characterization of existing U.S. tort law and its limits. This characterization is only contested by other legal scholars and analysts on the margin. My prescriptions are much more controversial, though most of the objections come from people who are skeptical of AI catastrophic risk and/or the political viability of my proposals, rather than the merits (on the assumption that advanced AI systems do generate catastrophic risks).&nbsp;</p><p>TLDR: Legal liability could substantially mitigate AI risk, but current law falls short in two key ways: (1) it requires provable negligence, and (2) it greatly limits the availability of punitive damages. Applying strict liability (a form of liability that does not require provable negligence) and expanding the availability and flexibility of punitive damages is feasible, but will require action by courts or legislatures. Legislatures should also consider acting in advance to create a clear ex ante expectation of liability and imposing liability insurance requirements for the training and deployment of advanced AI systems. The following post is a summary of a law review article.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4694006\"><u>Here is the full draft paper</u></a>. Dylan Matthews also did an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/7/24062374/ai-openai-anthropic-deepmind-legal-liability-gabriel-weil\"><u>excellent write-up of the core proposal</u></a> for Vox\u2019s Future Perfect vertical.&nbsp;</p><p>AI alignment is primarily a technical problem that will require technical solutions. But it is also a policy problem. Training and deploying advanced AI systems whose properties are difficult to control or predict generates risks of harm to third parties. In economists\u2019 parlance, these risks are negative externalities and constitute a market failure. Absent a policy response, products and services that generate such negative externalities tend to be overproduced. In theory, tort liability should work pretty well to internalize these externalities, by forcing the companies that train and deploy AI systems to pay for the harm they cause. Unlike the sort of diffuse and hard-to-trace climate change externalities associated with greenhouse gas emissions, many AI harms are likely to be traceable to a specific system trained and deployed by specific people or companies.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are two significant barriers to using tort liability to internalize AI risk. First, under existing doctrine, plaintiffs harmed by AI systems would have to prove that the companies that trained or deployed the system failed to exercise reasonable care. This is likely to be extremely difficult to prove since it would require the plaintiff to identify some reasonable course of action that would have prevented the injury. Importantly, under current law, simply not building or deploying the AI systems does not qualify as such a reasonable precaution.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, under plausible assumptions, most of the expected harm caused by AI systems is likely to come in scenarios where enforcing a damages award is not practically feasible. Obviously, no lawsuit can be brought after human extinction or enslavement by misaligned AI. But even in much less extreme catastrophes where humans remain alive and in control with a functioning legal system, the harm may simply be so large in financial terms that it would bankrupt the companies responsible and no plausible insurance policy could cover the damages. This means that even if AI companies are compelled to pay damages that fully compensate the people injured by their systems in all cases where doing so is feasible, this will fall well short of internalizing the risks generated by their activities. Accordingly, these companies would still have incentives to take on too much risk in their AI training and deployment decisions.</p><p>Fortunately, there are legal tools available to overcome these two challenges. The hurdle of proving a breach of the duty of reasonable care can be circumvented by applying&nbsp;<i>strict liability</i>, meaning liability absent provable negligence, to a class of AI harms. There is some precedent for applying strict liability in this context in the form of the&nbsp;<i>abnormally dangerous activities</i> doctrine. Under this doctrine, people who engage in uncommon activities that \u201ccreate a foreseeable and highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care is exercised by all actors\u201d can be held liable for harms resulting from the inherently dangerous nature of the activity, even if they exercise reasonable care. Courts could, if they are persuaded of the dangers associated with advanced AI systems, treat training and deploying AI systems with unpredictable and uncontrollable properties as an abnormally dangerous activity that falls under this doctrine. Alternatively, state legislatures could pass legislation instructing the courts in their state to apply strict liability in some specified set of AI harm cases.</p><p>The second problem of practically non-compensable harms is a bit more difficult to overcome. But tort law does have a tool that can be repurposed to handle it:&nbsp;<i>punitive damages</i>. Punitive damages impose liability on top of the&nbsp;<i>compensatory damages</i> the plaintiffs in successful lawsuits get to compensate them for the harm the defendant caused them. And one key rationale for this form of damages is that compensatory damages alone would tend to underdeter the tortious conduct involved. In the framework I propose, punitive damages could be applied in cases of practically compensable harm from AI that are correlated with uninsurable AI risks. In this way, punitive damages would pull forward the expected liability associated with uninsurable risks. Since we cannot hold AI companies responsible when uninsurable catastrophes occur, the only way to internalize uninsurable risks is to hold companies responsible for the expected harm associated with those risks before they are realized. In the next post, I will sketch out the appropriate punitive damages formula and explain how more technically oriented AI safety researchers can help lay the groundwork for implementing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, existing punitive damages law is poorly suited to the risks posed by advanced AI systems, in two ways. First, punitive damages require malicious or reckless conduct on the part of the defendant. This means that they are unavailable in cases of ordinary negligence, let alone strict liability. Second, there is no precedent for basing a punitive damages calculation on counterfactual injuries or unrealized risks. Rather punitive damages are typically used when the defendant has already caused a great deal of harm, but most of those harms are unlikely to result in successful lawsuits. Moreover, unlike with strict liability, there is no pathway for courts to carve out a narrow exception for AI, allowing punitive damages in ordinary negligence or strict liability cases involving AI, but not other harms. Eliminating the malice or recklessness requirement and allowing punitive damages calculations to account for&nbsp;<i>unrealized</i> uninsurable risk are both big asks to make of common law courts. To be clear, these are both warranted doctrinal moves that are consistent with the optimal deterrence rationale for punitive damages and within the powers of courts to make. Nonetheless, the sort of punitive damages I call for are more likely to be achieved via legislation.</p><p>If state legislature or Congress do take up AI liability legislation, this could unlock two additional important features. First, legislation could make the availability of strict liability and punitive damages clear well in advance of the first case of legally compensable harm caused by an advanced AI system. Courts, by contrast, have no means of credibly announcing their policies in advance. They can only decide cases as they come and write opinions explaining their rulings. If we are in for a hard takeoff, then there won\u2019t be time for early AI liability cases to work their way through the courts and generate the expectation of liability needed to induce AI companies to move more slowly and cautiously in training and deploying advanced AI systems. Second, state or federal legislation could require companies that train or deploy advanced AI systems to carry liability insurance that scales with potentially dangerous system capabilities, both anticipated (in the case of training insurance requirements) or measured (in the case of deployment insurance requirements). This would introduce a more cautious decision maker, the insurance company, into the loop. Training or deployment would only be permitted if and when the AI company is able to persuade an insurance company to write it a policy it can afford. This would guard against incautious behavior on the part of AI companies whose key decision-makers either underrate AI risk or do not expect there to be many \u201cwarning shot\u201d cases of practically compensable harm that is correlated with uninsurable risk.</p><p>If the tort law system can create an expectation that AI companies will be held liable for all of the expected harm generated by their choices, it should induce greater caution. This means both investing more in alignment and moving slower to train and deploy more capable systems. There are important limits to ex post liability, but it can play a crucial role in reducing AI risk, including catastrophic risk, if the technical, legal, and political barriers can be overcome. In a follow-up post, I explain how AI safety researchers can help address the technical barriers to implementing this framework.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Gabriel Weil"}}, {"_id": "t6iKFW9jz5SCEzBwK", "title": "BERI Returns All FTX Funds", "postedAt": "2024-02-12T16:40:48.583Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a link to BERI's blog post detailing the outcome of settlement proceedings for returning FTX funds.

The AI Board, which would comprise member states\u2019 representatives, will remain as a coordination platform and an advisory body to the Commission and will give an important role to Member States on the implementation of the regulation, including the design of codes of practice for foundation models. Finally, an advisory forum for stakeholders, such as industry representatives, SMEs, start-ups, civil society, and academia, will be set up to provide technical expertise to the AI Board.&nbsp;</i>See also more info in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/eu-commission-readies-establishment-of-ai-office/\"><u>this recent article</u></a> from Euractiv.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/10/03/letter-to-eu-s-future-ai-office-pub-90683\"><u>This letter</u></a> proposes topics people could focus on when working for the EU AI Office. My main Theory of Change would be: Make sure that supervisory power is proportionally divided on the severity of risks and the scale of the companies.

So if agreed upon in April 2024, the rules will apply a year later, from April 2025 onwards. Nine months before the rules apply, the AI Office must start working on Codes of Conduct (CoC) and risk taxonomy. This will mean the hiring processes for the EU AI Office could probably start in April, but also a bit earlier or later.</li></ul></li><li><u>Expertise</u><ul><li>Since they need to hire incredibly fast against below-market rates compared to tech companies (~$3000 post-tax), we expect it might be hard for the EC to hire the right talent.

For the more senior roles, obviously more requirements apply.</li></ul></li><li><u>Application Process</u><ul><li>We can see that interested individuals already write letters of interest for roles to key stakeholders in the European Commission, e.g. to Heads of Unit.

I think Tabarrok is correct that this is a crux in the debate about how pessimistic to be about the possibility of humanity defending ourselves against a misaligned AGI,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-1\" id=\"fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-1\">[1]</a></sup> and so in turn a crux about the probability of extinction or similarly bad outcomes from misaligned AI.</p>\n<p>One thing I think Tabarrok is importantly correct about is that the idea of an \u201coffense\u2013defense balance\u201d in hypothetical future human\u2013AI conflicts <em>is</em> important but often undertheorized. Anyone interested in this question should be humbled by the fact that offense\u2013defense theory and its application seem to me, as an outsider, to remain <a href=\"https://perma.cc/VX9F-Y4B2\">hotly contested by informed commentators</a>, despite decades of scholarship.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-2\" id=\"fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-2\">[2]</a></sup> Shorthand references to people\u2019s intuition on the offense\u2013defense balance between a hypothetical unaligned AGI and humanity are likely imprecise in many hidden ways, and ideally we would fix that. So Tabarrok is correct to say that this whole line of inquiry remains \u201con unstable ground.\u201d Kudos to him for sparking a conversation on that.</p>\n<h2>Why I am not as reassured by the historical trends in conflict fatality rates as Tabarrok</h2>\n<p>Some smaller points of agreement and disagreement were covered in the comments to that piece, including <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/the-offense-defense-balance-rarely/comment/45485155\">Daniel\u2019s great comment</a>. I want to focus mainly on the use of this graph, which I will call the \u201cOWID Graph\u201d:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tCEMc8c7Y85sKZW53/rrsfojezo5umxvmzypdt\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The OWID Graph generated a lot of good discussion. I\u2019m going to ignore here the difficulty of estimating such rates,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-3\" id=\"fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-3\">[3]</a></sup> because it\u2019s unclear in which direction that difficulty cuts, if any. I agree with <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/the-offense-defense-balance-rarely/comment/44925151\">Dwarkesh</a> that the apparent stability is obscured by the use of a log scale, but with Tabarrok that the fact that there is no apparent long-run trend itself hints at an interesting form of stability.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, there are a few other reasons why I also find this line of evidence to be less reassuring than Tabarrok.</p>\n<h3>Reason 1: Deaths in conflict is not a measure of the offense\u2013defense balance</h3>\n<p>To first set the backdrop, it\u2019s important to remember that (per my lay understanding), the offense\u2013defense balance is usually understood as the feature of some dyad\u2014pairs of states, in the central case\u2014with respect to some particular territory (again, in the central case).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-4\" id=\"fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-4\">[4]</a></sup> It is not straightforwardly some ambient feature of the world, comparable to, e.g., parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The global number or proportion of deaths in combat is therefore not necessarily a measure of the offense\u2013defense balance, though it may be a correlate thereof since offense\u2013defense theory predicts that in offense-dominant eras that there will be more conflict.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-5\" id=\"fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-5\">[5]</a></sup> (On the other hand, the theory also predicts that in defense-dominant regimes, wars will be more protracted, which could cause higher death rates. See World War I.)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-6\" id=\"fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>If we wanted to make statements about the long-run trend in offense and defense, therefore, we may want to look at long-run trends in territorial change. Some offense-defense theorists claim that in offense-dominant periods we should expect to see the number of states in a given region decrease.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-7\" id=\"fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-7\">[7]</a></sup> And it does seem like the long-term net trend in human history has been ever-greater territorial control of the most powerful political units. Right now, four political entities\u2014Russia, Canada, China, and the US\u2014control about 30% of the world\u2019s landmass. Even if you interpreted \u201cpolitical unit\u201d and \u201ccontrol territory\u201d loosely, I am 99% confident that, 100,000 years ago, the four most powerful political units cumulatively controlled much less than 1% of the world\u2019s landmass.</p>\n<p>But more fundamentally, I think the question of what the long-run trend has been is <em>not</em> the most informative question\u2026</p>\n<h3>Reason 2: Only a temporary period of offense-dominance may be sufficient for AI takeover.</h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t think the pessimist case turns on whether there has been a long-run, monotonic increase in offense-dominance. Instead, what it requires is that <em>at certain times one party in a dyad has had such an offensive advantage that they could eradicate/conquer the other</em>. And I think it\u2019s pretty clear that <em>has</em> been the case: history is replete with examples of states completely dominating or eradicating other states and societies. If you were a member of the conquered or eradicated group, and all you cared about was the survival of your group, it is of little comfort to you that in the long run the group that conquered you will have its offensive advances limited and itself need to become a defender. Your group is still permanently disempowered! Indeed, the possibility of offense-dominance being fleeting <em>favors</em> states rushing to offense, to capitalize on their temporary advantage.</p>\n<p>The question is then whether there is a realistic chance that an AI could find a technology that gives it an offensive advantage over humanity, for long enough that it could permanently seize power from us, just as more powerful states have seized on their (possibly temporary!) offense-dominance to seize power over others. The history of more powerful states conquering less powerful states does not give much reason for optimism if your main concern is that you will temporarily end up in the less-powerful state\u2019s position as against a misaligned AGI.</p>\n<h3>Reason 3: AI might not need to defend itself against humans wielding AI-made offensive weapons.</h3>\n<p>Tabarrok also correctly points at a possible reason for expecting long-run stability: attackers may need to become defenders, and so once they invent an offense-dominant technology they will probably be strongly incentivized to find defenses to it. This is especially the case because states seem to have had a hard time keeping new technologies secret from each other: a rational state should probably expect its competitor to copy its offensive technologies sooner or later. Even if a small period of offense-dominance can enable a state to totally subjugate one defender, future possible defenders will take notice and appropriate the original attacker\u2019s offensive technologies.</p>\n<p>But I take the pessimists\u2019 view to be that humans are likely to have weaknesses against which an attacking AI need not defend, especially owing to humans\u2019 dependence on biological processes. As a crude example, suppose an AI system that poisoned the atmosphere to make it unbreathable. This would require humans to expend enormous amounts on defense (e.g., controlled environments) to survive as a species, which may not ultimately succeed and would likely kill, at minimum, the vast majority of people. But it seems possible that a sufficiently advanced AI would not in so doing threaten itself much, if it no longer required human labor for upkeep. It is also worth considering whether AIs could obviate the need for defending against their own inventions through other strategies, such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keeping them secret from humans for longer.</li>\n<li>Relying on scientific or technological insights that are not easily understood by humans.</li>\n<li>Inventing weapons that humans cannot operate.</li>\n<li>Simply permanently disempowering humans before humans can have a chance to respond by appropriating AI-derived offensive technologies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, the reasons why we might expect long-run stability in human\u2013human conflicts may not apply to conflicts between humans and AIs.</p>\n<h3>Reason 4: The destructiveness of the most destructive conflicts is increasing</h3>\n<p>From eyeballing the OWID Graph, one salient feature is that the <em>most</em> destructive conflicts have gotten deadlier over time. Conflicts with over 100 deaths per 100,000 were unprecedented before 1600 but happened multiple times per century thereafter. The Thirty Years\u2019 War was uniquely destructive for approximately 300 years, until two comparable wars happened in the 20th Century.  Conflicts that have killed more than 20 people per 100,000 appear to have become steadily more common since 1600.</p>\n<p>This <em>is</em> what you\u2019d predict if there was a long-run increase in the destructiveness (which is distinct from offense-dominance) of military technology, net of defenses.</p>\n<p>Looking at the maximum fatality rate in addition to the median or mean is important if worse-case scenarios matter much more than central cases on ethically relevant dimensions. Since, \u00e0 la Parfit, many \u201cpessimists\u201d think that events that kill 100% of humans are orders of magnitude worse than events that kill (e.g.) 50% of humans, the upward trend in the maximum destructiveness of conflict is more salient than the lack of a long-run trend in the median or modal case: it suggests that the probability of conflicts that kill a high percentage of humans is rising, and therefore, maybe, that the probability of a conflict that kills <em>all or almost all</em> humans is rising. Of course, this is not a good reason to conclude that there is a high risk of such a conflict, and past conflicts have only barely breached 1% of humans, so on priors we still should not think it is likely. But a morally significant trend is real and going in the wrong direction.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See also Steven Byrnes, Comment to <em>AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities</em>, <strong>LessWrong</strong> (July 5, 2022),  <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities?commentId=Sf4caqwxDFyYHoxFZ\">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities?commentId=Sf4caqwxDFyYHoxFZ</a>. <a href=\"#fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>My understanding is that the seminal work on offense\u2013defense balance is Robert Jervis, <em>Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma</em>, 30 <strong>World Pol.</strong> 167 (1978), <a href=\"https://perma.cc/B2MG-F3UL\">https://perma.cc/B2MG-F3UL</a>. <a href=\"#fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>H/T Sarah Shoker. <a href=\"#fnref-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-ivGA8hNpMJz9qid6N-4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><em>See</em> Charles L.

It creates a record to get better over time and gives others insights into how you donate.</p><p>I officially made $45000 in 2023. I earned some investment income from some other sources though this is hard to quantify. I also had some savings from previous years so don\u2019t come away from this thinking that I gave such a substantial portion of my income. That said, I am still giving away a significant portion of my income this year. I think this is a good thing and hopefully, I can serve as an example to others to give away a significant portion of their income, even if it isn\u2019t that high.</p><p>In total, I am giving away $29,003.98 this year though some of this ($11,000) will come from my donations from Manifold mana (This isn\u2019t including my Manifund regranting balance).</p><p>I primarily prioritize animal welfare in my personal donations since I think that on the margin, it is greatly neglected compared to other EA priorities and leads to orders of magnitude more suffering reduction compared to GHP charities. Furthermore, I am a regrantor through Manifund where I get to give to \u201clongtermist\u201d focused organizations, and thus my personal donations this year are focused on animal welfare.</p><p>I think there is a good argument that if one is donating a modest sum of money, they shouldn\u2019t seek to diversify and mainly aim to figure out the best place for them to donate. I think this is a good argument but I have (clearly) elected not to. There are a few reasons for this. First, there is a pretty good chance that my donation numbers are going to go up a lot in the next few years, more than I could give to any one organization. I, therefore, think it is a good idea to form connections with several organizations early about whom I will support later with larger amounts. I also think it is beneficial to charities to have a somewhat but not overly diverse set of donors. I think I\u2019m a large enough donor to many charities to be meaningful but not course-altering.</p><p>The summary of my donations can be seen at the top of the post, here I will break them down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Charity Entrepreneurship - $8003.98</strong></p><p>I will start by admitting that this was the least intentional of my donations. I had money in my Charitable Impact account and due to changes in Canadian tax law, I couldn\u2019t give this away to many places. I was helped to find a route for this money to Charity Entrepreneurship and thus I gave away the entire remaining balance there.</p><p>This isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t think this is a very worthwhile donation. I think it is. Charity Entrepreneurship seems to be incubating about 1-2 highly effective charities per year that seem to be scaling quite well. This is crucial to effective altruism being able to scale while maintaining as high of a cost effectiveness as possible. I think they currently seem to have enough money but I would like to see CE get a bit more ambitious and scale their stuff harder which I seem to see them doing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insect Institute - $5000</strong></p><p>I think insects have a decent probability of sentience and the sheer number of insects is staggering. Even with a very tiny chance that these beings matter, expected value math works out such that averting the suffering of insects is extremely cost-effective. The Insect Institute is the best place I know of to help insects as they are working on lobbying to prevent the takeoff of insect farming. Insects are also extremely neglected. They aren\u2019t very cute and generally, outside of EA, very few people seem to care about insects. That said, the arguments for caring about insect welfare are very good. I think in many worlds, this is among my most effective donations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shrimp Welfare Project - $5000</strong></p><p>Many people reading this section are going to come over from Manifold since I gave this donation with mana and it was considered a very peculiar and to be frank, made-fun-of donation. Therefore, I am going to explain this donation with a tinge of prediction market vocabulary.</p><p>The world currently operates as if there are prediction markets priced at 0.0% on markets such as \u201cAre shrimp sentient?\u201d and \u201cDo shrimp\u2019s experiences matter morally?\u201d I think the true probability here is<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUvMKRkEOJQcc6V7VJqcLLGAJ2SsdZno0jTIUb61D8k/edit#heading=h.uskcgipunmm1\"><u> about 30-40%</u></a>. I think<a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/are-shrimps-sentient\"><u> lots of good work</u></a> has gone into studying this to back up my probabilities here. Now, while there are no markets for me to bet \u201cyes\u201d at 0.0%, collecting lots of shares and making lots of money in expectation, one thing I can do is donate to the Shrimp Welfare Project.</p><p>The Shrimp Welfare Project aims to reduce shrimp suffering in three main ways; improving water quality, humane slaughter, and continuous research into improving shrimp\u2019s lives. The numbers of farmed shrimp are staggering with ~440 billion shrimps being farmed each year.

I don\u2019t know the right amount of research for the community to be doing of course but I do think there is a potential tragedy of the commons that is possible in funding this public good for EA where people get to \u201cfreeload\u201d off the benefits of RP\u2019s work. I think an elegant solution to this is for most people to give a portion of their budget to the research that informs their other actions/donations.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cMcEBSNiy4meDrmuE/rethink-priorities-needs-your-support-here-s-what-we-d-do\"><u>They do need money</u></a>. I don\u2019t know how RP should be funded, or how much. But probably differently than the status quo of restrictive and private client work doing the bulk of their funding such that they can then research what they think is important. Many also seem to assume that RP, as a well-established EA institution, doesn\u2019t need more funds but through reading and conversations with RP, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all and an RP that pursues most of what they think is important seems like a good thing.</p><p>I\u2019m a bit concerned that they could increase their frugality. As I understand it, staff are paid quite highly and I\u2019ve heard of expenditures that a lower-budget organization could go without. That said, effective giving is caring about results and RP\u2019s research works in my opinion make it the best place to donate for EA research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Animal Ethics - $5000</strong></p><p>Animal Ethics seems to be the organization that is currently best working at the intersection of animal welfare and longtermism, thinking about and doing research and advocacy on helping non-human animals in the long term future. To be frank, I\u2019m surprised more work isn\u2019t being done on this with a more explicit focus. Nonetheless, I\u2019m quite impressed with Animal Ethics\u2019 work of spreading animal ethics and the importance of animal sentience around the world and reaching so many people. I am also impressed with the breadth and depth of content that they are generating.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, in conversations with Oscar Horta and others at Animal Ethics, they seem to really be thinking very hard about animal welfare policies for the long term and just generally deeply thinking about animal ethics in clever ways from speciesism, to advocacy to translating important content in other languages and establishing a presence outside of the West.</p><p>Animal Ethics also operates on a tiny budget. Last I checked, they were a 40-person organization with a total budget of $200,000. I expect my donation to go a long way here. I\u2019m surprised more EA donations aren\u2019t going here given the above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wild Animal Initiative - $1000</strong></p><p>This was admittedly a bit of a last-minute donation when I was asked to donate here and it is a bit of a token donation/signalling donation.

I'm confused by this and wanted to quickly jot down my thoughts - I won't try to make them rigorous and make various guesses for what additional assumptions people usually make. I might be wrong about those.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Views that IMO imply putting more weight on s-risk reduction:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/complexity-of-value#:~:text=Complexity%20of%20value%20is%20the,few%20simple%20rules%2C%20or%20compressed.\"><strong>Complexity of values</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some people think that the most valuable things possible are probably fairly complex (e.g. a mix of meaning, friendship, happiness, love, child-rearing, beauty etc.) instead of really simple (e.g. rats on heroin, what people usually imagine when hearing hedonic shockwave.) People also often have different views on what's good. I think people who believe in complexity of values often nonetheless think suffering is fairly simple, e.g. extreme pain seems simple and also just extremely bad. (Some people think that the worst suffering is also complex and they are excluded from this argument.) On first pass, it seems very plausible that complex values are much less energy-efficient than suffering. (In fact, people commonly define complexity by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/complexity-of-value#:~:text=Complexity%20of%20value%20is%20the,few%20simple%20rules%2C%20or%20compressed.\">computational complexity, </a>which translates directly to energy-efficiency.) To the extent that this is true, this should increase our concern about the worst futures relative to the best futures, because the worst futures could be much worse than the best futures.<br><br>(The same point is made in more detail <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RkPK8rWigSAybgGPe/a-longtermist-critique-of-the-expected-value-of-extinction-2#2_2__Disvalue_is_not_complex\">here</a>.)<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Moral uncertainty:</strong> I think it's fairly rare for people to think the best happiness is much <i>better</i> than worst suffering is bad. I think people often have a mode at \"they are the same in magnitude\" and then uncertainty towards \"the worst suffering is worse\". If that is so, you should be marginally more worried about the worst futures relative to the best futures. The case for this is more robust if you incorporate other people's views into your uncertainty: I think it's extremely rare to have an asymmetric distribution towards thinking the best happiness is better in expectation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefme7s6fflh9m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnme7s6fflh9m\">[1]</a></sup></span><br><br>(Weakly related point <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LKbWgJjtQDaKbn9HM/the-option-value-argument-doesn-t-work-when-it-s-most-needed\">here</a>.)</li><li><strong>Caring about preference satisfaction:</strong> I feel much less strongly about this one because thinking about the preferences of future people is strange and confusing. However, I think if you care strongly about preferences, a reasonable starting point is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifrustrationism\">anti-frustrationism</a>, i.e. caring about unsatisfied preferences but not caring about satisfied preferences of future people. That's because otherwise you might end up thinking, for example, that it's ideal to create lots of people who crave green cubes and give them lots of green cubes. I at least find that outcome a bit bizarre. It also seems asymmetric: Creating people who crave green cubes and <i>not</i> giving them green cubes <i>does</i> seem bad. Again, if this is so, you should marginally weigh futures with lots of dissatisfied people more than futures with lots of satisfied people.<br>To be clear, there are many alternative views, possible ways around this etc. Taking into account preferences of non-existent people is extremely confusing! But I think this might be an underappreciated problem that people who mostly care about preferences need to find some way around if they <i>don't</i> want to weigh futures with dissatisfied people more highly.</li></ol><p><strong>I think point 1 is the most important because many people have intuitions around complexity of value.</strong> None of these points imply that you should focus on s-risk.

Why?</p><p>The common story for how AI could overpower humanity involves an \u201cintelligence explosion,\u201d where an AI system becomes smart enough to further improve its capabilities, bootstrapping its way to superintelligence. Even without any kind of recursive self-improvement, some AI safety advocates <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined/\"><u>argue</u></a> that a large enough number of copies of a genuinely human-level AI system could pose serious problems for humanity. (I discuss this idea in more detail in my recent <i>Jacobin </i><a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2024/01/can-humanity-survive-ai#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20a%20stylized,and%20data%20centers.%E2%80%9D\"><u>cover story</u></a>.)</p><p>Some people think the transition from human-level AI to superintelligence could happen in a matter of months, weeks, days, or even hours. The faster the takeoff, the more dangerous, the thinking goes.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam Altman, circa February 2023, agrees that a slower takeoff would be better. In an OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond#fn-A\"><u>blog post</u></a> called \u201cPlanning for AGI and beyond,\u201d he argues that \u201ca slower takeoff gives us more time to figure out empirically how to solve the safety problem and how to adapt.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>So why does rushing to AGI help? Altman writes that \u201cshorter timelines seem more amenable to coordination and more likely to lead to a slower takeoff due to less of a compute overhang.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s set aside the first claim, which is far from obvious to me.</p><p>Computational resources, or compute, is one of the key inputs into training AI models. Altman is basically arguing that the longer it takes to get to AGI, the cheaper and more abundant the compute, which can then be plowed back into improving or scaling up the model.&nbsp;</p><p>The amount of compute used to train AI models has increased roughly <a href=\"https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-great-inflection-a-debate-about-ai-and-explosive-growth#:~:text=In%20the%20past%20decade%2C%20the%20amount%20of%20computation%20used%20to%20train%20AI%20systems%20has%20doubled%20every%20six%20months%2C%20increasing%20by%20roughly%20100%2Dmillion%2Dfold%20over%20this%20period\"><i><u>one-hundred-millionfold</u></i></a> since 2010. Compute supply has not kept pace with demand, driving up prices and rewarding the companies that have near-monopolies on chip design and manufacturing.&nbsp;</p><p>Last May, Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-wants-to-see-an-ai-rival-to-google-microsoft-a299e27f?mod=article_inline\"><u>said</u></a> that \u201cGPUs at this point are considerably harder to get than drugs\u201d (and he <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1\"><u>would know</u></a>). One startup CEO <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ai-boom-runs-on-chips-but-it-cant-get-enough-9f76f554\"><u>said</u></a> \u201cIt\u2019s like toilet paper during the pandemic.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps no one has benefited more from the deep learning revolution than the 31-year-old GPU designer Nvidia. GPUs, chips originally designed to process 3D video game graphics, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-nvidia-dominated-ai-and-plans-to-keep-it-that-way-as-generative-ai-explodes/\"><u>were discovered</u></a> to be the best hardware for training deep learning models. Nvidia, once little-known outside of PC gaming circles, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-nvidia-dominated-ai-and-plans-to-keep-it-that-way-as-generative-ai-explodes/\"><u>reportedly accounts</u></a> for 88 percent of the GPU market and has ridden the wave of AI investment. Since OpenAI\u2019s founding in December 2015, Nvidia\u2019s <a href=\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/\"><u>valuation</u></a> has risen more than <i>9,940 percent</i>, breaking $1 trillion last summer. CEO and cofounder Jensen Huang <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/jensen-huang-1/?sh=3d88490b3a6c\"><u>was worth</u></a> $5 billion in 2020. Now it\u2019s $64 billion.</p><p>If training a human-level AI system requires an unprecedented amount of computing power, close to economic and technological limits, as seems likely, and additional compute is needed to increase the scale or capabilities of the system, then your takeoff speed may be rate-limited by the availability of this key input. This kind of reasoning is probably why Altman thinks a smaller compute overhang will result in a slower takeoff.&nbsp;</p><p>Given all this, many in the AI safety community think that increasing the supply of compute will increase existential risk from AI, by both shortening timelines AND increasing takeoff speed \u2014 reducing the time we have to work on technical safety and AI governance and making loss of control more likely.&nbsp;</p><p>So why is Sam Altman reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0\"><u>trying to raise</u></a> trillions of dollars to massively increase the supply of compute?&nbsp;</p><p>Last night, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0\"><u>reported</u></a> that Altman was in talks with the UAE and other investors to raise up to <i>$7 trillion </i>to build more AI chips.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m going to boldly predict that Sam Altman will not raise $7 trillion to build more AI chips. But even one percent of that total would nearly double the amount of money spent on semiconductor manufacturing equipment last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, Altman\u2019s plan seems to fly in the face of the arguments he made not even one year ago. Increasing the supply of compute is probably the purest form of boosting AI capabilities and would increase the compute overhang that he claimed to worry about.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI safety community sometimes divides AI research into capabilities and safety, but some researchers push back on this dichotomy. A friend of mine who works as a machine learning academic once wrote to me that \u201cin some sense, almost all [AI] researchers are safety researchers because the goal is to try to understand how things work.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Altman makes a similar point in the blog post:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Importantly, we think we often have to make progress on AI safety and capabilities together. It\u2019s a false dichotomy to talk about them separately; they are correlated in many ways. Our best safety work has come from working with our most capable models. That said, it\u2019s important that the ratio of safety progress to capability progress increases.</p></blockquote><p>There are good reasons to doubt the numbers reported above (mostly because they\u2019re absurdly, unprecedentedly big). But regardless of its feasibility, this effort to massively expand the supply of compute is hard to square with the above argument. Making compute cheaper speeds things up without any necessary increase in understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>Following November\u2019s board drama, early <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-19/altman-sought-billions-for-ai-chip-venture-before-openai-ouster?embedded-checkout=true\"><u>reporting</u></a> emerged about Altman\u2019s Middle East chip plans. It\u2019s worth noting that Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley, two of the (now ex-) board members who voted to fire Altman, reviewed drafts of the February 2023 blog post. While I don\u2019t think there was any single smoking gun that prompted the board to fire him, I\u2019d be surprised if these plans didn\u2019t increase tensions.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI deserves credit for publishing blog posts like \u201cPlanning for AGI and beyond.\u201d Given the stakes of what they\u2019re trying to do, it\u2019s important to look at how OpenAI publicly reasons about these issues (of course, corporate blogs should be taken with a grain of salt and supplemented with independent reporting).

This <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/06/28/shifting-public-views-on-legal-immigration-into-the-u-s/\"><u>demographic fact</u></a> has persisted across decades so it may seem normal and obvious, but it actually presents a challenge to many economic theories of voter behavior. In particular, the anti-immigration preference among old republican voters isn\u2019t well explained by theories of \u201crational\u201d or self-interested voting.</p><p>These theories suggest that people vote for the candidate whose policies would benefit them the most. This is intuitive and has some empirical support. Democrats, who are highly educated, favor student loan forgiveness and Republicans, who are older, favor expanding social security. But there are just as many counterexamples to this theory. High-income Democrats vote for increased taxes and farm-and-fracking Republicans vote for tariffs which <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/economics-at-its-best-the-story-of-the-iowa-car-crop/\"><u>reduce the value of their export industries</u></a>.</p><p>Anti-immigration sentiment among old republicans is another counterexample to the predictions of straightforward self-interest in the voting booth. This group of voters face less of the purported negative impacts of immigrants than almost any other group. They don\u2019t compete with immigrants in the labor market since they\u2019re retired or close to it. They\u2019re insulated from any increases in crime which happen mostly in dense city centers (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexNowrasteh/status/1678784257030778880\"><u>if at all</u></a>).</p><p>Old republicans also capture lots of the upside from extra immigration. Young, working age immigrants buoy social security and Medicaid. Homeowning older voters benefit from upward pressures on land prices due to migration and population growth. Low-skilled immigrants also <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w30960\"><u>ease staffing pressures at nursing homes, significantly improving outcomes</u></a> for residents. This is especially beneficial to older Republicans who are more likely to smoke, be obese, and rely on social insurance.</p><p>Most of these voters would personally benefit from greater immigration, so why do they vote against it? It isn\u2019t just ignorance and irrationality. It\u2019s <i>rational </i>ignorance and irrationality.</p><p>Consider this model of an election: We get to choose between candidate D and candidate R. The straightforward self interest model simply says that we choose whichever candidate benefits us the most. If we\u2019re older, we might choose candidate D since expanded immigration would increase the quality and decrease the cost of our medical care later in life, perhaps worth tens of thousands of dollars in health and wealth.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter#:~:text=The%20Myth%20of%20the%20Rational%20Voter%3A%20Why%20Democracies%20Choose%20Bad,can%20trust%20to%20make%20laws.\"><u>rational irrationality</u></a> model notices that we only get these benefits if candidate D actually wins. If candidate R is thousands of votes ahead, then no matter who we choose to vote for, we\u2019ll get R\u2019s policies. Similarly, if candidate D was going to win with our without our vote then no matter what, we get D\u2019s policies. So unless our single vote decides the election, the policy differences between D and R have no direct impact on the self-interested welfare impact of our voting decision.</p><p>Instead of considering the difference between the value of each candidate\u2019s policy proposals, we consider the difference between each candidate\u2019s policy proposals <i>multiplied by our chance of changing the outcome of the election. </i>We\u2019re one vote out of tens of millions so this chance is miniscule. Even when one candidate\u2019s policies would benefit us on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars, the expected value of a vote for that candidate is tiny since it will almost certainly not change the outcome.</p><p>So why do people vote at all? Well, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/\"><u>lots of them don\u2019t</u></a>, suggesting that the small costs of voting are often enough to outweigh the expected value of a vote for one candidate over another. But what voter turnout there is can be explained by noticing that there are rewards to voting which don\u2019t rely on affecting the outcome of the election: The feeling of fulfilling civic duty, indulging in nationalism or xenophobia, cheering for your team colors, or seeing yourself as helping those in need.</p><p>These emotional benefits are modest, and are outweighed when the stakes are high. <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/nearly-three-quarters-millionaires-polled-g20-countries-support-higher-taxes-wealth#:~:text=A%20staggering%20new%20poll%20has,Economic%20Forum%20in%20Davos%2C%20Switzerland.\"><u>Democrat billionaires</u></a> still use tax advantaged savings accounts and write-offs because doing otherwise would cost them too much. But they don\u2019t face these costs at the voting booth. Even though a higher tax rate might cost them dearly, their single vote has almost no chance of causing or preventing this policy change. So they are free to indulge in the emotionally rewarding rhetoric of providing for the needy.</p><p>This theory of voter turnout also makes predictions for voter behavior. First, rational ignorance: Voters won\u2019t do much research on the similarities and differences between candidate\u2019s platforms since any gains they might get from a clear-eyed evaluation of the candidates are trivialized by their tiny chance of changing the winner. Second, rational irrationality: Voters won\u2019t work to correct biases that muddy their decision making since picking the right candidate doesn\u2019t matter much and indulging in biases can be emotionally rewarding.</p><p>So why do old republicans support cutting immigration even though that might land them in an understaffed nursing home for the rest of their lives?

When we learn the exact mechanisms of consciousness, we may be able to develop \u201cartificial\u201d consciousness\u2014 artificial in the sense that it will be an artefact of technological innovation. The creation of artificial consciousness (not artificial intelligence) will be the point in history when neurophysical developers become Doctor Frankenstein.</p><p>I make several proposals in this article including a call for Artificial Consciousness Safety (ACS)&nbsp;primarily focused on preventing the development of artificially conscious entities through the regulation of neuroscientific research.&nbsp;Despite digital sentience being fairly well known, preventative approaches appear to be rare and neglected. AI welfare usually takes the spotlight instead of the precursor concern of AC creation. The problem has high importance because it&nbsp;could involve vast numbers of beings in the far future, leading to&nbsp;risk of astronomical suffering (s-risks). I propose some early methods, estimates and scientific foundations to gain tractability in order to reconcile the wicked problem of ACS.</p><h3><strong>A Harmless Sentience Evaluation Tool</strong></h3><p>This line of investigation was triggered by a terrifying thought that pervaded me whilst researching methods to evaluate sentience. I was thinking about how one could build a consciousness&nbsp;detection or sensing device and the engineering it would require.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref69mrpuwi6h3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn69mrpuwi6h3\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I wondered something unimportant like, \u201cA BCI with a photonic-thalamic bridging sensor, if built could that detect anything?\u201d</p><p>And then, the mind-worm hit with a few thought wriggles which I have not been able to shake since \u2014 \u201cin order to detect consciousness, we would likely need a ground up understanding of its workings.\u201d This thought was followed by another \u2014 \u201cthat would lead to information which could facilitate the development of conscious computers\u201d, and then the final devastating wriggle \u2014\u201cthat would lead to the possibility of untold kinds and degrees of catastrophic digital suffering\u201d.</p><h2>Claims</h2><p>Now, before continuing with my arguments for implementing preventive ACS measures, I am aware there are claims in the mind-worm which could be disputed:</p><ol><li>a. A sentience evaluation device requires a comprehensive understanding of consciousness<br><br>b. A sentience evaluation device has utility<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Consciousness is substrate complexity dependent<br>&nbsp;</li><li>a. <strong>Solving consciousness to a significant degree leads to an increased likelihood of artificial consciousness</strong><br><br>&nbsp;b. Artificial consciousness will have the capacity to be sentient<br><br>c. Artificial sentience will have the capacity to suffer<br><br>d. Artificial sentience will still occur because of perceived benefits &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Artificial sentience is an S-risk because it might be easily replicable<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>My core concern and focus of this writing is <strong>3. a.</strong>&nbsp;as progress towards this goal is being made within disciplines such as neuroscience and most notably<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysics\">&nbsp;<u>neurophysics</u></a>.</p><p>3.b and 3.c and 4 contribute to the concern that digital sentience may be bad by default given that it likely entails suffering, which could be reproduced ad-infinitum.</p><p>The core claim <i>\"3a. Solving consciousness to a significant degree leads to an increased likelihood of artificial consciousness\"</i>, has two parts so let\u2019s break it down further. Before doing so, I\u2019ll share some definitions I am using.</p><h3><strong>Definitions</strong>:</h3><p><strong>Consciousness</strong>: Subjective&nbsp;experience.</p><p><strong>Sentience: </strong>Subjective experience of higher order feelings and sensations, such as pain and pleasure.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3d4gbjxud2d\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3d4gbjxud2d\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Artificial Consciousness (AC)</strong>: A digital mind; machine subjective experience. A simulation that has conscious awareness.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbahzoc2x7fs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbahzoc2x7fs\">[5]</a></sup></span><br>They are artificial in the sense of being made from synthetic, computational or other technological components.</p><p>I mean consciousness in the sense that, if you were them, it really is, \u201c<i>something to be like</i>\u201d the system [i.e. AC].If you ask the question, \u201cwhat is it like to be a simulated Bat?\u201d then you are contemplating an AC. If you were uploaded to a computer and still had a subjective experience, however strange, then you would be an AC.</p><p><strong>The Hard Problems:</strong>&nbsp;There\u2019s a lot of confusion around the hard problems of consciousness leading to new questions such as&nbsp;meta and real problems (see fixing the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2020/1/niaa009/5861711\"><u>hard</u></a>&nbsp;problem). In this post I\u2019ll be referring to the hard problems as the science of understanding experience on a mechanistic level (hopefully this avoids confusion).</p><p><i>Hard problems = mechanistic problems.&nbsp;</i></p><p>A good example of a hard problem in another field would be understanding an AGI neural network adequately enough to trace exactly how it has learned features such as altruism or deception. Following this, the next challenge would be to develop another AGI model choosing to either include or exclude those features.</p><p>&nbsp;When discussing the hard problem of replicating consciousness within the scope of this post, I am choosing not to focus on \u201cthe whys\u201d(ie. why do I experience anything at all?) nor the functions of consciousness (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2022/1/niac007/6573727?searchresult%3D1%23377635145\"><u>intrinsic</u></a>,<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2022/1/niac001/6523097?searchresult%3D1%23377634641\">&nbsp;<u>attentional</u></a>&nbsp;or otherwise) which could be considered a crucial error on my part. If you disagree with my definition of the hard problems, then I would suggest substituting \u201chard\u201d with \u201cmechanistic\u201d.</p><p><strong>Meta-problem:</strong>&nbsp;Why do people think that consciousness is hard to explain? Consciousness is easy to define\u2014it&nbsp;is the bedrock of sentient experience\u2014 it is however difficult to explain mechanistically. If we did understand it, my supposition is that we could use that knowledge in instrumental ways, such as being able to meaningfully measure it. For example, a measure of the quality of an individual\u2019s state of consciousness and how that correlates with their wellbeing (potentially triangulated with self-reported measures) would be a good way to prove our understanding of the subject.</p><h3><strong>Likelihoods</strong></h3><p>Solving consciousness is probably easier than solving suffering because suffering requires consciousness. Thus, ACS involves at least two fields of research: <i>Consciousness research + wellbeing research.</i></p><p>So then, why am I suggesting something as wild as ignoring the mysteries of consciousness or at least letting them rest?</p><p>I should make clear that I am not arguing that neuroscience research should be stopped. Instead, I propose that the research related to reverse engineering consciousness should often be considered \u201cDual Use Research of Concern ''(DURC)&nbsp;and preventative policies be implemented.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm7m8leill1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm7m8leill1\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>Just as we have AGI safety measures in place despite the fact that AGI has not yet been achieved, ACS measures could be implemented in anticipation of Artificial Consciousness suffering, indeed because there is not an economy built around AC like there is AI, we might be able to be proactively effective if we act early enough.</p><p>Although I am campaigning for ACS, it is important to note that I have low projections for the probabilities of most AC related forecasting (these opinions/estimates have been updated based on reader feedback and reflection during the writing/research process itself. I\u2019m not sure how useful creating prediction markets will be on these but it could be if someone wants to do that.):</p><ul><li>that consciousness is substrate-complexity independent: 4%&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflx4jk03nxl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlx4jk03nxl\">[7]</a></sup></span></li><li>Consciousness is biologically dependent: 15% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>that we will achieve artificial consciousness at all: 2%</li><li>that digital computers in the next 50 years will be conscious: &lt;1%</li><li>AC is dependent on advanced artificial intelligence: 2%</li></ul><p>Based on such low probability estimates, it is fitting to ask: why care about artificial consciousness if the chance of it developing is so unlikely? Well, I would answer that under scientific and moral uncertainty, the s-risk consequences that could occur are too drastic to ignore.</p><p><br>Getting back to the core claim and reason behind this article: if consciousness is reverse engineered, might this breakthrough be opening the s-risk floodgates more than anything else to an ocean of AC suffering?</p><h2><strong>Solving Consciousness to a Significant Degree&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>(leads to an increased likelihood of artificial consciousness. Claim 3.a. Part one)</strong></p><p>This part of the claim deals with the mechanistic problems of consciousness. Essentially, it is the kind of research which aims to understand the black box of the phenomenal mind.</p><p>Questions:</p><ul><li>What parts of the brain and body enable experience?</li><li>If found, how could this be replicated digitally?</li></ul><p>Auxiliary problems that contribute to understanding consciousness:</p><ul><li>What are the neuroscientific mechanisms of perception? How do sensorimotor cortical columns function? etc</li><li>Hard questions regarding the above neuroscience: Do any of these mechanisms contribute to the phenomenon of conscious experience? If so, how?</li></ul><p><strong>Possible interpretations of a \u201csignificant degree\u201d:</strong></p><ul><li>A rigorous scientific explanation that has reached consensus across all related disciplines.</li><li>Understanding just enough to be able to build a detection device</li><li>Understanding enough to create a simulated agent that demonstrates the most basic signs of consciousness with a formalised and demonstrable proof</li><li>Understanding consciousness enough for the formalisation&nbsp;to be consolidated into a blueprint of schematic modules, such as a repository on github with a guided and informative readme section explaining each component in enough detail for it to be reproduced.</li></ul><p>I believe neurophysics and also neuroengineering are among the main contenders for contributing to a solution in this area. One reason why the framing here is to a \u201csignificant degree\u201d is because of how unclear the threshold is until a person will be able to act on and implement an advanced mechanistic understanding of consciousness. One hope might be that the consciousness science progress threshold for beneficial implementations is less than that which is required for AC (such as: BCI therapies for binding disorders and a precise science of suffering/wellbeing). &nbsp;</p><p>This mechanistic part of the claim is less important and should mostly be understood as an IF THIS happens &nbsp;rather than HOW, and we can dispute cost-benefits in the next section. So the claim is mostly about what follows from THIS [IF:consciousness solution = TRUE]... THEN\u2026?</p><h2><strong>The Likelihood of Artificial Consciousness</strong></h2><p><strong>(Claim 3.a. Part two - what does it lead to?)</strong></p><p><i>Question:</i></p><ul><li>If consciousness could be reduced to a blueprint schematic, how long will it be before it is used to build a proto-AC or AC MVP?</li><li>If a blueprint for an AC&nbsp;MVP was linked or outlined in a public article, how long before it becomes a plugin for developers to build AC models?</li></ul><h3>Series of Events</h3><p>This is the most speculative part of the article and acts as a thought experiment rather than a forecast. The point of this is to keep in mind the key historical moment in which consciousness is solved. It could be in 10, 100, 1000 years or much longer. No one knows. The focus is on how events may play out from the finish of the seemingly benign scientific quest to understand consciousness.</p><p><img style=\"width:442px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wRNEad7agmnXvM7H7/oz74gg6tafk6teot0foh\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, Jeff Sebo and Robert Long wrote a paper on moral considerations for AI systems by 2030 and gave the likelihood of AI consciousness at least a one in a thousand chance.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6x9blb7p91v\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6x9blb7p91v\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Their probability for a biological dependence is much higher than mine, though if the framing was substrate complexity dependence then I think their estimate of 80% is far too low; I do not think they are sceptical enough<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftuzrnb38pqm\"><sup><a href=\"#fntuzrnb38pqm\">[9]</a></sup></span>. However, even if their estimates are accurate the moral duty should probably be on preventative AC measures more so than preparing for moral weights of near-term AI systems.</p><h3>Timeline Series of Events</h3><p>The time in this scenario is agnostic to the starting year and instead, focuses on the acceleration of events that may soon follow the initial historical moment that consciousness is reverse engineered. I\u2019ve included some further columns for people to consider in this thought experiment: the amount of AC individuals involved, the possible hedonic valence ranges, suffering distributions and average wellbeing. The values are essentially placeholders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(217, 217, 217);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\"

Digital minds may then be in horrifying simulations of unforeseeable kinds of pain. Innumerable entities, i.e. trillions of ACs spread across as little as 100\u2019s of simulation instances and seeds (depending on the amount of entities capable of being simulated in one instance). The AC suffering range may also go beyond the worst torture we can imagine (-10 wellbeing= agony) to the greater extremes of torture organic human minds could not imagine (-1000 wellbeing= unknown intensities of agony).<br><br>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to go into all the different ways digital minds can suffer. If you feel inclined you could watch a few Black Mirror episodes involving ACs and extrapolate those simulations to the nth degree.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Despite the risks and ethical considerations, could the adjacent sciences of Artificial Consciousness be considered too important to not pursue?</p><p>Here\u2019s a list of outcomes which some people, groups or governments&nbsp;may consider the benefits which outweigh the risks:</p><h3><strong>Beneficial Outcomes [3.d.]:</strong></h3><ol><li>A greater understanding of consciousness across the living world<ol><li>Improved ethics and moral considerations</li><li>Sentience evaluation devices</li></ol></li><li>Mind emulation<ol><li>Longevity - an alternative to cryonics.</li><li>Digital lives<ol><li>The possibility to trial having a digitally sentient child before an organic one</li><li>Experience Another World in VR ~ with Living NPCs!

This could be due to the fact that there haven\u2019t been any significant papers which would be considered as containing an AC \u201cinfohazard\u201d. Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t on the precipice of it occurring. Again, I think it\u2019s unlikely to occur if my probabilities are at all close. However, on the small chance a paper is published which hints at replicating a component of consciousness artificially, I\u2019ll be increasingly concerned and wishing we had security alarms (\ud83d\udd34activate the ACS taskforce; \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude92 \u2018slides down pole\u2019 and puts out the sparks (kindling?) of AC).</p><h3><strong>\ud83d\udea9AC Technological Milestones:</strong></h3><p>There will be a lot of false-positives in the upcoming years to do with claims around consciousness amplification. Similar to false-positives seen in AI development where people claim the AI is conscious when it will usually be a kind of sapience instead i.e. human intelligence-mimicry, not genuine qualia and sentient sensations.</p><p>Here are some possible milestones to look out (and test) for:</p><ul><li>Proto conscious sensorimotor sensation in a robotic limb.</li><li>The brain being plastic and feeling like the augmentation is a part of them is different from receiving real signals seamlessly through an extended peripheral nervous system where the limb is integrated. The functional equivalents of interoception, proprioception and exteroception could be used for a sensorimotor benchmark.</li><li>A false-positive example can be explained by variations of the rubber hand illusion, or phantom limb syndrome.</li><li>BCI-BCI reports study participants feel what is occuring in someone else [the connector would probably need to be as advanced as Generation 10 of synchron or neuralink. 1000\u2019s of shared neuralace threads]</li><li>A quantum computer runs a sentient program with a similar complexity to our neurons.</li><li>A tiny organism is replicated 1:1 digitally and responds exactly in similar ways.</li><li>An accurate consciousness sensing device</li></ul><p>Many of these milestones on the way to understanding consciousness would be difficult to verify without a consciousness sensing device; a catch-22 type situation. Alternatively, it is conceivable to build a close-approximation consciousness sensing device without completely solving consciousness.</p><h3><strong>\ud83d\udea9AC DURC examples:</strong></h3><ul><li>Neurophysics publications which detail a successful methodology for reproducing a component of conscious experience.</li><li>Computational Neuroscience publications which provide a repository and/or formula of a component of conscious experience for others to replicate.</li><li>Current Example (possibly): <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01069-w\"><u>Brainoware\u2014computation </u></a>is concerning because it may be on a trajectory that breaches the threshold of substrate complexity<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqrzcijoku3l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqrzcijoku3l\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;by combining the biological with the computational.</li></ul><p>These examples are flagged as concerning because they may be dangerous in isolation or more likely as components to larger recipes for consciousness (similar to Sequences of Concern or methodologies to engineer wildfire pandemics). It may be helpful to develop a scale of risk for certain kinds of research/publications that could contribute in different degrees to AC. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>How worried should we be?</strong></p><p>Now, what if we don\u2019t need to worry about the prevention of AC s-risks because the problems are too difficult to solve? I\u2019ve given my likelihoods and plan to continuously update them as new research comes out. Let\u2019s consider the failure to solve consciousness and/or build AC as positive because of the possibility that AC s-risks could be net-negative. The following points are possible ways these mechanistic failures could occur.</p><h3><strong>Failure Modes of Science:</strong></h3><ol><li>Failure to solve consciousness.<ol><li>Failure 1: Physicality. Consciousness may work in ways outside known laws of physics or cannot be physically replicated by the simulation capacities of near-term technology. Another similar possibility would be scientists ruling that the physics of consciousness is too difficult to untangle without a super-duper-computer (this still could be solved with enough time so it might be more of a near-term failure)</li><li>Failure 2: Evolutionary/Binding.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem%23Summary_of_problem_3\">&nbsp;<u>The phenomenal binding problem</u></a> remains elusive and no research has come close to demonstrating non-organic binding or even the mechanisms of binding. Similarly, consciousness may require organic and generational development that can not be replicated in the laboratory; non-organic, single lifetime conditions. No current analysis of biology has revealed why or if that is the case.</li><li>Failure 3: unknown unknowns.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Failure to build consciousness artificially (even if consciousness is solved).<ol><li>Failure 4: Substrate dependent. Solving consciousness proves that it can not be built artificially.</li><li>Failure 5: Complexity Dependent. Consciousness is substrate independent but building the artificial body to house a simulated mind would require enormous amounts of resources, such as computing hardware, intelligence/engineering advances, power consumption, etc.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Failure to solve either.<ol><li>Failure 6: Collapse. X-risks occur and we lose the information and resources to pursue the science of consciousness.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p>The real question we should be considering here is: if we do nothing at all about regulating AC-precursor research, how likely is it that we solve consciousness, and as result are forced to regulate consciousness technology?</p><p>Now, let\u2019s frame the exploration as if humanity has solved consciousness and following this, have followed ACS guidelines to implement regulatory and preventative measures. The following points explore possible failures that may occur in this circumstance.</p><h3><strong>Failure Modes of ACS</strong></h3><ol><li>Regulatory Failures:<ol><li>Policy Evasion. It seems likely that even if severe regulations such as an international moratorium on AC were in place, individuals would still implement the blueprint. Even if individuals and organisations agreed to the understanding that the risks outweigh the benefits, it just takes one rogue organisation to skirt around some of the policies \u201cred tape\u201d and create a product which many people may seriously value.</li><li>Bad Actors. Consider sadists, sociopaths and machiavellian personalities who care extremely little and/or even get pleasure about the suffering of others. The blueprint may be easily accessible to such people on github or the dark web meaning individuals could simulate minds in the privacy of their own homes or even servers that they set up online.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Halting of beneficial outcomes<ol><li>ACS counterfactually prevents or slows the creation of net-positive discoveries (all else being equal) such as accurate well being measures, sentience devices and therapies for disorders of consciousness. (And safety concerns were unwarranted)</li><li>The ACS project was never necessary (this millenia) because the second scientific failure mode holds true over the next few thousand years. We determine too many resources were poured into ACS/Digital sentience which could have been directed elsewhere. &nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p>Now let\u2019s consider some successful scenarios where ACS would no longer be problematic.</p><h3><strong>Success Modes</strong></h3><ol><li>Posthumanism:<ol><li>The species can be trusted with artificial consciousness technologies because we no longer harbour the bad incentives that would contribute to artificial sentience capable of suffering.</li><li>Post-human society considers artificial consciousness creation abhorrent because the risks are too severe and no one would ever touch it, even with a +10 valenced pole.</li><li>Other forms of utopia eventuate: There is no need to create artificial minds because advances in biotechnology have led to post-scarcity, post-mortality and post-suffering modes of existence.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Regulatory Successes:<ol><li>A global moratorium on artificial consciousness holds strong for 50+ years and hopefully we find a more permanent solution (such as solving suffering) in the meantime. This was first proposed by Thomas Metzinger in 2021<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnufl248sur\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnufl248sur\">[11]</a></sup></span></li><li>International policing.</li><li>Internal self-regulation measures are implemented across all related research sectors.</li></ol></li></ol><p>It seems to me that the success mode most likely to be effective (in the near-term) to handle the risks is 2.a: global moratorium. Moratoriums have happened in the past and AC moratorium should probably be on the scale similar to germline genetic editing and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and autonomous weapon bans.</p><p>The scientific failure modes of 1 and 2 may be the most realistic scenarios we can hope for, and the negative outcomes [3.c.] will hopefully only ever exist in our fictions and nightmares.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Artificial consciousness safety could be a cause area worthy of consideration as a global priority. I think it could be an additional part of digital sentience. Though it could be supersedent, as ACS might be made more robust with scientific foundations and a broader scope of possible interventions.</p><p>There are a lot of gaps and improvements to be made in this cause area&nbsp;particularly around the mechanistic thresholds, and ACS policies. I wanted to outline my main concerns and claims for them to either be disproven or made more clear. Writing this post has helped me clarify my own thoughts around this topic and sufficiently helped calm the mind-worm that started it. It will continue wriggling though until a success mode or positive failure mode is hit, which feels a long way off.</p><p>Some of the feedback I worry about being convinced by is&nbsp;that my probabilities around substrate dependence are quite off and I should be even more concerned than I am; that would suck. Second concern is that I should have read more about digital sentience, strengthened this proposal, or made an entirely different structure because a key section is not coherent, new, persuasive or worth thinking about. I think part of this is likely because I have not written much before, this is my first forum post. Being optimistic, I enjoyed writing and thinking about this and I would like to continue to and perhaps other people will encourage me to do so. I\u2019ve included one good counterpoint I received in regards to the thesis as a footnote<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefto0npfrklvn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnto0npfrklvn\">[12]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>This has been a strange topic and proposal to write about, especially because it almost appears as if I am advocating for awesome fields such as neuroscience to stop frontier research (I\u2019m not).&nbsp;It does feel closely related to fears around superintelligence, suffering-focused AI safety and in particular the AI pause debate. Self-regulation of neurosciences may be sufficient before an AC moratorium. It remains unclear which significant discoveries will contribute the most to AC creation. At the very least, we should be careful not to assume that digital sentience is inevitable or net-positive.</p><p>Perhaps this is nothing to worry about and I\u2019m contributing to a kind of moral panic which is supremely unhelpful and counterproductive<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh02rhqkuzm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh02rhqkuzm\">[13]</a></sup></span>.

Feedback and discussion are welcome.</i></p><h1>Summary</h1><p>AI is a particularly difficult domain in which to predict the future. Neither AI expertise nor forecasting methods yield reliable predictions. As a result, AI governance&nbsp;lacks the strategic clarity<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk8l6qd8448\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk8l6qd8448\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;necessary to evaluate and choose between different intermediate-term options.</p><p>To complement forecasting, I&nbsp;argue that AI governance researchers and strategists should explore <i>scenario planning</i>. This is a core feature of the <i>AI Clarity</i>&nbsp;program\u2019s&nbsp;approach at Convergence Analysis. Scenario planning is a group of methods for evaluating strategies in domains defined by uncertainty. The common feature of these methods is that they evaluate strategies across several plausible futures, or \u201cscenarios.\u201d</p><p>One way scenario planning methods are differentiated is by how they use <i>strategic parameters</i>&nbsp;to generate scenarios. I use \u201cstrategic parameters\u201d to mean features of the world that act as dimensions of uncertainty relevant to AI governance. With only a small number of scenarios, it\u2019s possible to evaluate strategies deductively. Larger numbers of scenarios require more complicated methods.</p><p>Scenario planners for AI x-risk can evaluate strategies with respect to <i>threat models</i>&nbsp;and <i>theories of victory</i>. Threat models are descriptions of and proximal pathways to existential catastrophes.&nbsp;However, there are several challenges to specifying and using threat models. First, it isn\u2019t clear&nbsp;which threat models are both plausible and describe truly existential outcomes.&nbsp;Second, less-than-existential threats might still indirectly affect x-risk. Third, expected AI x-risk mitigation is not a perfect proxy for expected value.</p><p>Theories of victory are descriptions of and proximal pathways to avoiding&nbsp;existential catastrophes. There is much less existing work on theories of victory&nbsp;than there is on threat models. Theories of victory should likely be developed to meet certain conditions, such as 1) plausibility 2) action-guidingness, and 3) sustainability.</p><p>I recommend that AI governance researchers&nbsp;and strategists use scenario planning methods both to evaluate strategies as well as identify the right questions to forecast.</p><h1>The Problem with Forecasting</h1><p>AI governance has a forecasting problem. When compared with other domains, both experts and forecasters fail to reliably predict AI developments.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Expertise.</strong>&nbsp;AI experts disagree widely about AI risk and development trajectories.

Best practice when forecasting is to establish a base rate with respect to a reference class (a set of relevantly similar events), but there is no clear reference class for many AI x-risk questions. We can\u2019t \u2014 to take an obvious example \u2014 establish a base rate for AI x-risk by comparing how many times humanity has successfully navigated a transition to a post-TAI world to how many times it has failed.&nbsp;</p><p>Forecasting\u2019s success for AI risk-relevant questions is accordingly limited. As evidence, consider the 2019 \u201cForecasting AI Progress\u201d tournament run by Metaculus.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcvsp7txj2nl\"><sup><a href=\"#fncvsp7txj2nl\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;An analysis<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref27frll7vu7r\"><sup><a href=\"#fn27frll7vu7r\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;found that \u201cMetaculus narrowly beats chance and performs worse in this tournament than on average across all continuous questions on the site [...].\u201d</p><p>In a previous analysis<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7oc08mwolvn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7oc08mwolvn\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;of forecasts for a different set&nbsp;of AI questions, M\u00fchlbacher and Scoblic argued that Metaculus predictions did better than \u201cnarrowly\u201d beat chance, but agree that \u201cAI-related questions tend to be intrinsically harder than many other questions.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb7oy0p4hk45\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb7oy0p4hk45\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Metaculus does at least have a worse track record for AI than for other categories.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnff3a1eo8d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnff3a1eo8d\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Forecasting with experts.</strong>&nbsp;One way to explain these results would be that AI experts lack training in forecasting methods, and forecasters lack AI expertise.</p><p>It was perhaps in response to this dilemma that the Forecasting Research Institute conducted a long-run tournament forecasting existential risks involving both \u2018superforecasters\u2019 and domain experts.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxla6wcyteer\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxla6wcyteer\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, despite months of debate, the two groups\u2019 estimates failed to converge on AI risk-relevant questions. The report observes that:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe most pressing practical question for future work is: why were superforecasters so unmoved by experts\u2019 much higher estimates of AI extinction risk, and why were experts so unmoved by the superforecasters\u2019 lower estimates? The most puzzling scientific question is: why did rational forecasters, incentivized by the XPT to persuade each other, not converge after months of debate and the exchange of millions of words and thousands of forecasts?\u201d (1)</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, despite sophisticated efforts to elicit reliable information from experts and forecasters, AI remains a particularly difficult domain in which to predict the future. As a result, AI governance lacks the strategic clarity necessary to evaluate and choose between different intermediate-term options.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxaf5dm72fim\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxaf5dm72fim\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scenario planning.</strong>&nbsp;In light of the limitations of forecasting, I&nbsp;argue that AI governance researchers and strategists should explore an alternative and complementary approach: <i>scenario planning</i>. This is a core feature of the <i>AI Clarity</i>&nbsp; programs\u2019s approach at Convergence Analysis. Scenario planning is a group of methods for evaluating strategies in domains defined by uncertainty. The common feature of these methods is that they evaluate strategies across several plausible futures, or \u201cscenarios.\u201d&nbsp;Scenario planning can help decision-makers and researchers prepare for several possible futures, rather than banking on a single predicted future.</p><p>Scenario planning is a complementary approach to forecasting because it can help identify the right questions to forecast. An ideal strategy would work in every scenario, but it\u2019s more likely that any given strategy will work in some scenarios but not others. In that case, we will have to decide which subset of scenarios is more likely than the other.</p><p>In the next section, I introduce and review some methods for generating scenarios. After that, I describe some criteria against which AI scenario planners might evaluate strategies: <i>threat models</i>&nbsp;and <i>theories of victory</i>.</p><h1>Strategic Parameters &amp; Methods</h1><p>A key tool of analysis in scenario planning&nbsp;are <i>strategic parameters</i>. I adopted this term from Matthijs Maas\u2019 <i>Concepts in Advanced AI Governance</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrhgbij390hk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrhgbij390hk\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Maas defines strategic parameters as:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[...] features of the world that significantly determine the strategic nature of the advanced AI governance&nbsp;challenge. These parameters serve as highly decision-relevant or even crucial considerations, determining which interventions or solutions are appropriate, necessary, viable, or beneficial to addressing the advanced AI governance challenge; accordingly, different views of these underlying strategic parameters constitute underlying cruxes for different theories of actions and approaches.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>For example, a few commonly-cited strategic parameters are <i>timelines to TAI</i>, <i>takeoff trajectories</i>, and <i>difficulty of technical alignment</i>.</p><p>In addition to their content, strategic parameters can vary according to their formal properties. For example, a parameter might be a continuous variable (time&nbsp;to TAI), or it might be a discrete variable (paradigm of TAI).</p><p>Strategic parameters might also be more or less fixed. At one extreme, a parameter might capture a rigid feature of the world (for example, the relationship between general intelligence and agency). At the other extreme, a parameter might describe the status of active policy agendas&nbsp;(for example, the existence of international AI safety standards). This might also vary depending on the actor: a rigid parameter for one actor might be a lever for another.</p><h2>Generating scenarios&nbsp;</h2><p>The parameters I\u2019ve mentioned so far are by no means exhaustive. In fact, there is no one correct or appropriate set. What constitutes an appropriate set of parameters depends on the scope and methods of the research in question.</p><p>Strategic parameters are sometimes referred to as \u201cvariables\u201d or \u201cdimensions\u201d in scenario planning, and are used to generate \u201cscenarios.\u201d&nbsp;Scenarios can be defined as combinations of parameters&nbsp;set to particular values&nbsp;(though they often also include narrative descriptions).</p><p>One way scenario planning methods are differentiated is by how they use strategic parameters to generate scenarios.&nbsp;</p><p>In the simplest case, a scenario planner&nbsp;might consider only one parameter with a few possible values. For example, in his article <i>Scenario Planning for an A(G)I Future</i>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefseiut8v71n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnseiut8v71n\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Antonin Korinek considered three values across a parameter capturing timelines to AGI. The three scenarios he identifies are 1) \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d 2) AGI in ~20 years, and 3) AGI in ~5 years.</p><p>Another example of scenario planning across a single dimension is present in Anthropic\u2019s&nbsp;<i>Core Views on AI Safety</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy0rscm21aik\"><sup><a href=\"#fny0rscm21aik\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Anthropic considers the \u201cdimension of uncertainty\u201d describing the difficulty of technical safety across \u201coptimistic\u201d, \u201cintermediate\u201d, and \u201cpessimistic\u201d scenarios. Anthropic writes that:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOur goal is essentially to develop:</p><ol><li>better techniques for making AI systems safer,</li><li>better ways of identifying how safe or unsafe AI systems are.</li></ol><p>In optimistic scenarios, (i) will help AI developers to train beneficial systems and (ii) will demonstrate that such systems are safe. In intermediate scenarios, (i) may be how we end up avoiding AI catastrophe and (ii) will be essential for ensuring that the risk posed by advanced AI is low. In pessimistic scenarios, the failure of (i) will be a key indicator that AI safety is insoluble and (ii) will be the thing that makes it possible to convincingly demonstrate this to others.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>A slightly more complicated case would be to consider two parameters. In one common<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhm8c791m3y6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhm8c791m3y6\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;scenario planning method, two extremes along two parameters are combined to create four scenarios, which can be represented as a 2x2 grid. There\u2019s no need to consider only extremes, though: for example, we could combine Korinek and Anthropic\u2019s chosen&nbsp;parameters to create 9 scenarios in a 3x3 grid:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">&nbsp;</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\u201cbusiness as usual\u201d</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">AGI in ~20 years</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">AGI in ~5 years</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">optimistic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 1</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 2</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 3</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">intermediate</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 4</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 5</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 6</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">pessimistic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 7</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 8</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Scenario 9</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>With only a small number of possible scenarios, it\u2019s possible to deductively evaluate strategies across them all. As we continue to add more parameters and values, however, the problem becomes more complicated. An upper limit to straightforward deduction is usually around 4 to 6 parameters, depending on how many possible values each parameter can take.</p><h2>Examples</h2><p><strong>Hua and Belfield.</strong>&nbsp;Hua and Belfield hit the limit of straightforward deduction in their paper \u201cEffective Enforceability of EU Competition Law Under AI Development Scenarios.\u201d They select strategic parameters according to their role in evaluating the efficacy of EU competition law, and divide them into two categories: technical and non-technical.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Technical Variables</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Non-Technical Variables</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Key inputs: the distribution of importance among the input driving AI capabilities development (algorithmic innovation, computational resources, or data).

So, instead of considering combinations of parameters (with the exception of \u201cnature and relationship\u201d, which is really two parameters), Hua and Belfield evaluate the efficacy of EU competition law across each parameter separately.</p><p>However, one of the key benefits to analyzing parameters together is the possibility of combination effects. For example, consider again the 3x3 grid above. Separately, we might prefer AGI in ~20 years to AGI in ~5 years, and optimistic technical alignment to pessimistic technical alignment. But that doesn\u2019t imply that scenario 2 is preferable to scenario 3 \u2014hypothetically,&nbsp;if alignment is easy, then the expected value of TAI might be positive, and we might prefer shorter timelines.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefib2j7gp8lf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnib2j7gp8lf\">[14]</a></sup></span></p><p>It may be appropriate to consider only a small number of possible scenarios when planning for a particular actor (in Anthropic\u2019s case) or when evaluating a particular policy domain (in Hua and Belfield\u2019s case).

In the previous methods discussed, additional work is necessary to evaluate strategies across generated scenarios with respect to their effect on x-risk.

AI systems \u2014 as well as the organizations and societies in which they are embedded \u2014 are complex systems, which can exhibit unpredictable and extreme interactions. For example, automated stock trading precipitated a trillion-dollar \u201cflash crash\u201d in 2010.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj2fbjmd4uq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj2fbjmd4uq\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As AI systems become increasingly powerful and embedded in critical infrastructure, economic activity, and military activity,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmfolboc1fdm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmfolboc1fdm\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;unforeseeable accidents could have catastrophic consequences.</li><li><strong>Agential.</strong> Agential threat models&nbsp;involve&nbsp;the possibility that the goals of agential systems may not be aligned with those of their operators.

However, it also includes threat models that describe negative but not truly existential outcomes.

Determining which threat models are both plausible and represent truly existential catastrophes is an open research question. &nbsp;</p><p>Most discussions of AI x-risk consider a subset of this taxonomy.

This clear lead eliminates an arms race dynamic, and the leading nation is able to sufficiently invest in technical safety, or coordinate with other nations to end TAI development.</li></ol><p><strong>R\u00e4uker and Aird.</strong>&nbsp;R\u00e4uker and Aird<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref133qyawfrc3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn133qyawfrc3\">[30]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;taxonomize theories of victory into five categories, which largely overlap Hobbhahn et al.\u2019s scenarios:</p><ol><li><strong>\u201cA multilateral international monitoring &amp; enforcement regime emerges and prevents unsafe AI development/deployment.\u201d</strong> This theory of victory corresponds to Hobbhahn et al.\u2019s second scenario.</li><li><strong>\u201cThe US (likely alongside allies) uses geopolitical influence to prevent unsafe AI development/deployment.\u201d</strong> This theory of victory assumes that the US is able to unilaterally regulate AI. For example, the US might be able to successfully control the global semiconductor supply chain.</li><li><strong>\u201cLeading corporate labs come to prioritize safety more, coordinate among themselves, and implement and advocate for various risk-reducing actions.\u201d</strong>&nbsp;This theory of victory partially overlaps with Hobbhahn et al.\u2019s second scenario. It assumes that leading AI labs have the potential to effectively self-regulate.</li><li><strong>\u201cA single lab develops \u201cminimal aligned AGI\u201d and uses it to end the acute risk period.\u201d</strong> This&nbsp;theory of victory corresponds to Hobbhahn et al.\u2019s first and fourth scenarios. In an extreme form, this theory is sometimes referred to as the first aligned TAI system performing a \u201cpivotal act.\u201d&nbsp;</li><li><strong>\u201cHumanity pursues a diverse range of risk-reduction methods, ensures key institutions and norms are adaptable and competent, and \u2018muddles through.\u2019\u201d </strong>This theory of victory corresponds to Hobbhahn et al.\u2019s second scenario.</li></ol><p>Some of these theories of victory are more plausible than others. Additionally, some are action-guiding across scenarios (for example, developing strong international regulation), and others are only possible in specific scenarios (for example, technical safety is easy).</p><p>There is much more work to be done developing theories of victory. For example, theories of victory should likely be developed to meet certain conditions, such as 1) plausibility, 2) action-guidingness, and 3) sustainability.</p><p>By \u201csustainability,\u201d I mean that a theory of victory should ideally not reduce AI x-risk per year to a constant, low level, but instead continue to reduce AI x-risk over time. In the former case, \u201cexpected time to failure\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefniyfmnhk8d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnniyfmnhk8d\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;would remain constant, and total risk over a long enough time period would inevitably reach unacceptable levels. (For example, a 1% chance of an existential catastrophe per year implies an approximately 63% chance over 100 years.) If instead x-risk continued to decrease each year, then expected time to failure would increase with time, and total risk might approach a limit.</p><p>That being said, sustainability&nbsp;might trade off against tractability, especially in the short term. In that case, It might be best to pursue a more tractable theory of victory in the short term to \u201cbuy time\u201d to develop and pursue a sustainable theory of victory in the longer term.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Scenario planning is a promising complementary approach to forecasting&nbsp;in AI governance. I recommend that AI governance researchers&nbsp;use scenario planning methods both to evaluate strategies as well as identify the right questions to forecast.</p><p>Different scenario planning methods are appropriate for different scopes. However, the methods for smaller scopes \u2014 such as scenarios involving short timelines to TAI \u2014 are more straightforward, and likely more appropriate for initial research.</p><p>There also remains much work to be done selecting and developing threat models and theories of victory. I\u2019m particularly excited about work designing plausible, action-guiding, and sustainable theories of victory.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Acknowledgements: Thank you to David Kristoffersson, Zershaaneh Qureshi, Justin Bullock, Elliot Mckernon, Deric Cheng, and Justin Shovelain for feedback.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnk8l6qd8448\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefk8l6qd8448\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M2SBwctwC6vBqAmZW/a-personal-take-on-longtermist-ai-governance#Key_bottlenecks\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M2SBwctwC6vBqAmZW/a-personal-take-on-longtermist-ai-governance#Key_bottlenecks</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrvibkc33wm\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrvibkc33wm\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fncvsp7txj2nl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefcvsp7txj2nl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/ai-progress/\">https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/ai-progress/</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn27frll7vu7r\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref27frll7vu7r\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/x5Re9EKwGvAjZSmeb/takeaways-from-the-metaculus-ai-progress-tournament\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/x5Re9EKwGvAjZSmeb/takeaways-from-the-metaculus-ai-progress-tournament</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn7oc08mwolvn\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref7oc08mwolvn\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/16708/exploring-metaculuss-ai-track-record/\">https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/16708/exploring-metaculuss-ai-track-record/</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnb7oy0p4hk45\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefb7oy0p4hk45\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I\u2019m not taking a stand on the definition of \u201cnarrow\u201d.

But not all games are zero-sum showdowns. To understand <i><strong>non</strong></i><strong>-zero-sum</strong><i><strong>ness</strong></i> it helps to consider \"sum\" different types of <i>games</i>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>zero-sum games</li><li>positive-sum games</li><li>negative-sum games</li><li>meta-games</li></ul></blockquote><h3><strong>ZERO-SUM GAMES</strong></h3><p>... are where two parties compete and in order for one party to win the other must lose. The positive payoff for the winner in such a game requires an equally negative payoff for the loser, so that the sum of the payoff is zero, hence \"zero-sum\". Chess is as zero-sum game because players can't both win or both lose, so is soccer... or competitive eating.</p><p>There are also lots of <i><strong>common sense</strong></i> sayings that echo zero-sum thinking - \"You don't get something for nothing\" or \"you get what you pay for\" \"you can't have your cake and eat it too\". Like any well-designed memes, these sayings have survived because in many situations they are confirmed by experience, but not always.</p><p>With <i><strong>non</strong></i>-zero-sum games, while you may not get something for nothing, the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts.</p><h3><strong>POSITIVE-SUM GAMES</strong></h3><p>... are non-zero-sum games which result in win-win scenarios.

Take for instance those weird horned beetles you've seen, the Hercules or Rhinoceros Beetle or the Stag Beetle with its over-sized mandibles. Not only does the \"size of their horn\" matter for sexual selection, but also for asserting dominance over competitive males without the need for physical conflict.</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/msx9kszjk1bfa76svx5y\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/muw4barwiuukkt2ysvsz 170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/qo2ucowvmnfuodqgawam 340w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/nkytemg8cigk15qjvbqy 510w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/c4n9j3wctliq6lckq7x8 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/djnmtuvmuoyrsjdqqh6u 850w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/bphhjnqcqiezgkraflin 1020w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/lwb5ylgj5juiptm7seyv 1190w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/e0habgrzijaqarzejg4z 1360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/vvfn5nf6t5lgnuftxqrl 1530w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/66s9ovSk34XmbYgmu/ch5cd7ysk9vpwbrlqvds 1604w\"></p><blockquote><p>In fact even when they fight, these beetles do so without injury, generally by flipping their opponent off whatever branch they're on.</p><p>Humans also take part in elaborate exercises that help us steer clear of conflict.

Typically we have between 12 and 20 grantees staying at any one time, each working on their own project. Grantees stay anywhere from 1 week to 1 year, and benefit from a productive environment, communal meals, and opportunities to network, collaborate and learn from their fellow grantees. CEEALAR subsidises their stay, and even offers full bursaries for select individuals, meaning grantees can focus full-time on their work, without financial pressure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Who we look for</u></strong></p><p>We look for grantees who are committed to safeguarding the flourishing of humanity and who are ambitious, hungry to learn, and capable of working independently.

It aims to support 1) the global insect/invertebrate welfare research community and 2) relevant stakeholders to incorporate evidence-based information on insect/invertebrate welfare into policy and practice. The society is run and staffed by entomologists, animal welfare scientists, and ethicists.</p><p>Many researchers on the Forum are interested in invertebrate welfare. This post is meant to inform these stakeholders about the IWRS guidelines for use in their work. The guidelines are intended to help researchers already committed to the use of invertebrates (e.g., having passed the \u2018replace\u2019 and \u2018reduce\u2019 steps of the 3Rs). They provide guidance on how to further refine research programs using the best available evidence for humane practice. So far, the IWRS has focused on producing guidelines for insects and decapod crustaceans.</p><p><strong>The 2024 guidelines for insects and decapod crustaceans can be found&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.insectwelfare.com/research-guidelines\"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The insect guidelines (Fischer et al. 2024) are an updated version of those produced in 2023. They were collaboratively produced by animal ethicists, welfare scientists, and entomologists, and reviewed by a dozen entomologists from different sub disciplines before publication. As there are 1 million known species of insects (and 5.5 million species estimated in total), these guidelines are meant to be general and should be applied in a species-specific manner by individual researchers. The guidelines cover the central welfare-related issues associated with capturing, housing, and using insects in research, to include sampling, transportation, environmental conditions, nutrition and water, disease management, invasive methods, analgesia/anesthesia, release, euthanasia, and disposal.</p><p>Building on the insect guidelines, the decapod crustacean guidelines cover research on crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and shrimp (Crump et al. 2024). Decapods are a much smaller group than insects, with only around 15,000 species. They nonetheless encompass incredibly diverse body plans, and numerous commercially- and scientifically-important species. To reflect this diversity, the guidelines were written by eleven experts who work on various decapods and animal welfare/ethics. The recommendations broadly mirror those for insects, covering collection, husbandry, invasive procedures, and humane killing or release. Key differences in the physiology, life history, and neurobiology of decapods and insects means that there are significant differences in the promotion of their welfare, warranting two sets of guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>Please share these documents with anyone researching insects or decapod crustaceans, and get in touch if you have any feedback. The guidelines will be updated annually each January.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/bob-fischer?mention=user\">@Bob Fischer</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/meghan-barrett-1?mention=user\">@Meghan Barrett</a></p>", "user": {"username": "Andrew Crump1"}}, {"_id": "snseLSyneSNv2b8fP", "title": "Factory farming in a cosmic future", "postedAt": "2024-02-10T12:14:51.254Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Humanity may inadvertently propagate animal suffering caused by factory farming when we establish settlements in space because we are too confident in futures free of animal suffering. This could pose a significant&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/intro/\"><u>suffering risk (or s-risk)</u></a>.&nbsp; In this post, I aim to show that such confidence is misguided. I start by explaining why factory farming in space is (probably) worth serious moral consideration. I then present four common reasons for believing that humanity\u2019s future in space will likely be cruelty-free, and critique them as best I can. I conclude,&nbsp;<i>very</i> tentatively, that a future full of factory farming is perfectly plausible, and currently our default trajectory.&nbsp;</p><h2>Key assumptions</h2><p>I have made three assumptions which I do not defend in any detail here, and which I have taken for granted as plausible:</p><ol><li>We are sufficiently concerned with animal welfare overall that a graphic, gratuitous description of just how bad factory farming in space could be is unnecessary here.&nbsp;</li><li>Humans could one day settle permanently in space, and we will do so in recognisably human form (i.e. not as digital minds, and not \u2018post-human\u2019 to the point of no longer requiring food).</li><li>Tens of thousands of people (at least) would need to be living beyond Earth for factory-farming in space to be a realistic development. I don\u2019t know how long this could take, and I do not attempt a forecast here, but this might take the form of multiple Earth-orbital stations and semi-permanent stations on the Moon with rotating populations, for instance, or even permanent settlements further afield on or around Mars.</li></ol><h2>Epistemic status and caveats</h2><p><strong>I am about 75% certain that factory farms in space will eventually be technically and commercially feasible, if humans settle in space.</strong> If this happens, it will probably happen too fast for most interventions to interrupt it, and there will be new, strong incentives for factory farming to continue indefinitely.</p><h1>Why might this matter?</h1><h2>Importance</h2><p>Yip Fai Tse has estimated that in a future where humans settle throughout the Solar System,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bfdc3MpsYEfDdvgtP/why-the-expected-numbers-of-farmed-animals-in-the-far-future#How_much_is_at_stake__in_expectation_\"><u>there could be as many as a&nbsp;</u><i><u>thousand trillion trillion</u></i><u> vertebrates farmed and slaughtered</u></a> for human consumption. This doesn\u2019t even cover the insects, crustaceans and molluscs (and many more animals) we may farm in future. He wrote that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bfdc3MpsYEfDdvgtP/why-the-expected-numbers-of-farmed-animals-in-the-far-future\"><u>the spread of factory farming into space might be one of the most important considerations for future animal welfare</u></a>, and notes that work is already being done on feeding humans in space by farming fish and insects.</p><p>There may also be normative reasons to take more seriously the possibility of factory farming in space. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2020/05/31/suffering-focused-ethics-defense-and-implications/\"><i><u>Suffering-Focused Ethics</u></i></a>, Magnus Vinding argues that happiness and suffering are deeply asymmetrical, rather than arbitrary ends of a well-being scale that can be algebraically balanced or outweighed. This implies that while we may still have good reasons to focus predominantly on the wellbeing of future people (and future digital minds), we are not at all exempt from giving due consideration to animals in the meantime.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as Fai notes, if animal welfare matters less in the longterm because we can expect there to be many, many digital minds, we should expect human welfare to matter less, too. This is a deeply complex subject but it should encourage us at the very least to find a stake in this argument \u2013 how much can&nbsp;<i>we</i> expect to matter morally, if we\u2019re sure that&nbsp;<i>this</i> won\u2019t?&nbsp;</p><h2>Neglectedness</h2><p>The issue seems neglected within EA, however, and where it is considered, it is quickly discounted.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/\"><u>80,000 Hours have estimated</u></a> that \u201cthe scale of the problem of factory farming itself\u2026is small compared to the scale of issues affecting future generations. This is especially true if you think that factory farming is likely to end within a few decades or centuries.\u201d Their exploratory piece does not suggest reasons to think that factory farming may soon end, and does not explore the possibility of factory farming in space. In addition, EA user alene described the scepticism they encountered from some effective altruists regarding the future of farmed animal suffering, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JSEencwkDuwWzYny8/who-is-protecting-animals-in-the-long-term-future\"><u>the confidence that it won\u2019t be a risk worth addressing</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I address tractability in the Conclusion.</p><h1>Reasons for optimism, and rebuttals</h1><p>In this section, I will describe and critique four reasons for optimism that humanity\u2019s future in space will be cruelty-free. There are likely many more reasons for optimism than I describe here, and many more valid critiques thereof, but I hope merely to show that we probably haven\u2019t considered them enough overall rather than that there aren\u2019t good reasons.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Earth can supply meat products to low-Earth orbit, the Moon and even Mars long-term</h2><p><strong>Reasons for optimism:&nbsp;</strong>Pre-deployed food caches and uncrewed resupply missions are possible, in principle, for an enduring human presence on Mars. We can currently land on the Red Planet within a few kilometres of a chosen target, which a rover could reach without much difficulty if needed, and well-packaged dehydrated food could plausibly remain edible for 5-7 years after launch. We could probably also send components for a small indoor farm for hardy, high-caloric vegetables (e.g. potatoes, \u00e0 la&nbsp;<i>The Martian</i>).</p><p><strong>Rebuttals:</strong></p><ul><li>First, a commitment to resupplying interplanetary settlements means factory farming might expand on Earth, unless other norms change too. For our purposes, it matters less where animals are farmed and more that the demand for particular products has increased in line with our population and activities further away, to the detriment of animals.&nbsp;</li><li>Second, there are obvious risks to this approach such as launch failures, spoilage en route, destruction of food on landing, and caches passing their expiry dates before use.</li><li>Third, there will be strong incentives for human settlements beyond Earth to strengthen their own food security and reduce dependency on a fragile Earthbound supply chain, including from an existential risk perspective, and factory farming in space could be seen as a reliable source of protein-dense foods.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, this might work for Mars, but it is far less certain further afield. Given our current propulsion technology and the transfer windows between optimal orbits, a crewed mission to Saturn\u2019s moons and back could take well over a decade, requiring several metric tonnes of food even for a small crew. Keeping food safe and edible with reliable failsafes in place for this enormous journey will be far more difficult, even if we can get such payloads into orbit.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>2. Lab-grown meats and alternative proteins will render factory farming obsolete</h2><p><strong>Reasons for optimism:&nbsp;</strong>Lab-grown meat is a fast-growing industry that has seen a great deal of progress over the last decade. It is often portrayed as the closest thing to a silver bullet for ending factory farming, and limiting the long-term effects of intensive animal agriculture on the environment.</p><p><strong>Rebuttals:</strong></p><ul><li>First, lab-grown meat has only recently become available to retail consumers, at relatively high cost and in limited markets. It will need to pass through lengthy, expensive and time-consuming regulatory hurdles worldwide before it reaches major markets, and it is difficult to know how quickly this will happen (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65784505\"><u>Singapore gave regulatory approval in 2020</u></a>; the US and some EU countries are in progress).</li><li>Second, the technical progress may be much more uncertain over the medium- to long term. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\"><u>a 2020 report commissioned by Open Philanthropy</u></a>, David Humbird wrote that \u201cthe cost of cultivation facilities will always be too burdensome, and the cost of growth media will always be too high, for the economics of cultured meat to make sense\u201d (the full report can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://engrxiv.org/preprint/view/1438/2973\"><u>here</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li>Third, if lab-grown meat turns out to be commercially-viable to produce at affordable prices, it is unclear how competitive it will be against \u2018traditional\u2019 meats. We should expect this to be a political and cultural issue, as the agriculture industry is a major employer and enjoys preferential treatment in many jurisdictions, and some consumers may regard lab-grown meat as \u2018unnatural\u2019 (and therefore undesirable, unhealthy or outright harmful). Factory-farmed meat may be promoted as more \u2018authentic\u2019 than lab-grown alternatives, or supportive of particular political views.</li><li>Fourth, the necessary bioreactors and raw materials for lab-grown meat will have to survive the high-g stresses of launch and short periods of microgravity. Bioreactors have been tested in space at a limited scale, although fluid dynamics, gas exchange and cellular behaviours are difficult to control in these environments. While something similar can be said about transporting live animals into LEO space, bioreactors require maintenance, repair and access to Earthbound supply chains that will still incur major costs; once provided with enough calories, live animals are (unfortunately) the most robust, affordable and disposable infrastructure needed to produce commercial quantities of meat, eggs and dairy.</li><li>Finally, without improvements in propulsion technology, it will be just as expensive (per kilo) to transport alternative proteins into orbit as anything else. In the long-term, this may make lab-grown meat less competitive against fungal, algal and other alternative proteins that may be successfully cultivated in space. This could be deceptively important: if meat-free diets become the norm in space because meat is simply unavailable, sufficient demand may make factory farming in space commercially viable long before lab-grown meat. Humans in space may never make the switch.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>3. Transformative AI will render factory farming in space unnecessary</h2><p><strong>Reasons for optimism:&nbsp;</strong>A comprehensive assessment of the problems AI could solve for us is beyond the scope of this post, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\"><u>the opportunities and risks</u></a> of this technology are well attested elsewhere. In short, transformative AI could far outstrip humans in the quality and quantity of technological advancement and economic growth it could produce, including innovations in biotechnology and engineering that make factory farming in space undesirable and/or unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Rebuttals:</strong></p><ul><li>First, transformative AI would have to mitigate not only the technical challenges of lab-grown meat cultivation, but also the regulatory and political/cultural issues mentioned above. Transformative AI solving technically-challenging problems does not necessarily mean it will solve all relevant problems.</li><li>Second, transformative AI may also solve the engineering problems that make reaching orbit so expensive. This may make it commercially viable to quickly send meat products into space at competitive prices before lab-grown meat can compete.</li><li>Third,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-022-00187-z#Sec3\"><u>the impacts of existing AI already extend to factory farming itself</u></a>. This may mean that transformative AI makes it harder for lab-grown meat and other alternative proteins to compete on their own terms, as factory farms are already taking advantage of economies of scale not necessarily available to lab-grown meat companies. This could also extend to advances in genetic engineering that allow animals to survive and reproduce in low- and zero-gravity environments.</li><li>Finally, we simply do not know what transformative AI will be like. It may be possible to create digital minds which experience consciousness, which presents important ethical and legal considerations if we expect AI to work on the issues we care about. It may not be enough to solve the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#instrumental-convergence\"><u>alignment problem</u></a> without also answering important questions about the rights of digital beings (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-issues-not-just-misalignment-an-overview/#new-life-forms\"><u>Holden Karnofsky</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\"><u>Nick Bostrom &amp; Carl Schuman</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TeBBvwQH7KFwLT7w5/william_macaskill-s-shortform?commentId=RLMp7cHf9fdLuRSfe\"><u>Will Macaskill\u2019s intention to work on this</u></a>).</li></ul><h2>4. Norms will change in favour of meat-free diets and better treatment of nonhuman animals&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Reasons for optimism: </strong>We might welcome news that vegetarian and vegan dietary habits are on the rise (Google reported huge increases in the search term \"vegan restaurants near me\" in 2019), but these trends are not global, nor one-way: Statista reported in late 2022 that <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/28584/gcs-vegetarianism-countries-timeline/\">vegan diets declined in India</a> between 2018 and 2022, while Mexico and Spain saw very little change at all.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>First, norms are powerful, but malleable. There is valuable work elsewhere on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YC3Mvw2xNtpKxR5sK/phd-on-moral-progress-bibliography-review\"><u>moral progress</u></a>, the fragility of value, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/uk/\"><u>contingency of history when it comes to ending suffering</u></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2020/05/31/suffering-focused-ethics-defense-and-implications/\"><u>biases that prevent us properly understanding suffering</u></a>. This strongly suggests that we are not at all guaranteed to move en masse toward meat-free diets, or taking nonhuman suffering more seriously. A well-known example of counterintuitive moral regression is slavery, which was commonplace in the ancient world around the Mediterranean but had all but disappeared in Europe by the Middle Ages: its mere absence, however, was not enough to prevent the Atlantic slave trade.</li><li>Second, if and when we live on multiple planets, it might be even harder to change norms through discourse. Real-time conversations between Earth and Mars will be impossible, because one-way transmissions will take a minimum of three minutes at best (extending to more than twenty minutes when the two planets are furthest apart); two-way exchanges will take hours, making cooperation and convergence on controversial issues much more difficult. This gets worse the further from Earth we inhabit: for example, delays between Earth and the moons of Jupiter will take three times as long as those with Mars).&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>Why I might be wrong</h1><p>There are five main ways in which I think I could be wrong about factory farming in space being a worthy concern. I provide a brief response for each.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>We may not live long enough to settle in outer space at all, due to nuclear war, malevolent AI or some other existential catastrophe.</strong>&nbsp;This is true, strictly speaking, but it doesn\u2019t seem like a strong discouragement from taking factory farming in space more seriously. Nobody who works to reduce pandemic risk argues against doing so given the risk of nuclear war, for example, and other important work on the alleviation of absolute poverty and animal welfare continues despite these ongoing existential risks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>We may make a political decision to remain on Earth long-term, perhaps to reflect more carefully on the allocation of resources in space, or to heal the planet we come from before we try to settle elsewhere in the cosmos.&nbsp;</strong>This is possible, given the malleability of norms described above. Spacefaring states are already&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eandtbooks.com/books/the-future-of-geography/\"><u>competing for access to low-Earth orbit and beyond</u></a>, however, and the welfare of nonhuman animals should ideally form part of any discussion of how to govern ourselves in space.</li><li><strong>We may convert ourselves to a purely digital form, in which we are eternal, editable, replicable, transferable and free of the suffering imposed by (and on) organic bodies.&nbsp;</strong>Given the uncertainty of how transformative AI might unfold, this may be unavailable and/or undesirable for many people. It also raises more complex questions about a future in which humans, nonhuman animals and digital minds share the cosmos.</li><li><strong>We discover strong normative reasons to believe that humans and nonhuman animals are not worthy of the same moral consideration as \u2018super-patients\u2019 or \u2018super-beneficiaries\u2019, e.g. digital minds. </strong>I don\u2019t yet take a strong view here, but see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/digital-minds.pdf\"><u>Nick Bostrom and Carl Schuman</u></a> (p. 14) for how this wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean bad lives for humans and nonhuman animals. Even in a universe where digital minds have a much, much larger claim on the proportion of resources in the cosmos, we might still have good reasons to use our smaller absolute share to prevent suffering for nonhuman animals.&nbsp;</li></ol><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I have tried to carefully critique four common reasons for optimism in a human-led future in space, a future in which nonhuman animals no longer suffer in factory farms. My current best guess is that Earth probably cannot reliably supply farflung human settlements in space, and that even with the opportunities provided by transformative AI, we are at least marginally more likely to enable a future full of orbital and extraterrestrial factory farms, as one without.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tractability, and tentative next steps</h2><p>While I am convinced that this issue is more important than widely believed and significantly neglected, I am deeply uncertain of how tractable it is. I don\u2019t know how or when we might build factory farms in orbit and beyond, and I don\u2019t know when or how quickly we might have to transition from a long, thoughtful exploration of this problem to developing useful interventions.</p><p>It may be too early to recommend specific actions. The s-risk posed by factory farming in space is clearly a strange niche issue for most people, and it would be counterproductive to invite further scepticism, ridicule or effective resistance from relevant industries by proposing premature interventions. That said, I would suggest the following questions that readers may wish to consider, and even try to address, as we try to understand how big this problem might be, and whether we should make it a priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>What might the first factory farm in space be like, in engineering terms? What might this suggest about timelines for intervention?&nbsp;<ul><li>As an example, I imagine a highly-automated disc- or ring-shaped station in low-Earth orbit, rotating on its central axis with sufficient centrifugal force to generate \u201cspin gravity\u201d that mimics conditions on Earth. It would probably serve humans living on space stations and on the Moon, and possibly further afield. Similar orbital factory farms might also be installed in stable orbits at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point\"><u>LaGrange Point 4 or LaGrange Point 5</u></a> (Earth-Moon system), with less need for course-corrective fuel burns.</li></ul></li><li>What commercial incentives might transformative AI create for both settlement in space, and factory farming?&nbsp;</li><li>Are there ways in which transformative AI might help accelerate our moral progress, negating any incentives for factory farming in space?</li><li>What would be some early indicators that factory farming in space is closer to becoming a reality? When might be the right time to act, and how?</li><li>Could genetic engineering create \u201cmind-free\u201d animals without any subjective experiences that could be farmed ethically? Is this an effort worth focusing on to end the suffering caused by factory farming on Earth, and forever end the possibility of it extending to space?</li><li>How does factory farming in space intersect with other futuristic proposals such as terraforming, which could introduce wild animal suffering to the cosmos?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it possible, in principle, to create digital minds that are free from suffering? If so, why might a much larger number of future digital minds (in expectation) still morally outweigh s-risk from factory farming in space?&nbsp;<ul><li>I think this is probably easier to answer if one accepts prioritarian ethics, but harder if one accepts suffering-focused ethics, but I\u2019m not sure.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>I have largely relied on the work of Yip Fai Tse here, but my thinking has also been strongly influenced by Magnus Vinding, Tobias Baumann, Nick Bostrom, Everett C.

The creation of artificial consciousness (not artificial intelligence) will be the point in history when neurophysical developers become Doctor Frankenstein.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite digital sentience being broadly discussed, preventative approaches appear to be rare and neglected. AI welfare usually takes the spotlight instead of the precursor concern of AC creation. The problem has high importance because it&nbsp;could involve vast numbers of beings in the far future, leading to&nbsp; risk of astronomical suffering (s-risks).

The focus is on how events may play out from the finish of the seemingly benign scientific quest to understand consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:72.07%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aTAntnyw9fRrtpnLb/omymkltubfq9ohdg4d5z\"><br>&nbsp;</p><p>There may be an inflection point in as little as two decades after consciousness is solved when AC products begin to trend. Did we also solve suffering before getting to this point? If not, then this could be where negative outcomes begin to have a runaway effect.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Artificial Consciousness Safety</strong></h2><p>There are organisations dedicated to caring about digital sentience (Sentience Institute) and extreme suffering (Centre for Reducing Suffering) and even organisations trying to solve consciousness from a mechanistic and mathematical perspective (Qualia Research Institute). We ought to have discussions on the overlap between AI safety, AI welfare and AC welfare. This may seem like arbitrary distinctions though I implore the reader to consider the unique differences. How helpful would it be to have a field such as ACS? I think it would tackle specific gaps that AI welfare does not precisely cover.&nbsp;<br>I\u2019m not aware of any proposals supporting the regulation of neuroscience as dual use research of concern (DURC) specifically because it could accelerate the creation of AC. This could be due to the fact that there haven\u2019t been any significant papers which would be considered as containing an AC \u201cinfohazard\u201d. Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t on the precipice of it occurring. On the small chance a paper is published that hints at replicating a component of consciousness artificially, I\u2019ll be increasingly concerned and wishing we had AC security alarms in place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>\ud83d\udea9AC DURC examples:</strong></h3><ul><li>Neurophysics publications which detail a successful methodology for reproducing a component of conscious experience.</li><li>Computational Neuroscience publications which provide a repository and/or formula of a component of conscious experience for others to replicate.&nbsp;</li><li>Current Example (possibly):&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01069-w\"><u>Brainoware\u2014computation&nbsp;</u></a>is concerning because it may be on a trajectory that breaches the threshold of substrate complexity by combining the biological with the computational.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyk6k18r5yom\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyk6k18r5yom\">[5]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>These examples are flagged as concerning because they may be dangerous in isolation or more likely to be components of larger recipes for consciousness (similar to Sequences of Concern or methodologies to engineer wildfire pandemics).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffbptnba8fng\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfbptnba8fng\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It may be helpful to develop a scale of risk for certain kinds of research/publications that could contribute in different degrees to AC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How worried should we be?</strong></p><p>Now, what if we don\u2019t need to worry about the prevention of AC s-risks because it is not feasible to create AC? The failure to solve consciousness and/or build AC may be positive because AC s-risks could be net-negative. The following points are possible ways these mechanistic failures could occur.</p><h3><strong>Failure Modes of Science:</strong></h3><ol><li>Failure to solve consciousness.<br><br><ul><li>Failure 1: Physicality. Consciousness may work in ways outside known laws of physics or cannot be physically replicated by the simulation capacities of near-term technology. Another similar possibility would be scientists ruling that the physics of consciousness is too difficult to untangle without a super-duper-computer (this still could be solved with enough time so it might be more of a near-term failure)</li><li>Failure 2: Evolutionary/Binding.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem#Summary_of_problem_3\">&nbsp;<u>The phenomenal binding problem</u></a> remains elusive and no research has come close to demonstrating non-organic binding or even the mechanisms of binding. Similarly, consciousness may require organic and generational development that can not be replicated in the laboratory; non-organic, single lifetime conditions. No current analysis of biology has revealed why or if that is the case.</li><li>Failure 3: unknown unknowns.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Failure to build consciousness artificially (even if consciousness is solved).<br><br><ul><li>Failure 4: Substrate dependent. Solving consciousness proves that it can not be built artificially.</li><li>Failure 5: Complexity Dependent. Consciousness is substrate independent but building the artificial body to house a simulated mind would require enormous amounts of resources, such as computing hardware, intelligence/engineering advances, power consumption, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Failure to solve either.<ul><li>Failure 6: Collapse. X-risks occur and we lose the information and resources to pursue the science of consciousness.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ol><p>The real question we should be considering here is: if we do nothing at all about regulating AC-precursor research, how likely is it that we solve consciousness, and as result are forced to try to regulate consciousness technology? Or at worst, respond in reaction to AC suffering after it has already occurred?&nbsp;</p><p>I would have loved to have done further research into more areas of ACS but at some point it's necessary to get feedback and engage with public commentary. I\u2019m sure there are many other low-hanging fruit here around the AI safety parallels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let me know if it is the case that we should hope for the scientific failure modes of 1 and 2. Indeed some of the feedback received so far has been on how extremely unlikely it is that we will create AC. If that is true, does that mean we should stop funding research into brain emulation and cease discussions about AI welfare? Either way, I think we ought to consider ACS interventions in order to prevent the s-risk nightmares that can emerge from making up AC minds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnvegu8vf60li\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefvegu8vf60li\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>A good example of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_technological_development\"><u>DTD</u></a>/<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/differential-intellectual-progress\"><u>DIP</u></a> is Steve Byrnes excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ybmDkJAj3rdrrauuu/connectomics-seems-great-from-an-ai-x-risk-perspective\"><u>writeup</u></a> on connectomics.&nbsp;After writing this article I read Steve's post on connectomics and it seems that I have written a counterpoint.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fncazw7m6df94\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefcazw7m6df94\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/sentience</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnta2ysgzwclm\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefta2ysgzwclm\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>AC welfare is distinct from AI welfare because AC includes non intelligent, precursor states and strange artificial manifestations of sentience.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnedjn7qb9nt\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefedjn7qb9nt\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Aleksander, Igor (1995).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-59497-3_224\"><u>\"Artificial neuroconsciousness an update\"</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnyk6k18r5yom\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefyk6k18r5yom\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Dynamical Complexity and Causal Density are early attempts to measure substrate complexity&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001052\"><u>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001052</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfbptnba8fng\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffbptnba8fng\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Kevin Esvelt on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M6PK2ofyjBefdSApX/cults-that-want-to-kill-everyone-stealth-vs-wildfire \">bad actors </a>and precise <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/kevin-esvelt-mitigating-catastrophic-biorisks\">mitigation </a>strategies</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Silica"}}, {"_id": "MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr", "title": "How to Accelerate Your New EA Organization with Fiscal Sponsorship and Operations Support", "postedAt": "2024-02-14T12:52:42.684Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This post is primarily written for people who are considering, or are in the process of, starting a new nonprofit organization, especially those who are concerned about the operational aspects of running the project.

Fiscal sponsorship, in particular, may slow down decision-making and restrict flexibility around key tasks such as financial management, hiring, and traveling, due to the fiscal sponsor\u2019s governance process and policies.</li></ul><p>Due to the benefits and costs, <strong>fiscal sponsorship and operations support tend to have outsized benefits for newer and smaller organizations</strong>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>New organizations generally benefit more from the \u2018instant infrastructure\u2019 of fiscal sponsorship and find the limited flexibility less costly.&nbsp;For a new organization already facing a huge amount of other decisions, having some functional structure and process in place quickly and easily can be much more valuable than having it be perfect. &nbsp;On the other hand, organizations that already have an existing legal structure and tax-exempt status may not benefit as much from fiscal sponsorship.&nbsp;</li><li>Smaller organizations often benefit from operations support, where part-time contractors can provide expert capacity (or even coordinated expert capacity) across a variety of skill sets in a way that\u2019s more cost-efficient than a full-time operations employee. Conversely, a larger organization that requires more than several full-time operations staff may see less benefit from operations support as they are able to hire for more specialized operations roles internally.</li><li>New organizations may choose to start off utilizing fiscal sponsorship and operations support services to get up to speed quickly and then, over time, reduce their reliance on external support providers as they build internal capacity, scale, and expertise.</li></ul><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:55.29%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/pbhc2sawzq3yinypfmey\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/hfv0qkxee8wlppelgd1u 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/zfbmpdtdcif96juttqli 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/gttx5fmiiougvysbwmfr 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/zgadhcv5tjvfuasmsfw2 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/zakz31uoicrhzjiocgbh 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/hngxcvnjybrdmgditgkx 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/isrxbwzbjhkxybhtranf 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/bu2gukodrgkggqznmund 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/dayvxzsfg4p5gozieqbm 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/xn6pflguuqgviqszaxuq 975w\"></figure><p><i>Disclosures: </i>I have tried to provide a balanced view of fiscal sponsorship and operations support, but note that I work for Rethink Priorities\u2019 Special Projects team which provides these services.

For the fiscal sponsee (\u201cfiscally sponsored project\u201d), having a fiscal sponsor is like starting to build a house with the framework already in place. (Image credit: DALL-E 3)</p><p><strong>Definition of fiscal sponsorship</strong></p><p>Per the National Network of Fiscal Sponsors, fiscal sponsorship \u201cgenerally entails a nonprofit organization (the \u201cfiscal sponsor\u201d) agreeing to provide administrative services and oversight to, and assume some or all of the legal and financial responsibility for, the activities of groups or individuals engaged in work that relates to the fiscal sponsor\u2019s mission\u2026Simply stated, fiscal sponsors place responsibility for implementing programs in the hands of project leaders while ensuring appropriate fiduciary oversight.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcwuzqss04xi\"><sup><a href=\"#fncwuzqss04xi\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>There are several fiscal sponsorship <a href=\"https://fiscalsponsorship.com/the-models-summary/\"><u>models</u></a>, but I will focus on Model A sponsorship, in which the fiscal sponsee can leverage the sponsor\u2019s existing legal and tax-exempt status for fundraising and operations. In practice, this typically means:</p><ul><li>the fiscal sponsor accepts grants and other funding on behalf of the sponsee,</li><li>the fiscal sponsor has ultimate control and responsibility over the sponsee\u2019s assets and liabilities,</li><li>sponsee staff are hired as employees or contractors of the fiscal sponsor,</li><li>work visas, if applicable, are sponsored by the fiscal sponsor, and</li><li>the fiscal sponsor handles certain administrative work, such as bookkeeping, tax filings, and payroll (though this may vary by sponsor and fiscal sponsorship model).</li></ul><p>Note that in this type of fiscal sponsorship, the fiscal sponsee typically pays a service fee to the sponsor and does <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;usually receive any funding from the sponsor.</p><p><strong>Advantages of fiscal sponsorship</strong></p><p>1) Tax-exempt status</p><p>One of the primary benefits of fiscal sponsorship is greatly reducing the time and expense associated with establishing and maintaining a new legally compliant tax-exempt entity. This can significantly speed up the process for a new organization to launch and begin impactful work while realizing the benefits of tax-exempt status.</p><p>Obtaining tax-exempt status can be one of the single biggest drivers of cost savings for a nonprofit organization, assuming the local jurisdiction allows it and the organization qualifies. Depending on location, grants issued to an organization&nbsp;or personal account may otherwise be taxed as business or personal income, which could significantly reduce the net amount received. In addition to the tax savings on grants received, some countries (including the US) also offer donor tax benefits on donations made to tax-exempt organizations, which is a boon to potential funders. &nbsp;</p><p>2) Streamlined administrative setup</p><p>There is considerable initial infrastructure required for a new nonprofit organization, such as:</p><ul><li>registering as a charitable organization and applying for tax-exempt status,</li><li>establishing compliance&nbsp;procedures, such as completing annual federal and local tax filing,</li><li>setting up governance processes and creating and enforcing organizational policies,</li><li>instituting a financial management system and expense management platform,</li><li>implementing HR/people systems, centralizing communications, tracking travel and time off, and more.</li></ul><p>At minimum, a fiscal sponsorship offers the fiscal sponsee the ability to leverage the fiscal sponsor\u2019s legal and tax-exempt status, so it is unnecessary for the sponsee to create and manage a new tax-exempt entity. &nbsp;Fiscal sponsors also typically have certain policies and processes (such as requiring a specific documentation process for expense reimbursements) that sponsees are required to follow, which can simplify and streamline the setup process but also may limit the flexibility of the sponsee.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, to varying degrees, fiscal sponsors may allow (or require) that sponsees use certain software platforms, such as finance, HR, communications, travel, etc. This can save the sponsee the time costs of selecting and implementing each of these platforms, though this may also restrict the platform capabilities available to the sponsee. For example, a specific expense platform may be well integrated in the fiscal sponsor\u2019s workflow, but cause additional complexity for the sponsee compared to other options available.</p><p>While the limited flexibility can certainly be a drawback, it is often less costly for a new organization, which is usually already facing a huge number of other decisions. During the especially capacity-constrained early days, organizations may prefer having decent, functional systems readily available over spending the considerable time necessary to select and implement more ideal systems. This situation can lead to some short-term frustrations in the instances where a fiscal sponsor\u2019s policies and platforms are not a perfect fit for an organization (such as the previous expense platform example), but typically this leads to one of two productive outcomes: 1) the fiscal sponsee works out a reasonable compromise with the sponsor or 2) the situation becomes a learning experience for a future where the sponsored organization eventually \u2018spins off\u2019 and becomes a separate entity from the fiscal sponsor.&nbsp;</p><p>3) Reputation and networking benefits</p><p>Working with a reputable sponsor lends credibility to the fiscal sponsee. The association with an established and respected fiscal sponsor can enhance the perceived legitimacy of the sponsored project.</p><p>Further, well-connected sponsors often have extensive networks and can facilitate connections with others in their network. This could lead to additional funding opportunities, partnership opportunities, and connecting with other sponsees who may be facing similar organizational challenges.</p><h2><strong>Operations Support: Ongoing Expert Capacity</strong></h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:50.02%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/cgrqk7hv9rswnjarzrae\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/rdhdnzq4nwbywnijwetk 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/t8am0j1rqo6swtcwpmox 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/snlxqg4tj8w2whlvu9jm 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/ni7xvshtp4vurereh8h0 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/ijrtz7kbb7arucybk3vs 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/vthejgveq9claan0kxcq 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/juvgjlwrktwobweamz0b 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/jj6xtcjhqek8ka2gjzfk 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/fs7oafjn6w5qmosgleza 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/xam4wx1couo2azyn4jsb 975w\"></figure><p>Operations support&nbsp;can provide specialized, experienced support as and when needed. To continue with the house analogy, professional operations support is like having an experienced professional plumber, electrician, roofer, and landscaper all available to maintain the house, rather than doing it without help or hiring a single generalist handyperson. (Image credit: DALL-E 3)</p><p><strong>Definition of operations support</strong></p><p>Operations or operations management does not have a universal definition and has been attributed several descriptions, for example: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ra9Pt2JkEDnKW4jsc/what-is-operations\"><u>here</u></a>, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/\"><u>here</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ib6hy9v3FgigxMuMM/what-is-operations-management\"><u>here</u></a>. I will provide some examples of what I consider to be operations tasks for reference, though a precise definition of the term is not important for this post:</p><ul><li>Compliance: tax, legal, agreements, contracts.</li><li>Finance: bookkeeping/accounting, budget management, payroll and benefits administration, purchases and reimbursements, invoicing.</li><li>People management: staff policies and procedures, staff recruiting, onboarding and offboarding, performance evaluations.</li><li>Other work can include communications, marketing, event planning, and more.</li></ul><p>By operations support, I generally mean either one of these two things:</p><ul><li>Hired operational services, such as those listed above, from a company or individual as an independent contractor, or</li><li>Additional support provided by a sponsee\u2019s fiscal sponsor outside of the typical duties listed in the previous section on fiscal sponsorship.</li></ul><p>The range of operations support can be a single task or many tasks, and the depth of support may be occasional assistance up to full ownership of the relevant workstream(s).</p><p><strong>Advantages of operations support</strong></p><p>While the primary benefit of fiscal sponsorship is to provide some instant infrastructure&nbsp;and reduce the up-front time required before an organization can focus on object-level work, the benefit of operations support is realized on an ongoing basis. By outsourcing certain activities, an organization can free up employee capacity and maintain focus on driving impact.</p><p>1) Capacity and comparative advantage</p><p>A key benefit of operations support is the ability to add capacity for handling non-core tasks, which allows other staff to focus on their comparative advantage. Operating an organization requires a wide variety of skill sets and knowledge, and it is rare for even the most talented and experienced founding teams to possess all of the desired skills and expertise required to run all aspects of an organization.</p><p>Given that there are limited hours in a day, outsourcing certain operations tasks can help an organization focus on its core competencies. Hiring operations support should not merely add capacity to an organization, but add expert capacity from an experienced professional. For example, founders without operations experience may find it difficult to evaluate and hire candidates for operations roles, so an operations support provider can help the recruiting, onboarding, and ongoing collaboration go more smoothly. &nbsp;</p><p>2) Accessing expertise on a \u2018fractional\u2019 basis</p><p>In a simplified example, let\u2019s assume that over the next year, an organization needs 2,000 hours (roughly one full-time employee equivalent (FTE) in the US) of operations support across four operations functions: compliance, finance, human resources, and recruiting. The organization may choose to either hire one full-time operations employee or contract a domain expert in each of these four functions on a \u2018fractional\u2019 basis (500 hours each, or 0.25 FTE).</p><p>It seems likely to me that contracting multiple domain experts will be more effective and cost-efficient than hiring one full-time operations person. This is primarily because there are so few candidates who have expertise and experience across this range of functions and those that do are likely expensive and highly sought after. In my experience, organizations attempting to hire for an operations role that covers all, or a significant portion, of operations work often find that they need to either compromise on paying a higher salary than expected for a candidate that meets all desired criteria or settle for a candidate who lacks the depth and breadth of expertise that contractors would bring. Another benefit of specialized contractors is that they are often more efficient in their domain than a generalist, so it may be the case that the contractors end up billing for ~5-15% less hours (highly variable and speculative) than the 2,000 expected.</p><p>Hiring operations support on an as-needed basis for infrequent or short-term tasks, such as legal advice and event planning, can also supplement an organization\u2019s capacity in a far more flexible way than adding a new permanent employee. This flexibility may be particularly beneficial when the organization\u2019s operational needs may change frequently, which is often the case for new organizations as they iterate and pivot to find what works. While there is some friction and cost associated with switching contractors, this is typically much less costly than replacing or drastically upskilling an existing employee.</p><p>As a specific example of the fractional hire model, consider&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jitasagroup.com/\"><u>Jitasa</u></a>\u2019s bookkeeping services. Per their website, Jitasa services 1,500+ small nonprofit organizations (including several EA organizations) with 300+ employees. Jitasa\u2019s scale and internal skill specialization allows them to provide clients with comprehensive bookkeeping services - backed by a full accounting department\u2019s worth of knowledge and expertise - at a fraction of the cost of one senior-level full-time employee.&nbsp;</p><p>3) Compliance and risk mitigation</p><p>For small organizations that are not yet ready to hire for more specialized operations roles, there are additional benefits to hiring expert operations support for workstreams that require very broad and/or deep technical domain knowledge.</p><p>Assuring compliance in areas such as legal, bookkeeping/accounting, and tax requires specialized knowledge and expertise. Non-compliance can lead to significant setbacks, loss of charitable status, or even penalties for organizational leadership.&nbsp;All organizations should, at minimum, have reliable and experienced professionals who can advise on questions related to work in these categories. Hiring experienced operations support to perform most or all of this work can further reduce the risk of costly missteps. A few examples of what could go wrong:</p><ul><li>Signing a large contract with a major supplier or customer without fully understanding the obligations and liabilities could have major financial and reputational consequences if commitments cannot be upheld.</li><li>Misunderstanding accounting and bookkeeping requirements could mean that taxes are filed incorrectly, which could incur fines and risk losing the organization\u2019s tax-exempt status.</li><li>Inadvertently classifying an employee as a contractor due to misunderstanding relevant state-level wage and hour laws could lead to underpaying the employee and incurring fines on top of paying the owed wages.</li></ul><p>Even workstreams that generally require less specialized expertise may be worth considering hiring operations support. While recruiting and event planning may not require the same technical expertise as providing tax and legal advice, a poorly run hiring round or failed event can still potentially have serious legal and reputational consequences, which an experienced operations support provider can help avoid.</p><p><strong>Putting it all Together: Coordinated Expert Capacity</strong></p><p>To this point, I\u2019ve made the case that hiring operations support can free up organizational capacity and mitigate the risks of non-compliance. But this only works when the operations support provider - the expert capacity - has clear instructions, access to necessary information, and an understanding of the organization\u2019s strategic vision. For a service provider hired to handle a single project or task, this requires the organization\u2019s leadership to regularly communicate with the provider to ensure they have everything required to meet the organization\u2019s needs, which can include facilitating the information flow of relevant context between internal staff and other external service providers, as well as between them and other service providers. The importance and difficulty of this information sharing and coordination increases with the more people and parties that become involved.</p><p>To this end, the additional benefits of <i>coordinated </i>expert capacity can be realized by working with an operations support service provider that offers multiple operations services working cooperatively. The provider may even offer fiscal sponsorship in addition to this operations support across a range of workstreams.</p><p>I define \u2018coordinated expert capacity\u2019 as when a service provider has visibility across a variety of interrelated operations workstreams and can, therefore, internally collaborate across workstreams to optimize workflow and provide better service. This model can replicate the efficiency of an in-house operations function and minimize the effort required to relay information across various parties. <strong>Additionally, a service provider that offers coordinated expert capacity is typically&nbsp;better placed to be a strategic partner on operations decisions, compared to a service provider focused on the details of a single workstream</strong>.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:624px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MnecE9Y3SgMTfobCr/ukdhol17o4xg4wjc3nnw\" alt=\"\"></figure><h2><strong>Potential Drawbacks of Fiscal Sponsorship and Operations Support: Cost and Control</strong></h2><p>The&nbsp;biggest disadvantages of fiscal sponsorship&nbsp;and operations support are the potentially high costs&nbsp;and reduced speed and flexibility in certain operational decisions.</p><p>The costs of fiscal sponsorship vary depending on the sponsor, but are typically charged as a percentage of income (i.e. grant funding) and are often 6-10%, though sometimes more.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpueuuyfqpd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpueuuyfqpd\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Fiscal sponsors that also offer operations support will have additional costs on top of this, potentially as an additional percent of income or other fixed or variable fees. Operations support providers that do not also offer fiscal sponsorship usually charge an hourly rate or a flat rate by week/month, depending on the service and provider quality and experience. These fees may seem high to a new organization on a small budget, though it still may ultimately be the most cost-effective way to access necessary expertise and skillsets. It is also important to remember that these costs account for the provider\u2019s costs, overhead, and the flexibility of a short-term and/or part-time agreement. &nbsp;</p><p>A second potential drawback is the potential lack of speed and flexibility on certain relevant operational decisions, especially in fiscal sponsorship arrangements. Fiscal sponsors typically require sponsees to follow specific governance policies and procedures in order to mitigate potential risks. Due to the interconnected legal structure of fiscal sponsors and sponsees, a fiscal sponsor bears ultimate responsibility for the assets, liabilities, and risks for each of its sponsees. As a result, fiscal sponsors are incentivized to move carefully and to be risk averse, as a significant issue with one sponsee (i.e. a major lawsuit) has the potential to negatively impact the fiscal sponsor and all other sponsees that the fiscal sponsor supports. This may mean that a fiscal sponsee may have specific limitations in terms of how they perform specific activities, including, but not limited to:</p><ul><li>spending funds,</li><li>hiring employees and contractors,</li><li>traveling and planning events, and</li><li>when and how they \u2018spin-off\u2019 and become independent from their fiscal sponsor (this needs to be discussed and planned for well in advance).</li></ul><p>Hiring an operations support provider without fiscal sponsorship tends to be less restrictive than a sponsor-sponsee relationship, though the provider may have its own policies and procedures that limit how or when they can perform work.&nbsp;</p><p>It is critical to proactively communicate needs and ensure a detailed understanding of expectations before committing to a fiscal sponsorship or operations support agreement. If service becomes unsatisfactory, new needs arise, or the service provider fit is less than expected, it is important that these concerns are raised as soon as feasible. A reputable service provider should be able to explain where there may or may not be flexibility in their service model and collaboratively work toward a productive solution to any good faith concerns.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>In this post, I have outlined some of the key benefits and drawbacks of fiscal sponsorship and operations support. Fiscal sponsorship can provide some instant initial infrastructure and significantly reduce the time required for a new organization to start doing object-level work. Operations support provides additional expert capacity through access to domain experts on a part-time, as-needed&nbsp;basis, which can be more effective, cost-efficient, and flexible than hiring full-time employees for a small organization. Comprehensive operations support across operations workstreams, especially when combined with fiscal sponsorship, can yield further benefits from coordinated expert capacity. Drawbacks include potentially high costs and (for fiscal sponsorship in particular) some degree of restrictions to organizational autonomy.</p><p>Due to the benefits and costs, fiscal sponsorship and operations support tend to be a better fit for newer and smaller organizations. Newer organizations generally benefit more from the instant infrastructure of fiscal sponsorship and may not be as concerned with the limits on autonomy in the short term. Smaller organizations often benefit most from operations support, where fractional professionals can provide a wide variety of expert capacity (or even coordinated expert capacity) in a way that\u2019s more efficient than a full-time operations hire.</p><p>New organizations may choose to start off utilizing fiscal sponsorship and operations support services to get up to speed quickly and then eventually reduce their reliance on external support providers, once they create their own operations infrastructure and build the internal capacity and expertise to efficiently meet their operations needs.</p><p><strong>Finding fiscal sponsorship or operations support</strong></p><ul><li>Rethink Priorities (disclosure: my employer) is currently <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KSdGmBrsWcSEBAeXe/rethink-priorities-seeking-expressions-of-interest-for\"><u>accepting Expressions of Interest for new projects</u></a>&nbsp;for fiscal sponsorship and operations support (rolling basis)</li><li>Pineapple Ops: <a href=\"https://pineappleoperations.org/fiscal-sponsors\"><u>Fiscal Sponsor Directory</u></a></li><li>EASE: <a href=\"https://ea-services.org/\"><u>EA Services Directory</u></a></li><li>Impact Ops: <a href=\"https://api.impact-ops.org/services/\"><u>Our Services</u></a></li><li>Anti Entropy: <a href=\"https://www.antientropy.org/home\"><u>Services and Process</u></a></li></ul><p><strong>Additional reading&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Impact Ops Article: <a href=\"https://api.impact-ops.org/fiscal-sponsorship-incubation-or-ops-support-whats-right-for-you/\"><u>Fiscal sponsorship, incubation, or ops support?</u></a></li><li>Anti Entropy Portal Resource: <a href=\"https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/fiscal-sponsorship-1\"><u>Fiscal Sponsorship Resources</u></a></li><li>National Network of Fiscal Sponsors: <a href=\"https://www.fiscalsponsors.org/about-fiscal-sponsorship\"><u>About Fiscal Sponsorship</u></a>&nbsp;</li><li>National Council of Nonprofits: <a href=\"https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/administration-and-financial-management/fiscal-sponsorship-nonprofits\"><u>Fiscal Sponsorship for Nonprofits</u></a></li><li>Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Launch-High-Impact-Nonprofit-Joey-Savoie/dp/B09NGTB8YR/\"><u>How to Launch a High-Impact Nonprofit</u></a></li></ul><p>This post was written in a personal capacity and does not express the views of my employer.

Here I\u2019ll discuss ways to develop counterfactual trust in moral trade.</p><p>Moral trade requires two trust-based components: factual trust and counterfactual trust.&nbsp; Factual trust simply means that all actors believe that the others will do what they agree to do.&nbsp; In most cases, this is pretty simple, and may be established through traditional means.</p><p>Counterfactual trust means that both actors believe that the others would have acted in a certain way if not for the trade.&nbsp; Take, for example, the moral trade I described in my last post: Open Philanthropy\u2019s animal welfare (AW) and global health and development (GH&amp;D) teams agree to fund a campaign to get JBS to use slower growing chickens, improving animal welfare and slowing antibiotic resistance.&nbsp; GH&amp;D needs to trust AW\u2019s assertion that, without trade, they would have funded a campaign against Purdue, and AW needs to trust GH&amp;D\u2019s claim that they would have funded GiveWell\u2019s top recommendation.</p><h3>Basic Tools</h3><p>This sort of trust is much more difficult to build.&nbsp; The cornerstone is standard in any relationship: personal trust of the individuals involved in the exchange.&nbsp; While it's difficult for any individual to perfectly determine even their own counterfactual action, especially over long time periods, honestly sharing best guesses and personal beliefs will help the group determine the true counterfactual.</p><p>A historical track record can also be useful for determining someone\u2019s counterfactual action.&nbsp; If they\u2019ve been donating to a specific charity or set of charities for a long time, even without trust, a likely counterfactual can be established.&nbsp; A track record of systematic decision making is also useful, even if the outputs of the system are different over time.</p><p>The third component is a clear, systematic, and public process for determining cost-effectiveness.&nbsp; If different agents can accept that others have different philosophical components to their worldview, but similar epistemics, they may be able to agree about the cost-effectiveness of different interventions based on different philosophical assumptions.&nbsp; Even if the epistemics are different, trust that the epistemic views are honestly held and consistently followed may well be sufficient for trade to occur.</p><p>Partly \u201clocking in\u201d this process is valuable.&nbsp; However, it\u2019s important to leave room for adjustment in case there\u2019s a flaw in the process.&nbsp; There may be inconsistency in your preferences that leaves you vulnerable to dutch booking.&nbsp; Parameters may also be updated in ways you don\u2019t expect and cause the model to not fully reflect your understanding of the interventions.</p><p>There are perverse incentives in the creation of the cost-effectiveness analysis.&nbsp; Each worldview is incentivized to rate the alternative intervention as low as possible in order to decrease the amount they have to pay to get the intervention funded.&nbsp; Honest analyses will help trading partners find terms that are agreeable to all of them, since traders will not want to give extra surplus to other worldviews and may instead allocate all funds to their top intervention.&nbsp; This practice may lead to short-term losses, but long-term gains, once agents with the other worldview become more reasonable with their CEAs.</p><h3>Weirder Ideas</h3><p>An external evaluator could provide a service to determine a counterfactual allocation.&nbsp; This technique is used in California\u2019s program to verify offsets for their cap and trade system.&nbsp; Evaluators project a counterfactual level of emissions, then measure true emissions with the project, and finally find the difference between the two to determine the counterfactual impact.&nbsp; While there are notable differences between these two scenarios, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/cap-and-trade/offsets/offset-verification-guidance.pdf\"><u>technical guidance</u></a> from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/compliance-offset-program/offset-verification\"><u>California Air Resources Board</u></a> for evaluators may prove useful for similar actors in the context of moral trade.&nbsp; GiveWell also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2020/06/25/why-youll-see-more-matching-campaigns-at-givewell/\"><u>evaluates</u></a> whether matching donors are giving counterfactually.</p><p>Prediction markets could assist evaluators or be used on their own to determine the expected counterfactual.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the size of these markets and relative lack of reasoning transparency from grantmakers might be insufficient for good prediction.&nbsp; However, for a large moral trade with open information this suggestion could work.</p><p>Over time, a proper market could emerge in which actors offer different funding percentages at which to trade.&nbsp; The highest offers of one worldview would match with the highest offers from another worldview, thereby maximizing the moral surplus generated.&nbsp; Having known actors with trusted counterfactuals would be essential for making this market work, but public information on potential traders\u2019 profiles would help encourage that.</p><h3>Effect of Relative Cost-Effectiveness Estimates and Expected Surplus</h3><p>Relative cost-effectiveness estimates also affect the level and importance of counterfactual trust.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Estimated Cost-Effectiveness of Alternate Intervention</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Effect on Counterfactual Trust</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low (0-40%)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low cost-effectiveness makes it very easy to establish counterfactual trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Medium (41-80%)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Medium cost-effectiveness makes it relatively easy to establish counterfactual trust.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">High (81-100%)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">High cost-effectiveness makes it hard to establish counterfactual trust, since it\u2019s unclear if the intervention would have been funded anyway.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>In the chart I assume that both worldviews have equal estimates, but in reality, people with different worldviews will likely have different ones.&nbsp; The magnitude of these differences will be an important factor in determining counterfactual trust.&nbsp; For example, if people with worldview A estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of the alternative intervention according to worldview A to be 40%, but people with worldview B estimate the value according to worldview A to be 85%, people with worldview B may require greater evidence that the intervention wouldn\u2019t have been counterfactually funded and that people with worldview A are giving their honest estimate.</p><p>Possible levels of surplus also have an effect on negotiation.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Possible Level of Surplus</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Effect on Negotiation</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low (0-10%)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Parties must agree very closely about relative cost-effectiveness estimates to find surplus-generating terms.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Medium (11-25%)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Parties must agree somewhat closely about relative cost-effectiveness estimates to find surplus-generating terms.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">High (26+%)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Parties do not need to agree very closely about cost-effectiveness estimates to find surplus-generating terms.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>As before, I assumed that both worldviews have similar estimates of possible levels of surplus.&nbsp; In reality, this may not be the case, and differing estimates may affect negotiation differently.&nbsp; At any level of estimated surplus, parties may refuse to trade if they don\u2019t view estimates as reasonable, since they would like a larger fraction of the surplus.</p><p>The percentages in this section are somewhat arbitrary best guesses.&nbsp; More analysis of real moral trades and grantmaker expertise could help determine more accurate numbers.&nbsp; They will also vary based on the typical variation of cost-effectiveness estimates in a given cause area (e.g. despite low levels of surplus, it may be relatively easy to make gains from trade in the global health and animal welfare spaces as compared to longtermist work, since there\u2019s much better data in those areas, and cost-effectiveness estimates from different parties should be much closer.)</p><p>Here are some scenarios (listed percentages are the estimated cost-effectiveness of the alternate intervention according to each party\u2019s philosophical beliefs):</p><ul><li>6%/96%<ul><li>Low level of possibility for surplus means that both parties have to agree more closely about cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>High cost-effectiveness according to one view makes it hard to establish counterfactual trust, since the worldview assigning 6% relative cost-effectiveness to the alternate intervention may think that the other worldview might have funded it anyway, since 96% is so close to the bar</li></ul></li><li>51%/51%<ul><li>Low level of possibility for surplus means that both parties have to agree more closely about cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>Because neither view places the alternate intervention close to the bar, both parties likely agree that the other would not have counterfactually funded it</li></ul></li><li>40%/96%<ul><li>High level of possibility for surplus means that the parties don\u2019t have to agree closely about the cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>High cost-effectiveness according to one view makes it hard to establish counterfactual trust, since the worldview assigning 40% relative cost-effectiveness to the alternate intervention may think that the other worldview might have funded it anyway, since 96% is so close to the bar</li></ul></li><li>96%/96%<ul><li>High level of possibility for surplus means that the parties don\u2019t have to agree closely about the cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>High cost-effectiveness according to both views makes it hard to establish counterfactual trust, since they both think the other worldview might have funded it anyway, since 96% is close to the bar</li></ul></li><li>80%/80%<ul><li>High level of possibility for surplus means that the parties don\u2019t have to agree closely about the cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>Cost-effectiveness isn\u2019t so high according to either worldview that each party doesn\u2019t trust that the other would not have counterfactually funded it.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The key takeaway from the first part of the section is this: the lower the relative cost-effectiveness estimate, the easier it is to establish counterfactual trust, but the closer the parties have to agree on cost-effectiveness estimates of the alternative intervention according to each worldview in order to find a surplus-generating trade.&nbsp; More even cost-effectiveness estimates between worldviews also makes it easier to trade.</p><p>Because of this relationship, trades that involve more distinct worldviews may be more promising.&nbsp; Here are more scenarios, this time with three parties (listed percentages are the estimated cost-effectiveness of the alternate intervention according to each party\u2019s philosophical beliefs):</p><ul><li>6%/6%/96%<ul><li>Moderate possibility of surplus means that the parties must agree someone closely about the cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>High cost-effectiveness according to one view makes it hard to establish counterfactual trust, since the worldviews assigning 6% relative cost-effectiveness to the alternate intervention may think that the other worldview might have funded it anyway, since 96% is so close to the bar</li></ul></li><li>51%/51%/51%<ul><li>High level of possibility for surplus means that the parties don\u2019t have to agree closely about the cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>Because no view places the alternate intervention close to the bar, all parties likely agree that the other would not have counterfactually funded it</li></ul></li><li>40%/40%/96%<ul><li>High level of possibility for surplus means that the parties don\u2019t have to agree closely about the cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>High cost-effectiveness according to one view makes it hard to establish counterfactual trust, since the worldviews assigning 40% relative cost-effectiveness to the alternate intervention may think that the other worldview might have funded it anyway, since 96% is so close to the bar</li></ul></li><li>96%/96%/96%<ul><li>High level of possibility for surplus means that the parties don\u2019t have to agree closely about the cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>High cost-effectiveness according to both views makes it hard to establish counterfactual trust, since they all think the other worldviews might have funded it anyway, since 96% is close to the bar</li></ul></li><li>80%/80%/80%<ul><li>High level of possibility for surplus means that the parties don\u2019t have to agree closely about the cost-effectiveness estimates</li><li>Cost-effectiveness isn\u2019t so high according to any worldview that each party doesn\u2019t trust that the other would not have counterfactually funded it.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Ideal Conditions and How to Create Them</h3><p>The ideal moral trade is intrapersonal; that is, a trade that one makes with themself.&nbsp; It\u2019s usually easy to trust oneself, and they don\u2019t have to determine specific funding percentages at which the trade will occur, since all the money is coming from the same pot.</p><p>Another good condition is for the agents to be part of the same organization, such as Open Philanthropy or EA Funds.&nbsp; Each organization has different teams with different goals, but their high levels of communication, visibility into processes, and common backgrounds and empirical strategies may facilitate trade.&nbsp; Things do get trickier though, since a specific value within a range of surplus-generating funding values must be selected.</p><p>If you intend to engage in moral trade in the future, here are some steps to take today that can help you prepare:</p><ul><li>Begin investing in relationships with others that you might trade with in the future</li><li>Build a track record, including\u2026<ul><li>Conversations with other potential trading partners</li><li>Public writing</li><li>Donations or volunteering based on the values and beliefs you shared</li></ul></li><li>Practice reasoning transparency in your track record \u2013 share your values, beliefs, and how you arrived at them</li></ul><p>Because these factors are so important in establishing counterfactual trust, there may be incentives toward dishonesty that will enable trades with better terms in the future.&nbsp; For example, if I\u2019m an animal-focused person, I may want to rate alternative proteins work as relatively ineffective compared to chicken welfare campaigns, so that I get better terms when I trade with the climate-focused people to fund more alt proteins work.&nbsp; However, I don\u2019t expect this effect to be significant.&nbsp; Developing a track record with dishonest beliefs or donations one considers worse than optimal is very costly, and the marginal benefit from a possible future moral trade with slightly better terms seems unlikely to compensate for these costs.&nbsp; This question merits more investigation \u2013 I haven\u2019t run the numbers, and it may become a more important question in developed markets.</p><p>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/quentin-mot-1\"><u>Quentin Mot</u></a> for feedback on this post.</p>", "user": {"username": "Pete Rowlett"}}, {"_id": "YoFs89t5XewB6bmZ4", "title": "4) A Case Study in Pandemic Policy Failure: Covid-19 & Human-to-Human Transmission", "postedAt": "2024-02-14T13:54:25.291Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In earlier posts I argued that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DTswPWmkzMM7ZeeGq/1-pandemics-are-a-solvable-problem\">pandemics could be solved</a>, but only by using the methods of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2DSmBW9Ek4CSdAwpa/2-pandemics-are-solved-with-risk-management-not-science\">Risk Management, not Science</a>. &nbsp;I further argued that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HamikyPzJRbZ3edZT/3-science-fails-in-a-pandemic\">Science fails in a pandemic</a>: not just that it is an inferior or inadequate method, but that the method itself cannot function in a crisis like a pandemic. In these kinds of environments, a misplaced trust in science can do more harm than good. In this piece, I will present a case study from the Covid-19 pandemic which demonstrates the weakness of science as a decision-making tool. The WHO's delay in confirming the presence of human-to-human transmission was one of the most consequential mistakes in the whole pandemic, and yet, as this piece will show, it was entirely avoidable \u2013 had they chosen the correct method of analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Setting The Scene...</h1><p>It\u2019s the third week in January 2020. A novel coronavirus has been identified in China. Official reports suggest there is little cause for concern: local health officials are on top of the outbreak and there are no signs of human-to-human transmission.</p><p>Data from external sources suggests otherwise.</p><p>Cases have been identified in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the USA, and such diffusion would be very unlikely, were the virus not spreading from human to human (\u2018contagious\u2019). The conflicting accounts created a tricky situation for the world\u2019s policy-makers.</p><p>If the virus was <i>not</i> contagious, then the only people who would be at risk of infection would be those who were in close contact with the animal source in the Huanan Seafood Market (the presumed origin of the outbreak). In that case, the outbreak would be geographically restricted to Wuhan, with a handful of cases turning up elsewhere in China and perhaps even overseas if some of those infected just happened to have flights booked for the following weeks. The Chinese government would have some work to do suppressing the outbreak at home, but for the rest of the world, it would just be another \u2018one of those things\u2019 that only ever happens \u2018over there\u2019.</p><p>If the virus <i>was</i> contagious however, then all of that went out the window. With modern air travel, a contagious pathogen could be spreading on the other side of the world in under 48 hours. Given the smattering of cases already identified overseas, that process might have begun. In that case, national emergency protocols would have to be implemented immediately; workers and resources would need to be requisitioned for the task; every part of society would have to be informed and prepared\u2026 <i>if</i> it was contagious.</p><p>The difference between these two scenarios could not have been more extreme, and so the question of contagiousness took on monumental significance for the management of the outbreak \u2013 not to mention for the management of international relations, the stability of our societies, and the health of every human being on the planet. It was crucial that the world got the right answer, and sooner rather than later. The responsibility for answering that question, and the world\u2019s attention, fell to the WHO.</p><p>To understand how the WHO approached their task, we will analyse the problem from a scientific perspective. That is, through the lens of the scientific hypothesis test.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Scientist's Perspective</h1><p>When SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in January 2020, scientists knew little about its epidemiological characteristics. It was a novel virus \u2013 how could they? Lacking this key information however, they were in no position to advise the world on appropriate responses.</p><p>Adding to the scientists\u2019 difficulties was the precariousness of the situation, the significance of any conclusion, and the implications for the world and everyone in it. For any scientist facing that dilemma, grounded in the philosophy of hypothesis testing, the appropriate course of action was clear: wait for the data to accumulate and let it make the decision for you. Of equal importance: do nothing until then.</p><p>The question was too consequential for the analysis to be rushed. It would be foolish to panic the world over what could turn out to be a minor outbreak, and not least because it would elicit global opprobrium for the WHO. Why take the risk? Getting the right answer was key, so the WHO would take their time to ensure that they did. As per the hypothesis test, they would wait until the evidence was pointing conclusively in the direction of contagiousness, and only then would they inform the world. Until then, the null hypothesis of no contagiousness would remain their default position.</p><p>And so, despite many early warnings from Wuhan and abroad, the WHO continued to urge caution into the second and third weeks of January 2020 while they waited for conclusive evidence to emerge. It was not until the fourth week of the outbreak that they relented and the world was officially notified that the early warnings were in fact correct: this novel coronavirus was transmitting from human to human, the world was facing a truly global pandemic, and everyone was at risk.</p><p>To the risk managers watching \u2013 gasping in disbelief \u2013 it had seemed an act of almost deliberate self-sabotage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Risk Manager's Perspective</h1><p>Given that this was a novel pathogen, we knew little about it, which meant that every possibility remained on the table, because if you don\u2019t know what it is, then you can\u2019t say what it isn\u2019t, can you?</p><p>Since we didn\u2019t know how virulent it was, &nbsp;it could have been very virulent. We didn\u2019t know how deadly it was, so it could have been very deadly. We didn\u2019t know how effective our medicines and therapeutics would be, so it was possible that they wouldn\u2019t work at all. We didn\u2019t know whether it transmitted from human to human, so it was possible that it did \u2013 and very well too.</p><p>We knew almost nothing about the virus at that time, so it was possible that it could have been anything, including all of the above and worse again.</p><p>Or, it could have been relatively benign. Again, we had no way of knowing either way.</p><p>But at least we <i>knew</i> that we didn\u2019t know, and that was something (\u2018known unknowns\u2019). We knew that high virulence and contagiousness were possibilities \u2013 we knew that they were <i>risks</i> \u2013 so we knew we needed a plan for them. By the principles of risk management: <a href=\"https://pandemicprevention.substack.com/p/wirm-3-the-philosophy-of-risk-management\">if the risk exists, then you must manage it</a>; if it is possible, then you must prepare for it. This is how risk managers keep themselves (and the rest of us) alive.</p><p>So, as things stood on the 1st of January 2020 (the <i>1st</i>, not the 22nd) a risk manager would have determined that this virus <i>could</i> have been highly-infectious, it <i>could</i> have been highly-virulent, and it <i>could</i> have been very efficient at transmitting from human to human. These <i>risks</i> would have been clear, and therefore the need for an immediate <i>risk management</i> response would have been too.</p><p>From the very first day of this outbreak, the risk manager would have seen the need for urgent action. Instead, three weeks later, the scientists at the WHO were still sitting on their hands waiting for the data to make the decision for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Science Fails Again</h1><p>In science, the null hypothesis is of no effect: there no difference between the variables in question, there is no relationship between them, nothing going on. The base case assumption is always the ignorance of the status quo, and we need overwhelming evidence to convince ourselves otherwise. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020, the WHO\u2019s base case assumption was that there was no contagiousness, and it took until the 4<sup>th</sup> week of January before it became impossible for them to continue to deny the awful reality of the situation.</p><p>This may have been the \u2018scientific\u2019 thing to do, but the delay was catastrophic for the world. By the time we had discovered the pathogen, it had already been given a 10+ week head start on us, and the WHO\u2019s unnecessary deliberations cost us at least another couple of weeks. Given that the outbreak could have been tripling in size every week at that time (and some estimates put that growth rate at 4x) this was equivalent to allowing the outbreak to increase by a factor of 10 or more while they waited. It's hard enough playing catch up with a PPP at the best of times, but it's near impossible when the WHO take so long to get out of first gear.</p><p>Had the risk managers been in charge, things would have been different.</p><p>The risk managers would have responded to the threat much quicker than the scientists because they only need confirmation of the <i>risk</i> to act, not overwhelming evidence that the risk has materialised. The mere existence a novel pathogen circulating in Wuhan was all the risk managers needed to know to justify an immediate response. Had the world applied their method of analysis to the question of contagiousness, the outbreak would have been 1/10th or even 1/30th of the size at the time, and a much easier problem to solve.&nbsp;</p><p>With the full benefit of hindsight, an immediate and forceful response on the 1st of January was the optimal course of action. As I have argued above, the risk managers would have provided it. It is a matter of fact that the scientists could not. The key takeaway is that risk management can be orders of magnitude more effective than science at guiding decision-making in situations like these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Type 1 vs Type 2 Errors</h1><p>The scientists and the risk managers are effectively testing the same hypotheses against the same datasets, but when we move from the scientific method to risk management, the null and the alternative hypotheses swap. For the scientist, the null is inaction and the alternative is action. For risk managers it is the reverse. The scientist needed proof that it was contagious to act, whereas the risk manager needed proof that it <i>wasn\u2019t</i> contagious to <i>stop</i> acting.</p><p>In Science, it is worse to believe something that isn\u2019t true (Type 1 error) than it is to <i>not</i> believe something that <i>is</i> true (Type 2 error) as anything built on falsity will eventually collapse, while the truth may yet be discovered another day. The same logic applies to criminal trials with the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence until proven guilty (in liberal societies at least).</p><p>In a pandemic however, the asymmetry in the errors flips. When the thing in question is a threat (a pathogen, wild animal, or storm) then the greater risk is in the Type 2 error: doing too little too late, not too much too soon. If it is possible that something very bad could happen, then you must prepare for that scenario, even if it is only a possibility. Over-protect yourself and you have wasted some resources; under-protect yourself and you die.</p><p>We know this already, which is why we put our seatbelts on before we start the car, install fire-doors during the building\u2019s construction, and save funds for a rainy day. We don't know whether the bad thing will happen, but we protect ourselves in advance, just in case. These are all forms of risk management, and they are so common and so deeply engrained in our culture that we hardly think about them anymore.</p><p>And yet the \u2018scientific\u2019 approach to epidemic control ignores this logic. The scientific method can\u2019t deal with contingencies \u2013 that\u2019s not what it\u2019s designed to do. Science\u2019s purpose is to know what can know for sure, but in a crisis, this need for certainty can yield the worst possible outcome: overlooking risks until it is too late to do anything about them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The WHO\u2019s mistakes in the early stages of the outbreak perfectly demonstrate both the failure the scientific method in a crisis, and the superiority of risk management (aka decision making under uncertainty) in volatile, uncertain, and dangerous environments. It also shows us what could have been, and how we could do better next time.</p><p>The WHO's reluctant admission of human-to-human transmission on the 22nd of January was met with a flurry of border control policies, all over the world. This demonstrates the significance of the announcement and it also shows us that the nations of the world were paying attention to it. Had the risk managers been in charge, they would have recognised the problem sooner, the world would have responded sooner and more forcefully too, and health outcomes would have been better for everyone. Instead, the WHO tried to do science and\u2026 well, the rest is history.</p><p>Sadly, this faulty approach is so pervasive among the scientists in the WHO, that they made the same mistake when delaying the declaration of a PHEIC in January 2020, and again in the official declaration of a pandemic in March 2020. Too slow, too late, again and again. We simply cannot solve the problem of pandemics with this thinking. On the contrary, it will sleep walk us into one catastrophe after another.</p><p>If we are to protect humanity from PPPs \u2013 whether naturally occurring, lab leaks, engineered, bioweapons, bioterrorism, or any other \u2013 a wholesale change in philosophy will be required. We must let go of our implicit assumption that science is omnipotent and scientists infallible, or that the solution to pandemics can be found in a novel compound or a new piece of technology. Instead, we must recognise and embrace the inherent uncertainty of these problems, and with it, <a href=\"https://pandemicprevention.substack.com/p/wirm-1-risks\">the philosophy of risk</a> and <a href=\"https://pandemicprevention.substack.com/p/wirm-4-the-practice-of-risk-management\">the practice of risk management</a>.</p>", "user": {"username": "PandemicRiskMan"}}, {"_id": "dM93vHvLTgpk8pLSX", "title": "Celebrating Benjamin Lay (died on this day 265 years ago)", "postedAt": "2024-02-08T14:33:24.739Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Quaker &nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Lay\"><u>Benjamin Lay</u></a> died exactly 265 years ago today (on February 8, 1759).

Here are some examples:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>1738: At the biggest event of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, Lay showed up in a great coat and waited his turn to speak. When the time came, Lay rose and announced in a \u201cbooming\u201d voice: \u201cOh all you Negro masters who are contentedly holding your fellow creatures in a state of slavery, . . . you might as well throw off the plain coat as I do.\u201d He then threw off his coat, revealing that he was dressed in a military uniform and holding a sword and a book: \u201cIt would be as justifiable in the sight of the Almighty, who beholds and respects all nations and colours of men with an equal regard, if you should thrust a sword through their hearts as I do through this book!\u201d When Lay plunged his sword through the book, it started gushing red liquid. In preparation for the event, Lay had hollowed out the book and inserted an animal bladder filled with bright red pokeberry juice. As he finished speaking, he splattered the fake blood on the slave owners present. (Apparently the room exploded into chaos and he was eventually carried out.) (Compiled from <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/quaker-comet-greatest-abolitionist-never-heard-180964401/\"><i><u>Smithsonian</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;and </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/what-we-owe-the-future\"><i><u>WWOTF</u></i></a>)</li><li>One Sunday morning he stood at a gateway to the Quaker meetinghouse, knowing all Friends would pass his way. He left \u201chis right leg and foot entirely uncovered\u201d and thrust them into the snow. Like the ancient philosopher Diogenes, who also trod barefoot in snow, he again sought to shock his contemporaries into awareness. One Quaker after another took notice and urged him not to expose himself to the freezing cold lest he get sick. He replied, \u201cAh, you pretend compassion for me but you do not feel for the poor slaves in your \ufb01elds, who go all winter half clad.\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/quaker-comet-greatest-abolitionist-never-heard-180964401/\"><i><u>Smithsonian</u></i></a>)</li><li>\u201cBenjamin gave no peace\u201d to slave owners, the 19th-century radical Quaker Isaac Hopper recalled hearing as a child. \u201cAs sure as any character attempted to speak to the business of the meeting, he would start to his feet and cry out, \u2018There\u2019s another negro-master!\u2019\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/quaker-comet-greatest-abolitionist-never-heard-180964401/\"><i><u>Smithsonian</u></i></a>)</li><li>\u2026ministers and elders had him removed from one gathering after another. Indeed they appointed a \u201cconstabulary\u201d to keep him out of meetings all around Philadelphia, and even that wasn\u2019t enough. After he was tossed into the street one rainy day, he returned to the main door of the meetinghouse and lay down in the mud, requiring every person leaving the meeting to step over his body.

One day, he persuaded the neighbors\u2019 6-year old son to his home and amused him there all day. As evening came, the boy\u2019s parents became extremely concerned. Lay noticed them running around outside in a desperate search, and he innocently inquired about what they were doing. When the parents explained in panic that their son was missing, Lay replied: <i>Your child is safe in my house, and you may now conceive of the sorrow you inflict upon the parents of the negroe girl you hold in slavery, for she was torn from them by avarice. </i>(<a href=\"https://www.swarthmore.edu/bulletin/archive/winter-2018-issue-ii-volume-cxv/fearless-and-fiery.html\"><i><u>Swarthmore College Bulletin</u></i></a>)</li><li>In 1742, the 61-year-old Lay set up a table on a busy Philadelphia street<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdpyu87p6dfe\"><sup><a href=\"#fndpyu87p6dfe\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and laid out delicate cups and saucers (previously owned by his wife Sarah).

He had a form of dwarfism and, as an adult, stood at a bit over four feet tall and had a hunched back (he called himself \u201cLittle Benjamin\u201d). He was briefly a shepherd as a teenager, then an apprentice <a href=\"https://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/14n1a2.pdf\"><u>glover</u></a>&nbsp;until he ran away to London to become a sailor when he was 21. During his twelve years as a sailor, Lay heard a lot about the slave trade from other sailors.</p><p>This was also when he met his wife Sarah. <strong>Sarah Lay </strong>(born Sarah Smith in 1677) had become a Quaker in her youth and was a minister of the congregation by 1712. Like Benjamin, she also had dwarfism. Various sources describe her as intelligent and charismatic, and she was respected as a minister (even later, when her husband was being denied membership by various groups \u2014 despite her own abolitionist activities). Benjamin spent five years courting her before she agreed to marry him in 1717. (Sadly, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41947343\"><u>not very much is written about Sarah</u></a>.)</p><p>In 1718, the couple moved to Barbados,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefke3dmrnuxhk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnke3dmrnuxhk\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;where they set up a profitable shop. They soon discovered the ugly side of Barbados; the primary business, sugar, depending heavily on brutal exploitation of enslaved people. The Lays witnessed the cruelties of slavery first-hand,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw1ql9mys4rm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw1ql9mys4rm\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and started seeking out enslaved people\u2019s stories, inviting them to their house for food and prayer meetings, and preaching against slavery. (According to Benjamin\u2019s book, Sarah initiated some of these activities.) By the time the Lays left Barbados a &nbsp;year and a half later, the local ruling class had begun preparing to banish them for \u201cfraternization\u201d with the enslaved. The couple went to London, but were soon expelled from the Devonshire House Monthly Meeting and moved to Colchester, which had a meeting house friendlier to their values.</p><p>In 1732, they moved again, this time to Philadelphia.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref79i1p0jkboa\"><sup><a href=\"#fn79i1p0jkboa\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;When the Lays arrived, they were disturbed to find that many Quakers (especially Quaker leaders) owned slaves. They also saw the harassment faced by a fellow anti-slavery advocate, Ralph Sandiford, who had published <a href=\"http://medicolegal.tripod.com/sandiford.htm\"><i><u>A Brief Examination of the Practice of the Times</u></i></a>&nbsp;without permission, for which he was persecuted to the point that he suffered a nervous breakdown. Benjamin Lay was Sandiford\u2019s friend until his death in 1733 and seems to have been outraged at the posthumous disparagement Sandiford was subjected to. Benjamin\u2019s anti-slavery advocacy became more disruptive. He became known for these actions and started facing his own persecution, which might have been the reason for the couple\u2019s move to a nearby town (Abington, which was home to Sarah\u2019s friend and fellow Quaker missionary Susanna Morris).</p><p>Then in 1735, Sarah suddenly died. Benjamin was very affected by this and accused one of his enemies of contributing to her illness and death. He seems to have become more confrontational after Sarah\u2019s death, and eventually he was denied membership in the Pennsylvania Monthly Meeting and the Abington Monthly Meeting. He also started writing.</p><p>In 1738, Benjamin Lay published <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/66038906/\"><i><u>All Slave-Keepers that Keep the Innocent in Bondage, Apostates</u></i></a>, one of the first anti-slavery books ever published in North America (printed and edited by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Lay%23Friendship_with_Benjamin_Franklin\"><u>Benjamin Franklin</u></a>, who apparently treasured his friendship with Lay and was proud of his work on the book). The text describes abuses enslaved people endured and discusses the theological justifications for declaring slavery a great sin. It also directly accused many elders and/or wealthy Quakers who accepted or participated in the practice of owning and trading slaves. (See a number of excerpts in this footnote.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjnedp49er8p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjnedp49er8p\">[6]</a></sup></span>) The Quaker Board of Overseers, which vetted all publications<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsy189gra72j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsy189gra72j\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;in Pennsylvania and consisted significantly or entirely of slave-owners, naturally issued an official condemnation of the book, saying that it \u201ccontains gross Abuses, not only against some of their Members in particular, but against the whole Society.\u201d They also declared that Lay was not \u201cof their religious Community.\u201d (As far as I can tell, he did not stop protesting at their meetings.)</p><p>Lay built himself a comfortable cottage in a cave. He also stopped consuming products he believed were immoral. This included refusing to eat animal flesh (animals were \u201cGod\u2019s creatures\u201d) and making his own clothes to avoid commodities produced by slave labor and animals. He continued meeting with abolitionists around the colonies and protesting slave holders, but his health began to give out and he spent the last two years of his life taking visitors in his cave.</p><p>In 1758, he got good news about the first Quaker ruling on the immorality of slavery; against the wishes of its leadership, the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting had voted that any Quaker who traded in slaves would be disciplined and eventually disowned. Lay apparently went silent after hearing the news, then said: \u201cThanksgiving and praise be rendered unto the Lord God. [...] I can now die in peace.\u201d He died a year later, at the age of 77.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:702.5px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dM93vHvLTgpk8pLSX/vlnbacs9spy9ogi3dscg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><i>Gravestone of Benjamin and Sarah Lay. </i><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gravestone_of_Benjamin_Lay_and_Sarah_Lay.png\"><i><u>Source.</u></i></a></figcaption></figure><h1>Role in the broader abolition movement</h1><p>It\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6Tfcxh2jzzZc5gfDA/joshcmorrison-s-quick-takes?commentId%3DLsbB4Qm3Hvhkqkgbb\"><u>really hard</u></a>&nbsp;for me to evaluate Benjamin and Sarah Lay\u2019s impact (I\u2019ll focus on Benjamin here, as I\u2019ve read more about him).</p><p>My overall sense<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpfnkziksv5i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpfnkziksv5i\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;is:</p><ul><li>Moral change seems to have been important for the abolition of slavery, and it might not have happened without key events/factors/actions (or it might have taken much longer):<ul><li>Slavery was seen as morally permissible throughout many/most periods and civilizations, including by influential philosophers and thinkers (e.g. Aristotle, Kant), and while we might hope that there\u2019s a \u201cmarch of moral progress\u201d that would have made abolition inevitable, it\u2019s not clear how long it would have taken without some key events around the 17th-19th centuries, and the evidence doesn\u2019t even seem to support a very consistent trend.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6jv69549mxd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6jv69549mxd\">[9]</a></sup></span></li><li>Moreover, economic factors don\u2019t seem to explain the abolition of slavery.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdj3m40388b9\"><sup><a href=\"#fndj3m40388b9\">[10]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li><li>Benjamin Lay\u2019s activism had a significant influence on the Quaker abolitionist movement.<ul><li>A generational shift might have been underway among the Quakers, but it seems that Lay might have made the unacceptability of slavery a much more salient topic and catalyzed action on this front (he was certainly noticed and discussed).

From <a href=\"https://headstuff.org/culture/history/terrible-people-from-history/benjamin-lay-quaker-abolitionist/\"><u>this</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Marriage wasn\u2019t that straightforward, though. As a Quaker he needed a certificate declaring his eligibility for marriage from his own meeting house (the Devonshire House Monthly Meeting in London). He didn\u2019t have any of the disqualifying conditions; he was neither already married nor in debt. But his opinionated mind, and his willingness to speak those opinions, had made him enemies of ministers in the meeting house that he had argued with. So he decided to think laterally, and took a job on a ship heading to the British colony of Massachusetts. There he asked the local meeting house to give him a certificate. They wrote to London, and though they did agree that the certificate should be issued they asked for it to include a passage exhorting him to \u201clowliness of mind\u201d and to behave himself peaceably in church. Of course Benjamin didn\u2019t do this, and so they refused to give him the official copy of the marriage certificate from Massachusetts. Benjamin had to appeal to the London Quarterly Meeting, a committee overseeing all the Quakers in the city, for assistance. They condemned his conduct but agreed that the DHMM should not withhold the certificate. So finally in July of 1718 he and Sarah were married. Two months later, with tensions still lingering, they left London and moved to Barbados.</p></blockquote></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnw1ql9mys4rm\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefw1ql9mys4rm\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>From <i>What We Owe the Future:&nbsp;</i></p><blockquote><p>Early in his time there, he whipped several enslaved people who, racked by hunger, had stolen food from his shops.

[...] The British government paid off British slave owners in order to pass the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act, which gradually freed the enslaved across most of the British Empire. This cost the British government \u00a320 million, amounting to 40 percent of the Treasury\u2019s annual expenditure at the time. To finance the payments, the British government took out a \u00a315 million loan, which was not fully paid back until 2015. [...] The economic interpretation of abolition also struggles to explain the activist approach that Britain took to the slave trade after 1807. Britain made treaties, and sometimes bribes, to pressure other European powers to end their involvement in the trade and used the Royal Navy\u2019s West African Squadron to enforce those treaties.90 Britain had some economic incentive here to prevent their rivals from selling slave-produced goods at lower prices than they could. But the scale of their activism doesn\u2019t seem worth it: from 1807 to 1867, enforcing abolition cost Britain almost 2 percent of its annual national income, several times what Britain spends today on foreign aid; political scientists Robert Pape and Chaim Kaufman described this campaign as \u201cthe most expensive international moral effort in modern history.\u201d [...]\u201d</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn182jprak8i2j\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref182jprak8i2j\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;From the <a href=\"https://us8.campaign-archive.com/?e%3D7023019c13%26u%3D52b028e7f799cca137ef74763%26id%3De2145888dd\"><u>February 2023 edition</u></a>&nbsp;of the <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-newsletter-archives\"><u>EA Newsletter</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>[Professor Brown] rebuts one prominent theory \u2014 that the practice of slavery was bound to end as it was no longer profitable for slaveholders and traders \u2014 by noting that people involved in the slave trade were viewing the system as profitable.

One change is described as especially significant: <strong>the shift from feelings of unease about the morality of slavery to organized action in slaveholding societies. </strong>Brown notes that it might be comforting to think that \u201conce [people] understood the cruelty of slavery, then of course they would organize and do something about it,\u201d but he stresses that \u201cnot only did it not happen that way, but it almost never happens that way.\u201d</p><p>Brown urges listeners to take this as a lesson that change like this is up to us: \u201cI think we need to watch ourselves individually, and watch the worlds that we live in and the people that we elect, and think about what harms we do or what harms we authorize or permit because they just seem basic to the world in which we live.

My diet is vegan, and sometimes I think of myself as a Vegan. I eat this way because I don\u2019t want to cause needless suffering to animals, and as someone interested in philosophy, as a human, I want to have consistent reasons for acting. You barely need philosophy to hold the belief that you shouldn\u2019t pay others to torture and kill fellow creatures. But insects? You often kill them yourself, and you probably don\u2019t think much of it.</p><p>I ignored insects because the consequences of caring about them are immense. Brian Tomasik, a blogger who informed some of my veganism, has little capacity for ignoring. He<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/the-importance-of-insect-suffering/#Ways_forward\">&nbsp;<u>wrote</u></a> about<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadkill#Insects\">&nbsp;<u>driving less, especially when roads are wet</u></a>, avoiding foods containing<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/insect-suffering-silk-shellac-carmine-insect-products/#:~:text=Just%20because%20at%20least%2050%2C000,is%20used%20to%20produce%20shellac.\">&nbsp;<u>shellac</u></a>, never buying<a href=\"https://www.peta.org.uk/issues/animals-not-wear/silk/#:~:text=But%20most%20of%20the%20insects,just%201%20kilogram%20of%20silk.\">&nbsp;<u>silk</u></a>.</p><p>But Brian can be easy to ignore if you\u2019re motivated to. He is so precautionary with his beliefs that he is at least <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/do-video-game-characters-matter-morally/\">willing to entertain</a> the idea of moral risks of killing video game characters. When a belief is inconvenient, taking the path of least resistance and dismissing the author, and somehow with this, the belief itself, is tempting.</p><p>But last year, at EAG London, I went to a talk about insect welfare by a researcher from rethink priorities, Meghan Barrett. She is a fantastic speaker. Her argument in the talk was powerful, and cut through to me. She reframed insects<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd5ngbjlm60s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd5ngbjlm60s\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;by explaining that, because of their method of respiring (through their skins<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefek99qaqgctt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnek99qaqgctt\">[2]</a></sup></span>) , they are much smaller today than they were for much of their evolution. If you saw the behaviour that insects today exhibit in animals the size of dogs or larger, it would be much harder to dismiss them as fellow creatures.</p><p>Many insects do have nociceptors<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6jzh2q56j3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6jzh2q56j3\">[3]</a></sup></span>, or something very similar, many of them exhibit anhedonia (no longer seeking pleasurable experiences) after experiencing pain, many of them nurse wounds. If you are interested, read more in her own words<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YcDXWTzyyfHQHCM4q/a-primer-for-insect-sentience-and-welfare-as-of-sept-2023\">&nbsp;<u>here</u></a>. She ended the talk by extrapolating the future of insect farming, which is generally done without any regard for their welfare. The numbers involved were astonishing. By the end, the familiar outline of an ongoing moral tragedy had been drawn, and I was bought in.<br><br>Why did it take so long for me to take insect suffering seriously, and why did Meghan\u2019s talk make the difference? I think this is because the belief that insect suffering is real is a&nbsp;<strong>tragic belief</strong>.</p><h3>What is a tragic belief?</h3><p>I understand a tragic belief as a belief that, should you come to believe it, will make you:</p><p>a) Knowingly a part of causing great harms, and</p><p>b) A resident of a worse world.</p><p>The problem is, some beliefs are like this. It\u2019s easier for us to reject them. Perhaps it is healthy to have a bias against beliefs like this. But, if we don\u2019t believe them, if we avoid them because they are difficult to embrace even though they are true, we will continue to perpetuate tragedies.&nbsp;</p><p>So we should find a way to stay open to tragic beliefs, without making the world seem too tragic for us to act.</p><h3>How can we open ourselves up to tragic beliefs?</h3><p>There are two techniques that I have seen and experienced which help with accepting tragic beliefs. Pragmatism, and righteousness.&nbsp;</p><h3>Opportunity framing, or pragmatism</h3><p>Part of the success of Meghan Barrett\u2019s talk in changing my mind was its last section. There was barely a breath between her projections of insect farming in the next century and her hope, and plans, for doing something to combat it. In a moment, the idea that incredible amounts of suffering might be about to come into being was replaced by the idea that we could&nbsp;<i>prevent</i> incredible amounts of suffering. From the idea that the already massive horrors of factory farming might&nbsp;<i>increase</i>, came the idea that, through our actions, we could save more lives than we might have thought possible before.&nbsp;</p><p>One way to accept tragic beliefs, then, is to turn them around.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019ve seen this in EA community building. The tactic of leading with Singer\u2019s drowning child thought experiment is sometimes effective. The argument that our obligations to rescue, which we feel so strongly when facing one stranger, might actually apply to&nbsp;<i>all</i> strangers who we could possibly help, works for some people. But it alienates a lot of people. Boundless obligations can be binding, they can restrict your actions, and take over your motivations. Some people react against this.&nbsp;</p><p>A way to appeal to them is to reframe the obligation as an opportunity<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefip0r9lpi689\"><sup><a href=\"#fnip0r9lpi689\">[4]</a></sup></span>. Instead of leading with \u201ca child will die if you do nothing!\u201d you lead with \u201cyou can save a child for only $5000!\u201d For globally well off people in rich countries, this can be empowering.&nbsp;<i>You are so lucky, you have the opportunity to do so much good!&nbsp;</i>The same framing was often used in conjunction with the \u2018most important century\u2019 \u2014&nbsp;<i>we are living at the most important time in history, we have the chance to shape the world into something fantastic!</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But this doesn\u2019t work for everyone. It can seem aesthetically off to be approaching altruism joyously when the subject matter is often so bleak.&nbsp;</p><p>Embracing a feeling of righteousness, when done in the right way, can be an alternative to the opportunity framing which allows us to maintain our awareness of tragedy.&nbsp;</p><h3>The joy in righteousness&nbsp;</h3><p>Benjamin Lay seemed to be having a bit of fun with his protests. Once, at the end of a speech against slavery, he stabbed a bible filled with pokeberry juice, splashing the blood red liquid on the people surrounding him. Even after being disowned by several quaker groups, he continued with his protests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is pure speculation, but I imagine that Lay was enjoying himself. I\u2019m sure he often felt lonely, or isolated, but I doubt he would have continued with his actions if he didn\u2019t derive some sort of joy from them.&nbsp;</p><p>Righteousness can be a way of finding joy in tragedy. When you strongly believe that you are right, that your beliefs are consistent and based in reality, it can feel&nbsp;<i>good</i> to stand up for those beliefs in the face of people who are indifferent or even hostile. Compared to indifferent people especially, you will be demonstrably more consistent and serious in your beliefs. You\u2019ll know how to answer their questions, how to expose their hastily derived counter arguments as self-serving or ad hoc, simply by your steadfastness.</p><p>But too much righteousness clearly has its downsides. Organisations like PETA, who pull off modern day Benjamin Lay-ish stunts, inspire hatred as well as support. Righteousness can also become arrogance, which is unattractive, but also epistemically risky. When you don\u2019t need the support of your peers to maintain your beliefs, you can become insensitive to real counterpoints.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>I\u2019m posting this on Benjamin Lay day, because Benjamin Lay is an example of someone who encountered a tragic beliefs and believed them. He realised that slavery was a horror, and rather than relaxing into the comfortable beliefs of his contemporaries, he opposed it. He did this even when it made him worse off. &nbsp;Perhaps this doesn't make him a <i>shining</i> example for living healthily with tragic beliefs \u2014 he did die a hermit.&nbsp;</p><p>It is hard to maintain tragic beliefs. On the face of it, it makes the world worse to believe them. But in order to actually do as much good as we can, we need to be open to them, while finding ways to keep a healthy relationship with tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p><i>In the comments, I\u2019d love to see other suggestions for sustainably maintaining tragic beliefs.&nbsp;</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnd5ngbjlm60s\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefd5ngbjlm60s\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>She used this word only out of necessity.

In an <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-12-04-bad_luck/\">earlier post</a> we discussed a literature review by Joseph Tainter (Tainter, 2023). Tainter lists three main kinds of events that have been identified as a cause for collapse: 1) external conflict, 2) internal conflict and 3) climate change. When we think about those it becomes clear that climate change could easily create external and internal conflict, but not the other way around. Does this mean that climate change is the ultimate cause for societal collapse?</p><h1>Climate changes with bad societal outcomes are mainly caused by volcanoes</h1><p>Before we dive into the gears of how climate influences society, we should first take a look at what kind of climate changes we are actually talking about. The climate on our planet is never static, but those changes are usually quite slow and easier to adapt to. The main problem of climate is when it changes quickly and without warning. This is most often caused by volcanoes. Due to improvements of paleoclimate analysis we now have a pretty good picture of when these volcanic eruptions happened. A good overview here is given by Sigl et al. (2015) where they reconstructed the climate of the last 2500 years from ice cores and a variety of other proxy comparisons to validate their main analysis. Especially between 500 BCE and 1000 CE volcanoes are a dominant driver of climate anomalies. Of the 16 main climate events they identified in that time 15 can be attributed to volcanoes. The mechanism here is that volcanoes emit sulfate aerosols. These scatter the incoming sunlight, reflecting a greater share of incoming light back into space and thus decreasing the total amount of energy that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface (1).</p><p>Sigl et al. also state that they see volcanic eruptions and their subsequent effects on the climate as linked to the collapse of civilizations, but have difficulties with direct attribution:</p><p><i>\u201c\u2026a direct causal connection of these two large volcanic episodes and subsequent cooling to crop failures and outbreaks of famines and plagues is difficult to prove . However, the exact delineation of two of the largest volcanic signals - with exceptionally strong and prolonged NH cooling; written evidence of famines and pandemics; as well as socio-economic decline observed in Mesoamerica (\u201cMaya Hiatus\u201d), Europe, and Asia - supports the idea that the latter may be causally associated with volcanically-induced climatic extremes.\u201d</i></p><p>A more recent study by B\u00fcntgen et al. (2020) goes a step further and directly looks into how much human history has been influenced by volcano-driven climate changes by combining historical records with climate reconstructions based on tree rings. They find a lot of historical examples of volcano triggered climate change that led to societal collapse or at least significant hardship for the people living at the time. They also highlight the following points:</p><ul><li>Population decline tends to coincide with cool summers and almost always follows volcanic eruptions.</li><li>Population decline at such times is mostly caused by famine and pandemics (2).</li></ul><p>They summarize their results in an impressive figure (Figure 1). This figure brings together several datasets about temperature, eruptions and historical events (see figure description). We can see that significant events usually follow a major eruption. However, not all eruptions lead to major events, even if they are big. Usually, you have to have several major eruptions in a shorter time period to detect global, negative effects. The same effect could plausibly be caused by super-eruptions, but we have not experienced such an event in recorded history (yet). The biggest effects can be seen for the <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-08-16-democracy_and_resilience/\">Late Antiquity Little Ice Age</a> and the <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-11-20-case_study_volcanoes/\">Little Ice Age</a>, which we both discussed in previous posts.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a8064a9-a08d-4f9b-b867-a2d037aa4016_3008x2058.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/hv1i9brcifm3mdg4udvd\" alt=\"Volcanoes and Climate over Time\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/qcaqx5xrbxpshlskpf6z 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/yzfxlyxwc5iy6fl7tgvq 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/hejp3ocyvkcqq1jjxmgr 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/hv1i9brcifm3mdg4udvd 1456w\"></a></p><p>Figure 1: Visual summary of volcanic eruptions (brown line at the bottom), temperature (red line), important historic events (as labels) and periods of warmer (green shade) and colder (blue shade) temperatures (B\u00fcntgen et al., 2020).</p><p>But history isn\u2019t deterministic and simple, and there do seem to be cases where non-volcanic climate change leads to collapse. A prime example here is the Bronze Age Collapse (discussed in an <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2020-10-28-bronze_age/\">earlier post</a> here). While the overall story of this collapse is quite complex, more recent research indicates that it coincides with a megadrought lasting ~300 years (Kaniewski &amp; Van Campo, 2017). In this case the origin for this shift in climate seems to be the always changing patterns of Earth\u2019s climate and cannot be pinpointed to a single event. Still, it seems like volcanoes are the main factor for changes in climate, which adversely affect human populations.</p><h1>We can find a pretty clear causality between climate and societal stability</h1><p>We now know that climate anomalies are mainly driven by volcanoes and that times of climate anomalies do coincide with times where a lot of societies tend to struggle. So far we only have established correlation and not causation. However, a study by Zhang et al. (2011) tries to establish exactly this causation by an extensive data analysis. To do so they zoom in to the time of 1500 to 1800 (which contains the Little Ice Age, but also times of more warm and stable climate). Their idea is that to establish that climate changes cause societal strive, we have to establish that the timing is right.</p><p>The linkage they want to study is climate anomaly \u2192 drop in agricultural productivity \u2192 famine \u2192 epidemics \u2192 population decline (3). They track all those variables over time and can indeed show that they happen in the order they postulated. What seems especially noteworthy is that all those changes are tightly related to the price of grain. They find if the grain price rises above a certain threshold, you can expect a major negative period for the population shortly after. Based on this finding they turn their model around and try to predict major historical events using only the grain price. This identifies 1264-1359 and 1559-1652 as crisis periods and 1360-1558 and 1635-1800 as especially favorable times. All dates check out with historical events:</p><p>Negative prediction</p><ul><li>1264-1359: Crisis period in the Middle Ages</li><li>1559-1652: General Crisis of the 17th Century</li></ul><p>Positive prediction</p><ul><li>1360-1558: Renaissance</li><li>1635-1800: Enlightenment</li></ul><p>They also find that the grain price inversely correlates with the temperature and find that temperature derivations of more than -0.1 standard deviations can be seen as a crisis threshold for human societies, while times with warmer temperature usually also lead to more stable societies. They also use this temperature threshold to predict past events and come to the same conclusions as with the grain prices. All this in combination makes it seem likely to me that climate is the most important driver for overall societal well being. Though, this is always mediated by the societal response to the climatic shift, as we discussed in a <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-08-16-democracy_and_resilience/\">previous post</a>.</p><p>The model discussed by Zhang et al, is also implicitly validated by a study by Ljungqvist et al. (2023). The Ljungqvist paper is a massive historical assessment of past famines in Europe. They explore the reasons for a variety of famines and how they played out and, like in the model of Zhang, we can see again and again the pathway of climate anomaly \u2192 drop in agricultural productivity \u2192 famine \u2192 epidemics \u2192 population decline. However, it should be noted that approaches as used by Zhang and co-authors have been criticized in the climate change community as being overly simplistic, not addressing the uncertainties of past climate data enough, and assuming that correlation implies causation (Degroot et al., 2021). We should bear these critiques in mind, and interpret the results of Zhang et al. cautiously.</p><h1>Theoretical underpinnings for the climate-society interaction</h1><p>We have reviewed some evidence that climate is very likely the most important driver for societal collapse. Now we need some theoretical underpinning to make an actual scientific theory from this. Fortunately for us, a study trying to build exactly this was published recently by Timothy Lenton (2023).</p><p>The main idea in Lenton\u2019s chapter is to transfer the ideas from tipping points (which we discussed in a <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-06-19-tipping_points/\">previous post</a>) from the climate system to the interaction of the climate system with human societies. Lenton argues that climate can be seen as an evolutionary pressure on societies. He bases this on arguments by others who have argued that the formation of states was a response to a changing climate. Yet, as we have seen, it has also been linked to many crisis and collapse events. This poses the question: \u201cIf climate deterioration is a credible trigger for the origin of complex societies, then how can it also be a trigger of their demise?\u201d</p><p>Lenton frames his answer to the question in regards to complexity. He imagines the complexity space a society can occupy as a collection of attractors. These attractors represent viable ways you could potentially organize your society. Once you reach such an attractor (for example, becoming a nation state), there are feedback mechanisms which tend to keep you at roughly this level of complexity. Civilizations will also tend to introduce additional mechanisms to make their current position in the complexity space more stable. This entrenches their current positions and means a larger shock is needed to dislodge it. This makes the shift to another complexity state more abrupt, potentially increasing the chance of collapse if it happens. In general, you can see the movement from one complex state to another as quite disruptive, as it entails a major reorganization of your society. Imagine the large number of changes that were required to go from a medieval, feudal society to the nation states we have now.</p><p>Societies will stay in their complexity position as long as they are not forced to leave it. They can be forced mainly by a variety of climate mechanisms (Figure 2):</p><ul><li>Extreme events in an otherwise stable climate: Your society gets hit by a once every 10,000 years flood, completely disrupting your way of life (Figure 2B).</li><li>A changing climate after a disruptive event: A volcano erupts and climate feedback mechanisms lead to permanently less precipitation in the region you are in (Figure 2C).</li><li>Slowly changing natural climate variability: The climate is never stable and changes over time, albeit slowly. This can remove the resource base a society is reliant on, but only gradually, making it hard to attribute to climate change (Figure 2D). For example, the change of the Sahara from a savanna to a desert.</li><li>Evolutionary changes of the society: Internal dynamics of a society could make it less adaptive to the current climate state it exists in. This makes the society more vulnerable to all climate effects, increasing the likelihood of events that overcome its internal feedback (Figure 2D). An example could be the cultural adaptation that led to favoring a specific food for cultural reasons, even though it is less efficient than other food you could grow in your area.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f548a2-fe62-4ff8-aaa7-d1b9ae1caa7e_1090x801.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/oxt2rzqakaduxez341ry\" alt=\"Societal Tipping Points\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/gaf1hh8musqb9te48i1d 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/scxrxgvpyhxtagw4dhyt 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/lxdpwqyoxsjmhhldqujd 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ve6ag9cdTnLQyuJAE/oxt2rzqakaduxez341ry 1456w\"></a></p><p>Figure 2: Different types of tipping point collapse scenarios.</p><p>Once any of these processes overwhelms the internal feedback mechanisms of the society, Lenton sees two possibilities:</p><ul><li>Collapse: The climatic shock is too big for the society, leading it to a state where it is no longer capable of upholding the processes that undergird its complexity. It collapses and drops back to the last viable state, with the depth of the fall being dependent on how deeply entrenched the society was on its complexity level.</li><li>Adaption: As the current state of complexity is not viable anymore, the society also has the possibility to undergo a considerable change, to reach the next attractor in the complexity space, which is more adaptive to the changed environment. Once there, the process begins anew.</li></ul><p>Lenton\u2019s description of collapse in this matter is helpful, as it gives us a more theoretical idea of how societies and climate interact when it comes to collapse. As we now have a model of how this should work, we can also go out in the world and try to actually falsify this hypothesis. Lenton describes how we could test his model scientifically: If we can detect a critical slowing down in important societal variables like grain harvest or currency value (4), it is likely that tipping point dynamics are the process which determines if a society collapses due to a certain event or not. This kind of analysis seems quite possible with the knowledge we already have today and I hope that somebody does it soon.</p><h1>A complete theory of collapse?</h1><p>In this post we have established that climate is a strong contender for a key reason for societal collapse, albeit mediated by the societal response and internal changes in the societal structure. However, this also means that we cannot look at climate alone. We always have to take into account the society as well. See for example, the highly variable reaction of societies to similar climate shocks, as described in an earlier post about the <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-08-16-democracy_and_resilience/\">Late Antiquity Little Ice Age</a>.</p><p>What is still missing is a more formal model that connects all these dots, especially in combination with the food system and epidemics and the overall capital of the society, which allows it to maintain unstable states at least for a while. This is also something that Lenton mentions at the end of his paper. To progress here we need to have first a feedback diagram that tries to define all the different interactions the climate, the food system and the society have with each other. Once this is established we can adapt this to a computational model and can see if it reliably predicts societal collapse. A good data source here is potentially the SESHAT database (Turchin et al., 2019), especially as they are currently compiling a dataset focused on societal crisis times.</p><h1>Endnotes</h1><p>(1) The scattering of the light also leads to bright red skies, especially when the sun is close to the horizon. This seems to be quite inspiring, as every time a major volcano erupts and paints the skies, we get <a href=\"https://worldhistory.substack.com/p/the-volcanoes-and-the-paintings\">a bunch of great art</a>.</p><p>(2) Unfortunately, they don\u2019t discuss if the pandemics are enabled by the famine or happen independently.</p><p>(3) The model in the paper is more complicated, but this seems like the main idea to me.</p><p>(4) As a reminder what critical slowing down means, here\u2019s the explanation from my tipping points post: <i>\u201cThe main way to detect tipping points are so-called Early-Warning Signals. They work by identifying changes in a system\u2019s behavior as it approaches a tipping point. This change is often marked by a phenomenon known as critical slowing down, where the system becomes less resilient to disturbances. This means once a disturbance happens it takes longer and longer to get back to its original state the closer it is to the tipping point.\u201c</i></p><h1>References</h1><p>B\u00fcntgen, U., Arseneault, D., Boucher, \u00c9., Churakova (Sidorova), O.

Reducing those costs may bring mental health apps in line with cash transfers or group therapy. The </i><a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@huw/self-guided-mental-health-cea\"><i>linked Observable notebook</i></a><i> allows you to interact with the estimates yourself.</i></p><p>Software provides enormous benefits to cost-effectiveness; there is zero marginal cost of supplying a software service to a new user (only acquisition costs). There are very few health interventions that have this property, as most health issues require physical treatment, usually from paid experts. As software has made content delivery orders of magnitude more cost-effective, it might also have this effect on non-physical health treatments.</p><p>I am interested in understanding if delivering fully self-guided, software-based mental health interventions might have a similar cost-effectiveness to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/strongminds-happier-lives-institute\">GiveWell\u2019s estimates for wellbeing improvements</a> (selecting these because they\u2019re a higher bar to clear than most other estimates of wellbeing improvement, and generally agreeable to the community).</p><p>I\u2019m not interested in this being the most comprehensive CEA; this is purely exploratory, to diagnose whether this is an issue worth pursuing. I will usually try to underestimate benefits and overestimate costs throughout, and I\u2019m only interested in getting within an order of magnitude or two of the most cost-effective interventions. The only way to really test these apps would be to run experiments in collaboration with them, which is much, much harder.</p><p>I\u2019ll define \u2018self-guided mental health app\u2019 broadly, as anything vaguely intending (explicitly) to improve mental health, and self-guided as anything with zero 1:1 contact with other people to guide you (i.e. an app that provides a library of guided meditations is self-guided).</p><p>To estimate the cost-effectiveness, let\u2019s break it down into:</p><ul><li>What is the short-term impact of a short treatment course on mental health symptoms?</li><li>How does that impact translate to other measures?</li><li>How many users will continue to use an app in the long term?</li><li>What is the customer acquisition cost of such an app?</li><li>What is the development cost of such an app?</li></ul><h2>Prior Art</h2><p>I\u2019m extremely grateful to the long history of the mental health topic on this forum. I found 2 specific CEAs/discussions that focused on mental health app development:</p><ul><li><strong>Stan Pinsent &amp; CEARCH\u2019s </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PaGcxuiKYiyEGBvpK/an-overview-of-promising-mental-health-interventions#Self_administered___tech_based_psychotherapy\"><strong>analysis of self-administered psychotherapy</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Finds a 12% chance of being as effective as a GiveWell top charity. I find a lower chance that existing apps are as effective, due to lower effect sizes for self-guided interventions (I think). We both agree that effectiveness is only achieved on the long tail and that our assumptions are shaky.</li><li><strong>George Bridgwater &amp; Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s </strong><a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/top-mental-health-and-happiness-charity-ideas-we-re-researching-in-2020-idea-prioritization-report\"><strong>2-hour CEAs for promising mental health interventions</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Specifically, they analyse guided self-help workbooks, gratitude journalling apps, apps for CBT, and apps for mundane, sub-optimal happiness. For a CBT app, they estimate lower retention, but lower cost-per-install, and achieve a much higher cost-effectiveness (possibly on the order of cash transfers or group therapy).</li></ul><p>I wanted to dive deeper specifically on self-guided mental health. I hope also by including distributional estimates (which Pinsent does) that we can gain some clarity on where the uncertainty is, and what levels we can pull to increase effectiveness.</p><h1><strong>Short-term impacts of treatment</strong></h1><p><i>(We will focus specifically on depression as a health outcome. It is the largest mental health category by incidence and health burden, and the most studied. By narrowing in this way we can only serve to underestimate total impact; although, as below, self-guided app-based treatments for depression seemingly generalise to anxiety and vice-versa.)</i></p><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20673\">Linardon et al. (2019)</a> appears to be a very well-conducted, well-cited meta-analysis of RCTs of smartphone apps that aim to treat mental health conditions (a broad definition, but one which is sub-divided later in the analysis). Further research uncovered other meta-analyses, but this was more robust in all relevant aspects (comprehensiveness, bias/quality checks, etc.), which I hope excuses the singular focus on the study (ex. it specifically aimed to improve <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20472\">Firth et al.

For all mental health apps, this was 4.0% (IQR 4.7%), suggesting that this is approximately the limiting retention. This implication concurs with the <a href=\"https://asset.jmir.pub/assets/1dda91320e467ad210720d7fd3cd2406.png\">decay curve plot from the paper</a>, and our intuitions about habit-building (some number of users will reach a sort of \u2018escape velocity\u2019 and stick with the app for the long term).</p><p>Comparing Baumel et al.

Given the wide range of observed employee-download ratios, this would be a very promising direction.</p><h2><strong>Reduce cost per employee</strong></h2><p>This is trickier, since the counterfactual employee likely would\u2019ve worked at another effective organisation or donated any extra salary. However, it might be possible to lower employee salaries a little bit? In practice, halving salaries (as low as we could reasonably go) only adds 14% more cost-effectiveness. I would not pursue it as a direction.</p><h2><strong>Market to low-CPI regions</strong></h2><p>CPI is usually half an order of magnitude lower in low- and middle-income countries. This is an excellent opportunity, as those countries also tend to have lower baseline life satisfaction &amp; worse existing mental health support.</p><p>Lower-income countries <a href=\"https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/app-market-ad-spend\">tend to have CPIs around US$0.05\u20131.50</a>, and adjusting to roughly this value nearly triples our cost-effectiveness (although there is a lot of uncertainty about those CPIs in practice). I think this would be an extremely promising direction\u2014apps could accept donations for customer acquisition and subscription costs in LMICs, while taking revenue from higher-income countries, without significant changes to their structures or business models. Advocacy in this area toward existing providers might be effective!</p><h2><strong>Improve dropoff rates</strong></h2><p>It might be possible to lower dropoff rates. We saw Insight Timer report a 16% retention rate, which would double our impact. They claim it\u2019s due to their <i>lack</i> of growth hacking techniques, which might be true if users are put off by an app that feels too slick.</p><p>At the very least, it seems reasonable that meditation apps have high dropoffs because they require significant upfront commitment, and a delayed emotional payoff (and are just not effective for some segment of users). All of these elements could be improved upon to increase the dropoff rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Improving the dropoff rate from 4% to 6% increases the cost-effectiveness by about 40%\u2014but we\u2019d have to be careful about DAU-hacking in practice.</p><h2><strong>Improve effect size</strong></h2><p>It may also be possible to achieve a larger-than-average effect size by structural means. The easiest-to-imagine mechanism here would be to simulate a therapist using a chatbot; this could even have a larger effect due to the increased availability &amp; lower cost. Or, it could be true that GiveWell\u2019s discounts are overly conservative. But in general, I can\u2019t speak for mechanisms as clearly as I can for the above. Improving the effect size by 50% increases the cost-effectiveness by 60%.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I mostly did this work for myself, but I hope it\u2019s useful for other EAs looking into this area. I am very new to the forum. If you\u2019re giving feedback, I am less interested in specifics on accuracy, and much more in large, directional things I\u2019ve overlooked that could have caused me to overestimate cost-effectiveness.

My estimate of potential as a community project</h1><p>I have some experience with organizing online and offline social groups, and instead of presenting the exact 5-10 different heuristic calculations behind my vibe, I'm just going to state my intuitive estimation<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1iycsoo6ev9h\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1iycsoo6ev9h\">[1]</a></sup></span>:</p><p>If someone set up an online neurodivergent community in the very regular way of making it a public opt-in group, advertised in places like the EA Forums, other EA+ forums, and the dozen or so EA+ Slack/Discord/Facebook/WhatsApp groups, I would expect the \"natural size\" of the community to be such that the number of total lurkers (active and inactive members) reach the low hundreds within a few years, with fewer than 10% of members engaging on a monthly basis, and if monthly online social events were to be held, the expected turnout would be fewer than 10 members. This isn't a pessimistic estimate, it's simply what would be consistent with how online groups usually are, given how relatively few EAs there are globally, let alone EAs who participate in <i>any</i> online group, let alone EAs who participate in <i>any</i> online group at least once a month, etc etc.</p><p>If this online neurodivergent community were the most successful group in all of the history of EA online groups, relative to the actually addressable market of active online neurodivergent EAs, I would still expect the turnout at events to be lower than 30 members.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2bgaijeoyp9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2bgaijeoyp9\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>I think fostering the group so that it reaches 10 active event-attending members is already a harder-than-one-might-think goal, especially for a timeline of 1-2 years. I can think of less typical approaches that could result in exceeding this goal (such as relying on word of mouth, peer influence, pitching to EA Virtual Program participants, and getting advertised on one of the EA+ newsletters with the biggest readerships), but this requires consistent effort and some luck, and I would be tempted to argue that this defeats the purpose of the online community in that it would no longer be about neurodivergent folks fitting in so much as trying to have a good turnout.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1ki41ucdj7j\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1ki41ucdj7j\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Personally, the overall potential impactful was not high enough for me, but since I had been exploring how an active community might be fostered at all, I then considered a larger and encapsulating idea: what if the intention was to consolidate and boost both existing and future online EA groups? And if that project was worthwhile, then I could easily include the infrastructure for a neurodivergent subcommunity, whether or not I was invested as an organizer within that or someone else was. But that is a subject of another post.</p><h1>3. Something I learned</h1><p>I don't have any amazing insights to share, just this one anecdote.</p><p>I was feeling very conflicted before I sent out my survey to almost 80 ND-affiliated EAGxVirtual participants via Swapcard. But I'm glad I did though, because the results were pleasantly surprising. People didn't accuse me of being a spammer or call me out on unsolicited promotion of my survey, even though I was afraid of being perceived as wasting people's time. Instead, more than 40% of the people I messaged filled out the survey, with 80% of those that did responding positively to my message. Take what you will from that, but hopefully something in the direction of it being a good idea to overcome fear and reach out more on Swapcard!</p><h1>4. What now with online community building?</h1><p>One of the main draws I had to this neurodivergent group idea in the first place is that I see a lot of potential in creating ND-specific resources, such as:</p><ul><li>Info directories of good books, YouTubers, podcasts, courses, etc.</li><li>Curated material, some of which may be improved encapsulations of important ideas that aren't so accessible or systematically captured by neurodivergent literature at present. For example, neurodivergent productivity seems not well represented.</li><li>Community contacts who can help others with their niche interests.</li></ul><p>I still value this and am personally interested in contributing, but have opted to prioritize and pursue this in a much different way.</p><p>I have a lot more to share regarding my exploration of online community-building ideas within EA, and that will hopefully appear in a separate and much more in-depth post. Those ideas aren't really specific to this neurodivergent community idea, so I haven't included them here.</p><p>If anyone is inclined to make something happen with the ND community idea, I'm happy to share my background research or connect you with potential collaborators.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflp79ewyepo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlp79ewyepo\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn1iycsoo6ev9h\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref1iycsoo6ev9h\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I would be mildly curious to hear from organizers who have anecdotal experiences that deviate significantly from my projections.

It aims to identify the drivers of progress and formulate strategies to optimise them in response to concerns about potential slowdowns in technological and societal advancements. Scholars in progress studies engage in discussions around the concept of \"accelerating progress\" and explore the roles of education, public policy, research and development, and collaborative efforts among various entities in fostering positive societal advancements.</p><p>Engineers can use their knowledge and experience in how innovative technologies get developed and implemented to contribute to the literature on progress studies. Engineers can also use their technical expertise to influence policy to stimulate innovation by providing feedback on policy papers or by working in policy.</p><h2>Uncertainty</h2><p>The content of this article is largely based on the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/\">Patrick and Cowen article in <i>The Atlantic</i></a>, supplemented with resources from <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\">Our World in Data</a> and <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.notion.site/Resources-on-Progress-Studies-182847fba3784db297d719b0831ca429\">Roots of Progress</a>.

The world is much better. The world can be much better. All three statements are true at the same time.</p></blockquote><p>There are tens of thousands of children dying every day. This is truly awful. However, historians estimate that approximately <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past\">half of all children</a> in the past did not survive until the end of puberty. This grim reality was pervasive worldwide, only significantly improving in the 19th century, just a few generations ago. This improvement can be attributed to an increased understanding and use of medicine, better housing and nutrition, economic development, as well as just recognising \u201cinfant mortality\u201d as a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1467-9566.1986.tb00298.x\">socio-medical problem</a>. This goes to show that the world is much better, as a result of human actions.</p><p>As engineers, we are familiar with many examples of current technological progress, from <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2023/12/04/jt_60sa_tokamak_online/\">nuclear fusion</a> to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/best-glucose-monitors#A-quick-look-at-the-best-home-glucose-meters\">wearable tech for people with diabetes</a> to <a href=\"https://cdrprimer.org/\">direct air capture</a> to tackle climate change. These technologies aim to solve problems and make people\u2019s quality of life better in the future. However, progress is hard \u2013 there\u2019s a reason why Edison is famous for saying \u201cI have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work\u201d!</p><p>We are still in need of much progress. People still die from both preventable diseases and diseases we haven\u2019t cured yet; we haven\u2019t yet learnt to predict and mitigate natural disasters; we still haven\u2019t solved climate change; many people around the world are still unable to live as comfortably as the average American. There are so many large and small opportunities for improvement: Progress Studies is an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/social-and-intellectual-movements\">intellectual movement</a> that aims to understand why progress happens and how to make it happen faster.</p><p>Academics such as economist Tyler Cowen (author of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Stagnation\">The Great Stagnation</a>) and philosopher Will MacAskill (author of <a href=\"https://www.whatweowethefuture.com/\">What We Owe the Future</a>) have noted in their respective books that technological progress and improvements in living standards appear to have slowed down since the explosive period of innovation and growth between 1870 \u2013 1970. In What We Owe the Future, MacAskill estimates that each doubling of technological advancement requires four times as much research effort as the previous doubling. <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf\">Stanford economists argue</a> that the easiest ideas have been found and implemented, leaving the more difficult discoveries that require much more effort to find, although this explanation is not universally accepted.

We summarise some of the points here.</p><ul><li>The field of Progress Studies is incredibly broad, and research to tackle these important questions is divided over many different fields, such as sociology, psychometrics, anthropology, psychology, sportometrics, economics, management science, etc. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to answer these questions, but the world would benefit from a more organised effort.</li><li>Some <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/\">topics to investigate</a> include:<ul><li>Effective approaches to identify and train talented young individuals.</li><li>Strategies for small groups to efficiently exchange and disseminate ideas.</li><li>Designing incentives for diverse participants in innovative ecosystems, such as scientists, entrepreneurs, managers, and engineers.</li><li>Understanding the varying levels of productivity among different organisations and the factors influencing these differences.</li><li>Methods for selecting and funding scientists.</li><li>Exploration of other related issues.</li></ul></li><li>Organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/\">Y Combinator</a>, <a href=\"https://www.joinef.com/\">Entrepreneur First</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a> have shown time and again to catalyse progress that affects wider society. It would be very impactful to understand what sets these organisations apart from others and implement interventions that increase the efficiency, productivity, and innovative capacity of our organisations.</li><li>Despite the significant contributions from scientific research to economic growth and our quality of life, there has been limited investigation into how best to structure the scientific endeavour itself. A <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w15466\">2011 paper</a> revealed that supporting promising scientists at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute with long-term grants increased the likelihood of those scientists to produce groundbreaking work by 96%. If this finding proves replicable, current funding processes could likely be much improved to allow more research autonomy and risk-taking.</li><li>Changes in demographics and institutional trends have silently reshaped the support structure for science. Take the National Institutes of Health, the biggest science funding source in the U.S., for instance. In 1980, it allocated 12 times more funding to scientists under 40 than those over 50. Fast forward to today, and the tables have turned: scientists aged 50 or older now get five times more funding. Is this shift towards funding older scientists a positive change? If not, how should we rethink science funding distribution? Other questions about the impact of prizes, fellowships, sabbaticals, and the optimal organisation of scientific bodies should also be asked. Despite the significance of these issues, there's a shortage of critical evaluation on how science is practised and funded. Addressing these questions would be a crucial aspect of Progress Studies.</li></ul><h3>Career moves</h3><p>Since Progress Studies covers so much ground, there are many ways you can contribute.</p><ul><li>Engineers are in a good position to contribute to literature on progress studies. Engineers understand how technologies get developed and implemented and are generally excited about technological advances. To contribute to this literature, it is a good idea to start writing early so you can build up your writing skills. Eventually, you might be able to contribute to places such as the <a href=\"https://ifp.org/\">Institute for Progress</a> or join the <a href=\"https://fellowship.rootsofprogress.org/fellows/\">Roots of Progress Fellowship</a>.</li><li>Since Progress Studies relies on findings from many different disciplines, it could be useful to gather all this information in one place. <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\">Our World in Data</a> is one such organisation that does this, but other institutions like the Civil Service may also provide you with opportunities to gather this information and implement good policies to encourage progress.</li><li>Working in an organisation famous for its innovation (e.g. NASA) or going through incubators like Y Combinator or Entrepreneur First may help you understand what factors catalyse progress.</li><li>Similar to our page on <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/engineers-climate-change-policy-venture-capital-grantmaking\">other ways to contribute to climate change without being an engineer</a>, there are opportunities to contribute to Progress Studies without being an engineer.<ul><li>Venture capitalists generally love to fund innovation, and working for a VC could be useful in understanding how to evaluate the potential impact of an innovation.<ul><li>Many traditional VC funds are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariannelehnis/2022/05/11/europes-largest-climatetech-vc-fund-offers-investment-insights/?sh=6240c51e3ad7\">not adequately equipped</a> to evaluate the potential impact and performance of technical startups. This is because they lack analysts with science or engineering backgrounds who have the requisite skills to conduct in-depth technical assessments of the product or service being developed.</li><li>One downside is that VCs don\u2019t generally fund very speculative or immature technologies, or technologies that don\u2019t have a high earning potential, so you may not gain the skills needed to evaluate these unproven technologies.</li></ul></li><li>Grantmaking requires similar skills to being a VC, but philanthropic/governmental grants tend to be more focused on speculative technologies. Working in grantmaking can help to build an understanding of how to evaluate grants based on impact and provide the best incentives in philanthropy/government to make progress.<ul><li>Similarly to VCs, grantmakers at large funding organisations need analysts with science or engineering backgrounds to conduct in-depth technical assessments of the programs they fund. These could include governmental organisations like ARPA-E in the US, which funds a lot of the early-stage work into things like superhot rock geothermal, and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advanced-research-and-invention-agency-aria-statement-of-policy-intent/advanced-research-and-invention-agency-aria-policy-statement\">Advanced Research and Invention Agency</a> (ARIA) in the UK.</li><li>Analysts are also required in think tanks and charity evaluators, such as <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/\">Founders Pledge</a>, <a href=\"https://lets-fund.org/\">Let\u2019s Fund</a>, <a href=\"http://givinggreen.earth/\">Giving Green</a>, <a href=\"https://www.climateworks.org/\">ClimateWorks</a>, and others.

One way is to work in government (e.g. the Civil Service) to make sure the public sector can shape and stimulate progress by implementing the best policies and incentives. You can also influence policy outside of your work by contributing as a member of the public to Policy Papers like the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-vision-for-engineering-biology/national-vision-for-engineering-biology\">National Vision for Engineering Biology</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Risks, pitfalls, and things to keep in mind</h2><ul><li>Current research into progress tends to be split up over many different disciplines. There could be a risk of knowledge being siloed rather than shared, leading to redundant work and miscommunication.</li><li>You might not agree with the intense focus on economic growth, which is often used as a proxy for innovation and progress, and has become the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/06/what-is-degrowth-economics-climate-change/\">default goal</a>. You may also have other philosophical disagreements with Progress Studies, as it tends towards techno-utopianism (\u201dcritics claim that techno-utopianism\u2019s identification of social progress with scientific progress is a form of positivism and scientism\u201d; \u201cthey also point out that it has little to say about the environmental impact of technology and that its ideas have little relevance for much of the rest of the world that are still relatively quite poor\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_utopianism#Criticisms\">Wikipedia</a>).</li><li>Depending on what you count as progress, it may not solely hinge on new discoveries and inventions; progress can also result from improved distribution of their benefits. Some argue that enhancing the quality of life can be most efficiently achieved by widely disseminating existing technologies rather than constantly pursuing new innovations. If you lean towards this perspective, your focus might be on global health and development rather than progress studies, which primarily emphasises advancing <a href=\"https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/crawford#:~:text=I%20would%20say,especially%20the%20government.\">cutting-edge technologies</a> in affluent, democratic nations like the US, rather than facilitating <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/c#node-21529531\">catch-up growth</a> that uplifts poor countries.</li></ul><h2>Learn More</h2><h3>Additional Resources</h3><ul><li>Collison, Patrick &amp; Cowen, Tyler (2019) <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/\">We need a new science of progress</a>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, July 30.</li><li>Crawford, Jason (2019) <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/progress-studies-a-moral-imperative\">Progress studies as a moral imperative</a>, <i>The Roots of Progress</i>, September 7.</li><li>Piper, Kelsey (2022) <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/2/11/22923756/to-make-progress-we-need-to-study-it\">To make progress, we need to study it</a>, <i>Vox</i>, February 11.</li><li>Roots of Progress <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.notion.site/Resources-on-Progress-Studies-182847fba3784db297d719b0831ca429\">Resources on Progress Studies</a></li><li><a href=\"https://press.stripe.com/\">Stripe Press</a></li></ul><h3>Relevant Organisations</h3><p>Progress Studies is still a burgeoning field, but a few organisations have been established.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thecgo.org/\">The Center for Growth and Opportunity</a> at Utah State University</li><li>The think tank <a href=\"https://ifp.org/\">Institute for Progress</a></li><li>The <a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/\">Roots of Progress</a></li><li><a href=\"https://humanprogress.org/\">Human Progress</a>, a project of the Cato Institute</li><li>The magazine <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/\">Works in Progress</a></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Jessica Wen"}}, {"_id": "aqDzhMHEw5WvQbmfu", "title": "LawAI's Summer Research Fellowship \u2013\u00a0apply by February 16", "postedAt": "2024-02-07T21:01:17.651Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Announcing the Institute for Law &amp; AI's 2024 Summer Research Fellowship in Law &amp; AI \u2014 </strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/SRF-2024\"><strong>apply before EOD Anywhere on Earth, February 16!</strong></a>&nbsp;<br><br><a href=\"https://law-ai.org/\">LawAI (formerly the Legal Priorities Project)</a> are looking for talented law students and postdocs who wish to use their careers to address risks from transformative artificial intelligence, to engage in an <strong>8-12 week long fellowship focused on exploring pressing questions at the intersection of law and AI governance</strong>.<br><br>Fellows will work with their supervisor to pick a research question, and will spend the majority of their time conducting legal research on their chosen topic.

We are also planning to launch new programs soon. We feel AIM being able to create onramps for other career paths (similar to what we have done for nonprofit entrepreneurship) is the most plausible way of doubling our impact.</p><h2><strong>A quick history of Charity Entrepreneurship</strong></h2><ul><li>Inspired by the early success of a few nonprofits identified by evaluators such as GiveWell, we decided to take a systematic approach to researching and then launching new impact-focused nonprofits (Charity Science Health, Fortify Health).</li><li>After some initial successes, Charity Entrepreneurship was started in 2018 as a formal Incubation Program to get more field-leading charities started.</li><li>31 projects were founded over five years, with an approximate growth of ten nonprofits a year in the upcoming year.</li><li>In 2023, CE extended its impact through the Impactful Grantmaking program (potentially<strong>&nbsp;</strong>impacting up to $10M in funding in its first year).</li><li>In late 2023, CE internally determined the best way to maximize our impact further would be to grow horizontally, focusing on programs for several career paths (e.g., launching a Research Training Program and Effective Giving Incubation).</li></ul><p>That takes us to about now, where Charity Entrepreneurship is still our topline brand and identity; however, we have a growing number of impact-focused programs that are not connected to directly founding a nonprofit.</p><h2><strong>What will AIM look like&nbsp; going forward</strong></h2><p>Our plan is to have a more cross-cutting umbrella brand that will represent our impact-focused ecosystem, with all our programs under one brand.&nbsp;</p><p><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cpuFnLtppbsLKcbbq/jvgttyywsf9dxq8mk4bx\"></p><p><strong>What do we expect to change?</strong></p><ul><li>Names and websites of the new programs. For example, some will be soon renamed (e.g., so \u201cImpactful Grantmaking\u201d will become \u201cAIM Grantmaking.\u201d)&nbsp;</li><li>All of our other programs will be moved off the CE site onto their own domains.&nbsp;</li><li>We will also create a few more centralized resources that cross-cut our programs (e.g., we will have an AIM blog instead of one for each program and a joint newsletter).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>You can also expect us to launch more new programs (with the next one launching in late 2024)</p><p><strong>What do we expect to stay the same?</strong></p><ul><li>In short, most things.</li><li>We still plan on keeping the same&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ambitiousimpact.com/#values\"><u>values</u></a> and ways of working.&nbsp;</li><li>We expect that most of our resources will continue to go into our Charity Entrepreneurship program for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</li><li>The Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation Program brand/website/newsletter will all continue, as well as other twice-yearly programs.</li><li>We are not making major personnel or staffing changes and do not expect AIM to change dramatically in staff size.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><br><strong>Why we are launching AIM&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>Creating more good in the world:&nbsp;</strong>Ultimately, AIM\u2019s goal is to have the most impact while tackling the biggest world problems. Although we feel the career path of founding a nonprofit is among the highest impact ones, we also think we can contribute a lot to building other career pathways. We noticed this area as a gap in the ecosystem and feel like filling it is one of the best ways to cause more good in the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Talent absorbency:</strong> This change indicates our long-term direction, with multiple programs serving impact-minded individuals. We have noticed more and more talented people who, although they might not be a perfect fit for the CE Incubation Program, would excel in adjacent programs. We are aware that nonprofit entrepreneurship is ultimately a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rjiGwvzBEbYj2Cth8/high-absorbency-career-paths\"><u>low-absorbency career path</u></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W2YChXz4f4nGzZMaE/why-we-look-at-the-limiting-factor-instead-of-the-problem\"><u>Limiting factor</u></a><strong>:</strong> Our pilot programs in grantmaking and research have both been promising enough that we feel there would be more impact in running programs like these as opposed to, e.g., graduating 20 charities a year via the CE program. We think that at some point in the near future, the limiting factor for how many new charities we can launch will be how the broader philanthropic ecosystem operates and not a specific aspect that CE could directly improve (e.g., increased outreach, seed funding, or research production).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ecosystem contribution</strong>: As we grow, we feel increasingly responsible for contributing to the broader philanthropic ecosystem in more interdisciplinary ways. For example, the CE Incubation Program\u2019s current net result on the ecosystem is turning funding into direct impact. Although we are happy with this trade, we would also like to contribute in other ways. For instance, our grantmaking program results in more money going into the broader effective nonprofit ecosystem. We think our work with CE has enabled us to set up some significant pathways to impact that would not be as easy for a newer organization to create.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>CE has a winning formula, and emotionally, it does not feel like moving from 1 to 2 is as important as going from 0 to 1. However, impact scales differently in practice than how it feels. We feel that enabling individuals to go into impactful career paths (similar to what we have done in the CE program) is the most plausible way of doubling our impact. We now get hundreds of applications from very talented candidates who are not quite a perfect fit for the CE Incubation Program, and we strongly believe there are other highly impactful career paths for them. We feel we are in a strong position to create this pathway and knock down some barriers that would otherwise stop people from having the highest impact.&nbsp;</p><p>So we are going to do it.</p><p>If you want to learn more about AIM and our various programs, visit our website:&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.ambitiousimpact.com/\"><strong><u>[VISIT AIM WEBSITE]</u></strong></a><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "CE"}}, {"_id": "wex8972nRsSjW8CHk", "title": "Compliance Monitoring as an Impactful Mechanism of AI Safety Policy", "postedAt": "2024-02-07T16:10:28.500Z", "htmlBody": "<h1><strong>Important pre-read notes &amp; definitions:</strong></h1><p>Some of this post is anecdotal as someone who works in this industry.

Examples include surveillance, justice, military, space, or healthcare. Though x-risk obviously applies here, it is not the focus of this post.</p><h1><br><strong>Introduction</strong></h1><p>In industries where mistakes can cost lives or cause large-scale damage to people or the environment (think nuclear power or air travel), all parties involved must not only obey very strict rules but collect large amounts of evidence about how exactly they obeyed the rules. This occurs at every stage of a process. These rules can come from laws, regulations, standards, and various other sources of varying strictness. The end result of this is much safer, more rigorously vetted systems and clusters of systems. This is called Compliance Monitoring (or just Compliance). If Law is the \u2018what\u2019, then Compliance is the \u2018how\u2019.</p><p>It also enables companies to demonstrate rule-following (compliance) if asked - for example during an audit or a court case. Having detailed records is very useful.</p><p>Despite this, the policy landscape in AI is such that compliance monitoring is still haphazard and is rarely undertaken in a serious manner by organisations. Some organisations have high-risk models, but as they are not in highly regulated industries they often lack the requirement and staffing to create proper processes. Some sell high-risk AIs into other industries without much regulatory oversight.</p><p>Compliance monitoring is also not an area subject to much research, either within EA or without. This post hopes to explore this in a simple, jargon-free manner, and suggest further useful research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Compliance Monitoring in Highly Regulated Industries</strong></h2><p>Different industries require different levels of compliance monitoring. Even within those industries, the level expected can differ. Take the food industry for a simple example.&nbsp;</p><p>A local cafe will be expected to collect and keep fewer pieces of evidence than a large frozen food factory. There is no set level by size, but it scales to level of risk and level of oversight. The cafe will keep records of accidents, deliveries, expiry dates and records of hygiene inspections. The factory however will have more equipment, more employees, more regular shipments, more output, and their food ultimately impacts far more customers (and more remotely) than the cafe - so their compliance recordkeeping will most likely be more burdensome. Their customers will also likely be primarily other businesses and are therefore much more likely to have their compliance evidence requested by those they sell to than a cafe is. The factory is however also more likely to have compliance support from specialised staff.</p><p>In highly regulated industries, for example the nuclear sector, compliance monitoring is nothing short of a colossal undertaking - often with entire teams of specialists working full time on making sure everything is safe and legal. Inspections can come at any time, and the consequences for failing one are tremendous.&nbsp;</p><p>There are dozens of licences, inspections, reports, and more required by law. Such sites as nuclear power plants also require vast amounts of supplies and resources, many of which are also controlled by their own regulatory regimes, and therefore there is much to keep track of. Even when buying equipment in, that external supplier needs to provide their own compliance evidence as part of that supply chain, which is then checked by the plant\u2019s compliance team. With major projects such as build space shuttles, debates between compliance teams can span years before a project even starts. Fortunately, the nuclear industry also attracts many highly specialised people who are experts in such compliance. The industry can also afford these people.</p><p>This is an important note, because the same is not the case when we consider AI.</p><h2><strong>Compliance Monitoring in AI</strong></h2><p>I have often found compliance monitoring in AI to have a very significant range of quality. I have spent a lot of time with organisations undertaking high-risk utilisation of AI, and part of that is meeting and talking with those in charge of safety. This may differ from the EA definition of AI Safety, but it's generally the person in charge of making sure the AI system is legal and safe to own and operate.</p><p>There is a vast range of how seriously these organisations take these duties. Even within public institutions such as healthcare or policing. Some are really on the ball, some are the legal compliance equivalent of a child's lemonade stand. Most are somewhere in between.</p><p>Amongst those who struggle the most are commercial entities, particularly when they are small or niche institutions. Often their safety or regulatory personnel lack the powers or experience to undertake the role effectively. Frequently they have no-one in charge of this at all.</p><p>A major issue is that so many (but not all) of the people in these roles have lots of experience in AI, but little (if any) in a safety regulation position. It's not something you can learn as you go without someone teaching you if the infrastructure isn't already there. AI start-ups rapidly scaling up are particularly prone to this.</p><p>Some AI Labs are internal research work only, meaning they don't release any products, which is also the hardest to audit because they aren't required to disclose much in the way of safety until something goes wrong unlike those who sell software to outside organisations who will be required to do some compliance tasks.&nbsp; The less an organisation interacts with the outside world, the less of a compliance infrastructure is likely there.</p><p>There are exceptions to this. Sometimes big companies can go a long time without this becoming an issue - until it does. One high-risk AI system used by over 150 cities in the US was found, somewhat accidentally during a court case, to have had its accuracy rating developed by its marketing department, not its engineers. As a result of this its highly touted accuracy rating had no scientific basis at all. This highly questionable process had not been detected by any of those 150 cities or hundreds of police forces who used it. No-one had checked that this system was as accurate as it stated.</p><p>&nbsp;Presumably, not one of those end customers had ever undertaken quality or compliance monitoring on how this AI was developed, trained, or deployed before they bought it and integrated it into their own systems.</p><p>This is why you see the safest AI systems in those selling such systems to regulated bodies. The AI systems used in, to use our earlier example, nuclear power are extensively vetted by both the makers and buyers from start to finish. I will caveat this by saying they are by no means perfect.</p><h1><strong>Why this is important</strong></h1><p>Compliance infrastructure is important for three reasons:</p><ol><li>A lack of compliance infrastructure makes it very hard for organisations to understand their risk areas (and therefore increases risk)</li><li>A lack of compliance infrastructure makes it very hard for independent experts or regulators to check if an AI system is being developed safely, and prevents injured parties from being to easily take legal action</li><li>A lack of compliance infrastructure makes it very easy for organisations to ignore safety whilst developing or using AI</li></ol><p>Whilst some of us consider AI Safety to be focused on AGI/ASI, and others consider AI Safety to include all AI systems in a spectrum, both parties would find such compliance useful in terms of reducing risk.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Challenges &amp; Mitigations</strong></h2><h3><u>Resources</u></h3><p>When implementing compliance procedures with organisations using high-risk AI, the number one difficulty is often resourcing. This includes human resourcing, but that is considered by itself in the next section. Organisations have limited amounts of time and money to spend on things, and there can be significant up-front investiture of both of these things for implementation of compliance monitoring.&nbsp;</p><p>Initial implementation can often require 300-500 hours of work, which is a significant time and money sink - especially if the process is required to be implemented quickly. This is worse for organisations who run on a set, externally-allocated budget, such as government departments or ringfenced charities.</p><p>This funding is a tremendous barrier to getting started. Fortunately, some initiatives have taken place to assist with this. Some police forces in the UK were given grants to run testing and audit on their systems aided by external agencies such as the National <a href=\"https://www.npl.co.uk/\">Physical Laboratory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\">NIST</a>, and were able to produce some useful <a href=\"https://science.police.uk/site/assets/files/3396/frt-equitability-study_mar2023.pdf\">reports</a>.</p><p>Though the report was far from perfect in my opinion, compliance monitoring was rapidly accelerated. This external expertise enabled the organisation to know where they were falling short and how to fix it.&nbsp;</p><p>Such a fund to assist set-up of compliance monitoring on-par with highly regulated industries would enable more AI manufacturers, retailers, and researchers to implement such measures - though it is uncertain who would fund this. A potential option is via collected insurance premiums, which is what the Motor Insurers Bureau does to protect those injured by uninsured drivers.</p><h3><u>Expertise</u></h3><p>Adequate expertise is incredibly hard to find, and even harder to keep. This is because many working in complex areas of compliance require either lots of experience (making them expensive) or a specific mix of STEM and legal background (making them desirable, and therefore expensive). Employees take lots of time to train from scratch due to the complexity of the role.</p><p>Though very large organisations can typically offer high salaries and good perks, smaller organisations suffer from this. In particular this impacts healthcare, local councils, policing, and the military (but not military procurement).&nbsp;</p><p>Some organisations using high-risk AI who I have worked with have hired an AI specialist on a 6-month temporary contract to set things up and get things running, and found this to be cost-effective. However, it often meant that the non-specialist staff left behind once the consultant left found it difficult to notice when the system was acting strangely, and even if they did notice lacked the expertise to understand why - and certainly were not able to correct the problem.</p><p>Even in AI labs full of technical experts, a lack of experience in policy and regulation implementation is a major failure point. This applies even when hiring those from a law background. There is a common joke in the legal field that goes along the lines of:<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Law School: This is how it all works in theory&nbsp;</p><p>Student: What about in practice?</p><p>Law School: In what?</p></blockquote><p>This is because there is often a significant difference between legal theory and the complex socio-legal realities of implementation. It\u2019s a lot like the difference between AI in lab settings and AI in the real-world.</p><p>As such, there is a considerable talent bottleneck here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Safety-Washing</u></h3><p>I recently read this <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zMhTvp5zF2QGgwYFA/why-i-think-it-s-net-harmful-to-do-technical-safety-research\">post</a> which briefly mentioned safety-washing, and I think it\u2019s a good thing to touch on here.</p><p>Organisations can (and do) hire \u2018safety\u2019 or \u2018compliance\u2019 professionals which are in action largely ceremonial - usually in an effort to appear focused on safety. Unless you are inside those organisations, it is very difficult to tell whether safety professionals have the authority and scope to implement and audit the compliance monitoring, or whether they are merely decorative. There is no quick fix to this, but good mitigation methods are membership of regulatory bodies, high levels of experience, or the presence of stringent external legal safeguards. The less well regulated an industry is, the higher the risk of scapegoating.</p><h2>The Benefits<br>&nbsp;</h2><p>The benefit of a comprehensive legislation-focused regulatory compliance monitoring infrastructure is essentially the reduction of risk. This includes not just risk of harm by the AI system itself, but reduces the risk to the company due to demonstrating effort towards compliance. It also enables better marketability, as products with good safety certifications will soon be preferred (and likely eventually legally required) now that AI risk is more in the public and policy conscience.</p><p><br>Consider <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/R-Bridges-v-CC-South-Wales-ors-Judgment.pdf\">Bridges v South Wales Police</a>, where the court found in favour of Bridges on some elements not because the AI system was biased, but because a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) had not been carried out. Put simply, SWP hadn\u2019t&nbsp;<i>made sure </i>it wasn\u2019t biased. A DPIA is a foundation-level document in almost any compliance procedure.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1><p>Compliance Monitoring is amongst the most powerful policy / regulation components in terms of impact, yet is largely neglected by AI Safety research.

In addition, we launched the new fund as a \"beta\" version to help our donors understand the increased uncertainty.</li><li>A shift in donations from better-researched &nbsp;cause areas and interventions to our more speculative Democracy Fund.&nbsp;<i>Medium risk</i>: We expect the \u201cbeta\u201d label to mitigate this risk as well. In addition, we explicitly communicate to our existing donors (e.g. through our newsletter) that we recommend the new fund only for&nbsp;<i>additional</i> donations and discourage the reallocation of existing or planned commitments.</li></ul><p>Overall, we expect the benefits of the new fund to outweigh the potential risks.

If I spend less on the Airbnb then this you get money back.</p><p>Location: To be announced, less than 3 hours traveling from Amsterdam Central station, somewhere in the Netherlands. The location is going to depend on the exact number of people.</p><p>Deadline for registering: Friday 16th of February (you are registered if you filled in the form&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;booked a call with me; see how to participate for more information).&nbsp;</p><p>I will be the facilitator of the retreat, note that I am not a professional nor a licensed therapist and will also not give any therapy, that is the work of the actual therapy sessions you book. &nbsp;</p><p>There will be a maximum of 6 participants</p><h3>TLDR</h3><p>This is a retreat similar to a meditation retreat but instead make as much progress as possible on your mental health by emotional work meditations, (self)therapy, and everything else that seems useful.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Description</strong></h3><p>As Effective Altruist we want to to do the most good we can which is a challenging task. This can bring emotional problems with it like worrying if you are good enough, imposter syndrome, or feeling constant pressure to work hard. Emotional struggles like this can hinder our productivity and progress and reduce the amount of good we can do.</p><p>But it\u2019s hard to make real progress on stubborn emotional problems in the occasional spare hours we squeeze around our hectic daily schedules. Setting aside a long stretch of focused uninterrupted time in a retreat setting away from distractions and the obligations of work and family allows you to go much deeper.</p><p>The aim of the retreat is to dive deep and make as much progress as possible to increase your emotional well-being and mental health in a long-lasting way by working on concrete issues you are struggling with. This could be emotional challenges like repetitive negative thoughts or feelings, and unpleasant or unhelpful behavior that is routinely in your mind or gets consistently activated in particular scenarios.</p><p>Examples include procrastination, low motivation, being less productive than you would like, wishing you had more confidence to take better actions, fear of judgment by others, high anxiety in certain situations, and distracting yourself with Twitter/Facebook/Netflix.</p><p>These problems can be very challenging to deal with. They often have an emotional component and may feel difficult to overcome. Another challenging aspect is that we are often only partly aware of why these thoughts are there, yet we notice they influence our behavior or mood unhelpfully.</p><p>Luckily, there are ways to make progress on these issues. By investigating our behavior and learn and ingrain more helpful patterns into our brain we can slowly adapt ourselves. Much of my current thinking comes from this post about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ\">memory reconsolidation</a> and the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.nl/Hardwiring-Happiness-Practical-Reshaping-Brain-ebook/dp/B00DVW8VN2/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hardwiring+happiness&amp;sr=8-1\">Hardwiring Happiness</a> that uses the science of Positive Neuroplasticity to shape your brain for the better. Additionally, I am a big fan of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st\">Internal Family Systems therapy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf\">Focusing (see Focusing chapter CFAR Handbook)</a>. There is much more to say about this and you also don\u2019t have to buy into these frames to join the retreat as I am happy to discuss what works best for you.</p><p>I will facilitate the whole week so you can work on this, and I am there to help you in any way possible. I will also make sure everybody feels welcome, included, and safe so you can entirely focus on your mental health progress. However, as a participant, you will be in the driver's seat when deciding what techniques and therapy modalities you want to practice. Together, we will make a schedule that fits you and that you are entirely on board with and excited about. I will point you to resources you can explore and techniques you can try out beforehand so you become well-prepared for the retreat. The typical day looks like silent meditation retreats but then focuses on emotional work and (self)therapy. It is recommended to be silent for the majority of the time to allow for deeper introspection. Here is an example schedule to give you an idea of what a day could look like (don't worry if you don't know all the terms). This is just an example schedule; you could do much more therapy or self-therapy if you have the energy or you could practice other kind of things.</p><ul><li>4-6 hours a day of emotional work meditations (HEAL from Rick Hanson, loving-kindness, self-compassion)</li><li>1-3 hours a day of Introspective self-therapy (Internal Family Systems, Focusing, Core Transformations)</li><li>0-2 hours a day of professional therapy from a therapist; I highly recommended booking therapy sessions during the retreat</li><li>~1 hour of physical exercise like walking, running, fitness, yoga etc.</li><li>'Do-nothing therapy ' for the rest of the day: sit, relax, and get bored. Only make sure you are not ruminating.</li></ul><h3><strong>Is this retreat suitable for me?</strong></h3><p>It is my first time organizing such a long retreat; therefore, it will be a bit experimental. Also note that I am not a therapist, although I don't expect this to be required. I will mainly be the facilitator and encourage you to book therapy calls where I expect most of the progress will happen. I believe that longer retreats like this can significantly improve your mental health and that this will have long-lasting benefits and, hence, one of the best investments you can make in your life. One of the aims of the retreat is to confirm if this is indeed the case. I recommend this retreat for people familiar with improving their mental health, who know what they can handle and feel comfortable diving deep. I don't recommend this for people who struggle with moderate to severe depression or have any other condition that might make this tricky for them, as I am not a licensed professional nor a therapist who is trained to deal with this.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How to participate</strong></h3><p>To register for the event, please fill out this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjn3eNiis9XjzBZsXGTjA_F-YAYAxexS__M7IoB3ggqxSAqA/viewform?usp=sf_link\">Google Form</a> and book a call with me (see the Google form for instructions). This call is to get to know each other better and determine if the event fits you. I want to create a safe container and ensure everybody who comes knows what they can expect. So, reach out to me if you have any doubts; I am happy to try to find a solution that addresses any concern you have.</p><p>Payment for the retreat happens after assessing from both side at the intro call that there is a good fit and before the first of the two preparation calls, see below.</p><h3><strong>Structure before and during the retreat</strong></h3><p>Before the retreat, there will be three calls besides the intro call. Two preparation calls and one call to get to know the other participants. The first preparation call and meeting with other participants is 3 weeks before the event and a second one 1 week before the event. In the first preparation call, we will make an individualized plan on what types of meditations and therapy you want to try out and explore. I will also point to resources you can read up on to better understand what mental health progress could look like and build your own mental model. The most important thing is that you get clear on how to make progress and get excited about the plan. One week before the retreat, there will be another check-in to see how you are doing and to create a more concrete plan for the retreat. Now that you have tried many techniques and seen which ones you liked and didn't like, you can better determine which type of meditation and therapy you want to practice. Note that you can always use your intuition during the retreat to adapt your plan if you see that a previous thing is not working.</p><p>During the retreat, everything is optional, but by default, we will have daily check-ins to see how everything is going and adjust course if necessary. You can also ask questions during the whole day, although it is encouraged to stay silent and only ask them during the check-ins. Additionally, we have group check-ins with a frequency determined by the participants to catch any group dynamic issues and share our journey to create a more cohesive group. Meditations will be done together as much as possible to develop accountability and routine. Besides this, there is no fixed schedule, and participants will have their personalized plan that, as said, can be adapted as necessary.</p><h3><strong>Logistics</strong></h3><ul><li>The event will take place in an Airbnb where we have the space for ourselves, and everybody has a separate bed but might not have a separate room.</li><li>The idea is that everybody arrives Friday evening, 8th of March, from 6 o'clock onwards and Saturday morning we start with the official program. Joining later or leaving earlier is possible, but please let me know. The program ends Sunday afternoon at around 2 o\u2019clock.</li><li>Together, we will go to the supermarket so everybody can buy groceries for themselves. The idea is to stack for multiple days, so we only have to go to the supermarket 2 or 3 times.</li><li>Food is not included in the price</li><li>Everybody helps cook 1 or 2 times in total for the week.</li></ul><h3><strong>About me</strong></h3><p>This is an independently organized event by me. I have run several mental health-related workshops at the EA Summer camp and the LessWrong Community weekend, managed a 4-day event for CFAR alums, and lately organized a 1-day mental health retreat. Recently, I have spent two months full-time improving my mental health, and in general, I am excited about techniques to get the most out of life. Currently, I am working full-time to shape my career path toward helping other EA people flourish.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Raymond Koopmanschap"}}, {"_id": "zMhTvp5zF2QGgwYFA", "title": "Why I think it's net harmful to do technical safety research at AGI labs", "postedAt": "2024-02-07T04:17:15.275Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "remmelt"}}, {"_id": "T5XNiQ3EBvv6vuDvt", "title": "Generating More Surplus in Moral Trades", "postedAt": "2024-02-06T19:58:07.819Z", "htmlBody": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>This post is a continuation of my earlier \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/23CjXyD5qpD4iqo9T/modeling-moral-trade-in-antibiotic-resistance-and\">Modeling Moral Trade in Antibiotic Resistance and Alternative Proteins</a>.\u201d  Here I\u2019ll give some ideas for ways to generate more surplus when making a moral trade.</p>\n<h3>Moral Trade Marketplace</h3>\n<p>Fundamental to an efficient market is a marketplace.  While I can\u2019t make a fancy website to facilitate transactions (though I can imagine the potential for one in the future), I can make a Google Doc.  If you want to get in on the action and find others to make moral trades with, go to the new <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmA9AHUezzSv2WxBEljmpc9I5bJL5F5WdF7zTkO_leE/edit?usp=sharing\">Moral Trade Marketplace</a>.  It\u2019s simple, but it should allow you to find others who have values and beliefs that differ such that you can trade.</p>\n<h3>Identify Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Finding more opportunities for trade will, of course, generate more surplus.  One way to start would be to list rough cost-effectiveness estimates for different interventions by worldview and seeing which ones could generate surplus.  I\u2019ve started to do so <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPU6TP7-WSAXB3loiIBuOGWVfCqK64Bmc-LMvHMIB7A/edit#gid=2098378663\">here</a>, but it would be easy to develop further.  You could find potential traders by looking at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IeO7NIgZ-qfSTDyiAFSgH6dMn1xzb6hB2pVSdlBJZ88/edit#gid=1149727382\">previous grants</a> from EA funders and finding others who have funded the same organizations.</p>\n<h3>Trade off the Negatives First</h3>\n<p>One way to generate more surplus is to trade off funding for the intervention that the other worldview finds least cost-effective, or even negative.  For example, if environmental and nonhuman animal-focused people were trading, the nonhuman animal-focused people might request that the environmental people take funding from a rewilding program instead of a solar research program to reallocate to the alternate intervention.</p>\n<p>People may be incentivized to engage in activities that are lower rated according to worldviews they don\u2019t hold, since they may get better terms for trading them off.  However, a competitive market should filter this out, and it may not be difficult to determine when someone is doing this.</p>\n<h3>Add More Parties</h3>\n<p>Add more parties to the trade.  While the default might be a trade between two actors, adding more distinct worldview holders will increase the potential for surplus.  Calculations can be seen <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPU6TP7-WSAXB3loiIBuOGWVfCqK64Bmc-LMvHMIB7A/edit#gid=695470489\">here</a> for a three worldview trade.  However, with more worldviews, more time and effort must go into establishing trust, reviewing historical records, and debating cost-effectiveness estimates.  In many cases, especially with larger trades, I would expect the increased possible surplus to overcome this challenge.</p>\n<h3>Popularize Moral Trade</h3>\n<p>As part of this, it\u2019s important to know actors with a wide range of moral views, including both those inside and outside of the EA community.  It\u2019s also important that they be open to learning about moral trade and take seriously the option of engaging in one.  Those with more money, and moral views that are less likely to change, will be able to make more and larger trades over time.  More actors in the market will make it more competitive and efficient.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/quentin-mot-1\">Quentin Mot</a> for feedback on this post.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Pete Rowlett"}}, {"_id": "bXcz8mvifFyQNXo8G", "title": "From Laboratories to Language Models: Can AI Support Rigor in the Jungle of Policy Analysis? (Linkpost)", "postedAt": "2024-02-06T18:51:35.345Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bXcz8mvifFyQNXo8G/gu4fyyhfrj0ccsmjn00e\"></figure><p>From my conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>Within many scientific fields, procedural standards such as experiments and statistical significance tests can produce results that are more accurate and easier to verify\u2014even for non-experts. In some fields (e.g., microbiology), developing such standards required tools that made them reasonable or enforceable, such as microscopes to test theories through observation. However, such high-quality standards have long been impractical for many topics in national security and foreign policy\u2014as well as the social sciences more broadly, <a href=\"https://www.stimson.org/project/the-future-of-social-science-and-national-security/\"><strong>which those policy topics often rely on</strong></a>. Some nice-sounding due diligence standards (e.g., \u201ctest your claims against all relevant case studies\u201d) are difficult to enforce because they demand too much from researchers or the standards are hard to operationalize (e.g., what counts as a \u201crelevant\u201d case study?). Formal peer review can help but is often slow and fails to catch some errors in research. Thus, it can be difficult for policymakers to determine which (if any) analysts and their assessments are reliable.&nbsp;</p><p>Should analysts give up hope of meaningfully improving rigor in these areas? Will the domains forever be treacherous jungles of complexity to their audiences and inhabitants? Perhaps, yet the ascendance of LLMs over the past two years offers some reason for optimism: it is entirely plausible that these and related AI models will enable better methods this decade, such as by making qualitative data collection more practical or by generating initial rebuttals to one\u2019s analysis. As <a href=\"https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/microscope#microscopic-aberrations\"><strong>with the earliest microscopes</strong></a>, such tools will likely require further improvements before scholars can trust them with some tasks, but if effective, they could significantly reduce some of the barriers to empirical analyses and operationalize due diligence standards that were previously unenforceable. Thankfully\u2014unlike with many policy questions\u2014researchers can begin <i>experimentally</i> evaluating LLMs\u2019 usefulness for policy analysis and social science. Given how valuable even marginal improvements in national security and foreign policy assessments could be, more scholars and analysts should thoroughly explore the tools\u2019 potential and prepare for their integration where appropriate.</p></blockquote><p>In the preceding section I go into detail on four categories of use cases, including \"smart search,\" larger-scale/replicable qualitative coding, preliminary argument review, and animal models for human interactions/reasoning.</p><p>To be clear, I think there's a decent chance that even if these tools became demonstrably effective, the vast majority of social scientists and policy analysts still would <i><strong>not</strong></i> use or require them in the near term. If the tools do work, one of my main theories of success is more like \"convince people working on the most important problems (which may tend to be people working on AI policy/safety and thus much more inclined to adopt these tools) to use these tools where appropriate,\" perhaps with assistance or legitimization from some early-adopters in other fields.</p><p><strong>If anyone knows of quantitative or qualitative studies of scientific tool adoption\u2014especially empirical analyses of the most predictive factors\u2014please let me know! I'd love to get a better estimate on the likelihood, shape, and pace of adoption (conditional on different levels of performance)</strong>.</p>", "user": {"username": "Harrison D"}}, {"_id": "p7mBWLMKKA2RZzti3", "title": "Moral Licensing\n~ the makings of a very negative-sum game?", "postedAt": "2024-02-08T13:39:15.615Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Recently reading the post on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d8nW46LrTkCWdjiYd/rates-of-criminality-amongst-giving-pledge-signatories\">rates of criminality amongst giving pledge signatories</a> and especially given the Sam Bankman-Fried fiasco, I thought moral licensing might have something to answer for.

My diet aims to be vegan, affordable, evidence-based, time-efficient and is quite ascetic. The intersection of these criteria seems close to EA and also different from how most people think about their diet. Therefore, I thought perhaps posting this might be helpful for some EAs who have thought very little about this but would like to learn about more optimal diets.</p><p>Moreover, I am interested in feedback from others who have done other or more research and come to other/supplemental findings - what am I missing?

As far as I understand, the only diet with considerable evidence is the Mediterranean diet as a whole. This is why, as I explain below, I am trying to make my diet as conformant as possible with the Mediterranean diet.</p><h3>The diet itself</h3><p>Please note that I am above average in terms of physical activity and seem to have a pretty high metabolism. I think the diet below comes out to more than 3000 calories per day. However, I think one can fine tune the diet below to drastically lower the calories, especially by cutting down on olive oil and perhaps also peanuts (and perhaps compensating with other legumes). In fact, I suggest for anyone looking to adopt this diet to start with my diet below in cronometer.com and then fine tune based on individual needs and preferences.</p><p>The diet consists of the following items and quantities. Note that this is a daily average, I do not consume all items every day. Instead, I aim to consume them all over a week such that the daily average ends up close to the following:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/buze9djYDYggqoSRs/msikmxxmylazrt2pleul\"></p><p>Then some notes on how to make this more time-efficient/ascetic:</p><ul><li>Once a week I lightly (5-7 minutes) steam 4-5 crowns of broccoli, blend with olive oil and keep in the fridge to be eaten over 5 days (2 days a week are without vegetables due to my concerns about extended fridge life of this puree) during a week. I find high-powered blenders required to properly cut the stems.</li><li>The legumes are just the canned type and I just drain, rinse and eat out of the box.</li><li>Based on whether I think I need more carbs or more proteins, I change the proportions of the following and eat as much as possible after having consumed the other items:<ul><li>The legumes</li><li>Oats, wheat/spelt and rice. I pick whatever is most convenient in terms of \u201cform factor\u201d such as pasta, bread or just plain cooked rice. I usually just dip bread in olive oil, or sprinkle olive oil on top of the rice). Sometimes I sprinkle some chili, squeeze some lemon and sprinkle some soy sauce and olive oil on top of rice or pasta - I guess I am not a complete ascetic haha</li></ul></li><li>My analysis indicates I might be short on vitamin D and B12 from the above, so I take these daily as supplements. I also take algal omega 3 in the form of DHA and EPA as the diet lacks in this (I think it only contains&nbsp; the ALA form that is much less bioavailable and the Mediterranean diet includes a lot of fish) and this is somewhat likely to be important for both short-term and long-term well-being</li><li>I also consume some fruit (perhaps equivalent to 5 oranges a week). Nutritionally, this is perhaps not strictly needed according to the calcs below, but as I am inspired by the Mediterranean diet and I am sure most people in those studies ate some fruit, I eat whatever and whenever convenient.</li></ul><p>Please note that the choice of items above is based on analysis as explained below. There is a reason for not eating cashews as part of the nuts and seeds portion, and for not including peas as part of the legumes part of the diet.</p><p>I should also note that I from time to time \u201crescue\u201d meat and dairy products. This would either be leftover meat from my family that is about to get thrown out or I might find about-to-expire meat on discount when in the grocery store. So my well-being on this diet might derive partially from this small addition of animal products although according to science the above diet is highly likely to cover all nutritional needs. More on this in the section below on methodology and how the diet practically integrates in my life.</p><h3>Methodology for developing the diet</h3><p>The diet was mostly developed around 2010 using a tool from the now defunct website whfoods.org. I never really formally investigated the non-profit behind the website, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WorldsHealthiestFoods\"><u>George Mateljan Foundation</u></a>. However, during my ~5 years of reading their research summaries and using their information, I never really came across anything that seemed unscientific. Moreover, the other people using the information seemed all to have the same impression as me: The information is comprehensive, evidence-backed and trustworthy.&nbsp;</p><p>More specifically, the website had some sort of diet calculator which is what I used to calculate my budget. It seemed to work on a principle of grouping food into nutritional groups (e.g. cauliflower and broccoli ended up in the same group, but so did crimini mushrooms!) and then one could indicate how much one ate of each food group during a week. The final outcome was a probabilistic assessment of likelihood of deficiency in different nutrients.</p><p>Here is roughly what I remember using as input:</p><ul><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Race/ethnicity: White (I think for especially D vitamin calcs but not sure as I do not remember them asking for skin tone)</li><li>Where I live: Northern Europe (again, I think for D vitamin calcs)</li><li>Weight: 75kg</li><li>Height: 190cm</li><li>Age: 35 (I am not sure which nutrient requirements change with age unless for children or &gt;60 year olds so I am not planning on changing anything soon)</li></ul><p>I then input different quantities in different food groups, seeking to find the smallest quantity of vegan food that as well as possible with high likelihood satisfied nutritional requirements. That resulted in the diet above although I was not able to remove the non-zero likelihood of being deficient in B12 and vitamin D without including dairy and/or meat.</p><p>I then recently discovered cronometer.com that does the same as the calculator above, but for each specific food item. I then inputted this diet, realized both that certain items were unnecessary (like tahini which I no longer consume) and that I was likely lacking in other nutrients (like vitamin A, hence the addition of carrot juice).</p><p>I also made some choices beyond the above:</p><ul><li>I mostly consume broccoli as a vegetable. The reason is that this to me seems like one of the most researched vegetables and it seems quite high ranging in terms of positive health effects. It is also easily available year round and it is relatively easy to cook in a healthy manner.</li><li>I have added \u201cconvenient variety\u201d by eating a wide range of legumes. I do not think this is strictly necessary but I understand that variety is a factor making a diet more healthy. And it is super easy to include different legumes in the diet as I simply open cans of beans.</li><li>Certain things are impacted by living in a family with 2 small kids. I would have liked to eat brown rice, but we always forget to put it on in time (it takes forever to cook!).</li><li>There are certain items I have included not because of strict nutritional needs. Examples are:<ul><li>Green tea - to stay focused throughout the day</li><li>Raisins - I am working out quite a bit and have a goal of building muscle in my core as I do desk bound work and have a small back injury</li><li>Olive oil - I include a bit of this to try to approximate the Mediterranean diet given my vegan and time-efficiency concerns</li></ul></li><li>I also encourage people to try to make the diet more appetizing and varied if possible. For example, I used to sprinkle turmeric, cumin, chili and some other spices on top of the beans with some olive oil. I also used to sprinkle cinnamon on top of my porridge. I do not have time for that right now but might do so again in the future - spices do contain a lot of nutrients and seem to confer quite a bit of benefits compared to their quantity, e.g. like turmeric.</li></ul><h3>After 10 years on the diet - how am I doing?</h3><p>I feel pretty good and all metrics I have evaluated (blood tests and other medical check-ups, though not for diets specifically) shows that I am super healthy. I do exercise according to common advice (e.g. 150 minutes vigorous exercise per week) so my health is not only down to diet. I also have very low levels of stress - this could possibly be partially explained by the diet e.g. through superb gut health. Yeah, on that, gut health does mean slightly elevated levels of gas production - you\u2019ve been warned, haha!</p><p>I did try something very close to this diet for about 5 years. I then tried eating \u201crescued\u201d meat a couple of times and suddenly I was consistently waking up 30-60 minutes before the alarm clock. I do not know what happened there but I have since eaten rescued meat a couple of times per week in order to increase my waking hours (I value being awake more than asleep!). If I remember correctly, I was then taking B12 supplements so it was something more than that I think.</p><p>I have also had one episode where I got this slight tension in my head for a couple of months. The doctor said maybe it was zinc deficiency but taking supplements did not help. I did not change my diet and it went away.&nbsp;</p><p>Lately, and after COVID, I have had the return of these slight tensions in my head but I do not think it is down to the diet. COVID for me also coincided with having 2 small kids and the doctor told me many dads (!) came to him complaining that they didn\u2019t feel that good after having kids.</p><p>Just sharing the above as there is some possibility these challenges could be at least partially due to my diet.</p><p>I live with my partner and our 2 small kids. The diet is actually a good thing in this context as they eat much more meat than I do. This has the following benefits:</p><ol><li>Whatever they eat, we need to prepare much less of it as there is 1 adult less to consider (much less chopping of onions!) - saving time</li><li>It is cheaper for the family overall</li><li>The kids are occasionally curious and seem to think tofu for example, is not that bad (even uncooked straight out of the packaging as I consume it!)</li><li>The diet lets me eat pretty vegan while my family eat a more typical carnivorous diet without the need for time and hassle of preparing 2 different meals every time.</li></ol><h3>Uncertainties/further investigations</h3><p>I am a bit uncertain about creatine. Is that what might have caused my energy boost from eating meat? Or should I take extra anyways?</p><p>With the diet I am kind of hoping for both increased energy levels in the short-term and longevity/extended productive life in the long-term. Is any subset of Bryan Johnson\u2019s supplement regime likely to be low-cost and uncontroversially likely to help me out? I have heard that caffeine is not that great and I consume a lot of green tea. Apart from sleeping more, is there more I can do? I also consume a bit of nicotine for productivity, probably offsetting some of the benefits of my diet. My nicotine consumption is probably on average about 1mg/day so still pretty low (13mg in a cigarette!).</p><p>A last thought I have had is that what might have made the Mediterranean diet impactful was that the food was good tasting (perhaps the nutrients in the food somehow interacts with endorphins released during eating?) and also eaten in a social, slow context. While I eat with my family, it is often done quickly and it is definitely nowhere as tasty as what I think most people on the Mediterranean diet eat.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/arepo?mention=user\">@Arepo</a> for quickly reading through (mistakes are my own) and coming with suggestions for improvements, especially pointing me to the cronometer.com website which let me fine-tune my diet and not just this post!</p>", "user": {"username": "Ulrik Horn"}}, {"_id": "JLgMvTsYB8nGwLC8E", "title": "A Special Issue on Effective Altruism in the Georgetown Journal of Law and Public Policy ", "postedAt": "2024-02-06T07:29:07.160Z", "htmlBody": "<p>A collection of articles on the ethics of EA.&nbsp;<br><br>H/t to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/jeffsebo?mention=user\">@jeffsebo</a>, who has an article with the catchy title \"Esoteric Altruism: Does Effective Altruism Require Its Own Destruction?\".

In 2018, she co-founded a local EA chapter in Lille, where she then lived. Other notable accomplishments of hers, among the many altruistic actions she took, include catering for several animal advocacy and EA events in France between 2020 and 2023, as well as co-organizing the <a href=\"https://www.question-animale.org/fra/estivales-2022\">2022 edition of the&nbsp;<u>Estivales de la question animale</u></a>, an annual French-speaking effective animal advocacy summit.&nbsp;</p><p>With steadfast sentientist and antinatalist beliefs, she was particularly dedicated to the idea of reducing suffering whenever possible.

There is no point funding 'scientific' measures to combat future outbreaks, when those measures are unlikely to be effective - if not totally counter-productive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Definitions</h1><p>What is Science? Science is a method of inquiry which uses experimentation, observation, and hypothesis testing to identify characteristics of the natural world (or some part thereof).</p><p>What is a Pandemic? A pandemic is an outbreak of a deadly, contagious pathogen which has infected many people across large geographic areas. A pandemic is kind of crisis: a rare and extremely harmful event.</p><p>Why does Science fail in a pandemic? Several reasons\u2026</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Long-Term Data Problem</h1><p>As a general rule in research, the more data you have, the stronger your theories will be. Equally, the less data you have, the weaker your theories \u2013 if indeed you can justify any theories all. Science has strict minimum requirements (which is why we can trust it) and a sufficiently large \u2018representative sample\u2019 is one of them.</p><p>What is our pandemic dataset? Is it representative? Does it allow us to draw scientific conclusions about pandemics and how they should be managed? Let\u2019s consider the potential evidence\u2026</p><p>How many outbreaks of dangerous pandemic-potential pathogens (\u2018PPPs\u2019) have there been in recorded history? Quit a lot, actually. If we included every major outbreak in every country, all the way back to the Plague of Athens, we\u2019d have hundreds. So that\u2019s a good start.</p><p>For how many of them do we have robust data? Bar Covid-19, none. (And even Covid-19 is debateable).</p><p>Our ability to collect and store this kind of data was minimal for most of human history. Moreover, the germ theory wasn\u2019t confirmed until the late 1800s so, in a way, we didn\u2019t even know what the \u2018data\u2019 was. There are major epidemics which killed millions, and yet we\u2019re still debating which pathogens might have caused them. While we can learn from these scraps of data, we have nothing like enough to reach robust scientific conclusions which can dictate our policy-making today.</p><p>If we <i>did</i> want to do robust science on pandemics, we would need comprehensive datasets from dozens of major epidemics \u2013 per pathogen! We\u2019re nowhere near that point, and I hope we never get there either. Humanity is not long for this world is we have to live through dozens more Covid-19s before we finally learn how to protect ourselves from respiratory PPPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Short-Term Data Problem</h1><p>So that\u2019s the long-term data problem, but what about when we are in the midst of an outbreak? What can we say about the data available to us and our ability to process it?&nbsp;</p><p>Our knowledge of the pathogen will always lag its spread. The first case we identify is rarely, if ever, the first case in the outbreak, so we know from the very start that we are playing catch up. The pathogen will always be spreading somewhere, out of sight, and the official number of cases identified will always the absolute minimum. This data deficit is just a fact of life in epidemic control.</p><p>If the pathogen is mutating, then our knowledge will also trail the evolution of its epidemiological characteristics and the symptoms it presents, which further complicates the game of catch up. Every variable needs its own representative dataset, so every mutation puts additional demands on our data collection and processing capacity. In these environments, the variables can multiply faster than the data can be collected, which means science cannot function.</p><p>We saw this during Covid, where the pathogen mutated and the strains multiplied. That was a major spanner in the works for the people trying to control the outbreak, but also for the scientists trying to establish its epidemiological features. Then the vaccines arrived, which was good for the people controlling the outbreak but worse again for the scientists, as their data requirements multiplied once more. And all of that was on top of the minimum data needed to stratify the results by country, age, sex, pre-existing conditions, etc.</p><p>Even if we did have perfect datasets, the process of scientific research is too slow to make it useful in an epidemic. It takes too much time to collect the data, analyse it, interpret it, publish it, and then get it in front of the relevant policy-makers. By then, the information is already months out of date. It\u2019s hard enough playing catch up, but it\u2019s near impossible when you\u2019re looking in the rear view mirror. And yet, that\u2019s the best that science can offer us.</p><p>To be clear, I\u2019m not just saying that science is unsuited to a pandemic, or that it is inadequate and other methods are necessary. I\u2019m saying that, in addition to those points, science cannot function <i>at all</i>! Scientific research stops being scientific in a pandemic. It cannot do what it is supposed to do, much less what we unreasonably expect of it. It\u2019s like a car driving through 5 feet of water: first the engine fails, then the wheels to lose contact with the ground. You don\u2019t have a car anymore; you have some kind of floating wreckage.</p><p>The effects of this can be seen in the published academic research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Contradictions</h1><p>We have academic papers telling us that masks worked during the Covid-19 pandemic and we have academic papers telling us that they did not (I am deliberately using the word \u2018academic\u2019 here, not \u2018scientific\u2019).</p><p>We have academic papers showing that lockdowns were effective and we have other papers proving conclusively that they were a waste of time.</p><p>To this day we have academics telling us that there is \u201cdispositive\u201d evidence that the pandemic began in a wet market in Wuhan, while other papers demonstrate that it cannot possibly be so.</p><p>Perhaps my understanding is simplistic or na\u00efve, but if they\u2019re all applying the same scientific method, to the same data\u2026 shouldn\u2019t they all produce the same results? Even if we allow for a healthy dose of variation, true science should not produce conclusions that are diametrically opposed to each other. Scientists may disagree on the size of the effect, but not on the sign, surely?</p><p>There may be many different explanations for these contradictory results, other effects at work, but I\u2019d argue that the possibility that science simply cannot function as intended in an extreme and dynamic environment like a pandemic would have to be one of them. We will never have enough data to reach a scientific consensus on any matter.</p><p>But even if we did, science would still fall short of what we need if we are to permanently protect ourselves from these kinds of threats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Making Statements vs Making Decisions</h1><p>Even if we did have exhaustive datasets on pandemics throughout the ages, and even if we did generate comprehensive datasets in real time as the current outbreak unfolded, and even if all of my aforementioned concerns could be allayed, we would still be left with the same question which spurred all that data collection and analysis in the first place: what should we DO with that information?</p><p>As has been discussed in this parish before, the purpose of science is to make statements, but in a crisis like a pandemic, we need to make <i>decisions</i> and take <i>actions</i>. Making statements and making decisions are completely different things, and the former does not automatically determine the latter.</p><p>Science tells us that the pathogen is becoming more contagious. OK, what should we do about that?</p><p>Science screams from the rooftops that \u2018masks work!\u2019, but I ask you again: what should we <i>do</i> with that information \u2013 wear masks 24 hours a day? The statement of fact does not lead us to a single course of action. Even perfect science still leaves us with the hardest part of the problem.</p><p>Some pieces of information can be decisive in determining our actions (e.g. there is cholera in the water =&gt; don\u2019t drink it) but these situations are rare. So even when science is functioning as it intended by providing us with robust statements of fact, we will still need other methods to make the right decisions to safely navigate volatile and dangerous environments. Hence why we need to let go of the scientific&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>If science really held the answers, wouldn\u2019t we have \u2018solved\u2019 Covid-19 long ago? There were so many scientists in the media, in the policy discussions, at the highest levels of influence, and yet the Covid-19 outbreak turned into a global catastrophe.</p><p>And if pandemics really were amenable to science, wouldn\u2019t we have also reached a scientific consensus on pandemic policies by now? We\u2019ve had centuries of practice, yet as things stand in early 2024, we seem further from consensus than ever. I\u2019d argue that we are less capable of protecting ourselves from PPPs today than we were in 2019, or even 2003.</p><p>Science fails in a crisis, as the Covid-19 pandemic showed clearly. It could not function as intended and it failed to provide us with the answers and direction we needed. It should be clear now that other methods are required.If the world is to protect itself from future PPPs, it will need people who know how to plan and prepare and make big decisions in the moment guiding our responses, not more campus academics or medics prescribing cures. Science is fine in calm seas, but Risk Management is needed in a storm.</p><p>My next piece will be a case study of a decision from the Covid-19 pandemic which was of immense consequence. It will demonstrate that not only does the scientific method fail in a crisis, it can lead you to the worst possible conclusions.</p>", "user": {"username": "PandemicRiskMan"}}, {"_id": "zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H", "title": "Research Report: Improving Access to Palliative Care in Sub-Saharan Africa", "postedAt": "2024-02-13T00:59:42.177Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Authors: Kaitlyn Hobbs, Sophia Seidler, Mo Putera</strong></p><p><strong>Reviewer:&nbsp;</strong>Morgan Fairless</p><p><strong>Date of publication:</strong> December 2023</p><p><strong>Research period:</strong> Research Training Program 2023</p><p>This report was conducted within the pilot for Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s Research Training Program in the fall of 2023 and took around eighty hours to complete (roughly translating into two weeks of work).

Of these people in need, 78% live in low- and middle-income countries. For children, 98% of those needing palliative care live in low- to middle-income countries with almost half of them living in Africa. In 2014, it was estimated that only 14% of people needing palliative care at the end of life, actually receive it.</p><p>Globally, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is referenced as one of the most under-developed and under-serviced region when it comes to awareness and provision of end-of-life care.&nbsp;Palliative care is an essential component of medical care for incurable, life-threatening illnesses to reduce the suffering of those affected.</p><p>We propose enhancing palliative care accessibility by providing medical advice, safe access to pain management, and additional support as necessary, collaborating with existing hospitals and community health centers to identify and systematically address gaps, offering training to local staff, and supplying required materials and medications to facilitate palliative care both at home and in hospital settings.</p><p>To ameliorate the burden of suffering in SSA, we propose implementing a charity that trains staff to deliver at-home palliative care.</p><p>We found evidence to support the idea that a charity could make change in this space, as exemplified by Hospice Africa, but did not find any studies or impact assessments that evaluate the effectiveness of current organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>We evaluated candidate countries in SSA for increased or improved PC services based on the scale of suffering burden as well as indicators of neglectedness and tractability. That said, several caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting the results. All in all, these factors proposed Zimbabwe as the top candidate region.</p><p>We confronted challenges in evaluating an outcome during our cost-effectiveness analysis but ultimately resolved this by reporting the cost per day of serious-health suffering (SHS) averted. With discounting, the geometric mean of the analysis came to $5.35 per SHS day averted.</p><p>Altogether, we propose funding a pilot project with a monitoring &amp; evaluation component to fill the evidence gap for effectiveness.</p><h1><br>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Background</h1><h2>1.1 Definitions and scope</h2><h3>1.1.1 Defining palliative care</h3><p>Palliative care is considered specialized medical care focused on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a life-threatening disease. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family. It is applicable at any stage of a serious illness and can be provided alongside curative treatments. The care team often includes doctors, nurses, and other specialists who work together to provide an extra layer of support aiming to address as many needs as possible including not only physical but psychological, social and spiritual needs.&nbsp;</p><p>It is proposed that palliative care needs slightly vary in the context of Africa compared to generalized global definitions (Clark et al, 2007). In addition to pain and symptom management as well as emotional, social, and spiritual support, income generation and financial support for food, shelter, and funeral costs, among other needs, may be included in palliative care in Africa. That said, our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.cnb5nwrfzhru\"><u>theory of change</u></a> outlined in this report only details provision of physical and psychological pain management tools but has the capacity to develop social, spiritual, and alternative means of pain relief in collaboration with local entities after a formal needs assessment takes place (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.p8cnnzvz2pyc\"><u>3.4 Approaches to Evaluation</u></a>).</p><h3>1.1.2 Models of Palliative Care Delivery in Sub-Saharan Africa</h3><p>An observational study of palliative care in Kenya and Malawi in 2015 generalized three models of provision of care (Clark et al, 2007): The specialist service model, district hospital model, and community model. The specialist service model entailed provision of care, referrals, and knowledge-sharing typically led by a doctor. District hospital models were often nurse-led and provided the most diverse range of services including but not limited to bereavement, social and nutritional support. Care was provided to in-patient, out-patient, and home-based patients and referrals for continued care could be made to other hospitals, health centers, or specialist clinics. The community model was also typically nurse-led but differed from the prior two models in that it would not be able to refer patients for continued care elsewhere. Care provision was holistic but relied on volunteers.&nbsp;</p><h3>1.1.3 Benefits of providing at-home palliative care</h3><ul><li>Increased access to care for those not living near a hospice or hospital or where capacities are reached&nbsp;</li><li>Avoids capacity limitations and cost of hospital transfers for in-patient care</li><li>Allows individuals to die at home, as preferred</li><li>Generally cost-effective, according to WHO\u2019s programme guide and Lancet Commission</li></ul><p>Due to the aforementioned benefits of providing at-home kits and PC services over in-patient care, the former became the focus for the proposed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.cnb5nwrfzhru\"><u>theory of change</u></a>.</p><h2>1.2 Order of magnitude of the problem addressed</h2><p>Serious health-related suffering (SHS), defined by Lancet Commission as suffering that cannot be relieved without medical intervention and when regular functioning is compromised (Knaul et al, 2017). SHS is often experienced by individuals at end-of-life. Around 78% of people in need of palliative care in their last year of life live in LMICs with only 14% of them receiving it (World Health Organization, 2016; Connor et al, 2020). Nearly half the number of children in need of palliative care in LMICs live in Africa. The figure below highlights the global burden of serious health-related suffering (SHS) where, within LICs, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) carries the greatest share (International Association of Hospice and Palliative Care, 2015). Given several reports and data sources indicating a large burden of end-of-life patients in Africa, we decided to focus subsequent research there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Figure 1.&nbsp;</strong>Rate of people per 1,000 population with SHS by income group (top) and region (bottom).</p><h3><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/cllfhz4syuwcethmkwsr\"><br>&nbsp;</h3><h3>1.2.1 Importance of Palliative Care</h3><p>WHO\u2019s&nbsp; <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/csy/palliative-care/whpca_global_atlas_p5_digital_final.pdf?sfvrsn=1b54423a_3\"><u>Global Atlas of Palliative Care</u></a> states that the accessibility of palliative care is an obligation under international human rights law as the right to palliative care and pain relief is recognized under the human right to health.&nbsp;</p><h2>1.3 Cause area review</h2><p>Previously, Happier Lives Institute (HLI) conducted a cause-area review for pain relief in which increasing access to opioids in palliative care of LMICs was estimated to be most promising (Dupret et al, 2023). In decreasing order of estimated cost-effectiveness, other evaluated intervention strategies included: supplying palliative care centres with opioids in LICs, increasing access for migraine medication in LMICs, and task-shifting psychotherapy for chronic pain.&nbsp;</p><p>A previous investigation into pain relief in low-middle income countries (LMICs) as a cause area was also compiled by two other RTP researchers (their work can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16YT9sAuwt5FAYB7-AYJfc711C4RHeShV2pcV-64Xx7w/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Cause Area - Improving access to pain relief in LMICs (Juan and Alex)</u></a>). The authors focussed on approaches to reducing chronic primary and secondary pain in LMICs and explored three intervention strategies; first, advocacy for increased access to opioids in palliative care; second, supplying palliative care centers with opioids was proposed, with the aim to reduce opioid shortages where policies already exist; and third, outreach for use of migraine medications. Of the investigated interventions, the authors proposed looking further into using advocacy campaigns for opioid use during palliative care in LMICs. Their primary concerns relate to HLI\u2019s cost-effectiveness calculations; particularly, the high household spillover rate of 53%, and uncertainties around the conversion rate between numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and subjective well being (SWB) scales.</p><h2>1.4 Intervention Scope&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite back-of-the-envelope calculations supporting approaches to increase access to opioids in LMICs, a shallow dive into the matter revealed concerns around diversion of pharmaceutical opioids as a result of transport routes through Africa (United nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2023). Several challenges and considerations for improving access to opioids include obtaining import and export permits, licensing physicians, nurses, and/or other healthcare workers to prescribe opioids, collaborating with a government body that regulates medications to ensure monitoring is possible, identifying qualified transport companies, ensuring tamper evident seals and a chain of signatures are used throughout the shipping process to track and authenticate all orders, monitoring sales patterns for upticks that may indicate diversion, among other considerations. Opiate-based pain medications are also subject to strict regulations due to their severe potential side effects. Since these regulations exist in high-income countries and appear sensible from a medical perspective (Joransen, 1990), we see few opportunities to bypass these regulations to improve access to opiates in low-income countries (LICs).&nbsp;</p><p>Although there is notable importance in overcoming barriers to accessing opioids for effective pain relief in PC patients, first, there is a seemingly greater need for establishing PC services in LMICs and enabling access to all forms of end-of-life support. This is is particularly apparent in Africa where PC is sparsely developed or equitable (Rhee et al, 2017). Therefore, we believe that creating conditions that allow for appropriate therapy with opiate-based pain medications in regions where opiates are medically approved and regulated at present, along with other evidence-based treatment approaches in life-limiting stages of disease, is a more promising approach to reducing suffering caused by substandard healthcare services.</p><h1><br>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Theory of change&nbsp;</h1><p>The goal of this intervention is to reduce suffering and improve quality of life by increasing dignity and the ability to adapt to progressive diseases in regions where access to such relief is sparse or non-existent. This aim will be pursued through the effective alleviation of pain and other forms of severe health-related suffering (SHS). A new organization could aim to increase access to palliative care in countries with inadequate coverage.</p><h2>2.1 &nbsp; Scope of the intervention</h2><p>We propose improving access to PC through provision of medical advice, safe access to adequate pain management, as well as additional support if needed. The approach is to collaborate with existing hospitals and/or community health centers. The organization would attempt to identify gaps in the availability of PC and to address them systematically. To close these gaps, training would be provided to the local facility's hospital staff, and necessary materials and medications will be supplied. This is intended to enable palliative care for people in their home settings as well as ensure access to palliative support for those already hospitalized.</p><p><strong>Explanation of color coding:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Green:&nbsp;We do not expect this uncertainty to be much of a burden</p><p>Orange: This might not be super easy to address and could be relevant regarding the expected success/ cost-benefit ratio of the intervention</p><p>Red: We&nbsp;expect this to be a high burden or uncertainty that could potentially kill the idea</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/jihkwbkav9k97p2e6jei\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/yp4jrnlq8hungububcv3 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/n3aa6zgqrmdwe1tsbr3e 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/aafpzxmxkiislptrnqji 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/kbtnssdzm40sfpavtxkg 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/am2vhyq08juuioaroazz 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/glhpzh0d2krxudzsjfmo 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/ukgiixshtucgfnoo9quy 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/zu5h6zibtcrb38v8umaj 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/kwghzgnsrtvxbpmq4nuu 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/s2tzwlrvm2bxgb6xgk01 1280w\"></figure><h3>Activities</h3><ol><li>Adapt existing flow charts/guidelines for palliative care that are easy to follow for field staff. <u>Actor:</u> organization's employees (can e.g. be done by the Founders = 2 P).</li><li>Cooperation with the local government and healthcare facilities to utilize available resources for implementation/enhanced availability of palliative care.&nbsp;</li><li>Run a survey to identify gaps and needs in PC in a specific region.</li><li>Assistance in securing materials/medications, financial and logistical support.</li></ol><h3>Outputs</h3><p>Intermediate Output:</p><ul><li>Guidelines that can be followed by PC workers</li><li>Existing resources are being utilizes&nbsp;</li><li>Existing needs are identified&nbsp;</li><li>Material and medications are provided</li><li>No financial or logistical burdens hinder PC center to exists</li><li>Framework conditions (financially and logistically) are set up that enable PC</li></ul><p>Final Output:</p><p>Ensure facilities that have trained staff, can provide access to medications and other necessary supplies, and can assist people with at-home care.</p><h3>Outcomes</h3><p>Intermediate Outcomes&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Increase in access to guideline-aligned PC due to providing guidelines and education of PC staff</li><li>Increase in access to adequate pain medication due to ensuring general availability in PC centers and provision of home-care kits</li></ol><p>Final Outcomes</p><ol><li>Early identification, correct assessment and treatment of pain and other issues.</li><li>Sufficient relief in pain and other causes of suffering (eg. respiratory distress)</li><li>Increase dignity, quality of life, and the ability to adapt to progressive disease</li></ol><h3>Impact</h3><p>Increased well-being/ reduced suffering&nbsp;</p><h2>2.3 Outlining assumptions and levels of uncertainty&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Assumption 1: Guidelines for palliative care exist and can be reframed to be easily followed by local healthcare staff</strong></li></ul><p>If we want to establish a sufficient treatment for severe&nbsp;health-related suffering, a guideline is necessary as it simplifies the treatment itself and allows for measurability of success in its implementation. We do not think this should be much of a burden, because guidelines for palliative care already exist with mention of international standards and it should be fairly easy to adapt them.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 2: Collaboration with local levels of government is plausible.</strong></li></ul><p>To utilize available resources (e.g. existing healthcare centers/doctors/nurses/etc) as well as to source out some of the regulatory and organizational costs, it is essential to collaborate with local policymakers.</p><p>We see a large burden here, especially in countries with corrupt governance where funding for additional stocks of medication, health system monitoring, and other resources may not be prioritized. Tractability should therefore be well-represented in the GWFM and might outcompete other aspects.</p><p>Aside from quantitative proxies like the Fragile State Index\u2019s components, it might also be worth looking at qualitative data such as whether other organizations have tried and failed to implement similar interventions.</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption3: Collaboration with local healthcare facilities is plausible.</strong></li></ul><p>To utilize available resources (e.g. existing healthcare centers/doctors/nurses/etc) it is essential to collaborate with local healthcare facilities. Therefore things like their general willingness to cooperate and possible bottlenecks such as lack of capacity in terms of space and time, as well as personnel shortages, must be considered.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 4: A survey is suitable for identifying gaps and needs in PC in the region the NGO is planning to operate.</strong></li></ul><p>To address a problem sufficiently it is necessary to identify the biggest needs, concrete bottlenecks, and gaps that need to be closed.</p><p>We assume that a survey can help identify these gaps and needs as well as serve as a tool for later evaluations.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 5: Access to pain relief medication is relatively unimpeded.</strong></li></ul><p>The organization needs to ensure access to adequate pain medication. As we believe this might be one of the greatest burdens to overcome for a country without external support, this should be a top priority of the nonprofit organization. This is likely a major barrier to overcome in countries where opioids are illegal or disincentivized. That said, it could be controlled by choosing to operate in a country where legal or social barriers are minimal.</p><p>Means to mitigate drug stock-outs include: making sure there is more than one pharmaceutical supplier, requiring manufacturers to maintain an&nbsp; inventory of ingredients for critical drugs, having a third party (ie. government) keep a stock pile of critical drugs, and building redundancies in the drug supply. These tasks may be beyond the scope of a pilot intervention but could be worked towards through collaborations with government and health partners.</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 6: Nonprofits can assist local facilities in terms of financial and logistical support.</strong></li></ul><p>There might be some logistical or financial burdens a local facility would face when trying to implement a comparable intervention by itself, that are way easier to tackle for an organization working from abroad/having international contacts and reputation.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 7: No additional considerations are required for the successful implementation of a well-equipped setting for palliative care.</strong></li></ul><p>To make the treatment accessible for people affected we would need to ensure facilities to have trained staff, can in practice provide access to medications and other necessary supplies, and can assist people with at-home care.</p><p>We expect there to be a broad variety of reasons why the named activities in our causal change do not necessarily lead to the establishment of well-equipped settings for palliative care in 100% of the cases (among others e.g. the density and quality&nbsp; of existing healthcare and the availability of medical personnel in the country where we want to operate).</p><p>This should be expressed in the CEA with a reasonable discount rate. We think it would be most accurate to incorporate different discounts for 'best case scenario', 'worst case', and 'median case' / 'best guess'.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 8: Availability of trained staff does in fact increase access to guideline-aligned palliative care</strong></li></ul><p>The organization aims to ensure treatment according to the best available evidence on palliative care.&nbsp; The organization's approach to doing so is to provide guidelines, educate staff, and provide materials needed besides drug therapy/ in addition to drug therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus it is not said that trained staff and the material accessibility of goods lead to accurate treatment in 100% of the cases.&nbsp;</p><p>This should be expressed in the CEA with a reasonable discount rate.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 9: There are no unforeseen barriers to making the indication/ prescribing/ delivering/ administering pain medication&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Ensure the access to adequate pain medication does not necessarily lead to patients in fact getting them. We expect there to be a broad variety of reasons why the mere availability of drugs does not necessarily lead to patients in fact getting and taking them in 100% of the cases. Among others we can think about the following barriers:</p><ul><li>(1) Indication -&gt; prescription: People who are authorized to make the indication and prescribe the medication are needed (most likely doctors)&nbsp;</li><li>(2) Stock -&gt; patient: The drugs have to be delivered to the patients (stock to the patient)</li><li>(3) Patient -&gt; treatment: Patients need to be able/ willing to administer drugs&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Opiophobia may reduce the efficacy of (1) and (3).</p><ul><li><strong>&nbsp;Assumption 10: Increase in access to guideline-aligned PC and adequate pain medication leads to early identification and correct assessment of need as well as improved treatment</strong></li></ul><p>The measures addressed do not guarantee for achieving the intended effect of&nbsp;early identification, correct assessment, and treatment of pain and other issues in 100% of the cases.&nbsp;</p><p>This should be expressed in the CEA with a reasonable discount rate depending on how likely it is that meeting assumptions 8+ lead to early identification, correct assessment, and treatment of pain and other issues.</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 11: Early identification, correct assessment, and treatment of pain leads to sufficient relief of pain and other issues</strong></li></ul><p>If the need for adequate therapy is met we can be reasonably confident about it being beneficial for the people affected. Nonetheless, we should correct in some order of magnitude how much adequate therapy means in terms of relief in pain and other causes of suffering e.g. respiratory distress.</p><ul><li><strong>Assumption 12:&nbsp;Relief in health-related suffering improves quality of life&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>If the need for adequate therapy is met we can be reasonably confident about it being beneficial for the people affected. Nonetheless, we should&nbsp;correct in some order of magnitude how much relief in pain and other causes of suffering e.g. respiratory distress means in terms of improving quality of life, and the ability to adapt to progressive disease.

This could be accomplished by utilizing Hospice Africa Uganda\u2019s Needs Assessment questionnaire (Kikule, 2003) or developing one alike. The figure below also highlights several key considerations that may help guide a needs assessment prior to formalizing intervention details.</p><p>From a monitoring &amp; evaluation perspective it should be defined what indicators should be monitored by program staff to check if staff is indeed trained, access to medications and supplies have improved, and patients requiring PC do get them. Several means to assess quality of care exist in developed countries and may be referenced for this purpose but were not researched due to time limitations.</p><p>The intervention program should also come equipped with a means to measure its operational efficacy. This could benefit from further research.</p><p><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/jgtvtvrqfqww3npb94yv\"></p><p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Integrating palliative care into district health services - questions to consider (<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/250584/9789241565417-eng.pdf\"><u>WHO&nbsp;</u></a>Figure 10, p. 41)</p><h1>3 Quality of evidence</h1><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KLy0PzzZzy_ra-Sy-3RVldystf7nf3ace4aONkmPU6s/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>#RTP23H4: (ER) Improving access to pain relief in palliative care of LMICs (Mo Putera, Kaitlyn Hobbs, Sophia Seidler)</u></a></p><h2>3.1 Evidence that a charity can make change in this space</h2><p><i>(This section\u2019s content is taken from the links in&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.13cgh5abwiq6\"><i><u>section 6.2</u></i></a><i>)</i></p><p>We did not find studies in the academic literature that evaluate the effectiveness of existing charitable organizations in this area; therefore, we rely on claims not sourced from the academic literature, but instead made by various organizations working in this space.

The following section elaborates on the latter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In summary, we suggest that the uncertainty in PC interventions reducing SHS&nbsp; mainly relates to concerns associated with the measurability and feasibility of randomized studies in palliative care settings, rather than indicating a genuine absence of the effects of the interventions.</strong> Though there are challenges in conducting randomized control trials (RCTs) on palliative care patients (Visser et al, 2015), a more in-depth analysis of the evidence is needed to provide further validation for this hypothesis.</p><h3>Evidence on effectiveness of varied PC interventions in developed countries</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924791/\"><u>Aslakson et al. 2014</u></a> published a systematic review of 37 studies completed in the US and France evaluating 30 different interventions to better integrate palliative care and intensive care unit (ICU) care. The key takeaways are as follows:</p><ul><li>Evidence of effectiveness depended on outcome measured:<ul><li>Most interventions decreased hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS)</li><li>All interventions (except two) had no effect on mortality</li><li>Few interventions significantly affected family satisfaction</li></ul></li><li>No evidence of harm from any intervention</li><li>Low evidence base quality made it hard to draw conclusions, due to&nbsp;<ul><li>Heterogeneity of interventions&nbsp;</li><li>Heterogeneity of outcome measures&nbsp;</li><li>Most studies being underpowered&nbsp;</li><li>Most studies being subject to multiple biases&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>The difficulty of assessing impact of interventions on family satisfaction (likely generalizes to other types of palliative care as well):<ul><li>High baseline family satisfaction (~70%) made many studies underpowered to detect statistically significant changes</li><li>Patients and families might be invested in believing that they receive \u201cgood\u201d care and reticent to criticize caregivers</li></ul></li></ul><p>Regarding this evidence, it seems necessary to note that it relates to palliative care in developed countries, not in low-income countries. Therefore, the effect cannot be directly extrapolated without discounting for generalisability. We are somewhat perplexed by the study's result that the interventions had no impact on mortality since palliative care is not intended to influence a patient\u2019s prognosis. At most, it can be assumed that this conclusion signifies that there is no negative effect in terms of increased mortality, which would be a desirable outcome and align with the assertion that no adverse effects have been detected.</p><p>Interpreting the lack of improvement on family satisfaction, the authors of the study refer to a relatively high baseline satisfaction of families before the intervention. We assume that this could be different in LIC due to the absence of palliative care structures, potentially resulting in a larger spillover effect on family members than what may be demonstrated in the present study. However, a more detailed analysis in this regard is necessary before making substantiated assumptions, particularly when considering quantitative aspects.</p><h3><strong>Evidence on outcomes of various PC interventions</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392418304688#abs0010\"><u>Ahluwalia et al. 2018</u></a> published an evidence synthesis of 139 systematic reviews of palliative care interventions, conducted with the goal of informing the fourth edition of the National Consensus Project Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care.

Thus the consistently described insufficient data regarding significant effects of palliative care measures raises concerns about the effectiveness of the intervention being evaluated here. Particularly, the fact that palliative care involves additional measures for alleviating suffering beyond mere pharmacological pain management fundamentally complicates drawing conclusions about the effect size of individual interventions. Nonetheless, reasons persist for adhering to the planned intervention. An aspect worth noting is that throughout all the studies, no averse effects have been reported.&nbsp;</p><h2><br>3.3&nbsp; Evidence on other key uncertainties</h2><p><strong>Assumption 1: Guidelines for palliative care exist and can be reframed to be easily followed by local healthcare staff</strong></p><p>The following guidelines for palliative care were found with mention of international standards:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.nationalcoalitionhpc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NCHPC-NCPGuidelines_4thED_web_FINAL.pdf\"><u>Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care</u></a></li><li>See also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/250584/9789241565417-eng.pdf\"><u>Planning and implementing palliative care services</u></a> (p 14 f)</li><li>WHO-recommended<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554435/\"><u> analgesic ladder</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.thewhpca.org/images/resources/npsg/APCA_Standards_Africa.pdf\"><u>APCA PalIiative Care Guidelines in Africa</u></a></li></ul><p><strong>Assumption 4: A survey is suitable for identifying gaps and needs in PC in the region the NGO is planning to operate</strong></p><p>The WHO implemented a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/42919/9241591498.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\"><u>Needs Assessment</u></a> using an interview created by Hospice Uganda for terminally ill persons or their caregivers. They also developed a network of PC professionals to advise the program planning, provide technical assistance, and help obtain resources.</p><p>We assume that a survey can help identify these gaps and needs as well as serve as a tool for later evaluations, thus other tools like focus groups, consultations, etc. could be equally valid.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Assumption 5: Access to pain relief medication is relatively unimpeded.</strong></p><p>The World Health Organization includes opioids on the list of essential medications. Initially, this led us to assume that there should not be a significant regulatory obstacle to granting access to opioid-based pain medications. However, it appears that even an internationally operating organization must adhere to local regulations. Therefore, when considering the feasibility of the operation, a country that permits opioid therapy should be chosen. It should be noted that this could lead to countries with an even greater need in the evaluation being overlooked.</p><p>Several barriers to accessing medication may include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Costs</strong>: Due to the comparably low costs of painkillers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Global-priority_pain.pdf\"><u>(Sharma et al, 2020)</u></a> we do not estimate costs to be a high burden for a nonprofit organization operating in this field.</li><li><strong>Regulations:</strong></li></ol><ul><li>Disincentives to prescribing opioids for pain relief exist in several countries; for example, in Ghana, prescription limits prevent opioids from being prescribed for more than 2 days and in 11 African countries, few local pharmacies are able to dispense opioids (Cleary et al, 2013).&nbsp;</li><li>Although, it is legal to prescribe opioids in Zimbabwe, our proposed intervention region according to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.j9lx2nmbkqat\"><u>Geographic Assessment</u></a>, prescription rate is low (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.vcxedhw2hem6\"><u>6.3 Operating in Zimbabwe</u></a>), suggesting that disincentives may exist and should be further investigated. Disincentives may be reduced through health worker training and adequate guidelines.</li></ul><p>3. Inventory</p><ul><li>We expect to leverage current pain medication stocks, although this assumes they are not in shortage. We did not do research on how to overcome this barrier.</li></ul><p>4.&nbsp;Societal structure</p><ul><li>Collective attitudes towards medicines and end-of-life care</li><li>Presence of multi-family or multi-generational households vs nuclear households.&nbsp;<ul><li>Could be easier to reach caregivers.</li><li>Views on palliative care may be more easily influenced by other household members.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Assumption 11: Early identification, correct assessment, and treatment of pain leads to sufficient relief of pain and other issues</strong></p><p>We are reasonably certain that opioid prescription reduces suffering and related issues. We are less certain that palliative care reduces suffering and related issues (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.xu4gjwwmcel0\"><u>section 4.2&nbsp;</u></a>elaborates on this). We therefore propose discounting the effect size of palliative care to account for mixed evidence quality.</p><p><strong>Assumption 13: Net change of Well-being in Intervention region is positive&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Though beyond the scope of this report, we suggest developing an evidence-backed conversion of SHS to WELLBYs.&nbsp;</p><p>Some considerations on this matter from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/pain-relief/\"><u>HLI\u2019s pain relief report</u></a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Conversion rates</strong>: 1 unit change (0-10 pain scale) \u2192 0.12 units LS, or 1.09 units in negative affect and affective mental health&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Low estimate</strong>: having \u2018extreme pain\u2019 (versus \u2018no pain\u2019) in the EQ-5D is associated with losses of 0.5 (Graham et al., 2010), 0.7 (Mukuria &amp; Brazier, 2013), or 1.3 life satisfaction points (Dolan &amp; Metcalfe, 2012). Birkj\u00e6r et al. (2020) found similar results with a different scale: going from \u2018mild\u2019 to \u2018extreme\u2019 pain (on a \u2018mild, moderate, extreme\u2019 scale) is associated with a loss of 1 life satisfaction point.&nbsp;<ul><li>For context: \u2018extremely anxious or depressed\u2019 ~ 3.6 LS points lost in Dolan and Metcalfe (2012)</li><li>HLI says \u201cconsider going from \u2018no pain\u2019 to \u2018extreme pain\u2019 to be going from 0 to 10 on a pain scale, an 11-point change. Hence, we take the higher end of these estimates, 1.3 points, and divide by 11, to calculate that a&nbsp;<strong>one unit change on a 0-10 measure of pain will lead to a 0.12 unit decrease in life satisfaction</strong>.\u201d</li></ul></li><li><strong>High estimate</strong>: Psychology-based therapies for chronic pain reduce pain by 0.24 SDs and improve SWB (in negative affect and affective mental health measures combined) by 0.26 SDs -- so naively, \u201ca&nbsp;<strong>1-unit decrease in pain represents a 1.09-unit decrease in negative affect and affective mental health measures</strong>\u201d, or&nbsp;<strong>~9x the earlier estimate</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>Why discrepant? HLI: \u201c(1) perhaps psychotherapy for pain improves SWB through channels beyond reducing pain intensity (2) perhaps the regressions only measured life satisfaction whereas these RCT studies of psychology-based therapies measured negative affect and affective mental health\u201d</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Difficulties in estimating conversion rates</strong>: it\u2019s to model a dose-response relationship between pain and SWB, because&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>It depends on what\u2019s being asked &amp; how respondents interpret it&nbsp;</li><li>Pain can also affect SWB in indirect (instrumental) ways, e.g. pain and its causes \u201ccan cause disability or loss of function (which can incur social and economic consequences), preoccupy the mind, or lead to mental health problems\u201d</li><li>Pain affects others too: \u201cby spreading through empathy, by needing others to help, or by lowering one\u2019s social and economic participation\u201d</li></ul></li></ul><p><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/g1kttdaiza1uhyw11vqh\"></p><p>These considerations seem somewhat confusing to us if not partially contradictory, and definitely not straightforward. Due to time constraints, we have not yet been able to come up with satisfactory considerations in this regard. An expert interview with HLI may help provide a better overview and understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>The table below from HLI\u2019s pain relief report represents how they predict the strength of the dose-response relationship between pain and SWB from a search of literature:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Table 1. </strong>Happier Lives Institute\u2019s prediction of dose-response between pain and subjective well-being.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/wnyusdtawqxozh0fhegl\"></p><p><strong>Assumption 14: No unintended effects occur as a result of receiving palliative care from the organization.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924791/\"><u>Aslakson et al. 2014</u></a> didn't find any evidence of harm from any of the 30 different interventions they reviewed within a systematic review. Thus, as far as we can tell, they did not assess opioid-related palliative care, so opioid abuse may still be a concern.</p><p><br>&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Geographic assessment</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oWn5w_cNeGClfEjcep78d-nyGZVRhkmXPWVjPGAyciY/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>#RTP23H4 (GWFM): Improving access to pain relief in palliative care of LMICs (Mo Putera, Kaitlyn Hobbs, Sophia Seidler)</u></a></p><p>Globally, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is referenced as one of the most under-developed and under-serviced region when it comes to awareness and provision of end-of-life care (Gysels et al., 2011). As such, it became the scope of the geographic assessment for this theory of change. We compiled inquiries pertinent to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.cnb5nwrfzhru\"><u>Theory of Change</u></a>, which could potentially influence both the feasibility of implementation and the ultimate impact of the intervention. We then tried to answer them as precisely as possible. First, we identified the area of greatest burden using&nbsp;the reported rate of serious health-related suffering, extracted from the<a href=\"https://hospicecare.com/what-we-do/projects/global-data-platform-to-calculate-shs-and-palliative-care-need/database/\"><u> International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC)</u></a> database. Next, we considered conditions that would influence tractability of this intervention such as, current health care quality and infrastructure as well as conditions of the state. Thirdly, we considered where current intervention strategies are lacking.&nbsp;Finally, we conducted a formal geographic assessment using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.311e0rdeg0j0\"><u>Equation 1. GWFM scoring</u></a> to find the top candidate countries for starting a new nonprofit.&nbsp;</p><h2>4.1 Geographic Assessment</h2><h3>4.1.1 Burden</h3><p>The geographical evaluation of this intervention required different information sources. To assess the scale of the burden within SSA, we conducted a global analysis to ascertain countries with the most pressing need for palliative care. This entailed a quantitative assessment of the rate serious health-related suffering (SHS) per 1,000 population, extracted from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hospicecare.com/what-we-do/projects/global-data-platform-to-calculate-shs-and-palliative-care-need/database/\"><u>IAHPC</u></a> database. The Lancet Commission defines SHS as any suffering that cannot be relieved without medical intervention and \u201cwhen it compromises physical, social or emotional functioning\u201d (Knaul et al, 2017). We think this is valid information to rely on, yet it is worth noting that data avaliable are from 2015.</p><h3>4.1.2 Tractability</h3><p>A tractable region for intervention was expected to be a locale that had some well-functioning pre-existing health care as well as suitable social environments that would allow for ease of program development and collaboration. This can be thought of as a proxy of \u201cease of operation\u201d. To consider the quality of existing healthcare infrastructure and provisions, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/sites/default/files/2018-08/State%20of%20health%20in%20the%20African%20Region.pdf\"><u>World Health Organization\u2019s</u></a> Health Products Infrastructure (HPI) and (Health) System Resilience (HSR) Indicator were referenced. Both represent normalized indices; the former suggests the quality of physical infrastructure, such as&nbsp;presence of basic equipment and density of hospitals, healthcare centers, health posts, and hospital beds.&nbsp;Alternatively, the Health System Resilience indicator provides additional information on the following: awareness of essential services and quality of provisions; diversity in providing a broad range of services; functional mechanisms exist to ensure skills of staff and management are effective and updated; health care organizations are inter-operative and adaptable.</p><p>Social, or \u201cstate\u201d conditions, were proxied through averaging three&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fragilestatesindex.org/indicators/\"><u>Fragile State Index indicators</u></a>: (1) Public Services: the presence of basic state functions that serve the people; (2) State Legitimacy: representativeness and openness of government and its relationship with citizens; (3) Security Apparatus: internal and external security threats to a state and perceived trust of citizens in domestic security.&nbsp;All information referenced was used as input in the formal geographic assessment WFM to measure how much attention each issue is being paid.&nbsp;</p><h3>4.1.3 Neglectedness</h3><p>As an indicator of the neglectedness of palliative care within a country we incorporated information about the number of hospice or PC services per million into the geographic assessment.&nbsp; This includes data from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iccp-portal.org/system/files/resources/APCA_atlas.pdf\"><u>African Palliative Care Association (APCA)</u></a> regarding the density of palliative care services per million inhabitants, according to population data from the World Bank.</p><p>This is in line with an evaluative survey conducted by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iccp-portal.org/system/files/resources/APCA_atlas.pdf\"><u>APCA</u></a> in 2017 of ongoing efforts made to develop or enhance palliative care in specific geographic locales that offered insights on neglectedness. Here as well specifically, the density of hospices or palliative care services per million people was used to reveal proportionally under-serviced areas. For further investigation, it can be considered to incorporate&nbsp; a score capturing how much attention PC is getting, relative to other countries. For instance the percentage of a country\u2019s Gross National Income spent on PC, or the status of Pain relief medication in a country\u2019s essential medicines list.</p><h3>4.1.4 Evaluation&nbsp;</h3><p>We created a&nbsp; list of target countries using an average of subjective weights. One key factor was ease of operation (can also be thought of as tractability), which helped us rule out countries that were too challenging to work in.

Methodological challenges with converting measures of suffering to measures of subjective well-being are also noted. In line with the Lancet Commission\u2019s estimation of palliative patient suffering, we thought it\u2019d be more appropriate to evaluate cost-effectiveness by estimating the number of SHS days reduced through intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>Our cost-effectiveness calculation models a hypothetical 5-year program of free (worst-case) to low-cost (best-case) healthcare staff training in addition to free provision of at-home PC kits and services.</p><p>Based on our cost-effectiveness model, it was estimated that a new home-based palliative care program in Zimbabwe could reduce SHS by one day per patient for a cost between [$0.04, $1,350.40] USD with a geometric mean of $5.35. The primary concern of the calculation is the assumption that receiving palliative care reduces SHS days (Knaul et al, 2017). Note that this may not mean that suffering is eliminated but may propose that a patient receiving intervention is no longer categorized to be experiencing \u201cserious\u201d suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>We derived a potential conversion rate to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.x77f0bi6wq0n\"><u>Appendix: A note on converting SHS days to WELLBYs</u></a>.</p><h2>5.1 &nbsp; Effects</h2><p>The following considerations guided the estimation for effect of implementing new home-based PC programs:<br><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/hkr0lxn5zxjustgdjbfj\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/c5jwrg6tp36bdmequoh8 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/novo7ophoavw37ssme9w 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/wuzan3exd2ypqkehpxuw 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/w0fmd1an0y8dv8avfvhf 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/whrddco5jkamzfk7pa6y 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/vnvatzioowinkckxjdd9 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/mxnt0knqakax0g2rdfdm 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/bi5xqnydejw3kxubktkx 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/lgyaqi07ec3goxwrvh8c 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zFmrrA7CSeoEpgR5H/dojfeo1a5exi7z6cqjhe 918w\"></p><h2>5.2 &nbsp; Costs</h2><p>To estimate costing, we decided on a top-down approach where funding determines the number of people receiving care (as opposed to a bottom-up approach that would estimate the cost of relieving all SHS individuals). In the above analysis, $100,000 was allocated annually to acquire and deliver pain medications and other palliative care products. Adjusting this parameter will affect estimations.</p><p>It\u2019s assumed that philanthropic funding is expected to cover 100% of the organizational costs.

Where appropriate, task-shifting may be applied to reduce the demand on specific health care practitioners (see Tables 3 and 10 of WHO\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/250584/9789241565417-eng.pdf\"><u>guide for programme managers</u></a>). Feasibility of these efforts may be better understood through an expert interview with a PC representative in Zimbabwe.</p><h3><strong>Access</strong></h3><p><strong>Information</strong></p><p><strong>As the intervention is contingent upon this collaboration and many of the key actors presently operating in Zimbabwe and Africa are encouraging of improving PC services, it is not expected to be a barrier.&nbsp;</strong>Collaboration with local governments and health organizations is a key component to this operation that would involve cross-organizational sharing of information. APCA is likely the first point of contact and an organization with whom this intervention would work closely. APCA may offer local contacts in healthcare and government roles who would become additional collaborators.</p><p><strong>Medicines</strong></p><p>It is expected that the at-home PC kit would comprise medicines that are approved and accessible in Zimbabwe. If it is found that additional essential medicines should be included during collaboration with local healthcare providers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/250584/9789241565417-eng.pdf\"><u>WHO</u></a> (p. 55f) proposes the following considerations:</p><p>1. Approval/permission of the health ministry to register the medicine&nbsp;</p><p>2. Importation [of medication]</p><p>3. Contracting, pricing and estimating&nbsp;</p><p>4. Registration [of medication]</p><p>5. Import and export licensing&nbsp;</p><p>6. Storage, distribution and stocking&nbsp;</p><p>7. Education of prescribers</p><p>8. Community education</p><p><br><strong>Relevant stakeholders</strong></p><p>Currently it appears most likely that the key stakeholders and funders would be grants from general philanthropic donations. Therefore, it seems important to account for this in terms of a discount in the cost-effectiveness analysis and to consider additional potential stakeholders.</p><h3><strong>Feedback loops</strong></h3><p><strong>Monitoring reach.</strong> Health workers can record their patient visits systematically either through the current capabilities of the local health system or by way of an extension to the system (ie. through a new means or standardization of reporting defined by the charity).</p><p><strong>Monitoring prescriptions.&nbsp;</strong>It is expected that prescription-monitoring is a capacity of current health systems so would not pose additional challenges.</p><p><strong>Measuring palliative care quality.</strong> It is also important to assess the quality of the palliative care provided. A number of outcome measures and indicators are available to measure the quality of palliative care. Standardized clinical tools should be used to measure symptom burden and functional ability regularly.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/250584/9789241565417-eng.pdf\"><u>WHO</u></a>, 2016. p. 66f)</p><p>See also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23809769/\"><u>quality indicators mentioned in this publication</u></a> and comparison of quality indicators detailed in this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19615636/\"><u>systematic review</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Measuring reduced suffering.</strong> We posit that reduced suffering may be measured through surveys of palliative patients and their caretakers; however, given the state of patients and variability in the experience of suffering, this may be challenging to draw conclusions from.</p><h3><strong>Funding</strong></h3><p><strong>How much funding do they need in general over the course of their existence?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to provide continued care, funding would need to be persistent. Our cost-effectiveness estimate proposes that the first year of operation would cost about $100,000 plus fixed charity start-up costs. We estimate that this cost will be lower in the following years, as some starting as well as administrative costs would not longer have to be taken into account.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that this is so far a very rough estimate and we are reasonably uncertain about the estimated numbers. Due to time constraints we did not include more detailed organizational costs and instead used CE\u2019s estimates for fixed charity start-up costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, we assume that all costs would be covered by the Charity and therefore funding corresponds fully to philanthropic donations. Staff training may also be covered by health care workers, as described in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.6qdkulyf5xfm\"><u>7.2 Costs</u></a>.he cost analysis by the WHO in the funding section of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/250584/9789241565417-eng.pdf\"><u>Planning and implementing palliative care services -&nbsp; A guide for programme managers</u></a> (p. 37) leaves room for further exploration as to whether a distribution of costs to other funders, such as governments, may be promising in the long run.</p><h3><strong>Scale of the problem</strong></h3><p>In 2015, Zimbabwe had the highest rate of SHS in Africa of 81.55 per 1000 population as can be seen in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hospicecare.com/what-we-do/projects/global-data-platform-to-calculate-shs-and-palliative-care-need/database/\"><u>Global data platform to calculate SHS and Palliative Need</u></a>. With Africa representing, on average, the youngest population globally, access to adequate palliative care may become paramount in relieving pain and suffering in the upcoming decades. In Zimbabwe, a continued population growth adds to the expected scale of burden in the future.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Tractability</strong></h3><p>From the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.za1n27wdlf2x\"><u>Tractability</u></a> conditions proposed through developing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.311e0rdeg0j0\"><u>GWFM</u></a>, Zimbabwe appears to be fairly tractable. Potential limitations may include challenges in accommodating Zimbabwe\u2019s 16 official languages; however, leveraging local staff should help to mitigate this concern. Securing relations with the government and current health organizations may also present challenges but is primarily expected to be welcomed (see the above section on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.gblkamtovypr\"><u>Access to relevant stakeholders</u></a>).</p><p>We tried to get a better sense about conditions contributing to tractability of Zimbabwe by looking at additional facts that might be relevant.

This was not included in the CEA as it does not directly or measurably reduce suffering.</p><p>It is also possible that reduced suffering may have positive effects on households and community, as suggested by a large estimated spillover in Dupret et al. 2023.</p><p><strong>Negative</strong></p><p>Due to time constraints, comprehensive evaluation of potential adverse effects was not completed. Given that the organization will be dealing with substances susceptible to abuse, addiction, and severe side effects, we propose further investigation to estimate the extent and probability of such externalities arising.</p><p>We also expect the implementation of at-home palliative care to increase the burden on the healthcare system. This should be mitigated through task-shifting and/or training local community members.</p><h3><strong>Remaining uncertainties</strong></h3><p><strong>The following uncertainties remain (note: this list is not intended to be comprehensive):</strong></p><ul><li>How to estimate reduction of SHS days through deliverance of palliative care</li><li>Whether staffing and medicinal resources will be available</li><li>How readily accepted collaboration would be between current health organizations and government</li><li>What the primary barriers will be in implementing at-home PC in Zimbabwe</li></ul><h1>9 Directing funding towards and existing entity</h1><h2>9.1 Governments</h2><p>According to APCA\u2019s Atlas of Palliative Care in Africa released in 2017, the majority of national governments in Africa reported having minimal funding for palliative care. This indicates that additional funding to support governmental development and endorsement of palliative care programs or subsidizing of universal medical expenses would probably be helpful for many African countries.&nbsp;</p><h2>9.2 Current organizations</h2><p>Among several smaller players, key established organizations that have aims in alignment with this proposed intervention strategy are listed below. For all, the impact of their initiatives on reducing suffering is not reported.</p><h3><strong>APCA</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>has also defined a set of palliative care guidelines, encourages governments to support affordable palliative care in public health services, provides training for community and professional care providers, and suggests research and monitoring and evaluation methods to ensure consistency in care is provided across the continent.</p><p><strong>Effectiveness of operations:</strong> impact is not reported.</p><h3><strong>HOSPAZ</strong></h3><p>is a national private, voluntary association that has representatives in each district and aims to assess and support improvements of palliative care provision in Zimbabwe. The organization coordinates with palliative care providers to build capacity and advocacy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Effectiveness of operations:</strong> from the HOSPAZ website, the mechanisms of action and impact in developing PCs is unclear. Webpages describing the program and palliative care are broken.</p><h3><strong>Island Hospice and Healthcare</strong></h3><p>was the first hospice in Africa, providing home-based palliative care in Zimbabwe since 1979. The organization follows the World Health Organization\u2019s model for PC to offer clinical care, psychosocial support, and comprehensive capacity building for health professionals, spiritual leaders, communities, and alternative medicine providers (Khumalo &amp; Maasdorp, 2016).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Effectiveness of operations:</strong> The Island Hospice and Healthcare website\u2019s \u201cImpact\u201d webpage highlights the reach of their program services in terms of home and clinical visits, phone calls, and office consultations, among a few other metrics; however, an estimated reduction in pain and suffering is not reported. The organization claims to be audited by Deloitte &amp; Touche annually. Audit reports may provide more insight into operations and impact but were not investigated for this report.</p><h3><strong>Hospice Africa</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>has been able to overcome barriers in access to medicine by providing at-home palliative care kits and lobbying for reduced restrictions in opioid-related policies (Jagwe &amp; Merriman, 2007).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Effectiveness of operations:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.hospice-africa.org/\"><u>Hospice Africa</u></a> established Palliative care in 37 countries that would otherwise most likely lack this kind of medical care. They managed to train 10,000 healthcare professionals via short courses and study programs.</p><p>Given the establishment of PC organizations in Zimbabwe, it may be helpful to support current organizations as they continue to mobilize access to and delivery of palliative care in African countries. Expert interviews to ascertain current roadblocks or organizational deficiencies in addition to conducting a cost-effective analysis estimating the counterfactual return of funding these organizations could provide a better understanding of the efficacy of current initiatives and whether a new organization in this space would bring about effective change.</p><h1>9 Conclusion</h1><p>After conducting a comprehensive examination of pain reduction in low-income countries (LIC) that focuses on the scale of the problem, potential barriers, conditions in individual states, and the cost-effectiveness of introducing at-home PC, we assess that the establishment of palliative care in Zimbabwe appears to hold potential, though this is subject to further validation. Specifically, we consider it a cost-effective measure for adequately addressing serious health-related suffering, including the provision of opioid-based pain medications.&nbsp;<strong>As such, we propose funding a pilot project with a monitoring &amp; evaluation component to fill the evidence gap for effectiveness.&nbsp;</strong>As mentioned in section&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_nwofoeVOESfZPeImaPSEw-rzHheesxrWPRCYqThxc/edit#heading=h.qxvmwzd15run\"><u>8.2 Key factors</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.africanpalliativecare.org/web/sites/default/files/2023-10/APCA_STRATEGIC_PLAN_2020-2030.pdf\"><u>APCA\u2019s aim</u></a> to incorporate PC in all levels of health care by 2023 suggest that the near future is a promising time for collaboration and implementation of a home-based palliative care charity organization in Africa.

This post is part of my</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/aY38LaKmqEtoaqyFq\"><i>&nbsp;<u>sequence</u></i></a><i> of GPI Working Paper summaries.</i></p><p><i>If you\u2019d like a very brief summary, skip to \u201cBrief summary.\u201d</i></p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Suppose you may choose to donate to the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF), which is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\"><u>estimated</u></a> to save a child\u2019s life for every ~$5,000 received, or donate to Make-A-Wish, which grants an ill child\u2019s wish for ~$7,500 on average. If you care about maximizing the impartial good brought by your donation,&nbsp;the decision might seem obvious. But Mogensen argues it isn\u2019t, and, more broadly, many EA priority rankings seem to be in tension with reasonable assumptions&nbsp;you might make about rational decision-making under uncertainty.</p><h1>Cluelessness</h1><p>If we choose actions based on their consequences, we have to consider&nbsp;<i>all</i> possible consequences\u2014some of which stretch into the far future. As long as we don\u2019t discount future value, future consequences dominate the differences in expected value between choices, meaning they determine our choices. The problem: we are clueless about our actions\u2019 long-term consequences.</p><p>Mogensen anticipates a&nbsp;<i>Naive Response</i> to this: Cluelessness doesn\u2019t impede our rational decision-making because we can still maximize expected value\u2014we simply account for uncertainty by assigning probabilities.</p><p>He calls this \u201cthe Naive Response\u201d because it doesn\u2019t take the depth of our uncertainty seriously\u2014our evidence often doesn\u2019t even allow us to assign precise probabilities.</p><p>For example, consider the AMF. Our evidence suggests saving children\u2019s lives may indirectly affect population size, but we are uncertain about how. Worse, we are uncertain about whether, at the margin, we want the population to increase or decrease. We also don\u2019t know the political effects of saving lives through a charity instead of local health institutions. Hence, we are so deeply uncertain about the effects of donating to the AMF that we can\u2019t create a precise probability distribution.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"rilhfo6rals\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrilhfo6rals\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrilhfo6rals\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><h1>The maximality rule</h1><p>One way to adapt to such uncertainty is to assess decisions with a set of plausible probability functions instead of just one. Unfortunately, doing so is incompatible with simple expected value maximization, leaving us to find a new decision criterion.</p><p>Mogensen proposes a decision criterion,&nbsp;<i>the maximality rule</i>, that he finds plausible enough to prevent us from ruling it out.&nbsp;</p><h3>The maximality rule (definition)</h3><p><strong>The maximality rule:</strong> We\u2019re allowed to choose an act if no other act has greater expected value according to&nbsp;<i>every</i> probability function in our set of plausible probability functions.</p><p>When we have two acts, and one has greater expected value in&nbsp;<i>some</i> of our set\u2019s probability functions but not all of them, the maximality rule doesn\u2019t prefer that act over the other, but it also doesn\u2019t think they are exactly equal. This is a key attraction of the maximality rule: It \u201cdoes not contrive a preference between incommensurable options where there is none.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"g7tyn1louq\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg7tyn1louq\"><sup><a href=\"#fng7tyn1louq\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Unfortunately, it also has its faults. First, because it considers every probability function, it can prefer acts that don\u2019t have the highest expected value in any of our set\u2019s&nbsp;<i>individual</i> probability functions.</p><p>Mogensen discusses a similar alternative to the maximality rule that doesn\u2019t have this problem, called&nbsp;<i>the</i>&nbsp;<i>liberal rule</i>, but its problems lead him to prefer the maximality rule.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"6i474y4xaxo\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6i474y4xaxo\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6i474y4xaxo\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Mogensen also notes a fault in the maximality rule in the following case:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"in82s7tbune\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefin82s7tbune\"><sup><a href=\"#fnin82s7tbune\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><ul><li><i>p&nbsp;</i>can be true or false. Your set of probability functions gives&nbsp;all probabilities from 10% to 80% to<i>&nbsp;p </i>being true.</li><li>You're first offered bet&nbsp;<i>A</i>, which you can choose to take or leave. It pays $15 if&nbsp;<i>p</i> is false, but costs $10 if&nbsp;<i>p</i> is true.</li><li>Then you\u2019re offered bet&nbsp;<i>B</i>, which you can also choose to take or leave. It pays $15 if&nbsp;<i>p</i> is true, but costs $10 if&nbsp;<i>p</i> is false.</li><li>Accepting both bets guarantees a $5 gain, regardless of whether&nbsp;<i>p</i> is true or false.</li></ul><p>The maximality rule permits us to decline both bets, even though we are foregoing $5 for sure.</p><p>Another similar alternative to the maximality rule,&nbsp;<i>the \u0393-maximin rule</i>, doesn\u2019t have this problem, but, as before, its drawbacks lead Mogensen to prefer the maximality rule.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"rvjqi24dplj\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrvjqi24dplj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrvjqi24dplj\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>So, although some decision criteria are better than the maximality rule in some cases, Mogensen doesn\u2019t think any of them are better overall; we can\u2019t rule out the maximality rule and ought to avoid conclusions that aren\u2019t consistent with it.</p><h1>Implications</h1><p>Donating to the AMF has numerous potential indirect effects, such as the population size. Some of these affect the long-term future, including slightly changing the probability of existential risks.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"rilhfo6rals\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrilhfo6rals\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrilhfo6rals\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Because minute changes to the far future have great significance, they dominate the differences in expected value between our options. The problem: we\u2019re so uncertain about these long-term consequences that we can\u2019t create a precise probability function to define expected values, giving us a reason to consult the maximality rule. Under such uncertainty, Mogensen argues that, in a decision between only the AMF and Make-A-Wish, the maximality rule permits us to donate to either.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"e0ohkg69dhd\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe0ohkg69dhd\"><sup><a href=\"#fne0ohkg69dhd\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>While this conclusion doesn\u2019t necessarily hold in reality, as we can donate to many organizations (not just these two), Mogensen thinks it applies to many highly-ranked EA global well-being charities, as we don\u2019t know the sign or magnitude of their long-term effects (including the probability of extinction).</p><p>As he puts it:</p><blockquote><p>If our evidence cannot rule out that the chance of extinction is ever so slightly higher given a choice to donate to one of GiveWell\u2019s top charities as opposed to an organization like Make-A-Wish Foundation, [people abiding by the maximality rule] arguably need not prefer the former.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, interventions aiming to improve the long-term future or reduce existential risks also lack sufficient evidence of their effects, forcing us to rely on intuitive conjectures with a demonstrably poor track record.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"bas6ghak908\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbas6ghak908\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbas6ghak908\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>Mogensen feels we need more research before we\u2019ll know what the maximality rule would suggest about long-term focused interventions, but he thinks we should be skeptical that it would say we must choose them.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>He concludes:</p><blockquote><p>I do not insist that the maximality rule is correct. I merely claim that it is sufficiently plausible that we cannot rule it out. For all we know, orthodox effective altruist conclusions about cause prioritization are all true. In fact, I am inclined to believe they are. The problem is that I do not know how to set out and argue for a decision theory that is consistent with a long-termist perspective and supports these conclusions without downplaying the depth of our uncertainty. Then again, as a philosopher, I know that I am inclined to believe a great many things for which I lack an adequate response to certain apparently compelling sceptical challenges. Some may share my conviction that this is just one of those cases. But those who are already sceptical of effective altruist conclusions undoubtedly will not.</p></blockquote><h1>Brief summary</h1><p>Mogensen argues:</p><ol><li>When it comes to our actions\u2019 broad effects, we are clueless\u2014we\u2019re so uncertain we can\u2019t assign precise probabilities.</li><li>When we\u2019re clueless, we can\u2019t rule out using the maximality rule and shouldn\u2019t&nbsp;draw conclusions contrary to it.</li><li>Using the maximality rule, we don\u2019t have to donate to the AMF over Make-A-Wish, which probably applies to most other global well-being interventions.</li><li>We need more research to know what the maximality rule would suggest about long-term-focused interventions, but we should be skeptical that it would say we must choose them.</li></ol><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"rilhfo6rals\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrilhfo6rals\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"rilhfo6rals\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrilhfo6rals\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>See <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/andreas-mogensen-maximal-cluelessness/\">pages 13 to 16</a> for a detailed and concrete discussion (especially if you are skeptical of this notion).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"g7tyn1louq\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fng7tyn1louq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"g7tyn1louq\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefg7tyn1louq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>Quote from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/684184\">Bradley and Steele (2015)</a>.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"6i474y4xaxo\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn6i474y4xaxo\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"6i474y4xaxo\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref6i474y4xaxo\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>See <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/andreas-mogensen-maximal-cluelessness/\">pages 10 and 11</a> for the definition and drawbacks of the liberal rule.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"in82s7tbune\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnin82s7tbune\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"in82s7tbune\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefin82s7tbune\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p><a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~adame/papers/sharp/elga-subjective-probabilities-should-be-sharp.pdf\">Elga (2010)</a> identified this problem.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"rvjqi24dplj\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrvjqi24dplj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"rvjqi24dplj\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrvjqi24dplj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>The <i>\u0393-maximin rule</i> requires us to act as if the worst possible expected utility of each act is correct (see <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/andreas-mogensen-maximal-cluelessness/\">page 12 </a>for the proper definition of the <i>\u0393-maximin rule</i>).

The present post explores one of the greatest opportunities AI brings for animals: accelerating the development and mainstreaming of tasty, nutritious, affordable, and convenient alternatives to animal products.</p><p>AI\u2019s potential for alternative proteins is being explored by many companies and other corporate bodies (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalalternativetechnologies.com/\">Animal Alternative Technologies</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.biocraftpet.com/\">BioCraft</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://climax.bio/\">Climax Foods</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cultfoodscience.com/\">CULT Food Science</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eternal.bio/technology\">Eternal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.equi-nom.com/\">Equinom</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ju.st/\">Eat Just</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alt-meat.net/kraftheinz-notco-partner-around-ai-driven-plant-based-innovation\">KraftHeinz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notco.com/us/about/giuseppe\">NotCo</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.proteinindustriescanada.ca/artificial-intelligence\">Protein Industries Canada</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://shiru.com/\">Shiru</a>, to name a handful), a few non-profit organizations (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenprotein.ai/\">GreenProtein</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://new-harvest.org/ai-cellag/\">New Harvest</a>), and at least one national government, with the UK\u2019s Food Standards Agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/media/document/Alternative%20Proteins%20for%20Human%20Consumption.pdf\">publishing a 2022 report</a> that notes:</p><blockquote><p>Combining artificial intelligence and machine learning and other emerging technologies such as 3D printing [...] could lead to an entirely new food production system, in which any desired molecule or food could be synthesised from any feedstock input. This has the potential to profoundly change the types of food we consume in the future, and the way most of our food is produced [...] This may bring considerable benefits for food system resilience and food security, and at the same time help to reduce food waste.</p><p>Nonetheless, research in this area is still in its infancy, in part because many of the companies working on this are keeping their cards very close to their chest. As such, the opportunities listed below are generally avenues where further exploration seems particularly promising, rather than tried-and-tested applications. All corrections, additions, and points of disagreement are very welcome.</p></blockquote><h1><strong>Opportunities</strong></h1><h2><strong>Plant-Based Proteins</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd3ntj5vz0m7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd3ntj5vz0m7\">[1]</a></sup></span></h2><h3><strong>Optimizing the extrusion process</strong></h3><p>Extrusion is the process that converts plant proteins into a food product with the required shape, structure, and texture. This is far more complex than it might appear at first glance. Critical variables include temperature, pressure, moisture content, feed rates (i.e., the speed at which the proteins are fed into the extrusion mechanism), screw speed (i.e., the speed at which the extrusion mechanism operates), and die design (i.e., the shape and size of the molds or \u2018dies\u2019 through which the protein material is forced). Another variable is the ingredients themselves: proteins are complex inputs (especially protein types from non-soy sources, which we know comparatively little about), further complicated by the varying effects of the different \u2018isolation\u2019 methods used to extract the proteins from their original plant source.</p><p>A change to any one of these parameters can yield significant variations in the final product,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/greenprotein-ai-shines-a-light-into-the-black-box-of-extrusion\">often in highly unpredictable ways</a>. Running trials to test which combinations of these parameters are most likely to yield the desired results can be prohibitively expensive, especially for smaller start-ups.&nbsp;</p><p>In principle, AI could radically streamline this process by running simulations using a wide array of ingredients and other parameters to find the most promising combinations. While this is unlikely to entirely replace real-world extrusion trials, at least in the short-term, it can help to whittle down the set of possible combinations so that fewer real-world trials are necessary. This is a key objective of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenprotein.ai/\">GreenProtein.ai</a>, which is developing an AI-powered extrusion model that companies can use to streamline their processes and help turn the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/greenprotein-ai-shines-a-light-into-the-black-box-of-extrusion\">\u2018black box\u2019</a> of extrusion from an art into a science.</p><h3><strong>Mapping unique combinations of plant proteins</strong></h3><p>All the amino acids found in animal-derived products can also be found in plants. As such, in principle, AI can be used to map the protein structures of different animal proteins, then replicate this molecular structure using only plant-based ingredients. (With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/fao-stories/article/en/c/1661991/\">up to 30,000</a> edible plant species in the world, there are many such ingredients to choose from.)</p><p>However, matching the taste, texture, and nutrition of regular meat products requires more than just matching their amino acid profile. It also depends on factors such as the arrangement of those amino acids, the structure of the final plant-based product (and the methods used to achieve that structure), and the reaction with other components (like sugars and carbohydrates) during cooking. Also, different combinations of plant proteins are needed for different processes, such as the extrusion process for plant-based meat and emulsification (the process of combining liquids to create a stable mixture) for plant-based dairy products.&nbsp;</p><p>How can AI systems approximate taste and texture? Often, this is based on human feedback on successive iterations of a product. The models then use this feedback to modify the ingredients and process to better align with the flavors and textures being sought.</p><p>Machine learning models also appear to be getting better at predicting textures themselves. Texture is typically analyzed based on the Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) methodology, with a reference conventional meat product (such a boiled chicken breast) for comparison. Researchers have used machine learning&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/2/344\">to predict \u2018hardness\u2019 and \u2018chewiness\u2019</a> using this TPA framework, with some success. Machine learning has also been used in broader food science applications to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VkeOePabZk\">detect different aromas</a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6yh527dv1yq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6yh527dv1yq\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and sort these into \u2018good\u2019 versus \u2018bad\u2019 smells. A more sophisticated model could in principle distinguish, for example, \u2018meaty\u2019 versus \u2018artificial\u2019 smells.&nbsp;</p><p>This combined machine learning/human feedback approach is used by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notco.ai/index.html\">Giuseppe platform</a> created by NotCo, the company behind NotMilk, NotChicken, and the NotBurger. This platform contributed to the non-intuitive inclusion of cabbage and pineapple in the recipe for their dairy-free milks, and the inclusion of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171214-could-ai-help-create-a-meat-free-world\">broccoli, goji berries, mushrooms and a mystery nut</a> in their chocolate recipe. (This platform incorporates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notco.ai/\">Giuseppe Biagio</a>, a user interface that allows chefs to trial product formulations suggested by the Giuseppe platform, then provide sensorial reviews on those formulations that the model then learns from.)&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/nl-en/2017/06/06/whats-cooking-chef-watson/\">IBM\u2019s Chef Watson system</a> likewise draws on existing recipes to generate thousands of ingredient combination ideas, then uses models of human perception to select the best ones, while a similar model reportedly alerted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ju.st/\">Eat Just</a> to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171214-could-ai-help-create-a-meat-free-world\">suitability of mung beans</a> for their scrambled \u2018egg\u2019 products.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Tailored optimization of plants for specific products</strong></h3><p>AI can be used to map specific plants throughout the entire supply chain, from seed to plate. By monitoring how different crops compare in terms of ease of processing, the taste and nutrition of the final product, and other such metrics, companies can ensure they are using the source ingredients that best suit their requirements. Such requirements vary significantly between products: for example, while some products require arresting flavors, others call for a more neutral taste profile. Similarly, needs for protein content, water solubility, and viscosity will depend on the nature of the target product.</p><p>For instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.equi-nom.com/technology\">Equinom\u2019s Manna platform</a> has information about millions of different seeds, which it can use to select the most suitable breeding combinations of seeds for alternative protein companies\u2019 needs. Their development of Sabra hummus can help illustrate this: first, Sabra requested high-quality sesame that could be locally grown. Manna then identified the biochemical traits needed to meet Sabra\u2019s sensory requirements and recommended some optimal breeding combinations from the millions of seeds on their AI platform. They then bred several lines of sesame seeds, each of which Sabra then used to make their hummus. Sabra\u2019s Research &amp; Development team then tested each hummus on metrics such as taste, texture, and nutrition, and finally selected the best one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another example is Korean food tech company&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theplanteat.com/?lang=en\">The PlantEat</a>, which has used AI to develop a new soybean variation called \u2018Hayoung\u2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vegconomist.com/food-and-beverage/protein/koreas-the-planteat-ai-soybeans/\">that is reportedly</a> tastier, more easily digestible, and less allergenic.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Improving reliability of crop production</strong></h3><p>AI systems can optimize the growth of the crops needed for alternative protein products. For example, in-field sensors can be used to to gather data about the health, size, and quality of crops throughout the growing season, helping producers promptly address real-time risks (such as the spread of disease) and seize future opportunities for improvement (such as altering light levels, spacing, the combination of different kinds of plant, and make-up of soil nutrients). This lends itself particularly well to indoor farming models that allow for closer control of the harvest. A consortium led by Protein Industries Canada is taking this approach for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alt-meat.net/plant-protein-partners-developing-ai-technology-improve-ingredients\">pea and canola crops</a>, to ensure that alternative protein ingredient processors have a more consistent supply of protein to work with.</p><h2><strong>Cultivated Meat</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref15idlwojssy\"><sup><a href=\"#fn15idlwojssy\">[3]</a></sup></span></h2><h3><strong>Optimizing cell culture media</strong></h3><p>The cost of cell culture media is often regarded as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/seren-kell-alternative-proteins/#:~:text=And%20essentially%20it%20came%20down%20to%20the%20cost%20of%20cell%20culture%20media.\">biggest limiting factor</a> to the large-scale production of affordable cultivated meat (though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-cultivated-meat/#Media:~:text=Significant%20cost%20reductions%20are%20possible%20without%20large%20technological%20leaps\"><u>there are some signs</u></a> that significant cost reductions should be possible in the near future, even without large technological leaps.) This is therefore an obvious contender when considering the highest-priority applications of AI for cultivated meat production. Fortunately, it also seems to be a problem for which AI is uniquely well-suited.</p><p>For animal cells, cell culture media typically consists of around 30 to 50 nutrients (including energy sources, amino acids, vitamins, salts, and metals), growth factors (proteins that play a crucial role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation), and other substances that regulate variables such as pressure and osmosis. \u2018Undefined\u2019 nutrient sources, such as animal serum and hydrolysates (complex mixtures obtained from breaking down biological materials), are often used because of their growth benefits: their \u2018undefined\u2019 nature means that the exact composition and concentration of many of the nutrients they contain are not precisely known, and they can interact with each other in complex and unpredictable ways that may significantly vary depending on the types of cells being cultivated. Identifying which of these ingredients are actually needed, and in what quantities and concentrations, is crucial to improving the media\u2019s yield and affordability. Matters are further complicated by the importance of eliminating ethically problematic animal-derived components from the media. The most significant of these is probably fetal bovine serum (FBS), whose use is still widespread in the industry despite many companies having eliminated FBS from their supply chains.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftbee0o6cn\"><sup><a href=\"#fntbee0o6cn\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Given the countless possible combinations of nutrients, growth factors, and other substances, theoretical scientific understanding combined with trial and error approaches can only take one so far. Incorporating machine learning algorithms can make this process radically more efficient by substituting real-world trials with virtual simulations (and also greatly helping researchers to synthesize and apply the sizable existing literature on the topic).&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a group of researchers recently used machine learning algorithms to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bit.28132\">design media with 181% more cells</a> than a common commercial variant with a similar economic cost, while doing so using 38% fewer experiments than the standard experimentation method. This is still a far cry from the radical improvements needed, but it\u2019s at least somewhat promising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969723036112?via%3Dihub\">Another group of researchers</a> used predictive modeling by neural networks to predict the global warming potential, cost, and growth rate of different reduced-serum media formulations for a zebrafish cultivated meat production system. (Reducing the amount of serum is beneficial largely because of the serum\u2019s high costs and the difficulty of predicting how it will react with other elements of the cell culture media, as well as the ethical considerations mentioned above.) The model was able to accurately predict those variables with a success rate of 98%.</p><h3><strong>Image segmentation and classification</strong></h3><p>Microscopic analysis can help assess the number and orientation of cells in a cell culture, as well as individual cells\u2019 health, behavior, and lineage (i.e., what kind of cell they are). Monitoring these features is crucial for cell culture optimization. This task consists of both image segmentation (i.e., separating dense images of many cells into the constituent cells) and image classification (i.e., identifying the individual features of each cell).&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, researchers tend to perform this analysis manually, as the computer systems designed for such analysis (which rely on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://new-harvest.org/app/uploads/2022/12/LitReview_ML_ZacharyCosenza.pdf\">relatively crude measurements</a> of variables such as cross-sectional area, circularity, and pixel intensity) are comparatively rudimentary and unreliable. In principle, Machine Learning algorithms would be well-suited to this kind of task, learning from labeled data-sets to classify images of cell cultures with increasing accuracy. Such algorithms are already being put to similar use in fields such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VkeOePabZk\">pathology, radiology, and medicine</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff7n6rxg7e6d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf7n6rxg7e6d\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>The current limiting factor here is data. Though many cells have been analyzed in this way, annotated cell images have rarely been uploaded into the public domain. This is often because researchers either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VkeOePabZk\">haven\u2019t seen the value of doing so</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsjsn6nj3uk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsjsn6nj3uk\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;or because they (or their employers)&nbsp;<i>have</i> seen the value, and therefore wish to keep such data confidential. There are some exceptions, such as the public repositories&nbsp;<a href=\"https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/\">Image Data Resource</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35662455/\">TissueNet</a>, but a much greater number of relevant images are still needed.</p><h3><strong>Bioprocess optimisation</strong></h3><p>Growing the necessary cell cultures for cultivated meat is extremely costly and resource-intensive. AI-powered predictive analytics could radically streamline the process by monitoring and controlling parameters such as the temperature and pH levels within bioreactors (in addition to the supply of nutrients and growth factors in the cell culture media, as mentioned above), ensuring that these are optimally tailored to cells\u2019 requirements at different phases of the process. This could bring benefits not only in the form of higher quality, greater speed, fewer inputs, and lower costs, but also a smaller environmental footprint, which will be important both in its own right and to secure stakeholder support.&nbsp;</p><p>For example,<i>&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.biocraftpet.com/\">BioCraft</a>, who are working to replace conventional pet food with cultivated meat alternatives,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@shannon_55048/ai-and-the-future-of-pet-food-1a65188c5ec5\">report</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We built our AI to both fine-tune the cell proliferation process and enhance the nutritional value of our cultivated meat. AI is helping us identify and understand connections between biochemical cues (such as nutrients in our growth media) and the outcomes they elicit (such as cell growth). This information helps us greatly narrow down the hands-on experimentation we need to do in the lab, which gets us to the outcomes we want far quicker, and at far less expense.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.animalalternativetechnologies.com/\">Animal Alternative Technologies</a> takes a similar approach. They have apparently used AI to create an entire manufacturing system named the \u2018Renaissance Farm\u2019 that will help willing food businesses produce cultivated meat at scale. This allegedly goes beyond products such as mince or snack-size bites to include whole-cut products such as steak, the structure of which is notoriously hard to replicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Discovering new cell lines</strong></h3><p>AI can be used to select, and engineer, the most productive and stable cell lines for cultivated meat production, and to predict the taste and texture of the end product based on the cell lines and their cultivation conditions. (A cell line is a \u200b\u200bpopulation of cells grown from a single cell or small group of cells and grown in a cell culture.) AI models can gather data on cell lines such as their growth rates, nutritional needs, genetic makeup, and reaction to different cultivation conditions, then identify how these traits correlate with characteristics such as growth and stability. It can then use this information to identify specific genetic modifications that might enhance those characteristics, and test these predictions using simulations of various cultivation conditions.</p><h3><strong>Examining gene networks</strong></h3><p>Gene networks are collections of proteins and molecules within a cell that interact with one another, and with other substances in the cell, to ultimately determine the cell\u2019s function (e.g., whether a cell remains a stem cell or develops into a muscle cell or nerve cell). Understanding these networks in greater detail could help address&nbsp;<a href=\"https://new-harvest.org/app/uploads/2022/12/LitReview_ML_ZacharyCosenza.pdf\">various roadblocks in cellular agriculture</a>, such as \u2018the need to maintain proliferation over long periods of time, differentiation potential into preferred tissues, robustness in bioreactor environments, genetic stability, and survival in [...] culture media\u2019. Machine learning methods could help researchers understand how these gene networks operate under different conditions, and therefore help optimize the cell lines and conditions to ensure that they produce the desired outputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Fermentation</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu8j6bc3k96j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu8j6bc3k96j\">[7]</a></sup></span></h2><h3><strong>Discovery of promising strains and \u2018designer enzymes\u2019</strong></h3><p>AI systems can significantly enhance the efficiency of \u2018high-throughput screening\u2019, which involves the rapid analysis of a large number of biological samples or compounds, to identify the most effective strains for producing specific proteins. (\u2018Strains' refer to microorganisms, such as bacteria or yeast, which are selected or engineered for their ability to produce target proteins in large quantities.) Complementing this, AI can also help to identify the most effective feedstock composition for a particular strain: i.e., finding the right mix of nutrients and materials that these microorganisms need to grow and produce proteins efficiently.</p><p>In addition to aiding the discovery of promising existing strains, AI-assisted synthetic biology approaches can help researchers to design new \u2018designer enzymes\u2019 that function more efficiently than existing ones. AI algorithms can use genetic data to predict which genetic modifications are likely to most increase protein expression levels (i.e., the amount of a specific protein that the microorganism is able to produce) and overall cellular productivity (which encompasses factors such as the microorganism\u2019s health, its efficiency at converting feedstock, its ability to withstand variations in environmental conditions, and its longevity).&nbsp;</p><p>For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vivici.com/\">Vivici</a> uses precision fermentation to produce dairy proteins that can be used in dairy alternatives. They&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vivici.com/newsroom/vivici-selects-ginkgo-bioworks-to-extend-its-range-of-novel-dairy-proteins\">recently partnered</a> with cell programming company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/\">Ginkgo Bioworks</a>, who will use their generative AI platform to provide Vivici with the most promising candidate strains for their purposes. Using these strains, Vivici is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/vivici-launches-nature-equivalent-whey-protein-beta-lactoglobulin-in-2024.html\">expected to launch</a> its \u2018nature-equivalent\u2019 whey protein beta-lactoglobulin product in early 2024. The major whey protein in most mammals\u2019 milks (though not humans\u2019), beta-lactoglobulin is a versatile ingredient that can be used to enhance the texture and \u2018mouthfeel\u2019 of many different foods and beverages.</p><p>Applications of AI for fermentation are greatly helped by broader AI-powered breakthroughs in protein structure research. The main breakthrough has been the creation of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/\">AlphaFold</a>, an AI model developed by Google\u2019s DeepMind that can accurately predict a protein\u2019s structure based on the sequence of its amino acids. (The amino acid sequence dictates how the protein will fold into its unique 3D shape, which in turn determines how the protein behaves and interacts within the body. In the pharmaceutical field, for example, this helps researchers to understand the structures of harmful proteins involved with diseases and design new drugs to target those harmful proteins, including by using AI simulations to test out candidate drugs.)</p><p>The tech-driven alternative proteins company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://shiru.com/\">Shiru</a> is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://shiru.com/post/shiru-is-breaking-ground-in-leveraging-alphafold-to-discover-novel-functional-food-proteins/\">leveraging AlphaFold</a> to identify proteins that can replace traditional ingredients: \u2018We use [AlphaFold\u2019s] protein structure models to help us determine protein function, enabling us to identify the best protein ingredients for all food categories based on their inherent chemical and structural identity.\u2019 This underpins their AI model&nbsp;<a href=\"https://shiru.com/technology/#how-it-work\">Flourish</a>, which identifies naturally occurring proteins that are likely to meet the specifications for a particular product, uses host microorganisms to produce those proteins, tests those proteins in the laboratory and real-world applications, then brings the successful novel proteins to market.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Process optimization</strong></h3><p>As with cultivated meat production, AI systems can analyze critical variables in fermentation bioreactors (such as temperature and pH levels) to minimize time and costs while maximizing growth and protein yield. For example, the company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eternal.bio/\">Eternal</a> reports using machine learning in this vein to optimize their fermentation processes in order to develop their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eternal.bio/mycofood\">fungus-based Mycofood</a>. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pow.bio/\">POW.BIO</a> uses AI-powered process optimization and bioreactor management in their development of a continuous fermentation process that sustains cells at peak productivity while avoiding contamination by unwanted microbes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/9/6/503\">A recent paper</a> applied machine learning models to the fermentation of E.coli and found that the model successfully highlighted fermentation processes that were deviating from expectations, which in practice could allow operators to rapidly detect problems in specific bioreactors and either make the necessary adjustments to get the fermentation process back on track, or halt the process to save unnecessary time and costs.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Cross-cutting</strong></h2><h3><strong>Research analysis</strong></h3><p>AI models can help distill a huge array of scientific literature and make new connections between studies, greatly helping researchers pinpoint the information they need and reach conclusions about the most promising steps to take. This could increasingly take the form of semi-autonomous AI assistants such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06792-0\">Coscientist</a>, \u2018an artificial intelligence system driven by GPT-4 that autonomously designs, plans and performs complex experiments by incorporating large language models empowered by tools such as internet and documentation search, code execution and experimental automation\u2019.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Understanding food chemistry</strong></h3><p>The relation between flavor of ingredients before and after cooking is poorly understood. AI predictive tools could identify what flavor would emerge after a certain cooking process and provide options for different ingredients and processes to use to attain a specific final flavor profile. This is an application being explored by IBM\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/nl-en/2017/06/06/whats-cooking-chef-watson/\">Chef Watson</a>: in addition to its algorithms for selecting the best flavor combinations, it also uses algorithms to identify&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfi.org/blog/how-ai-can-help-fix-the-food-system/\">optimal ingredient proportions and recipe steps</a>.</p><h3><strong>Predictive maintenance of bioreactors</strong></h3><p>In addition to optimizing bioprocesses within bioreactors, as mentioned above, AI can also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.genengnews.com/insights/stars-in-alignment-for-artificial-intelligence-in-bioprocessing/\">help with equipment maintenance</a>, predicting failures and thereby minimizing wasted time and money.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Combination with 3D printing</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://proteindirectory.com/blog/3d-printed-alternative-proteins/#:~:text=In%20the%20alt%2Dprotein%20industry%2C%20cell%20or%20plant%2Dbased,the%20assistance%20of%20a%20human.\">There is precedent</a> for alternative proteins being produced using 3D printers, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plantbasednews.org/news/alternative-protein/worlds-first-3d-printed-vegan-salmon-europe/\">world\u2019s first 3D-printed vegan salmon filet</a> that hit stores last September.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271911/\">There is also precedent</a> for AI being used in conjunction with 3D printing in bioprinting, drugs, gels, biopolymers, and smart materials. Perhaps most relevantly, the two technologies have been used together to print tissues and organs for transplantation, with neural networks predicting the cell viability, mechanical properties and cell proliferation of 3D printed tissues.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Streamlining supply chains</strong></h3><p>AI technology can help to streamline supply chains, helping companies bring down costs and expand into new areas. Supply chain tasks could include analyzing and predicting market trends, optimizing distribution routes and schedules, and automating inventory management. For example, plant-based meat producer Heura&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.qualityassurancemag.com/news/heura-uses-toolsgroup-for-digital-supply-chain-transformation-to-support-global-expansion/\">recently commissioned</a> a provider of AI-assisted supply chain optimization software to improve the planning speed and accuracy of their supply chains to help them expand into new regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Personalized nutrition</strong></h3><p>AI is increasingly being used to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271911/\">generate personalized nutritional guidance</a>. This is especially useful for people with specific nutritional needs, such as pregnant women, school children, athletes, and people with various diseases. This could help people to identify which alternative proteins are most likely to meet their health and nutritional needs, especially in a world where alternative proteins can be specifically tailored to meet such needs (for example, by adjusting the amount of protein, fat, or fiber, or fortifying with vitamins and minerals that specific demographics are more likely to lack), potentially with the aid of personal or local 3D printers.</p><h3><strong>Tailored sales and advertising</strong></h3><p>AI algorithms can be used to collect detailed information about internet users and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/watson-advertising/thought-leadership/how-ai-is-changing-advertising\">tailor advertising</a> to match the interests and behaviors evinced by their online histories. The same product could therefore be presented to one potential consumer based on its health benefits, to another on sustainability grounds, and another on animal welfare grounds, depending on each consumer\u2019s predicted user profile. With organizations increasingly using AI to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/ai-in-sales\">drive up their business-to-business sales</a>, alternative protein companies could also leverage AI to increase take-up of their products by distributors.</p><h3><strong>Consumer appeal</strong></h3><p>Beyond just emulating the limited textures and flavor profiles of conventional animal products, AI can help establish alternative proteins as a fundamentally different, and superior, product. For example, machine learning algorithms can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/bytes-to-bites-part-one-digitizing-consumption-insights-leveraging-ai-in-food-product-development\">continually monitor</a> consumer preferences and market trends to provide alternative protein companies with real-time suggestions for novel products. This approach is already being rolled out in the broader food and drinks industry, such as with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tastewise.io/home/tastegpt\">Tastewise\u2019s TasteGPT model</a>.&nbsp; Largely free from the immensely inefficient biological constraints that face the conventional animal product industry, alternative protein companies would be able to respond to such suggestions at a rapid pace, designing and marketing totally new products from scratch before the zeitgeist shifts.</p><h2><strong>Limitations</strong></h2><h3><strong>Lack of substance</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/the-ai-gap-rabobank-expects-fb-giants-to-stretch-dominance-amid-affordability-barriers.html\">AI-washing</a> \u2018occurs when companies claim that their offerings involve AI technology, but in reality, they either don\u2019t or their connection to AI is minimal and not core to the product\u2019s functionality.\u2019 Its purpose \u2018is to make products or services appear more cutting-edge than they actually are, with the goal of drawing investors\u2019 and customers\u2019 attention.\u2019</p><p>This, combined with the general lack of transparency mentioned above, can make it hard to judge when a company is using AI in a meaningful way, and how. AI-washing and unrealistically optimistic claims about what a company will achieve, or has already achieved, using AI, without solid evidence to back it up, could also lead to skepticism about the entire field from investors, governments, and other stakeholders.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Lack of affordable computing power</strong></h3><p>Handling vast datasets requires a huge amount of computing power. For small companies, this could prove prohibitively expensive.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhokm9314u3a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhokm9314u3a\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While larger companies typically have more capital to invest in the technology required, the overall financial and time investment may be significantly larger if they need to replace or adapt existing systems throughout their operations. Quantum computing has been noted as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/bytes-to-bites-part-one-digitizing-consumption-insights-leveraging-ai-in-food-product-development\">potential game-changer</a> in this regard (though there\u2019s still&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/12/6/23990752/quantum-computers-ibm-google-honeywell-china-supercomputer-artificial-intelligence\">plenty of uncertainty</a> about when reliable quantum computers will be developed, let alone become affordable to alternative protein start-ups).&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Lack of data</strong></h3><p>All of the possible applications listed in this post rely on having a huge amount of relevant data that the AI systems can learn from. Generally speaking, this data is still extremely limited. This is in part due to the infancy of the alternative proteins field (especially for cultivated meat), and in part due to the lack of data-sharing between the companies working in this space (which is detailed in the section below). There are also relatively few research papers in the public domain about machine learning and alternative proteins, especially regarding cellular agriculture. As such, many companies currently need to rely to a great extent on their own sets of data that are collected using costly, time-consuming, often coarse-grained methods. Fortunately, as outlined in the following section, there are various organizations working to address this issue.</p><h3><strong>Lack of collaboration</strong></h3><p>Of course, some of the earlier, larger companies in this space (like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://synthesis.capital/insights/six-predictions-for-2023\">Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat</a>) do now have a lot of data to work with. The issue is that most of the funding in the cultivated meat space is in the form of private investments in start-up companies, rather than public funding for open-source academic work. This leads to a lot of siloing and a relative lack of data sharing.

In this part, I will take the flip perspective: rather than looking at firms, I will look at workers.</p>\n<p>Labor markets are how people earn their living. When labor markets fail to match workers to jobs, productive workers miss out on income that could be transformative for their lives, and the economy loses productive capacity that is essential for growth. So the functioning of labor markets in developing countries is a top priority for anyone who wants to promote economic growth.</p>\n<h2>1. Unemployment is much higher than official statistics suggest; self-employment is akin to unemployment.</h2>\n<p>How high is unemployment in developing countries? This question is surprisingly hard to answer. The typical approach to measuring unemployment is to ask whether people want to work but are unable to find work. By this approach, which is taken by national agencies, the unemployment rate in developing countries is similar to developed countries at 5-6%. (<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS\">ILO</a>)</p>\n<p>However, this approach underestimates unemployment, by ignoring self-employed people. 55% of employment in LMICs is self-employment, rising to a staggering 80% in low-income countries. (<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.EMP.SELF.ZS\">ILO</a>) \"Self-employment\" in developed countries conjures up the images of freelancers, contractors, entrepreneurs---people who choose self-employment because it has benefits over wage employment. However, in developing countries, it's much closer to unemployment. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/4/2287/7181328\">Donovan et al (2023)</a> observe that unemployed workers and self-employed workers switch into wage employment at similar rates, and they earn similar wages after switching. Moreover, self-employment does not seem to be a first step into stable employment; when workers in developing countries move from unemployment to self-employment, they are 24 percentage points more likely to return to unemployment in the next three months, compared to workers in developed countries to make the same move. Finally, a large share of labor market flows (transitions between unemployment and employment) in developing countries is just the movement between self-employment and unemployment, suggesting that people move between these two states at a very high rate. All of these facts suggest self-employment is a close substitute to unemployment. It's obviously not as bad\u2014some income is better than no income\u2014but it suggests that self-employed people want wage jobs just as much as unemployed people, but cannot get them. Thus, there is an unemployment crisis in developing countries much beyond what the official statistics suggest.</p>\n<p>How large is this problem? <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RiMgkKu7DJqfnqU3vIqQszD1TEREY9jf/view\">Breza et al (2021)</a> find that <em>at minimum</em>, 24% of rural self-employment during India's agricultural lean season occurs solely because workers cannot find jobs. If we heroically extrapolate this to a whole country, then the true unemployment rate in low-income countries jumps from 6% to 25%.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-1\" id=\"fnref-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-1\">[1]</a></sup> 25% unemployment is a catastrophic failure, and a crisis that cuts against both poverty alleviation for individuals and aggregate growth. The main takeaway is that unemployment is a much bigger issue than it seems in developing countries, and should be a high priority for development interventions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-2\" id=\"fnref-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<h2>2. Wages are too high, plausibly because of social pressure.</h2>\n<p>Why is real unemployment so high? In a well-functioning market, wages would fall so that firms were willing to hire more of these unemployed workers. More generally, wages should rise when workers are more demanded, and then fall when workers are less demanded. <a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20141625\">Kaur (2018)</a> shows that in village labor markets, the first part is true, but not the second. High rainfall in Indian villages increases yields and thus increases the demand for harvest labor, while low rainfall decreases yields and thus reduces labor demand. Yet wages increase in response to high rainfall, but <em>they do not decrease in response to low rainfall.</em> This failure of wages to move downwards is a key cause of unemployment, because it results in wages that are too high for employers to want to hire workers. While this evidence is specific to agriculture, <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/can-africa-be-manufacturing-destination-labor.pdf\">Gelb et al (2017)</a> show that manufacturing wages in Africa are much higher than those in countries with similar incomes; it stands to reason that this would also cause unemployment.</p>\n<p>Why don't wages fall? Workers surveyed in Kaur (2018) say that wage cuts would be unfair. Furthermore, at labor stands in Kenya, 73% of workers say that their peers would stop talking to them if they worked for below the market wage; 53% say their peers would stop lending money to them; 67% say they would be informally barred from working at the labor stands. (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdNC9bRtmSIpywX65LbgDatxobqlUU2k/view?usp=sharing\">Breza et al, 2023</a>) Moreover, randomly offering workers jobs in private (rather than in public) makes workers 25 percentage points more likely to accept a wage 10% below the prevailing wage. This points to significant social pressure keeping wages too high\u2014a discouraging conclusion, since circumventing social pressure seems quite hard. But it's at least the right question to ask, and there could be scope for a social norms intervention here.</p>\n<h2>3. Workers see significantly lower wage growth over their life compared to workers in developed countries.</h2>\n<p>Each country has a <em>life-cycle wage profile</em>; a relationship between how old someone is, and how much they earn. In rich countries, a person can expect their wages to double over the course of their working life; in poor countries, they can only expect a 50% increase. (<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696225\">Lagakos et al, 2018</a>) In other words, life-cycle wage growth is twice as high in rich countries compared to poor countries.</p>\n<p>The main reason this disparity matters is because wage growth over the life-cycle is a path to upward mobility for poor people. If you make more money as you get older, that makes it possible to enter the middle class, build up savings/assets, invest in your children\u2019s education, and other things that we understand as necessary to build up a broad middle class in any country. But a more subtle reason we care about wage growth is that it signals <em>growth in skills</em>. In a world where businesses pay people more when they are more productive, wage growth reflects the fact that older and more experienced workers are simply better at doing a job/doing harder jobs than younger and less experienced workers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-3\" id=\"fnref-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-3\">[3]</a></sup> Interpreted this way, stagnant wage growth means that <em>workers may not be gaining much experience and skill over their life cycle.</em> This limits their productivity growth, and thus economic growth as a whole.</p>\n<p>So why is wage growth over the life cycle so different across countries?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Education.</strong> Across countries, educated workers have steeper life-cycle wage growth than uneducated workers. This could reflect their ability to accumulate more skills from a job than uneducated workers, if education makes them able to pick up skills more easily while on the job. The differences in education rates between developed and developing countries alone accounts for one-third of the difference in wage growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Slippery job ladder.</strong> The flat wage growth on average masks important heterogeneity; conditional on staying in the same job, wages grow <em>faster</em> in developing countries than in developed countries. (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/4/2287/7181328\">Donovan, Schoellman and Yu 2023</a>) So the weak average growth reflects the fact that people are much less likely to stay in the same job, and that when they switch jobs, they often see wage <em>decreases</em>: workers who move into a high-wage job are 39 percentage points more likely to leave it within three months compared to similar workers in developed countries, moving into a lower-wage job or unemployment. This is a slippery job ladder; rather than climbing the rungs from unemployment to stable jobs that pay more and more, people \"fall off the ladder\" and move to lower-paying jobs, which prevents them from seeing sustained wage growth.</li>\n<li><strong>On-the-job training.</strong> Firms in developing countries provide less on-the-job training to workers (<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/728667\">Ma, Nakab and Vidart 2024</a>) which hinders them from learning over their life cycle. This behavior is a logical response to the slippery job ladder described above; if workers stay in their jobs for much less time in developing countries than in developed countries, firms have no incentive to invest in training them, since they won't be able to reap the benefits of training them. This difference accounts for another third of the difference in wage growth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How can we target life-cycle wage profiles so that people see more wage growth? For one thing, education interventions look much better because of their potential impacts on life cycle wage growth being much larger than their effects on wages at some point in time (what people normally look at). Moreover, subsidizing firm-provided training could incentivize firms to train their workers more even in the face of turnover.</p>\n<h2>4. Village labor markets are efficient during peak seasons, but inefficient during lean seasons.</h2>\n<p>Rural labor markets employ the majority of workers in developing countries, and it's important to understand how they function in particular. What does it mean for a labor market to work efficiently? The core criterion is that it <em>clears</em>; every worker who would like to work at the market wage gets a job, and every employer who would like to hire at the market wage gets a worker. Labor market clearing is the bedrock of an efficient labor market. Do village labor markets in developing countries clear? The answer depends on whether we are talking about the <em>peak season</em> (agricultural activity is high) or the <em>lean season</em> (agricultural activity is low).</p>\n<p>During peak seasons, the evidence is unanimous that labor markets clear. <a href=\"https://sci-hub.ru/10.1086/503579\">Jayachandran (2006)</a> finds that when agricultural productivity increases due to quasi-random rainfall shocks, agricultural wages increase. Moreover, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RiMgkKu7DJqfnqU3vIqQszD1TEREY9jf/view\">Breza et al (2021)</a> randomly hire a large number of workers across Indian villages, and when they hire during the peak season, local wages increase (as the number of workers decreases). The responsiveness of wages indicates a healthy labor market that is responsive to local conditions and worker productivity, a reassuring finding.</p>\n<p>During lean seasons, however, labor markets likely do not clear, and workers are under-hired relative to an efficient market. Breza et al find that even hiring 24% of a village's labor force outside of the village during the lean season has no effect on village wages, suggesting that at least 24% of workers wanted to work at the prevailing wage but were unable to. <a href=\"https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~kamurali/papers/Working%20Papers/NREGS_GE%20(Current%20WP).pdf\">Muralidharan et al (2022)</a> randomize an intensification to India's rural employment guarantee and find that in treated areas, private wages <em>and</em> employment increased. These two results together are only consistent with village employers acting as monopsonists when hiring workers, and thus hiring workers less than is efficient.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-4\" id=\"fnref-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-4\">[4]</a></sup> This is a source of inefficiency that is especially likely to bind during the lean season when fewer employers are hiring workers.</p>\n<p>The fact that village labor markets under-utilize workers during the lean season is strong evidence in favor of governments providing rural employment programs during the lean season; such active labor market policies are common in developing countries, and it's reassuring to know that they might be effective (subject to implementation issues).</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Labor markets are crucial for people to earn incomes, and for economies to grow by matching workers with firms to produce more. Developing countries have labor market challenges that significantly limit their ability to use productive workers, as well as the ability of those workers to earn income and grow their skills.</p>\n<p>This post is much lighter on evidence-based solutions than the previous posts. This is partly a function of labor markets being a much harder object to grapple with, compared to firms or households - and it's partly a function of the fact that research into labor market failures and their connection to aggregate economic growth is scarce. We are still in the phase of establishing the problems, and it remains to be seen what the right solutions are.</p>\n<p>But there's an optimistic side to thinking about labor markets; because the core problem is matching workers and firms who would like to be matched, and this matching is fundamentally decentralized, I see this as one area where private approaches to solving problems are unusually effective development interventions. Consider a few examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An entrepreneur sets up a job board in a big city, going to many employers in the city and asking them to send her information whenever they want to hire workers. She collects a lot of job postings and takes them to slums where lots of workers live, including new migrants who don't know where to look for jobs. If they apply for these jobs and the employer hires them, the employer pays her a commission.</li>\n<li>An entrepreneur offers a certification program for workers to demonstrate literacy and numeracy skills, knowing that the education system has spotty quality, so many high school graduates will lack foundational literacy and numeracy. He offers employers insurance payments in case their worker fails to meet job requirements and needs to be fired. If workers get hired for their certification, they pay a share of their wages to the entrepreneur up to some limit.</li>\n<li>A mobile payments company knows that seasonal migration is profitable for many workers, so it offers a loan for migration during the lean season. The loan has a high-enough interest rate to be profitable even if many borrowers default, but low-enough that migrants can repay it while still having enough income to make migration worthwhile.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>None of these are bulletproof ideas, only demonstrations of an underlying fact; fixing labor market failures generates a positive surplus, and whoever fixes those failures can claim some of that surplus as their reward. The second example is the real model of <a href=\"https://www.harambee.co.za/\">Harambee</a>, a nonprofit that has been evaluated successfully (<a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:44e3ce71-72d6-414b-ab61-6310179ed760/download_file?file_format=application%2Fpdf&amp;safe_filename=Carranza_et_al_2022_job_search_and.pdf&amp;type_of_work=Journal+article\">Carranza et al 2020</a>). So while the evidence is not as clear on effective solutions as it is on problems, perhaps people who are motivated to solve these issues can blaze the trail.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-9whQXRwqkwfquYxx6-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The official unemployment rate is 6%; of the remaining 94%, 80% are self-employed.

The way AI typically works is you give it a reward function that grants the AI points for doing what you want it to do, but often, the reward function can be satisfied without doing what you wanted it to do. For example, someone gave a Roomba the task of not bumping into any walls. It learned to drive backwards, <a href=\"https://nitter.net/smingleigh/status/1060325665671692288\">because there are no sensors on the back</a>.&nbsp;You could also imagine a robot that's programmed to get you a cup of coffee. On the way there, it'll step on a baby, because we didn't tell it to care about the baby.</p><p>It gets worse when the AI is incredibly smart, as long as it still has ways of affecting the real world without any human intervention. The worst case scenario is if you told an AI to maximize paperclip production. If it's really smart, it will realize that we don't actually want this. We don't want to turn all of our electronic devices into paperclips. But it's not going to do what you wanted it to do, <i>it will do what you programmed it with</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbn3841y9fl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbn3841y9fl\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So, if the AI realizes that you would try to stop it if it actually achieved its goal, it might try to get rid of you.</p><p>And, importantly, there would be no hope of us trying to outsmart it. It would be like a chimpanzee trying to outsmart it. If we really wanted to, we could wipe out every chimpanzee. We're kinda doing it already by accident, and we're not even that much smarter than chimpanzees. Imagine an AI which had that same difference in intelligence, but actually wanted to kill us. That's what we should be worried about.</p><h2>Not Everybody Should Do Outreach</h2><p>I was originally going to write this as part of a much longer post, which is tentatively titled, \"AI Safety isn't Weird But You Are\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffe2q8tl4uvb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfe2q8tl4uvb\">[2]</a></sup></span>, but I was convinced it would be better to release a shorter post just to get this idea out there, so more people read it, and the information gets out more quickly. However, I do want to briefly explain something tangentially related to this topic. <strong>PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS ON AI SAFETY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE DONE BY RACISTS, NAZIS, SEX OFFENDERS OR ANY OTHER DEPLORABLE PEOPLE.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw3dwv3k9a3d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw3dwv3k9a3d\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I hope this point is obvious to most reading this, but I have seen actual debate over this question<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref53yf1uado4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn53yf1uado4\">[4]</a></sup></span>. I'd like to think that very few people actually believe this, but I'm not sure. I've seen people say they think A.I. alignment is too important for \"petty arguments\" about things like human rights. If they actually believed this I'd think they would condemn every racist from the community<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefue38zglrs2e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnue38zglrs2e\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to prevent the community from having a reputation of being ok with racism.</p><h2>Tip: Talk About Already Existing Problems in AI</h2><p>One common criticism I see of the AI Safety community from outsiders is that we don't talk about the current dangers of AI. I think this is because, as effective altruists, we don't see those as major issues. However, I think these topics are still worth discussing. Not only would make this objection go away, but it also makes people more willing to think about the dangers of AI.</p><p>Lots of people have heard about Apple's Face ID not being able to distinguish between two different black faces. Now imagine this AI gets used to determine who is a civilian and who is a war militant, and it starts assuming that all people of a particular skin tone are militants. I've never used this particular hypothetical as an argument before, but I can imagine it would be very convincing.</p><p>If more of our arguments looked like this, I imagine it would boost the community's credibility. Of course, this isn't the worst case scenario that we tend to talk about, but it makes the worst case scenario seem more credible as well. If this doesn't convince them, then I don't know what would. And as an added bonus, if you're talking to someone who won't find the worst-case scenario credible, they should at least be scared enough by this to still care about the dangers of AI.</p><h1>How Often Does This Work?</h1><p>I thought it might be worth it to show how well this strategy works. In case the title implied otherwise, I won't rigorously explain why this works. I'm a computer scientist, not a psychologist. But I think it works because it's based on knowledge that people already have. People already know that AI fails sometimes, so it's pretty easy to take that to its logical conclusion.</p><p>The point of this section is to instead give a list of times when I've used this technique, and hope that it's enough to convince you that this is is a pretty useful technique.</p><p>The first time I tried this was at a club fair to promote my effective altruism club at the Rochester Institute of Technology. On our table, we showed some posters we had designed for upcoming discussions, and the one about AI Safety caught at least one person's eye.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:54.54%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/qi8nx3nnmrdakxlfb0n4\" alt=\"an ai safety poster, with a subtitle saying, &quot;Artificial Intelligence is getting better, so how do we make sure it's used for good?&quot;\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/sw475p5wtl5pcs39dd4c 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/q6hujxx0i3h7sgj7aa2f 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/unww04vwigvadncizvgk 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/eib8jly5wymliiasflha 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/gdrwvdm8g7ltxr3jgbgs 1300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/asqcc1rmvuxw8ro7bk8h 1560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/fcma9qlszh0xq9oc3dsp 1820w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/sekj8ooy2tk9ibamfkpn 2080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/pedcsiwbfznkd76tcbxl 2340w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C87eWWjAzCwqzeydL/gafjxugtmcik321pbmg7 2550w\"></figure><p>This person asked me why there was a meeting dedicated to artificial intelligence, and I had to, on the spot, come up with a good explanation that doesn't sound paranoid or crackpotish. It took me some thinking, and I don't remember the exact words, but it sounded something like this:<br><br>\"As artificial intelligence gets smarter, eventually it's going to have the ability to do serious harm to people, so we want to make sure that it's doing what we want it to do, and not mistaking our intentions or being programmed with bad intent.\"</p><p>The person didn't exactly seem enthusiastic, but accepted that response.</p><p>During the meeting, someone from the AI Club on campus came to the meeting to invite us to give a talk about AI safety. Club alumnus, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nicholaskross\">Nick</a> and I prepared the presentation using the principle that 3Blue1Brown uses: to gently guide the audience to the conclusion, making it seem as though they came up with the idea themselves. You can watch the full presentation on YouTube.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4fkKcLhEyQ\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4fkKcLhEyQ\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>During the presentation, there were no obvious objections from the audience. Many people I saw seemed to be in clear agreement. When I talked to the club's executive board after the presentation, they were all very interested, and we were able to keep talking about it for what I would approximate to be an additional half hour after the presentation.</p><p>So, for context, after our club meetings, we often head somewhere for dinner in what we call Tangent Time. This is to discuss anything that we didn't talk about during the meeting, either because it's off-topic or because we didn't have time. I don't remember exactly how we got to the topic, but AI was brought up, and this day, we had some new members with us. Nick gave the least convincing argument possible for why AI is dangerous: asserting it as true. This is the argument by assertion fallacy, which did not convince our new member. It's worth briefly noting that one of the students is in a master's program for computer science. So here, I interjected, giving the short form of the pitch that I've already described, and it quickly turned around, saying \"I liked their explanation. That convinced me\".</p><p>I've been working with the Eastern Service Workers Association lately as a volunteer. What they do doesn't matter for the context of this post, but in the future I plan on making a post to discuss what effective altruist organizations can learn from their unreasonable efficiency. Anyway, I don't have a car, so I rely on the other volunteers to graciously drive me to my apartment from the office. Knowing that I'm a computer science student, people have asked me about my thoughts on AI on more than one occasion. Using the same pitch, I've been able to convince people that there is a legitimate danger to superintelligent AI.</p><p>Last semester, I took a \"Historical and Ethical Perspectives in Computer Science\" class. Our last couple of discussions, and the final paper, were focused on AI. I talked about AI safety in the final paper, but I have no way of knowing whether the professor agreed with me or not. I also brought it up in one of the discussions. One person did have a counterargument. I don't remember what the exact counterargument was, but the person actually didn't understand my point<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9txhiki4fqc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9txhiki4fqc\">[6]</a></sup></span>. When I clarified, the person gave a \"hmm\", which I will take as a reluctant agreement. Another student said that she thinks this is a long ways away, which I agreed with.</p><p>None of the people I've been talking to are LessWrong readers. They're just people I happened to meet as a computer scientist and effective altruist. It's possible that people are more perceptive to these arguments now than when Yudkowsky started working on LessWrong. AI is a lot more advanced now. There have been several strikes over the past couple years centered around the use of AI in movies and television. AI is much more accessible now, allowing people to see the flaws. But I do have to wonder, while writing this, what could have been if Yudkowsky spent more time developing his arguments, rather than creating the rationality community.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnbn3841y9fl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefbn3841y9fl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This connects the problem of AI with the more mundane computer problem of computers doing what you tell them to do, which is not necessarily the same as what you wanted it to do.

This project will be my PhD thesis. I have some of the main ideas drafted out. However, I still have most of the PhD to go, so a substantial amount of opinions and particular formulations on the matter are subject to changes.</p><p><i>Disclaimer:</i> I have received some funding as a Forethought Foundation Fellowship in support of my PhD research. But all the opinions expressed here are my own.</p><h1><strong>Index.</strong></h1><p>Part I - <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YC3Mvw2xNtpKxR5sK/phd-on-moral-progress-bibliography-review\">Bibliography Review</a></p><p>Part II - Seven Philosophical Takes and Opinions</p><p>Future parts will discuss: moral circle expansion, normative theories of progress, empirical takes and opinions, possibilities for measuring moral progress, and policy implications. They will be published as my research progresses.</p><h1><strong>Introduction.</strong></h1><p>This is my second research-related post, building on the previous <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YC3Mvw2xNtpKxR5sK/phd-on-moral-progress-bibliography-review\">Bibliography Review</a> on the topic of Moral Progress, a topic in which I've been working for a couple of years.&nbsp;</p><p>As I outlined in the introduction of the first post, since the finished book manuscript won't be ready until around 2026, I want to post some preliminary takes or opinions that I have on the subject of Moral Progress. These are underdeveloped bullet points that I aim to develop further in the manuscript that should eventually become a book.</p><p>However, I will have to say that in academia there is always the danger of \"getting scooped\". I don't want to outline my ideas in full detail before they are published in a journal or a book, since someone could just take them, rewrite them a bit and publish them under their own name. It's a bit of an odd position to be in, so I hope you can forgive some level of vagueness.</p><h1><strong>Seven Philosophical Takes and Opinions.</strong></h1><p>Okay, so the first post had a lot of books and articles. But what have I found out until now? What are my opinions?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, keep in mind that whatever I say here is preliminary and subject to change, but some key points from my work that I have written about so far, or that I aim to develop in writing include the following. Here they might be presented \"hot takes\" or opinions, I will develop and defend them further in the future, but I hope they will help guide your thinking on the topic of moral progress.</p><p>I present them in an order similar to how I present them on the PhD thesis, which I think makes the most sense. It starts from the <i>conceptual and philosophical issues</i>, which I explore here, and goes towards the <i>empirical</i> and <i>policy recommendations </i>towards the end, which I'll explore in later posts.</p><h2>(1) There are at least three different forms of skepticism against the idea of moral progress. But I believe they're all wrong.</h2><p>In my work, I aim to distinguish at least three importantly different ways in which somebody might want to resist accepting idea of moral progress: <i>(1) The Liberal Skeptic, (2) The Illiberal Skeptic, and (3) The Metaethical Skeptic.</i></p><p><strong>(1) The Liberal Skeptic</strong>, who disagrees on empirical grounds. They might think that if the world became more liberal (in a broad sense, e.g. respected individual human rights more), that would be a good thing, but that empirically the world hasn't actually become better in this way.&nbsp;</p><p>My main criticism of such views is that I simply don't see how such a position is tenable on empirical grounds. Just to take a look at what Pinker (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13543093-the-better-angels-of-our-nature\">2011</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35696171-enlightenment-now\">2018</a>), Rosling (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness\">2017</a>), Norberg (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31694126-progress---ten-reasons-to-look-forward-to-the-future\">2016</a>) or many economists have written. Or just take a look at data on the state of the world in the <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a>, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\">Our World in Data</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/\">Gapminder</a>.</p><p>You don't have to agree on every detail, but I think certain easy facts are staring us in the face. These are cases like the abolition of slavery and the lessening of discrimination of people of color, women's suffrage and feminism, the reduction of cruel punishments like public tortures/executions and foot binding, plausibly animal rights and welfare, and plausibly care for future generations. For other forms of discrimination, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discrimination\">just take a tour through Wikipedia on the topic</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, the goodness of these improvements doesn't depend on adhering any controversial moral theory, they are accepted as improvements by most plausible versions of common-sense ethics, consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics, contractualism, etc.</p><p>So my claim is that Liberal Skeptics are simply empirically misinformed, perhaps because they are cognitively biased. <a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness/\">Rosling in Factfulness</a> outlines some plausible biases that could be in effect.</p><p>I believe most EAs aren't liberal skeptics. They think these points are trivial. Yet I have faced quite a bit of pushback when presenting the empirical facts of progress in venues other than EA. People tend to resist many of the empirical facts, or their interpretation, or attempt to emphasize the exceptions or bad facts (such as inequality, climate change, and catastrophic or existential risk... which is fair in some cases, but people take it as if the amount of bad things in the world is somehow constant!). So, many books on the topic of moral and social progress might require a section on the advances we have achieved so far, because most people are just deeply wrong about the state of the world.</p><p>Some other liberal skeptics disagree with the idea of \"moral progress\" because they misunderstand what a theory of progress entails. They might think believing in progress entails believing in linear progress without any instances of regress, or that it entails believing in \"iron laws\" of progress (called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poverty_of_Historicism\">historicism</a> in the philosophy of history), or that it entails believing in<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology\"> teleology</a>, or the idea that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_history\">history has a final end state</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This had been the case from the ancient era until quite recently. But I believe a plausible naturalistic theory of progress should adhere to none of these. I believe the empirical study of human behavior from social science has greatly superseded these problematic philosophical notions.</p><p>So that doesn't prove the Liberal Skeptic right in their skepticism. Rather, we should reduce our theory of progress to more plausible claims, such as that history has rough patterns or mechanisms that can be studied through social science. And that empirically, we can show that we have morally improved in our beliefs and/or behaviors. So the skepticism is not warranted.</p><p>There are some weaker versions of this Liberal Skeptic claim that I could deal with, such as the objection that slavery, women's suffrage, etc. was low hanging fruit and we haven't come far. I actually accept some weaker forms of this claim, so it's not contrary to my theory of progress.</p><p>Another objection is that these problems are self-generated (humans invented slavery, and then humans got rid of it, so we're \"back to the start\"). In a sense, that's right, but slavery has been around for a very long time. We shouldn't be misled that life in pre-state societies was morally just or pleasant. I think we have enough evidence for tribal warfare (e.g. <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/ethnographic-and-archaeological-evidence-on-violent-deaths\">Our World in Data on archeological violence</a>) and even the behavior of apes (such as the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal\">Frans de Waal </a>or <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2131522.Hierarchy_in_the_Forest\">Christopher Boehm</a>) as quite brutal.</p><p>Here I have only talked about humans. A further objection is that by expanding human power, we have also expanded our capacity to do harm, which has grown faster than the moral good we have done, particularly if we take non-human animals into account. If we take the suffering of animals such as factory farmed chickens, fish, or cows seriously, we might come to the result that we are causing more harm than good just due to factory farming, probably even if we have a 1.000-to-1 discount rate. <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/HUEDOE.pdf\">Humans kill 56 billion animals for food each year!</a> <i>(Thanks to Arturo Macias in the comments for helping make this explicit!)</i></p><p>I don't really have a counterargument to this last point. I guess I agree with it. It seems like big-number scenarios like animal suffering (and perhaps longtermism) can really flip direction of the discussion from a consequentialist standpoint. Perhaps one thing to mention is that it seems unlikely that we have really changed our moral behavior towards them. It's the same behavior of killing animals that have always done, but just greatly amplified by technology. So it seems a form of social regress, rather than moral in a narrow way.</p><p><strong>(2) The Illiberal Skeptic. </strong>This is the conservative or reactionary, as well as accounts of politics deemed perfectionist. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perfectionism-moral/\">perfectionism</a> as<i> \"writers [that] advance an objective account of the good and then develop an account of ethics and/or politics that is informed by this account of the good. Different perfectionist writers propose different accounts of the good and arrive at different ethical and political conclusions. But all perfectionists defend an account of the good that is objective in the sense that it identifies states of affairs, activities, and/or relationships as good in themselves and not good in virtue of the fact that they are desired or enjoyed by human beings.\"</i>.</p><p>I haven't yet written much about why they're wrong, but basically the idea within contemporary political philosophy is that such views are problematic or flawed. They go too far into imposing one particular view of \"the good life\". Pretty much all anglophone, Rawls-inspired accounts of political philosophy reject such views, so this rejection of perfectionism is not mine alone. &nbsp;</p><p>Let me give the quick gist. Perhaps the most recent type of perfectionism in recent decades has been communitarianism, defended by authors such as Michael Sandel, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Charles Taylor, against Rawlsian liberals in the 80s.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe there was a lot of confusion in these debates. For example, communitarians said that liberals had a view of the self that was too atomized and individualistic. But it wasn't exactly clear what the communitarians were claiming that the liberals were defending, and a lot of the debate was composed of liberals saying \"No, we're not saying this\". For more details, see Simon Caney \"<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01384.x\">Liberalism and communitarianism: a misconceived debate</a>\" or Allen Buchanan \"<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/BUCATC\">Assesing the communitarian critique of liberalism</a>\".</p><p><strong>(3) The Metaethical Skeptic.</strong> This is the error theorist, moral nihilist, or extreme moral relativist, who doesn't want to adhere to any notion of moral progress.&nbsp;</p><p>To refute this skeptic, I think there are reasons why the notion of progress is more attractive than the concept of moral truth. I think a notion of moral progress is <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/Archives/Fall2012/entries/moral-anti-realism/moral-error-theory.html\">less metaphysically and epistemologically weird or suspicious than the notion of moral truth.</a> I think one way to make the error theorist accept a notion of progress is to relativize it. We can achieve a lot by asking the error theorist what they care about, even in an instrumental way. It is likely that they care about human welfare (or the welfare of all sentient beings), happy mental states, flourishing, achieving human capabilities. These things are not metaphysically suspect. They're much less problematic, and the error theorist already accepts this in their practical life and moral judgements.</p><p>Then we simply say that we can make a conditional statement in the form \"If you care about human welfare/flourishing/capabilities, then you should call the change from state of affairs X with less human welfare to state of affairs Y with more human welfare an instance of moral progress\".</p><p>Of course, this by itself is not enough to rule out error theorists who want to increase suffering, and labelling increased suffering as progress. I think I'm ok with letting that part of the debate go. It seems out of the scope of my work to deal with such views. But these forms of skepticism that say \"creating pain is morally good\" seem implausible, and need an argument <i>in favor</i> of them.</p><p>There's more we can say against the metaethical skeptic, but I think one of the main things we can do is to develop an attractive and compelling view or theory of moral progress that even a skeptic might want to adopt.</p><h2><strong>(2) There are many interesting conceptual distinctions at play, such as Individual/Collective, Local/Global, Beliefs/Practices, Moral/Social...</strong></h2><p>Moral progress is not one simple thing to analyze. It is not a monolith, in the same way that scientific progress and technological progress are not monoliths either, as shown by the people working in Progress Studies (<a href=\"https://rootsofprogress.org/bibliography\">just see how big the bibliography is!</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, I believe moral and social progress is an entire area of research that might deserve its dedicated promotion and funding. It has overlapping points with normative moral philosophy when we are making normative judgements, but also overlaps with many of the social sciences such as economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience, and primatology, when talking about the empirical details.&nbsp;</p><p>Just to help you out navigate these waters, some simple key distinctions to keep in mind while navigating the topic of moral and social progress include:</p><p><strong>(1) Individual vs Societal vs Global Progress. </strong>An intuitive distinction is the level of analysis that we are talking about. Are we analyzing the moral beliefs and actions of people, of entire societies (groups, towns, nation-states...) or of the entire world?</p><p>There might be arguments why we might want to commit to a form of <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/\">methodological individualism</a>, because it would seem odd to say that all individuals in a society can be morally progressive yet the society, which is made out of a collection of these individuals, is regressive. So it seems like Social or Global Progress <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/\">supervenes</a> or is <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grounding/\">grounded</a> on individual beliefs and actions. (Though judgement aggregation has technical problems, see <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief-merging/\">here</a>).</p><p>But in practice, there might be reasons why we might want to analyze Societal Progress and Global Progress at the macro level, from a sociological standpoint, rather than as the collective of many individual psychological states beliefs or behaviors. This might remind some of the issue of whether macroeconomics is reducible to microeconomics. It's a bit of a similar issue.</p><p>Some examples include the fact that institutions, laws, social pressures, and customs, make people behave in weird ways that might be counter to their personal moral beliefs, such as fear of authority and punishment, conformism, or lack of information.</p><p>So I'd analyze them apart from each other. <i>Individual Progress</i> would be focused on an individual's ethical development, such as becoming having better moral beliefs or attitudes. One can become more morally impartial, or achieve greater coherence in their moral system, or become more empathetic or tolerant. This change is often driven by personal reflection, moral education, or life experiences, and typically just impacts the individual and their immediate surroundings (unless they have a lot of power or a big sphere of influence, such as by having a lot of money or being a politician).</p><p>Meanwhile, <i>Collective Progress</i> involves broader ethical improvements within a community or society, like the recognition of human rights or social acceptance of marginalized groups. While it might appear as an aggregate of individual progress, collective progress often results from distinct mechanisms like cultural shifts, legislation, or social movements. Its impact is more far-reaching if it gets organized, by influencing national or international policies.</p><p>The mechanisms through which they operate also differ, individual progress might stem from cognitive dissonance leading to moral reform, whereas collective progress can emerge from societal changes or organized actions of social movements.&nbsp;</p><p>The rate of progress will also likely differ, individuals might experience sudden moral epiphanies (e.g. a meat-eater becoming vegan after reading Peter Singer), while societal shifts generally take longer, having to overcome systemic barriers and the inertia of the status quo (e.g. banning factory farming can take decades).</p><p><strong>(2) Progress in Beliefs vs Progress in Practices. </strong><i>Progress in Beliefs</i> refers to changes in the content of moral beliefs, as the name suggests. <i>Progress in Practices</i> relates to how individuals might act and what habits they have. Cases of progress in belief without progress in practice include the classic cases of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia\">weakness of the will (<i>akrasia</i>)</a>, such as a person who deems meat eating to be immoral, but who hasn\u2019t managed to change their habits because their moral motivations haven\u2019t overridden other motivations that they might have or their desire or habit for meat eating.</p><p>Furthermore, <i>Progress in Practices</i> perhaps also includes changes in the structure or method of moral reasoning, such as being open to listening to moral arguments and reasons, without necessarily altering the content of the first-order moral beliefs themselves (e.g. still being a meat eater). An example might be a society adopting more systematic or democratic ways of making moral decisions, which over time leads to progress in beliefs or in other further practices. (See ideas such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_rationality\">Communicative Rationality</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy\">Deliberative Democracy</a> in the work of Jurgen Habermas and Seyla Benhabib for some inspiration)</p><p><strong>(3) Narrow Intentional Moral Progress vs Wide Unintentional Social Progress. </strong>I call <i>Moral Progress in a strict sense</i> to narrow and intentional deliberate advancements in moral thinking, typically led by individuals in engaged in ethical discourse, such as philosophers, journalists, policymakers, and intellectuals. It's not about broad societal shifts but about targeted developments in ethical belief, knowledge, or understanding, like formulating new ethical theories or applying moral reasoning to novel problems. Consider the concepts of rights, deontology, trolley problems, the experience machine, population ethics. These concepts were developed by a particular person or group of people at some point in time. (That doesn't mean they were invented, you could argue rights were simply discovered. Here I'm just referring to the conceptual discovery in an epistemic sense, in the same way that Newton formulated the theory of gravity).</p><p>On the other hand, I call <i>Social Progress</i> to the wide and unintentional progress that encompasses social advancements that occur independently of explicit moral intentions. Unlike moral progress, social progress often results from other types of developments, like economic or technological changes. For example, if people like <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero\">Robert Wright</a>, <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/13543093-the-better-angels-of-our-nature\">Steven Pinker</a> and others are to be believed, an increase in societal wealth can lead to reduced violence and improved living conditions, exemplifying how material circumstances and non-moral factors can promote a more ethical society.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe a complicated example is how is the rise of the bourgeoisie, driven by economic interests, led the way for major moral transformations during the Enlightenment, American Revolution, French Revolution, etc.</p><p>In this sense, favorable ethical outcomes can arise from actions that are not explicitly driven by moral considerations. Social progress is driven by social, institutional, or technological innovation, and it can circumvent moral dilemmas that arise in conditions of material scarcity. We can avoid difficult distributive moral dilemmas of how to morally distribute food, organs, and wealth, if we are able to achieve a post-scarcity society where those needs are covered. This might be a crucial reason why many ethical developments (Universal Human Rights, greater cosmopolitanism, more care for animal welfare...) have taken place after the Industrial Revolution.</p><h2><strong>(3) Explicit moral philosophizing perhaps hasn't mattered </strong><i><strong>that</strong></i><strong> much historically in creating moral improvements until now, but it will probably become more important in the future.</strong></h2><p>Following from the previous point, I think that wide social progress<i> </i>has been more impactful in the past, while the impact of narrow moral progress<i> </i>might slowly become stronger in the future.</p><p>Regarding moral progress, you could say that people like Locke, Kant, and Mill helped with reinforcing liberalism, Hegel and Marx with Marxism, and Hayek with neoliberalism have been massively influential philosophers in the real world due to their ideologies (for better or worse). I freely grant that point.</p><p>But I think that many of the moral improvements that we consider clear or paradigmatic, like the abolition of slavery, woman's suffrage and feminism, and the rise of cosmopolitanism, the animal welfare movement, and longtermism are actually not that philosophically deep, and are obtained through relatively simple form of philosophical reasoning. So moral progress in the sense of deep moral thinking has probably not been the main driver. Here's the basic argumentative structure for all of them:</p><ol><li>Agents A and B should be treated equally unless there are morally relevant differences between A and B.</li><li>There are no morally relevant differences between A and B.&nbsp;</li><li>So Agents A and B should be treated equally.</li></ol><p>Well, that wasn't so difficult, I just saved you over 200 years of social struggle for slavery abolitionism, women's rights, cosmopolitanism, animal rights, and longtermism right there!</p><p>What has been the problem, then? The issue has been, first, what Kitcher (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57630862-moral-progress\">2021</a>) calls <i>altruism failures</i>, which are failures to consider the position of others at all. Most people in human history didn't seriously consider or ponder the moral standing of slaves, women, enemy nations, or future generations in a serious way. If you travelled back in time and proposed human rights or universal suffrage to them, people would have mocked you. For example when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman\">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>, one of the first feminist texts, Thomas Taylor wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes, arguing that we might as well give rights to <i>animals</i> as well!</p><p>Second, the dominant party benefited. Slaveowners benefited from slaves, men over women, dominant nations over subjugated ones, humans over nonhuman animals, and current generations over future generations rule or have ruled with an iron fist. They had the power, and people don't want to upset the status quo, particularly when it benefits them.</p><p>Third, when the dominant party starts to be questioned, they try to argue that there are relevant moral differences because there are empirical differences. Slaveowners and men will say something that black people and women are inferior or stupid, and try to pass their prejudices as science. Over time, they get caught. The observations pile up, the science proves wrong. But such a change in views takes time to be widely accepted in society.</p><p>This is a bit different for the moral cases of cosmopolitanism, animals, and longtermism, which have to do with a rise in the importance of moral impartiality. Let me offer some quick ideas. It's fine if you don't strictly accept them. I'm just hinting at some possibilities.</p><p>For cosmopolitanism, I believe an argument from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position\">veil of ignorance</a> applied across all nations, arguing that the place where you're born is morally arbitrary and thus the natural order is unjustified can do a lot of the heavy lifting. (Rawls didn't like this approach if you read his Law of Peoples, but I believe Brian Barry and others developed it, and Rawls' Law of Peoples was heavily criticized for not extending his veil of ignorance argument across nations.)</p><p>For animal welfare, Singer's <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/animals-and-ethics/#:~:text=The%20Argument%20from%20Marginal%20Cases%20is%20an%20argument%20that%20attempts,%E2%80%9Cmarginal%20cases%E2%80%9D%20of%20humanity.\">argument from marginal cases</a>, the argument that there are disabled people who are less capable than nonhuman animals of stuff like rational thought, has done great part of the work . Additionally, Mark Rowlands has a veil of ignorance argument for animals, if you follow an argument that it's morally arbitrary what animal you're born as, behind a veil of ignorance. (I believe it was <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7036626-animal-rights\">here</a>?)</p><p>For longtermism the jury is still out, but I believe that the fact that people don't have preferences right now (or current mental-state welfare) doesn't mean that future people won't have preferences in the future that also should be respected. So I believe we should hold moral impartiality for future generations (discounted for uncertainty, but that's an empirical discounting, not a moral one). This is a very strong claim! But I believe it's not that different from cosmopolitanism. One is in space, another in time. There can also be a veil of ignorance argument for this. Why is it relevant, from a sort-of impartial \"point of view of the universe\", whether you're born in 2000 or 2050? From the moral point of view of impartial evaluation, it's all the same.</p><p>It's fine if I didn't convince you with my arguments. But a big part of the point is that they all share argumentative structure, a move towards moral impartiality due to irrelevant moral differences. If you look at it that way, moral philosophy seems quite unimpressive until now.</p><p>So I think what we have been doing until now in the history of ethics is picking low-hanging ethical fruit. Once we pick lots of it, ethics will get subtler and harder, and only AI ethicists (or ethicists + AIs working as a team) will be able to solve ethical dilemmas, since they will get quite complicated, by covering a massive amount of thought experiments variations in seconds, and applying methods of consistency reasoning, reflective equilibrium, and other stuff relevant to moral reflection.</p><h2><strong>(4) The relative (or differential) speed of progress in different domains might be what matters for a flourishing future.</strong></h2><p>Toby Ord has made this point in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb7BoXYTWYI\">EAG talk presenting an unpublished paper he's been working on for a long time</a>. &nbsp;To summarize his talk in a key takeaway, he argues that just advancing progress all-across-the-board, in all domains, just accelerates the pace of humanity. So earlier humans will enjoy higher welfare, but humanity becomes extinct faster. So promoting all kinds of progress equally doesn't change overall human welfare, and doesn't change things from a morally impartial perspective. We get higher welfare sooner rather than later, but also get dangerous toys (dangerous AGI, easy to make manufactured pandemics...) sooner rather than later.</p><p>What we should aim for, instead, is <i>differential progress</i>. That is, accelerating some domains of progress so that they arrive <i>comparatively</i> earlier than others, providing us with safe or protective technologies, social norms, and institutions first, before we develop the dangerous ones. This is a reason why we might want to accelerate social and moral progress, as well as safety technologies, before we reach potentially unsafe technologies. (See also Bostrom's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_technological_development\">Principle of Differential Technological Advancement</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>This serves as an argument for why we might want to speed up moral progress (and related forms, such as improving our institutions) rather than speeding up technological progress, particularly of potentially dangerous technologies.</p><p>A bit of a caveat, however. It's worth keeping in mind that the interactions between material conditions such as socioeconomic arrangements (e.g. the development of capitalism) and technologies (e.g. the industrial revolution, AGI) tend to have an effect on our moral and political beliefs &nbsp;in ways we cannot really yet predict. (Particularly if cultural evolutionists like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WEIRDest_People_in_the_World\">Henrich 2020</a> are to be believed).</p><h2>(5) Progress and Secular Ethics.</h2><p>Theories of progress attempt to be morally uncontroversial, remaining uncommitted to particular theories within normative ethics (deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics, contractualism, etc.). So I will not enter this discussion here.</p><p>But let me say some thing related he relationship between religion and morality, which is a complex one, to say the least. Derek Parfit claimed at the very end of Reasons and Persons that we might be at the beginning of moral history, given that secular morality has just recently come apart from religion. While there are exceptions, let's just say ethics has been heavily religious or heavily influenced by religion for most of human history.</p><p>Let me just give some broad guidelines for secular progressive ethics, from observations that come from the more empirical side of things, rather than from moral controversy. These ideas need further development, and some people have been working on them a little, but I'd like to see more work pushing and developing them further.</p><p><strong>(1) Secular humanism</strong>, a la Voltaire, Pinker and others. This is quite a vague set of values that has actually evolved over time, but it's something to do with human (and nonhuman) flourishing as one of the main pillars of secular ethics. One advantage of this is that values can be rationally criticised and revised in the light of new moral beliefs and evidence.</p><p><strong>(2) Abandoning historicism</strong>, the idea that history \"has a plan\" planned by God (Kant's philosophy of history) or by the Collective Spirit of Humanity (Hegel's philosophy of history) or by material conditions (Marx's philosophy of history) that is unfolding as an \"iron law\". Summary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_history#Teleological_approaches\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I think such historicism is implausible. But whatever your beliefs, secular moral discussion should not rely on it. So we should abandon strong teleology / historicism. Adopt a naturalized teleology or no teleology at all. The claim is something like \"Society improves, but it does so contingently, with lots of bumps along the road (think of nazis or other totalitarians)\"</p><p><strong>(3) Darwinism is the \"universal acid\"</strong>, as Daniel Dennett (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2068.Darwin_s_Dangerous_Idea\">1995</a>) claims. This means that a post-darwinian, agnostic world should be more fallibilist towards the values it holds. This means taking into consideration how evolution has shaped our moral predispositions towards a nepotistic bias, due to us living in scarcity conditions for most of evolutionary history. Evolutionary theory should be an important insight for <i>descriptive</i> morality.</p><p>Vaguely related, I've heard some people call the pragmatist american movement a second enlightenment under the light of Darwin (e.g. the first section of <a href=\"https://sites.pitt.edu/~rbrandom/Texts/The_Pragmatist_Enlightenment_and_its_Pro.pdf\">Robert Brandom's reading of American Pragmatism</a>). I think this is one reason why many writers on progress, such as Philip Kitcher, are also pragmatists in the american tradition.</p><p>Keep in mind, taking Darwin seriously definitely <i>doesn't</i> mean \"use evolution as a <i>normative</i> guide to morality\", like Herbert Spencer and the social darwinists thought, in fact, we should...</p><p><strong>(4) Combat the appeal to nature fallacy</strong>. What is natural is not necessarily good. Think poison, disease, homelessness, or poverty, they're the natural state of things. And what's artificial is not necessarily bad. Think of medicine, housing, wealth, or technology, they're artificial. <a href=\"https://muddyclothes.substack.com/p/appeals-to-nature-should-not-limit\">Here's a good summary of that point.</a></p><p>Going further, this basically means that stuff like transhumanism is on the table for our moral future. Human nature shouldn't be a hard constraint on our moral thinking, since we can shape our environments and ourselves.</p><p><strong>(5) Building on that, moral intuitions change with material conditions</strong>. What was considered alien and weird, like interracial or gay marriage some decades ago, or transhumanism right now, will likely be seen as normal by future generations that grow up in such societies.</p><p>A sort-of corollary of that: we should be careful of value lock-in. We wouldn't want the value lock-in of racist, sexist, nepotist, or speciesist values performed by our ancestors upon us. So keep options open for changes in our future morality. Given the odds, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Dtr8aHqCQSDhyueFZ/the-possibility-of-an-ongoing-moral-catastrophe-summary\">we're probably committing moral atrocities we haven't even considered</a>.</p><h2><strong>(6) The term \"Progress\" faces risks in the wrong hands.</strong></h2><p>When talking about moral progress, we sometimes make moral claims about societies or eras being better than others. And it seems reasonable that we might want to make all-things-considered judgements, particularly with relatively clear-cut statements like \"Nazi beliefs were morally bad\", or \"Genocide is an atrocity\". I think a theory of progress that is unable to make those claims is probably incomplete. Though some authors don't want to commit to general statements of progress.</p><p>But, of course, replace Nazis or those committing genocide with a more morally neutral contemporary culture and things can become problematic very quickly. What I fear about this is that historically, people have used claims about \"bringing progress or civilization to barbarians\" as a way to justify colonization or imperialism. By which I mean that theories of progress can potentially be co-opted for nefarious supremacist uses. We have seen many cases of trying to \"export civilization\" through force and colonization. To this, I want to make several points:</p><p><strong>(1) Making truthful all-things-considered with these sweeping generalizations is hard.</strong> It can be already hard to compare two individuals across a single domain of morality, so imagine comparing an entire nation across all domains of morality. I believe it's possible, but much harder than the quick judgements we often make, and we should be careful.</p><p><strong>(2) Progress doesn't mean imposing. </strong>Questions about imposition are further questions dealing with difficult matters such as political authority, international interventionism, and paternalism, among others. Given the awful track record of colonial expansion, I think it's extremely reasonable to have a strong heuristic or precautionary principle against foreign intervention by force.</p><p><strong>(3) I fear that many lessons learned for good social movements can also be used by bad regressive social movements. </strong>The issue is that most of the mechanisms that drive moral progress have to do with value-neutral stuff. You can organize a social movement for moral good or for a moral atrocity, and most of the lessons learned can be used either way.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully there are some exceptions. The areas that are closer to reason and moral philosophizing might have more layers of defense towards avoiding being captured by rhetoric.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>(7) Practical difficulties with working on the topic of Moral Progress.</strong></h2><p>Before I finish, I also wanted to give some practical takeaways for other researchers that might want to work on this topic in the future.</p><p>Research in this area is difficult because it is very interdisciplinary and broad. It has to put together knowledge from very disparate areas to merge into a big interdisciplinary synthetic theory. So far, I have drawn insights from primatology (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal\">Frans de Waal</a>), anthropology (particularly theories of cultural evolution like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henrich\">Joseph Henrich</a>), sociology, &nbsp;developmental psychology (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tomasello\">Michael Tomasello</a>), and many others. If we want more theorizing on progress, probably need interdisciplinary teams to work on it. I see some minor progress on this on researchers working under the broad umbrella of \"cultural evolution\", but there is more work on the cultural evolution of technologies than the cultural evolution of norms. I don't see people from Progress Studies doing a lot on the cultural evolution of norms, either.</p><p>Sadly, no single academic field matches up with the desired target. If you're a social scientist, you're allowed to use more quantitative tools, but you might be unable to make the required normative judgement calls for the normative side of how to trade-off different forms of moral progress. If you're a moral philosopher, you get more freedom to make normative claims of what is good or bad, but peer reviewers will probably push you away from using too much quantitative data.</p><p>This all means that I believe that it's hard to publish academic papers on this topic. For example, I find it difficult to write standalone papers, because if you write about moral circle expansion, somebody might disagree that moral progress is a thing because of anti-realist metaethics, or have a skeptical moral epistemology. So there's always a way to escape the debate if you aren't systematic in your work with a book. This is true unless you have a narrow, constrained insight. Some good examples of narrow piecemeal insights are Moody Adams (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9973.00120\">1999</a>), Buchanan and Powell (<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/BUCTLO-8\">2015</a>, <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/BUCTAN-5\">2016</a>) Hanno Sauer (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10677-019-09983-9\">2022</a>), but eventually their smaller insights were expanded ended up becoming full-blown theories in books, such as Moody Adams (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60277656-making-space-for-justice\">2023</a>), Buchanan and Powell (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38388738-the-evolution-of-moral-progress\">2018</a>), Hanno Sauer (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135683054-moral-teleology\">2023</a>).</p><p>So building a general theory of moral progress is hard. If you want more depth, my practical suggestion is to go for narrower questions dealing with <i>particular aspects</i> of progress instead. Here are some inspirations from posts I've seen in the EA Forum recently. I like questions such as:</p><ul><li>\"How human governance institutions (e.g. AI) will keep up if AI leads to explosive growth?\" (from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/y8Mu8EZtyJZeHAnra/memo-on-some-neglected-topics\">Memo on some neglected topics by Lukas Finnveden</a>)</li><li>\"Positive [utopic] visions about how we could end up on a good path towards becoming a society that makes wise and kind decisions about what to do with the resources accessible to us\" (from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/y8Mu8EZtyJZeHAnra/memo-on-some-neglected-topics\">Memo on some neglected topics by Lukas Finnveden</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/thesis-topics/civilisation-collapses/\">Civilizational collapses</a> (Recommended for historians and economic historians, perhaps?)&nbsp;</li><li>Particular questions within <a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/thesis-topics/persistence-and-contingency/\">Historical Persistence and Contingency</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/thesis-topics/historical-trends/\">Most Important Historical Trends.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pwxwDidqbnwqWhvA4/international-tax-policy-as-a-potential-cause-area\">International Tax Policy as a Potential Cause Area, by Tax Geek.&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/thesis-topics/ai-sentience/\">The possibility of and moral importance of AI sentience.&nbsp;</a></li><li>and a long etc.</li></ul><p>These are still big ambitious questions that deal on moral and social progress indirectly.
