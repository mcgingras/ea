Obviously there's nothing that EA can realistically do for development in South Africa or Argentina, countries with very different histories but completely screwed-up utterly hopeless politics. That said, most developing countries have institutions that are quite a bit more functional than this and there's a lot more to work with (even in somewhere like Nigeria, vide <a href=\"https://kenopalo.substack.com/p/on-why-i-remain-bullish-on-nigeria).\">https://kenopalo.substack.com/p/on-why-i-remain-bullish-on-nigeria).</a> That sort of work ultimately takes long-term cadre building in developing countries themselves since trying to import governance wholesale rarely works outside of (occasionally) authoritarian regimes, but the potential payoffs are of course absolutely enormous.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Sol3:2"}}]
