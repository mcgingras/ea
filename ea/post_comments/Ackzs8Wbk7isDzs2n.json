I had a similar reaction to Haydn's recent \"<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/3/25/23655082/ai-openai-gpt-4-safety-microsoft-facebook-meta\">If your model is going to sell, it has to be safe</a>\" piece. Let me try to unpack this:</p><p>On one hand, I do think safety is important for the commercial interests of labs. And broadly being better able to understand/control systems seems good from a commercial standpoint.</p><p>My biggest reservations can be boiled down into two points:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>I don't think that commercial incentives will be enough to motivate people to solve the hardest parts of alignment</strong>. Commercial incentives will drive people to make sure their system <i>appears to do what users want</i>, which is very different than having systems that <i>actually do what users want </i>or <i>robustly do what users want even as they become more powerful</i>. Or to put it another way: near-term commercial incentives don't really cause me to put appropriate amounts of attention on things like situational awareness or deceptive alignment. I think commercial incentives will be sufficient to reduce the odds of Bingchat fiascos, but I don't think they'll motivate the kind of alignment research that's trying to handle deception, sharp left turns, or even the most ambitious types of scalable oversight work.</li><li><strong>The research that is directly incentivized by commercial interests is least likely to be neglected</strong>. I expect the most neglected research to be research that doesn't have any direct commercial benefit. I expect AGI labs will invest a substantial amount of resources to prevent future Bingchat scenarios and other instances of egregious deployment harms. The problem is that I expect many of these approaches (e.g., getting really good at RLHFing your model such that it no longer displays undesirable behaviors) will not generalize to more powerful systems. I think you (and many others) agree with this, but I think the important point here is that <i>the economic incentives will favor RLHFy stuff over stuff that tackles problems that are not as directly commercially incentivized</i>.</li></ol><p>As a result, even though I agree with many of your subclaims, I'm still left thinking, \"huh, the message I want to spread is not something like \"hey, in order to win the race or sell your product, you need to solve alignment.\"&nbsp;</p><p>But rather something more like \"hey, there are some safety problems you'll need to figure out to sell/deploy your product. Cool that you're interested in that stuff. <strong>There are other safety problems-- often ones that are more speculative-- that the market is not incentivizing companies to solve. On the margin, I want more attention paid to those problems. </strong>And if we just focus on solving the problems that are required for profit/deployment, we will likely fool ourselves into thinking that our systems are safe when they merely appear to be safe, and we may underinvest in understanding/detecting/solving some of the problems that seem most concerning from an x-risk perspective.\"</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Akash"}}, {"_id": "aNTFamWeBzc57Z5rs", "postedAt": "2023-03-29T22:17:56.974Z", "postId": "Ackzs8Wbk7isDzs2n", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>There are other safety problems-- often ones that are more speculative-- that the market is not incentivizing companies to solve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>My personal response would be as follows:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>As Leopold presents it, the key pressure here that keeps labs in check is <i>societal constraints on deployment</i>, not <i>perceived ability to make money</i>. The hope is that society's response has the following properties:<ol><li>thoughtful, prominent experts are attuned to these risks and demand rigorous responses</li><li>policymakers are attuned to (thoughtful) expert opinion</li><li>policy levers exist that provide policymakers with oversight / leverage over labs</li></ol></li><li>If labs are sufficiently thoughtful, they'll notice that deploying models is in fact bad for them! Can't make profit if you're dead. *taps forehead knowingly*<ol><li>but in practice I agree that lots of people are motivated by the tastiness of progress, pro-progress vibes, etc., and will not notice the skulls.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Counterpoints to 1:</p><p><strong>Good regulation of deployment is hard</strong> (though not impossible in my view).&nbsp;</p><ul><li>reasonable policy responses are difficult to steer towards</li><li>attempts at raising awareness of AI risk could lead to policymakers getting too excited about the promise of AI while ignoring the risks</li><li>experts will differ; policymakers might not listen to the right experts</li></ul><p><strong>Good regulation of </strong><i><strong>development </strong></i><strong>is much harder, and will eventually be necessary.</strong></p><p>This is the really tricky one IMO. I think it requires pretty far-reaching regulations that would be difficult to get passed today, and would probably misfire a lot. But doesn't seem impossible, and I know people are working on laying groundwork for this in various ways (e.g. pushing for labs to incorporate evals in their development process).</p>", "parentCommentId": "ibjMJ2DxT9udJQP7m", "user": {"username": "deep"}}, {"_id": "JxEGkRjdzxJ8ZFAGX", "postedAt": "2023-03-29T22:29:19.285Z", "postId": "Ackzs8Wbk7isDzs2n", "htmlBody": "<p>Like Akash, I agree with a lot of the object-level points here and disagree with some of the framing / vibes.
