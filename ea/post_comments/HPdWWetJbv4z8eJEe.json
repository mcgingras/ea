Also, in many cases, insurance increases the risk of a lawsuit or reduces the other side's willingness to settle.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, suppose I think someone negligently breaks my leg and I am considering whether it is worthwhile to litigate. If I find out the person is an uninsured second-year philosophy grad student, I probably won't bother -- collecting any judgment will be very difficult, and a rational judgment debtor will just file for bankruptcy and get the debt wiped anyway. If the person is a middle-class tourist from the UK, I will probably find it worthwhile to sue if the damages are big enough and if I think there is a good enough chance I could collect on any judgment. Now, if I know that either of these people were insured, I am much more likely to sue, and I am not going to be willing to reduce a settlement demand based on doubts about collectability.</p><p>However, I think there is a good idea here. I would suggest there is a legal clawback risk and a \"moral clawback risk\" -- that the grantee will be (and/or feel) ethically obliged to return some or all money although not legally required. Replacing some or all of the FTX-aligned funds seems to weigh the combined legal + moral clawback risk at 100%. Although offering insurance has some downsides, it does seem less expensive than unconditionally replacing the funds.&nbsp;</p><p>So there may be some conditions under which a funder would find it wortwhile to provide clawback insurance while it would not fund the project.&nbsp;</p><p>That sounds <i>relatively</i> straightforward as it comes to legal clawback risk; it is interesting to consider how &nbsp;\"insurance\" might work if the \"insurer\" were willing to provide some coverage for moral clawback risk. For those with certain beliefs about moral clawback, the grantee's moral-clawback obligation or non-obligation can already be determined, so an \"insurance\" paradigm makes no sense. But for some of us, the nature and extent of a moral-clawback obligation depends on information that is not yet known.</p><p>Would the \"insurer\" decide the extent to which the ultimately determined facts create an ethical obligation to return funds? Or perhaps the \"insurer\" would offer 100% coverage for legal clawback risk and would allow the \"insured\" to decide moral clawback subject to a coinsurance requirement. For example, the \"insurer\" might only match the amount the \"insured\" was willing to voluntarily return out of its own pocket. &nbsp;That would address concerns that grantees may be too quick to find a moral-clawback obligation if the cost is coming entirely out of someone else's pocket, and reduce the cost of providing \"insurance.\"</p>", "parentCommentId": "eEEynrSoeMksMzX3q", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "hbGBMACiHHnX3qTKR", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T19:44:55.609Z", "postId": "HPdWWetJbv4z8eJEe", "htmlBody": "<p>I strongly suspect there are legal reasons that covering future clawbacks, especially if they say so explicitly, is not going to be workable, or at least is significantly more complex / dangerous legally.</p>", "parentCommentId": "M9kCqEbGcavosrsE6", "user": {"username": "Davidmanheim"}}, {"_id": "LEpRNzuif6iHLzzyC", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T22:26:17.289Z", "postId": "HPdWWetJbv4z8eJEe", "htmlBody": "<p>(I work at Open Phil assisting with this effort.)</p>\n<p>We think that people in this situation should apply.
