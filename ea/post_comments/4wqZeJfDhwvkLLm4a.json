That's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ufmRBzscMnBkyYxSc/vincent-van-der-holst-s-quick-takes?commentId=vit94vtX43CizeCjS\">here.</a><br><br>We also did a red teaming session on Profit for Good at EAGxRotterdam. This was filmed but unfortunately never released (I think the video person literally said they lost the recording :/).&nbsp;<br><br>Generally the biggest reasons against Profit for Good, based on my experience of founding one called BOAS:<br>- Raising capital is (at least currently) harder. It's hard for me to put a number on it but I'd say it's at least 3 times less likely you'll receive funding.&nbsp;<br>- You will raise less capital and slower than the competition so they might outcompete.&nbsp;<br>- Legal issues. Depending on the country there's not set company structure for this.&nbsp;<br>- Lack of capital means you cannot retain talent (based on my experience getting talent is easier as a PFG) as easily as having deep venture capital funded pockets.&nbsp;<br>- Lack of understanding of stakeholders: generally a lot of people assume PFG's cannot scale because they donate profits. It's important people understand PFG's can reinvest profits just like regular for-profits.&nbsp;<br>- Status quo bias: just because people think it hasn't been done (it has, but people don't generally know that) they assume it cannot be done, even when presented with arguments (e.g. the successful PFG's already out there and the research on them).&nbsp;<br>- Some people argue that people are selfish and founders start companies to get rich, so they wouldn't want to start/run PFG's. Based on our founder pipeline it suggests the opposite. It was full of people who could make more money doing less work, and many applied <strong>because </strong>we were a PFG, not in spite of.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "BOAS"}}, {"_id": "KiC63xjx6rhY7eNLe", "postedAt": "2023-09-19T14:19:16.904Z", "postId": "4wqZeJfDhwvkLLm4a", "htmlBody": "<p>Please note that the arguments from the quick take are in the document under appropriate headings.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "XsAXkTqAnCG3B3s4H", "user": {"username": "Brad West"}}, {"_id": "xG5ZdMNYiqT5zqhog", "postedAt": "2023-09-19T14:35:17.858Z", "postId": "4wqZeJfDhwvkLLm4a", "htmlBody": "<p>I just saw they are.

Each firm ends up with some market power and thus charges a price that is ex-post, too high. However, there is a cost of entry, so firms enter until the final firm gets 0 economic profit.</p>\n<p>My thinking was that for those who favor the charitable firm, that charitable firm might not be the one 'closest to me' ... so I might end up travelling further to reap the 'charitable benefit', but with a transportation cost (or analogously, a 'product differs from my preference') cost that might counteract that benefit.</p>\n<p>The response was ~that some products are basically undifferentiated and have no or low entry costs/fixed operating costs.  But if there is free entry, why should we expect there to still be profits in such industries?  (You can come up with some reasons, but it might be hard to do this without a 'differentiated product' after all.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "david_reinstein"}}, {"_id": "LAeH7ch4WDLjE6Cgn", "postedAt": "2023-09-19T18:01:24.668Z", "postId": "4wqZeJfDhwvkLLm4a", "htmlBody": "<p>I think some of my other critiques and suggestions (note I am fairly positive on this idea, just trying to red team in a helpful way) were not addressed.
