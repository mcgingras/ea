In the \"Deathprint of meat\" section you clearly cite the sources for the meat-to-emissions conversions, but not the meat-to-animal conversions. From reading further down the piece it seems they probably come from Saja, K. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-012-9402-x\">2013</a>). Is that correct?<br><br>2. Saja (2013) seems to calculate 2 kg of chicken meat for \"Average animal products per one animal life\", which would be 0.5 chickens per 1kg though in your table you have 0.667 for animals killed per kg meat for chicken meat. I think that 0.667 is Saja's figure for Fish (1.5kg of meat per 1 fish)?<br><br>3. If you did use Saja (2013), I wonder if you could elaborate on why, especially since as you note it \"excludes the animals used as feed (e.g. fish meal and insect meal given to farm animals).\" One could also use the conversion factors from <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/animal-product-impact-scales/\"><u>Faunalytics (2020)</u></a> which I believe do include feed fish (here 1kg of chicken meat would be associated with 0.87 animal deaths).
