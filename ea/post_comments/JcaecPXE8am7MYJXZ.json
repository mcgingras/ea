You feel like you're in a recognition deficit, many people around you feel the same way, and no one is injecting gratitude into the ecosystem to resolve the misery spiral.

It's tiring that there's always more to do and that I could always be prioritising harder and helping others more. A thing that makes that bearable to me is working together - having a community supporting each other other in trying to do good but also giving each other a break. It feels horrid to instead have people angry at each other, and getting fire from outside the community too. I hope your local community is supportive. I hope you guys are able to help each other to focus on the good and to take breaks, and deeply care about each other, while you're all improving the lives of others. &nbsp;I hope some of the appreciative, caring messages people have left in response to this post have helped the burden feel a little lighter. &nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}]
