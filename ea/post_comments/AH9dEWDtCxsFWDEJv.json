It was totally weird and drew confused looks. My colleagues thought I was going somewhere after work where that apparel would\u2019ve been appropriate. In another locale, all the high-status people wore too-large, faded, and holey pullovers (and other such pieces) probably to signal that what they value in their apparel are its thermal properties and not the social ones (ironically).</p>\n<p>My take-away from that was that if I engage in in-person outreach efforts, I\u2019d have to dress in various very different ways according to the audience\u2014and that seems to be in line with the usual leafleting tips.</p>\n<p>However I don\u2019t often engage in such outreach. It\u2019s more common that I\u2019m among friends and would like to influence them.

We create better ideas when we a) have access to new ideas, and b) access to lots of different kinds of ideas. People with access to new ideas are often seen as weird, and you need to be weird yourself to search for or find a profusion of different perspectives, so people with better ideas are practically inevitably weird, despite all of the weird people with terrible ideas.</p>\n<p>So, rhetorically, if you have a weird idea, it's helpful to find what is integral, universal, and generic about it, such that when you try to explain it to people they don't explode over how weird it is. An example: a friend was telling his partner about creating a house built around the tree, but planting the tree as a sapling in a container above, and then training its roots as they grew through the house so that they were effectively living inside of, or underneath and within, a treehouse, but the partner thought this was very very strange until my friend mentioned that people train vines along trellises all the time, and it's the same idea.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "SASS"}}, {"_id": "5dD43fyuGJv77Fsbd", "postedAt": "2015-03-16T18:07:30.051Z", "postId": "AH9dEWDtCxsFWDEJv", "htmlBody": "<p>Great article addressing an important question. I've had a lot of similar concerns being active in environmental politics - thinking, did you HAVE to wear that to this interview, or did you HAVE to dye your hair that colour? This is, I think, a case of #6, specifically weirdness as a signal of a stereotype.</p>\n<p>For environmentalism, the worry is that a potential audience will switch off immediately because they can caricature the activist as part of a particular set of people who are all very alike, and as a group are very different to the audience. If all greens have green, dreadlocked hair and wear oriental patterns on their baggy trousers, the danger is that weirdness doesn't just look like an expression of honest individuality, it's actually quite the opposite - a signal of belonging to a distinct group which has little in common with many of those it ought to be seeking to persuade. </p>\n<p>For EA, I'm not sure if the same danger rears its head. I'm sure in ten years it might be possible to stereotype and caricature effective altruists, but the stereotype doesn't exist in the public mentality quite yet. For that reason, it's not so easy simply to switch off and say, &quot;Nah, that stuff is just for altruists&quot;, treating altruists as a kind of subculture. And it's fairly unlikely that we will become a subculture - as has been noted, if there's something weird that does unite EAers, it's probably a particular stance on morality, rationality and so on - things which are fairly cerebral and need not have any obvious external presence. The things that are noticeably weird about us tend not to be shared, and so don't contribute to the possibility of stereotyping. </p>\n<p>And when you have the occasional weirdness that's just an honest, personal thing, and you're a generally nice person on the whole, it's not weird at all - it's charming, it's eccentric, and it probably does an awful lot more good than being identikit and grey.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Luke_Ilott"}}]
