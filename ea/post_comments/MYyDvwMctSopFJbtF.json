According to <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-updates-to-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework/#2-our-previous-bar\">Open Phil</a>, \"GiveWell uses moral weights for child deaths that would be consistent with assuming 51 years of foregone life in the DALY framework (though that is not how they reach the conclusion)\", so satisfying the needs one person would have to extend its healthy life expectancy by 4.53 years (= 0.0888*51).</li><li>I think it is unlikely that satisfying the needs would results in such large benefit. Healthy life expectancy at birth in the Palestine was 61.8 in 2016, which means satisfying the needs of one person would have to extend it by 7.33 % (= 4.53/61.8). I believe this can be thought of as satisfying the needs being equivalent to eliminating a 7.33 % risk of death of 2.7 million, which seems a clear overestimate of the real risk.</li></ul><p>On the one hand, there may be interventions which satisfy the needs at much higher cost-effectiveness than the suggested above.
