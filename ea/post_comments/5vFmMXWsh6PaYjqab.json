Max Tegmark is President of the former, Nick Bostrom is Director of the latter. The two dramas today are not related, other than longtermist organisations needing better acronyms]</p><p><strong>Some other things noted for further detail from the article:</strong></p><ul><li>I have no reason to dispute the claim of <i>Nya Dagbladet </i>to be a 'pro-nazi' site<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsdu5fext56o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsdu5fext56o\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(<i>clarifying edit/correction in footnote)&nbsp;</i> - users with a bigger knowledge of the Swedish media ecosphere might be able to clarify, but this claim seems to be trustworthy.</li><li>Expo claims that a promise from FLI for a grant is in a written application to the County Administration of Dalarna in Sweden with a signature by Tergmark, despite Tegmark initially denying the claim - they now have a picture of Tegmark sending a letter of intent, which unless forged, looks 100% genuine.</li><li>A response from Dentons (a US law-firm representing FLI) <s>seems to confirm the decision to fund </s><i><s>Nya Dagbladet&nbsp;</s></i><s> had been made, but there is now no promise from FLI and not likely to be</s>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefigbz81lkzoi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnigbz81lkzoi\">[2]</a></sup></span>.

It is unclear why FLI decided to make the grant initially, and later change their minds.</li><li>Tegmark's brother, Per, seems to be affiliated with the Populist, anti-vax right in Sweden (note,this is only after a very cursory Google search). The reasons this seems to be relevant is that Per has been a contributing writer for <i>Nya Dagbladet </i>in recent years.</li></ul><p><strong>My understanding:</strong></p><ul><li>In August/September, FLI promised funding in a letter of intent for $100k to <i>Nya Dagbladet&nbsp;</i> so they could set up their foundation.&nbsp;</li><li>In October, the promise of funds seems to have been secure enough for the Dalarna County Administrative Board to register the foundation.</li><li>In December, Expo (presumably investigating the new <i>Nya Dagbladet</i> Foundation) follow the money back to FLI and question Tegmark</li><li>Tegmark initially denies having done so, &nbsp;but Expo have the signed letter. Eventually Dentons, a law firm, respond for FLI and deny that any funds had been released to <i>Nya Dagbladet</i>, and that this decision had been made before Expo got in contact with Tegmark/FLI. They have not responded since.</li></ul><p>I cannot speak to any legal questions here, or liability that FLI might face, though I'm not sure why there would be.</p><p>There are, however, massive reputational issues at stake. The EA movement is under intense scrutiny right now, and this seems to be another case of <s>a major actor</s> a well-known actor in our movement doing something that has massively poor consequences for the public perception of EA unless they can explain why.

But I think I will elaborate on my thoughts on EA/politics in a future post, rather than here.

It seems like there is almost no communication coming out from EA orgs and leaders, which presumably is very legally safe but can have very damaging reputational consequences.</p>\n<p>I expect you're constrained in what you can say in response to this but, candidly, I think it's important to note that CEA itself is choosing public silence, albeit about a different issue. Accordingly, I was surprised to see you posting (in a personal capacity) about another org needing to give a full explanation and you not understanding why they haven't, and especially in such strong terms. CEA's example probably influences a lot of other orgs within EA.</p>\n<p>Is there something I am missing on this?

One of these grant proposals came from the Nya Dagbladet Foundation&nbsp;(NDF, not to be confused with the eponymous newspaper)&nbsp;for a media project directly related to FLI's goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although&nbsp;we were initially positive about the proposal and its prospects,&nbsp;we ultimately decided to reject it because of what our subsequent due diligence uncovered.&nbsp;We have given Nya Dagbladet and their affiliates zero funding and zero support of any kind, and will not fund them in the future.&nbsp;These final decisions were made by FLI\u2019s leadership independently of any outside influence&nbsp;and well before any inquiry regarding the NDF proposal by members of the media.</p><p>On December 15, after we had informed NDF that their proposal was rejected, <a href=\"http://expo.se/\">Expo.se</a> contacted FLI with questions regarding the NDF proposal.&nbsp;We&nbsp;responded the same day that FLI had decided not to fund the project now or at any later time.</p><p>On January 13 <a href=\"http://expo.se/\">Expo.se</a> nonetheless ran&nbsp;<a href=\"https://expo.se/2023/01/elon-musk-funded-nonprofit-run-mit-professor-offered-finance-swedish-pro-nazi-group\">their piece</a>&nbsp;with a clickbait title combining \"Musk\" and \u201cpro-nazi\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other issues we have with their article, we consider this headline reference to \"Musk\" to be unfair and misleading.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is only one of many prominent members of the worldwide science and tech communities to have supported the Future of Life Institute over the years, and plays no role in our grantmaking decisions.

The platform reacted angrily to the decision, and published a series of articles where specific officials at the agency were named and pictured. The publications caused distress among employees at the agency who felt menaced and pressured, as <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/kultur/anstallda-pa-myndighet-pressade-av-hogerextrema-medier/\"><i><u>Dagens Nyheter</u></i></a> reported at the time. The following year, Nya Dagbladet made another application for public funding; this time they were successful and received about $30,000 in various grants.</p></blockquote><p>The article linked (archive <a href=\"https://archive.ph/7nZb7\">here</a>) Google translates the article as referring to the Norwegian press. I thought that was pretty weird, but from googling the Swedish (Myndigheten f\u00f6r press, radio och tv), I think the Google translate is wrong and it is indeed about the Swedish press (<a href=\"https://www.mprt.se/\">here</a> is the website of the Swedish press agency).

Neo-Nazism is bad.</p><blockquote><p>because you offer support without conditionalising on how bad the misdeeds are (\u201chowever questionable\u201d they are).</p></blockquote><p>I think I may be giving a wrong impression here. I don't offer unconditional support for someone who's, say, funneling millions of dollars to neo-Nazis. Max clearly has not done that, and given the evidence at hand, I support him standing up for himself. That means I am conditioning on having some sense of the evidence, which contradicts my wording. I meant to hedge my words by saying something to the effect of, 'well I'm offering this support even though I don't know very much of the specifics, so don't like judge me if this turns out to be really horrible'. But this is a bit cowardly given that, well, my support <i>is</i> somewhat conditional on having read some about this and seeing his comment, and reflects some anticipation that he has a good chance (50%?) of having not been really in the wrong. That said, yes I think something wrong or really wrong may have happened here, and don't want to be construed as not allowing for that reality.</p><p>This is a technicality, but \"seeking answers\" is describable as inquisitiveness and inquisitional, so &nbsp;I stand by my wording, in that I think it both technically true and carries the vibe I want it to convey, even if it's actually justified on people's part to ask those questions. I meant it to have that double-meaning. Given the karma amounts going on, I don't consider the connotative usage at all hyperbolic, and I'm not including social media discourse that almost certainly exists but which I have not seen.</p><blockquote><p><i>noun &nbsp;</i>1. a period of <u>prolonged</u> and intensive questioning or investigation.</p></blockquote><p>I think people's questioning is very valid in this circumstance. I also think Max has a right to stand up for himself if he believes he hasn't done wrong. The fact that he didn't pay out money after investigating seems <i>pretty important</i> to me. But I don't know what that process was with the paperwork and some letter I forget the exact name of, because I am unvirtuously not looking at the actual empirical details very closely. I think Max will provide more details of his intentions, and questioning is a process that will help with that. The fact that his brother was involved strikes me as a conflict-of-interest that should provide pause, though I also know there are many conflicts-of-interest in EA-land. I would guess that it would be pretty hard for someone investigating the newspaper to not catch some whiff that it was problematic early on, if they hadn't heard of the newspaper already (I don't know how well-known it is there). That determines whether a \"positive initial impression\" on his part would make sense or not, as that's the only wrong thing I have seen so far based on what he said, an initial mistake in doing due diligence fast enough. I think a crux we maybe have here is that I'm basically taking him at his word on that, and assuming he doesn't have like corrupt ties or fascist leanings, which for all I know could be false. My best guess is that the latter is not the case (I hear something about him being center-left?) and that leaves the problem of maybe his brother came pleading to him to save this newspaper and that they would do some longtermist programming in exchange for saving it, I don't know!</p><blockquote><p>It seems as if you find outrage in response to misdeeds more offensive than the misdeeds themselves</p></blockquote><p>If FLI loses hundreds of thousands in funding, or more, for what turns out to have been a mistake in due diligence, that would indeed be a sad consequence to me. Though I agree that it's <i>more</i> important to question institutions if they are acting out of integrity than what the results are (see more below).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cdepending on how bad the actions were, FLI should apologise or not apologise, and we should criticise or punish them in proportion to how bad they were\u201d</p></blockquote><p>I agree. I think it's not obvious to me yet that they have besides fucking up on due diligence speed. Again, I will hedge by saying I am not combing carefully over the evidence like others are.</p><blockquote><p>\"I would far prefer a world in which people feel entitled to do that, than one where it\u2019s discouraged. When I imagine the alternative, I imagine a world in which we automatically assume good intent on the part of any authority figure alleged to have done something bad, or one in which people are too polite or timid to speak out, etc.\"</p></blockquote><p>Given what happened with SBF, and the extent to which this type of questioning might have uncovered that sooner, I simply have to agree, even if the results make me uncomfortable. It is extremely important we do more of this (in a sustainable way?).</p><p>Edit 1: I really like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5vFmMXWsh6PaYjqab/linkpost-fli-alleged-to-have-offered-funding-to-far-right?commentId=GYpBx6ETSbTx9h6Zy\">harfe's questions</a> for Max, and I should also add my original comment was not referring to any specific comments that were made in response to Max's top-level comment, since mine was the first response afaik, though I think I was anticipating him receiving a ton of skepticism, and wanted to express support for what looks like someone in a really hard place right now who likely had mostly good intentions going into this.</p>", "parentCommentId": "6dAnNixTgPHWwhNex", "user": {"username": "DonyChristie"}}, {"_id": "GzMd2qWG6qvHtojHK", "postedAt": "2023-01-16T01:43:20.845Z", "postId": "5vFmMXWsh6PaYjqab", "htmlBody": "<p>This statement really doesn't answer most of the questions raised by the Expo report. Indeed, it spends about as much time criticizing Expo as providing specific factual information about FLI's&nbsp;questioned conduct.</p><p>The approval of this grant seems bizarre enough that justification beyond the bare characterization of a positive impression is needed here. What was the grant proposal about? How did funding it further FLI's mission? Why was it assessed positively?</p><p>What vetting of the grant proposal did FLI conduct before issuing the letter declaring that it had \"approved a grant\" to NDF? (I'm quoting from the September 7 letter published by Expo. FLI hasn't repudiated that letter as false or misleading at the time it was written, so I'm going to take it at face value.). It does not seem responsible that one would \"approve[]\" a six-figure grant without having some idea about who the proposed grantee was and their ability to carry out the purposes of the grant. Nor does it seem reasonable that FLI would determine that making a grant to a proposed foundation associated with a far-right, anti-science, Holocaust-denying media outlet was an effective way to get \"research, outreach and other important work in furtherance of FLI\u2019s mission\" done.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as the press statement's attempt to mainstream the people associated with NDF, Expo quoted from a Holocaust-denial editorial by the lead editor of the media outlet (chair of NDF) and exhortations by another ND editor to vote for a neo-Nazi political party (as characterized by the Anti-Defamation League). NDF's \"board of directors consists of the senior editors of\" ND, which means those editors stood by while ND published advocacy for a neo-Nazi political party. See also other comments on this thread.</p><p>Your brother told&nbsp;Expo that he did \"not want to answer questions concerning whether he has been involved in contacts between Nya Dagbladet and FLI.\" Are you in a position to state whether (and if so, how) he was involved in any way with the grant, with NDF, or with any contact between the prospective grantees and FLI? If there was involvement, can you state whether you and your wife recused yourself from any consideration of the grant proposal due to an involvement of an immediate family member?</p><p>What information did FLI find -- and not know earlier -- that caused it to rescind the grant \"approv[al]\"? Why was this information not found earlier?</p><p>Do you want to comment on your response to Expo asserting that FLI had not \"approved grants to any person or organization in Scandinavia\"? Unless there is more context, that statement isn't consistent with the September 7 letter or the media statement above. Especially when combined with a statement suggesting that Expo had no reasonable factual basis for having such a belief: \"Where did you get this incorrect information about Future of Life Institute?\"&nbsp;</p><p>Basically, I am finding it hard to find a way in which none of the following three following statements are true: (1) FLI approved a six-figure grant to NDF without looking to see what kind of work the proposed grantees did; (2) FLI was on notice of their extremist views and approved the grant anyway; or (3) FLI made a false or misleading statement about approving the grant when it knew or should have known that statement would be relied on by third parties. If FLI had not yet considered whether NDF was an appropriate grantee (but was planning to do so later), it was simply not appropriate to characterize this as an approved grant. (In contrast, I think it was OK that the letter did not list certain legally-required and technical preconditions.) One problem with issuing a vague response is that it leaves the reader to determine which of these three statements is true. I think all are problematic, but some more so than others.</p><p>The final paragraph of the statement is the most alarming. The statements that you will \"continue to engage the broadest sample of humankind\" and make \"no apologies for engaging with many people across the immensely diverse political spectrum\" have been made in the specific context of criticism for approving a grant to an organization whose board is significantly linked to Holocaust denial (and <i>at the very least</i> extremely tolerant of neo-Nazism). If you did not intend to include such organizations in your statements of non-apology and future intent, you really should say so and define the bounds of who FLI is willing to work with.</p>", "parentCommentId": "Dn88oPPMdDK9dpmjh", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "3CbtZJSGAkc64c97K", "postedAt": "2023-01-16T05:37:55.464Z", "postId": "5vFmMXWsh6PaYjqab", "htmlBody": "<p>\"I would normally angrily downvote you, but I do want to indicate support for you continuing to engage here and think it is good for other people to be able to see your response so I will vote up and disagree\"</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "QBAvWGsumKCYbYEEs", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "HywF7bnQknjxwhHDY", "postedAt": "2023-01-16T06:03:07.766Z", "postId": "5vFmMXWsh6PaYjqab", "htmlBody": "<p>&nbsp;Overall I think any reasonable person should have an intuition that the site is dodgy after skimming a few articles, and the Nazi articles are just irrefutable proof if you want to question that initial impression. &nbsp;<br><br>&gt; To be honest, given that the last name <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro\">Shapiro</a> seems to mostly be used by people with Jewish ancestry, I'd be kind of surprised if his brother knew about that content before submitting</p><p>I'd guess Shapiro knows he has some strange bedfellows but cares more about pushing anti-vax and right-wing populist view points than avoiding Nazis (unclear if he knows about that specific editorial ofc)&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "PtJpMm2JugkZQrpoc", "user": {"username": "elephantower"}}, {"_id": "2Lo9rs4tK3radDNxc", "postedAt": "2023-01-16T08:38:07.245Z", "postId": "5vFmMXWsh6PaYjqab", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Overall I think any reasonable person should have an intuition that the site is dodgy after skimming a few articles</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Eh I agree tbh but there's a gap between \"dodgy\" and \"horrific[ally] racist\", which was \"Shakeel's concern\" that you mentioned.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "HywF7bnQknjxwhHDY", "user": {"username": "DanielFilan"}}, {"_id": "CSJmcQaXkvoG7ebuz", "postedAt": "2023-01-16T10:41:34.188Z", "postId": "5vFmMXWsh6PaYjqab", "htmlBody": "<p>Not totally sure, but IIRC characters like 'a' or 'z' are about 8 bits each, depending how the text is encoded.
