Instead, it might be more effective to try to engage more with those closest and most salient to us -- housemates, workmates, siblings, parents, kids, old friends, etc. And often the most mood-lifting thing is not to ask these people for help, but rather to offer them help in whatever specific things they're trying to accomplish.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "NJEnvLJW6ruDWSceW", "postedAt": "2022-10-11T00:27:22.040Z", "postId": "MtD5S58nyuZt4toCg", "htmlBody": "<p>Great tip, Geoffrey - hadn't heard this before, look forward to trying it.</p>", "parentCommentId": "H9vedypd9aTwywMjv", "user": {"username": "Emily Dardaman"}}, {"_id": "yKCjxfpzWjDyjcKSZ", "postedAt": "2022-10-11T00:32:42.378Z", "postId": "MtD5S58nyuZt4toCg", "htmlBody": "<p>Great post.

I have definitely noticed how mood-lifting it can be to help others, especially if it is something I can do easily (such as translating a phrase to a coworker from a language they don't speak).<br><br>I also notice I am somewhat wary of using helping close ones as a form of emotional regulation because I've seen a fair share of co-dependency issues of different levels. Mostly in the form where someone gets closer to a person who is not doing that well, tries to take care of them and ends up in a space where their own mood is largely dictated by how the loved one feels.

In this sense, the person being alive and happy is intrinsically valuable, but not because it is their right to live. Seeing moral patients as \"containers\" of happiness is a common criticism of utilitarianism. (I have also had anxiety over \"but since I'm constantly sad does utilitarianism then tell me I should remove myself from the pool of sentient beings, what if the sum of total happiness is getting lower because of me\".
