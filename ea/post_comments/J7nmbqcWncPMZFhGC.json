I think this latter type of research can clearly be impactful - for instance, Racing to the Precipice is a pure game theory paper but informs much of the conversation of avoiding race dynamics.

I also don't think that would allow you to do much prediction of where public opinion is headed.

This intermediary role could probably benefit from a few years of immersion in the gov't/policy/think tank world -- but not such deep immersion that one soaks up all of the conventional wisdom and groupthink and unexamined assumptions that tend to characterize many policy subcultures.

There are so many comments like \"we need an agency like the FDA or the IAEA\" from people who only have a superficial notion of how these agencies operate.

I don't know how many discussions I've had about AI Safety and Governance in the context of China, but almost nobody (certainly not me!) has been in the discussions providing perspective of how things actually work in China, how policies can be influenced, how corporations and government actually influence each other (i.e. who meets whom, when, where, what flexibility do they have, ...). So this could be a great area for someone who has worked in that kind of area in China, or who has a network of people in that area.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Denis "}}, {"_id": "4mDBCACLLot9Ra5pt", "postedAt": "2023-10-05T13:22:38.405Z", "postId": "J7nmbqcWncPMZFhGC", "htmlBody": "<p>Another +1 that it's surprisingly easy to get experts to talk to you.
