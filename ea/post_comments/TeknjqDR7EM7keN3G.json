I love the new recommendations page, and I\u2019m thrilled that GWWC is taking the \u201cevaluate the evaluators\u201d mission seriously. The one thing I\u2019m kind of confused by is the new GWWC funds. Don\u2019t EA funds already serve as the natural choice for donors who want high impact giving opportunities within a particular cause area and don\u2019t want to worry about having to manually update their selections as recommendations change? Having a duplicate set of funds within Effective Ventures seems like it will add overhead and confusion without necessarily providing a clear benefit. In trying to think through the potential benefits, I do see how having the GWWC funds would make it possible to not recommend certain EA funds in future years if you were to find issues with their grantmaking. However, it seems like those kinds of issues could also be addressed via the EA funds making changes in response to the GWWC research team\u2019s findings. Having two sets of competing funds trying to do the same thing within EV just appears to me to be a potentially poor use of resources unless there\u2019s a clear justification for keeping them separate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My apologies if this question has already been addressed elsewhere, I tried to look back through the previous announcement and AMA but may have missed some discussions.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MHR"}}, {"_id": "NyuuesrCTdqCG69cC", "postedAt": "2023-11-28T08:27:41.059Z", "postId": "TeknjqDR7EM7keN3G", "htmlBody": "<p>I\u2019m also confused about this.</p>\n<p>As I understand things there are now two different global health funds under the Effective Ventures umbrella, both of which currently amount to deferring to GiveWell (which, to be clear, I think makes a lot of sense!) with extra steps.</p>\n<p>First there\u2019s the EA Funds Global Health and Development Fund, which really seems to be equivalent to the GiveWell All Grants fund but with EA Funds branding. The fund managers are <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/global-development#fund-managers\">listed</a> as Elie Hassenfeld (co-founder and CEO of GiveWell) and GiveWell Staff, and the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/gwuk/about/faq\">GiveWell UK FAQ</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GiveWell acts as the manager of the Fund and directs EA Funds on where to grant it. Giving to the GH&amp;D Fund is analogous to giving to GiveWell's <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants\">All Grants Fund</a> in that we may allocate the Fund to less certain but still high-expected-value opportunities outside of our top charities. You might choose to give to the GH&amp;D Fund instead of our All Grants Fund via GiveWell UK if you would also like to support other cause areas through EA Funds (such as its <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare\">Animal Welfare Fund</a>, <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\">Long-Term Future Fund</a>, or <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community\">EA Infrastructure Fund</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That last sentence is the only publicly stated justification I\u2019ve found for why the EA Funds GH&amp;D Fund exists. It doesn\u2019t seem very compelling to me. I guess it would have been awkward to create EA Funds for the other cause areas but not for global health?</p>\n<p>And now there\u2019s the GWWC Global Health and Wellbeing Fund, whose <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-GB/charities/global-health-and-wellbeing-fund\">webpage</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Grants from the fund] may include allocations to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charities or projects recommended by an evaluator/grantmaker the research team has evaluated (such as a grant to <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-GB/charities/against-malaria-foundation\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, which is recommended by <a href=\"http://www.givewell.com/\">GiveWell</a>).</li>\n<li>A fund run by an evaluator the research team has evaluated (such as a grant to whichever GiveWell funds can best use it).</li>\n<li>Charities or projects the research team has reason to believe are highly impactful, including cases where this reasoning isn\u2019t the result of deferring to a vetted evaluator (though we expect this to be rare, as the research team generally evaluates evaluators rather than individual charities or projects).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>For this first round, we expect to allocate donations to this fund in consultation with GiveWell, based on our recent <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rn1d69KR3zfVzZaRZvSZNp1vcDap1hudzxngNqeFHuc/edit#heading=h.e3jonqb3x294\">evaluation of its work</a>. In practice, this will likely closely resemble the grantmaking of GiveWell\u2019s All Grants Fund\u2026 Our research team may identify new funding opportunities (outside of those recommended by GiveWell) in future grantmaking rounds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here there\u2019s potential at least for future divergence from GiveWell\u2019s recommendations. But it seems this will really only come into its own if GWWC finds another global health evaluator it endorses, or develops substantial global health expertise of its own.</p>\n<p>More broadly, now that GWWC has launched its own funds, how does Effective Ventures expect the relationship between GWWC and other grantmakers under the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GRYFJGnye2gCxCTG4/ea-orgs-legal-structure-inhibits-risk-taking-and-information\">EV fiscal sponsorship umbrella</a> to evolve? What would the internal governance and external communications look like if, hypothetically, the GWWC research team concluded that one of the other EV-sponsored grantmakers was allocating funds poorly?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "QtrLtgjoXg37gkteq", "user": {"username": "Andrew Gimber"}}, {"_id": "cvaXw6ZuBQGyTgacj", "postedAt": "2023-11-28T17:27:11.720Z", "postId": "TeknjqDR7EM7keN3G", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you! Great question.

This is because we ended up working with GiveWell based on our initial evaluations, and EA Funds has historically asked them to advise their fund as well. However, this could easily change in the short- to medium-term, e.g. we hope to evaluate both Happier Lives Institute and Founders Pledge next year as candidates for evaluators informing our GH&amp;W Fund grantmaking in addition to GiveWell.</p>\n<p>Hope that clarifies a bit!
