Are you referring to my posts and comments on social media? That's more transient, so I make less of an effort on social media to be legible to everyone. Do you have examples of the posts or comments of mine you mean? I don't get tons of feedback on this. Of course people tell me I'm often confusing. But the feedback isn't actionable. I can decode any posts you send me. For example, here is a <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1oc/volunteer_opportunities_in_effective_altruism/\">post of mine</a> where I haven't gotten any negative feedback on the content or writing style. This post was like a cross between a personal essay and dense cause prioritization discussion, so it's something I wouldn't usually post to the EA Forum. It's gotten some downvotes, but clearly more upvotes than downvotes, so somebody is finding it useful. Again, if I get some downvotes it's ultimately feedback on what does or doesn't work on the EA Forum. This is the kind of clearer feedback specifying something. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "cHqR8g8HLnRgZuc75", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "9E4GZiX8e4PncYZiN", "postedAt": "2018-06-12T00:51:30.937Z", "postId": "JPtptap3cdvXRq2BY", "htmlBody": "<p>I also have some posts I've taken more time to edit for clarity on my personal blog about <a href=\"https://ideasyncretic.wordpress.com/tag/effective-altruism/\">effective altruism</a>. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "cHqR8g8HLnRgZuc75", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "vnDsWs8eurkZZqYYw", "postedAt": "2018-06-12T10:39:10.865Z", "postId": "JPtptap3cdvXRq2BY", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't want to spend too long on this, so to take the most available example (i.e. treat this more as representative than an extreme example): Your summary at the top of this post.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General point: I get it now but I had to re-read a few times.</li>\n<li>I think the old &quot;you're using long words&quot; is a part of this, which is common in EA and non-colloquial terms are often worth the price of reduced accessibility, but you seem to do this more than most (e.g. &quot;posit how&quot; could be &quot;suggest that&quot;/&quot;explore how&quot;, &quot;heretofore&quot; could be &quot;thus far&quot;, &quot;delineate&quot; could be &quot;identify&quot;/&quot;trace&quot; etc....it's not that I don't recognise these words, they're just less familiar and so make reading more effort).</li>\n<li>Perhaps long sentences with frequent subordinate clauses - and I note the irony of my using that term - and, indeed, the irony of adding a couple here - add to the density.</li>\n<li>More paragraphs, subheadings, italics, proofing etc. might help a bit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also have the general sense that you use <em>too many</em> words - your comments and posts are usually long but don't seem to be saying enough to justify the length.

For example, I'd hope someone familiar with academic jargon but relatively new to EA might come to fully understand the case of potential s-risks from terraforming, having come in knowing little to nothing about the subject. I'm aware I often use too many words, but when the time comes to make posts more accessible, I can and will do so. I appreciate this feedback though. Please feel free to provide feedback anytime. I update on it quite quickly, even from a single person. I wish more people felt comfortable doing so. </p>\n<p>I wrote this post up because it will tie into a series of blog posts I'll be rolling out.
