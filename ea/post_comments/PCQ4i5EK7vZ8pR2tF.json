Relatedly, for next EAG I want to have a small set of questions to ask people (last time it was &quot;What do you think of insect suffering?&quot;). I would highly recommend others come in with thought-provoking questions they want answered. Brainstorming:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is one trait/idea/action/ you wished the EA community had/understood/took? (or insert &quot;people&quot; for &quot;EA community)</li>\n<li>What is one book you would recommend and why?</li>\n<li><em>Takes out $5</em> Where should I donate this?</li>\n<li>What do you need help with in your life?</li>\n<li>What are you most uncertain about?</li>\n<li>What would make you change your cause prioritization?</li>\n<li>Who do you most look up to?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Warning: At EAG Berkeley at least, not <em>everyone</em> you meet will be able to answer all of these questions because they're newer to the movement - adapt accordingly.</p>\n<p>Perhaps print off some business cards (even crude, informal ones), with whatever information you wish to impart to people - contact or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Try to do a summary of the day before you go to sleep (or just the trip). I made a post on Facebook and tagged some of the people I met (you will have to friend them first for the tag).</p>\n<p>Any other ideas? :-)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "DonyChristie"}}, {"_id": "nXzNEwfiq9rbApB5F", "postedAt": "2017-05-17T07:00:50.385Z", "postId": "PCQ4i5EK7vZ8pR2tF", "htmlBody": "<p>Love your writing style!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Telofy"}}]
