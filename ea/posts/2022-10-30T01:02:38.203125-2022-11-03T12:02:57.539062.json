But, and it\u2019s a big but, ~80% of the applications are speculative, from people outside the EA community and don\u2019t even really understand what we do. Of the 300&nbsp;<u>relevant</u> candidates we receive, maybe 20 or so will make it onto the program.&nbsp; So for the purposes of those reading the EA Forum, (who one would imagine are somewhat or very involved in EA) the likelihood of getting into the later rounds of the application process are actually pretty good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u201cThe charities you are launching will get started whether I apply or not\u201d</strong></p><p>Nope. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. In recent years we have had more charity ideas than we have been able to find founders for. We have been trying to launch a Postpartum charity for a number of years, and ideas such as Exploratory Altruism have rolled over from one cohort to the next. The truth is that for every year a charity doesn\u2019t get founded, that\u2019s a year of its impact gone.&nbsp;</p><p>Many EAs don't realize that they are exactly who we are looking for. Right now we are particularly interested in finding founders who could potentially focus on&nbsp; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vSTPC5IyaCrFVSx8NJKDVmnmkXfXDz78gY3FM6s59XQ/edit#heading=h.1mpagpp0mekv\"><u>Tobacco Taxation and Fish Welfare</u></a>, as it may well be the case&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;that these interventions won\u2019t get off the ground if we don\u2019t find suitable co-founders very soon.&nbsp;</u></p><p>&nbsp;To help mitigate this,&nbsp;<strong>we have just extended our application deadline to November 10 and we are appealing to readers here, to think once more about applying, and to spread the word.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u201cBut it pays too little\u201d</strong></p><p>It is true that, historically, some CE founders made the decision to take meager salaries&nbsp; but it\u2019s worth clarifying that the charities we launch set their own salaries (CE doesn\u2019t dictate anything). Moreover, in recent years we\u2019ve seen steep improvements in the speed, ease and quantity of funding achieved by our incubatees, so the choice of salaries taken, ranges greatly.&nbsp; Don\u2019t expect to match corporate salaries, but our founders are living fully and comfortably.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(When it comes to financial support during the program, we don\u2019t want financial limitations to stop anyone from starting an organization, so we offer extended stipends to cover living costs, childcare, etc.. Personal financial limitations should never be a reason to not start a charity that could save thousands, if not millions, of lives.)&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have the right skills and experience\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>Doctors think they lack the commercial skills, business students think they lack the research skills and researchers think they lack the interpersonal skills. The truth is that nobody comes onto the program ready. That\u2019s what the program is for!</strong></p><p><br>Even after the program, the first year of running the new charity is spent learning- piloting and testing, becoming a skillful and capable expert in your chosen intervention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation Program is far more than just a way to get a new intervention funded. We are not looking to find ready made charity entrepreneurs, we are looking for people with great potential to, overtime,&nbsp;<i>become</i> great founders - we literally wrote the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/book\"><u>handbook</u></a> on this!&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d</strong></p><p>Your doubt may be unfounded: At least half of the people who\u2019ve made it through the program all the way to launching and getting funded never thought they would even be accepted, and yet they went on to launch tremendously high-impact charities who have improved the lives of millions of humans and non-human animals.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a good fit\u201d</strong></p><p>It\u2019s really hard to know if you\u2019d be good at something you\u2019ve never done. But after four years of launching high-impact charities, CE is really, really good at knowing what it takes. We know who has the potential to become a founder.&nbsp; Our vetting process has been specifically designed for this, so the best way to explore your fit is to just&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/apply\"><u>apply</u></a>! Even for round one, we provide feedback on your answers (our aim is for the process itself to be useful for all, even if you don\u2019t proceed to the later rounds).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I get more experience first? I\u2019m still learning about EA\u201d</strong></p><p>Our data shows that a founder who starts now and runs a charity for three years will outperform (at running a charity) someone who does two years work experience in a consultancy and then starts running a charity for a year. In short, start early and learn the most applicable things as you go along.&nbsp;<strong>Every year you delay is a year\u2019s worth of impact removed from the world.&nbsp;</strong>Because of how neglected the areas that we recommend interventions in are, it is often unlikely that anybody could possibly have relevant experience anyway. How many people do you know who have previous experience in lead elimination, bait fish advocacy work, or how to run educational radio ads in Africa?&nbsp;</p><p>We provide very intensive training and sometimes a part of it is unlearning ineffective work habits people have previously picked up in less impact-focused roles.&nbsp;</p><p>And for those of you who still consider yourself to be a new EA who couldn\u2019t possibly be ready- if you regularly engage with EA content and are part of the community in any way at all, you could have absolutely incredible potential for impact and we wholeheartedly urge you to apply now, rather than waiting another year or two.&nbsp;<strong>Don\u2019t deprive the world of your untapped impact just because you don\u2019t have all the answers yet.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>Other factors that don\u2019t have any bearing on your potential as a founder: age, introversion vs extroversion, gender, or location. We build charities in historically marginalized and underserved regions and we favor local applicants. 33% of our program participants are from low or middle income countries (and increasing). Our own team is also diverse: 66% are female, nonbinary or from sexual orientation minorities.</p><p><br>And finally, if you were unsuccessful in the past, we strongly encourage you to do so again.

Many people don\u2019t have the time or desire to read academic papers, but the findings of the research are still hugely important and action-relevant.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/\">Global Priorities Institute (GPI)</a> has started producing <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/paper-summaries/\">paper summaries</a>, but even these might have somewhat limited readership given their length. They are also time-consuming for GPI to develop and aren\u2019t all in one place.</p><p>With this in mind, and given my personal interest in global priorities research, I have written a few mini-summaries of GPI papers. The extra lazy / time poor can read just \u201cThe bottom lines\u201d. I would welcome feedback on if these samples are useful and if I should continue to make them - working towards a post with all papers summarised. It is impossible to cover everything in just a few bullet points, but I hope my summaries successfully inform of the main arguments and key takeaways. Please note that for the final two summaries I made use of the existing GPI paper summaries.</p><h3><strong>On the desire to make a difference (Hilary Greaves, William MacAskill, Andreas Mogensen and Teruji Thomas)</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>Preferring to make a difference yourself is in deep tension with the ideals of benevolence. If we are to be benevolent, we should solely care about how much total good is done. In practice, this means avoiding tendencies to diversify individual philanthropic portfolios or to neglect mitigation of extinction risks in favour of neartermist options that seem \u201csafer\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>My brief summary:</p><ul><li>One can consider various types of \u201cdifference-making preferences\u201d (DMPs), where one wants to do good themselves. One example is thinking of the difference one makes in terms of their own causal impact. This can make the world worse e.g. going to great lengths to be the one to save a drowning person even if other people are better placed to do so. This way of thinking is therefore in tension with benevolence.</li><li>One can instead hope to have higher outcome-comparison impact, where one compares how much better an outcome is if one acts, compared to if one does nothing. This would recommend not trying to save the drowning person, which seems the correct conclusion. However, the authors note that thinking of doing good in this way can still be in tension with benevolence. For example, one might prefer that a recent disaster were severe rather than mild so that they can do more good by helping affected people.</li><li>Under uncertainty, DMPs are also in tension with benevolence, in an action-relevant way. For example, being risk averse to the difference one individually makes sometimes means choosing an action that is (stochastically) dominated by another action - essentially choosing an action that is \u2018objectively\u2019 worse under uncertainty, with respect to doing good.</li><li>This can also be the case when people interact - the authors show that the presence of DMPs in collective action problems with uncertainty can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. Importantly they show that the <i>preferences themselves</i> <i>are the culprits</i>. This is also the case with DMPs under ambiguity aversion (ambiguity aversion means preferring known risks over unknown risks).</li><li>One could try to rationalise DMPs by saying people are trying to achieve \u2018meaning\u2019 in their life. But people who exhibit DMPs are generally motivated by the ideal of benevolence. It seems therefore that such people, if they really do want to be benevolent, should give up their DMPs.</li><li><i>See paper </i><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/on-the-desire-to-make-a-difference-hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-andreas-mogensen-and-teruji-thomas-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></li></ul><h3><strong>The unexpected value of the future (Hayden Wilkinson)</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>An undefined expected value of the future doesn\u2019t invalidate longtermism. A theory is developed to deal with undefined expected values and this theory leads to an even stronger longtermist conclusion than what we started with.</p></blockquote><p>My brief summary:</p><ul><li>Standard arguments for longtermism rely on a large expected value of the future. But there are pretty credible arguments that the expected value of the future is undefined! In this case expected value theory is rendered useless and we need to find an alternative theory if we are to choose between different actions.</li><li>One theory that works in important scenarios is expected utility theory with sensitivity to risk, because it reduces the importance of extreme outcomes in decision-making. But there are compelling arguments for risk neutrality - so can we find a theory that retains risk neutrality?</li><li>The author builds on previous work to develop an adequate theory of value that does so - one that considers value differences between different actions, and essentially ignores outcomes that are sufficiently unlikely to occur.</li><li>This theory strongly supports a longtermist conclusion - in fact it says it is <i>infinitely</i> better to improve the far future than the present. The case for longtermism becomes even stronger than what we started with!</li><li><i>See paper </i><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/the-unexpected-value-of-the-future-hayden-wilkinson-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></li></ul><h3><strong>Longtermism, aggregation, and catastrophic risk (Emma J. Curran)</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>If one is sceptical about aggregative views, where one can be driven by sufficiently many small harms outweighing a smaller number of large harms, one should also be sceptical about longtermism.</p></blockquote><p>My brief summary:</p><ul><li>Longtermists generally prefer reducing catastrophic risk to saving lives of people today. This is because, even though you would be reducing probability of harm by a small amount if focusing on catastrophic risk, the expected vastness of the future means more good is done in expectation.</li><li>This argument relies on an aggregative view where we should be driven by sufficiently many small harms outweighing a smaller number of large harms. However there are some cases where we might say such decision-making is impermissible e.g. letting a man get run over by a train instead of pulling a lever to save the man but also make lots of people late for work. One argument for why it\u2019s better to save the man from death is the separateness of persons - there is no actual person who experiences the sum of the individual harms of being late - so there can be no aggregate complaint.</li><li>The author shows that a range of non-aggregative views (where we are not driven by sufficiently many small harms outweighing fewer large ones), under different treatments of risk, undermine the case for longtermism. These views typically generate extremely weak claims of assistance from future people.</li><li><i>See paper </i><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/longtermism-aggregation-and-catastrophic-risk-emma-j-curran/\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></li></ul><h3><strong>The case for strong longtermism (Hilary Greaves and William MacAskill)</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>Humanity\u2019s future could be vast, and we can influence its course. That suggests the truth of strong longtermism: impact on the far future is the most important feature of our actions today.</p></blockquote><p>My brief summary:</p><ul><li>The expected number of future lives is vast. You only need non-negligible probabilities of humanity surviving until the earth becomes uninhabitable, spreading into space, or creating digital sentience.</li><li>We can predictably improve the far future by steering between persistent states that differ in long-term value. A persistent state is one which \u2013 upon coming about \u2013 tends to persist for a long time. One way to steer between persistent states is to reduce the risk of premature human extinction - which would therefore be a pressing goal given the vastness of the future.</li><li>Under a person-affecting view of population ethics where we care about making lives good but not making good lives, reducing risks of extinction isn\u2019t important. But there are alternative interventions that would still be good for the long-term future - such as guiding the development of artificial super intelligence (ASI). ASI is likely to be influential and long-lasting, so ensuring it has the right values would be good for the long-term future under all plausible moral views.</li><li>Uncertainty does not undermine the case for strong longtermism because we also have \u2018meta\u2019 options for improving the far future such as conducting further research and investing resources for use at some later time.</li><li>The authors don\u2019t think that cluelessness about far-future effects of our actions or the fact that strong longtermism might hinge on tiny probabilities of enormous values (fanaticism) undermines the case for strong longtermism. Fanaticism is one of the most pressing objections, but denying fanaticism has implausible consequences and the probabilities might not be so small that fanaticism becomes an issue.</li><li>As well as strong longtermism being justified on an axiological basis (making a claim about the value of our actions) we can also justify it on deontic grounds (in terms of what we should do). The authors argue for a deontic justification, as improving the far future is far more valuable than focusing on the short-term, can be done at comparatively small cost, and does not violate any serious moral constraints. These conditions mean we should be driven to act by strong longtermism.</li><li><i>See longer summary </i><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/summary-the-case-for-strong-longtermism/\"><i>here</i></a><i> and paper </i><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></li></ul><h3><strong>The Epistemic Challenge to Longtermism (Christian Tarsney)</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>If we are happy with expected value theory and don\u2019t mind being driven by very small probabilities, longtermism holds up well. However, if we don\u2019t like being fanatical, the epistemic challenge against longtermism seems fairly serious.</p></blockquote><p>My brief summary:</p><ul><li>One broad class of strategies for improving the long-term future are \u201cpersistent-difference strategies\u201d (PDSs) where one tries to put the world into a better state of the world than it would have been otherwise, and hopes that this state persists for a long time.</li><li>But one might think it is too difficult to identify ways to do this. For example, such strategies might be threatened by \u201cexogenous nullifying events\u201d (ENEs), which nullify the effect of our PDSs. Negative ENEs, such as existential catastrophes, put the world in a less good persistent state.</li><li>If we assume that we will settle star systems one day (cubic growth) then, provided that the (constant) probability of ENEs in the far future is low enough, a typical longtermist intervention should be better than a neartermist one. This is because potential value would be huge. The author thinks the probability of ENEs is likely to be low enough for the longtermist intervention to win.</li><li>However, a model in which we don\u2019t spread to the stars and we eventually reach zero growth (steady state model) is more pessimistic as we would need an unrealistically low probability of negative ENEs occurring in the far future for a longtermist intervention to beat a neartermist one. This rests on conservative assumptions though, and if we relax these the case for longtermism becomes more credible again.</li><li>The case for longtermism is also strengthened once we account for uncertainty. For example, we might consider that cubic growth is very unlikely, and also that it results in only a very small probability of very high value (like a Dyson sphere). Even in this case, despite arguably very small probabilities, the expected value of longtermist interventions still easily beats neartermist ones, because the potential value is huge.</li><li>So if we are happy with expected value theory and don\u2019t mind being driven by very small probabilities, longtermism seems to hold up well. However, if we don\u2019t like being fanatical, the epistemic challenge against longtermism seems fairly serious.</li><li><i>See longer summary </i><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/summary-the-epistemic-challenge-to-longtermism-christian-tarsney/\"><i>here</i></a><i> and paper </i><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/christian-tarsney-the-epistemic-challenge-to-longtermism/\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "jackmalde"}}, {"_id": "im8wyhQCwnyjYv57e", "title": "GiveDirectly's cost-effectiveness could be 6.7x higher", "postedAt": "2022-11-03T04:39:16.703Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The linked google document and its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zQgzktTbnIANOhwnQbguPuUUCR7nR5pZTUNqxdvdZik/edit#gid=1362437801\"><u>companion spreadsheet</u></a> were my entries to the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/change-our-mind-contest#:~:text=GiveWell%20is%20launching%20a%20contest,lives%20the%20most%20per%20dollar.\">GiveWell Change our Mind Contest</a>. I argue that the cost-effectiveness of GiveDirectly\u2019s (GD\u2019s) cash transfer program in GiveWell\u2019s current analysis is undervalued because the health, wellbeing, and general equilibrium benefits are not explicitly modeled.&nbsp;The intro section I have included below within this post - see the link for the full argument.<br><br>I show that GiveDirectly\u2019s cost-effectiveness could increase 6.7x if health, wellbeing, and general equilibrium effects are explicitly modeled. The majority of the increase comes from reductions to child mortality in the health section. The values I calculate are intended as a proof of concept \u2014 I know that I have not been able to use the same level of rigor GiveWell would, and in particular my moral weights have not been calibrated among a group of people and so would need to be further refined. However, I believe they are good enough to demonstrate the value of explicitly modeling health, wellbeing, and general equilibrium effects within GiveDirectly\u2019s cost effectiveness analysis.&nbsp;<br><br>A summary of the major sections follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KgR5Mj5U0y7M_vCEYC6IpptPZrGM8Xjcwz0EzDBBN_8/edit#bookmark=id.52cb70afmnre\"><strong><u>Health</u></strong></a>: The adjustments to capture health benefits of cash transfers in the current model are too small, but should be explicitly modeled and considered one of cash\u2019s primary outcomes. Cash prevents child and adult deaths from malnutrition, both near-term, as recipient families purchase food, and longer-term, as a result of increases to income that allow them to continue buying food. It also prevents stunting, wasting, and other health issues that result from malnutrition, and may impact other pathways to better health outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I explicitly model the moral weight of reductions in mortality for children under five due to a transfer, in the immediate term only, using the effect size from <a href=\"https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Benchmarking.pdf\">GiveDirectly\u2019s study in Rwanda</a>. This has the largest impact of all changes that I model, because of the large moral weight associated with reductions to child mortality. I also model reductions to child stunting and assign them a moral weight. This modeling increases GD\u2019s units of value by 654, for a new total 4.5x higher than the original of 172. The same logic could be followed to explicitly model other health benefits, which I believe would increase the cost-effectiveness further.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KgR5Mj5U0y7M_vCEYC6IpptPZrGM8Xjcwz0EzDBBN_8/edit#bookmark=id.kgk0o77qd3cx\"><strong><u>Wellbeing</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> There is no moral weight for improvements to mental health or wellbeing in the current cost-effectiveness model, but these improvements are substantial for large, unconditional cash transfers. I argue that there are wellbeing benefits independent of the benefits to increased consumption that are not being captured. I suggest one way of defining a moral weight for wellbeing and quantifying the wellbeing impacts independent of consumption that results in 118 additional units of value, or a 70% increase on the original value.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KgR5Mj5U0y7M_vCEYC6IpptPZrGM8Xjcwz0EzDBBN_8/edit#bookmark=id.1bujlb10igwn\"><strong><u>General Equilibrium</u></strong></a>: The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/General-Equilibrium-Effects-of-Cash-Transfers.pdf\"><u>general equilibrium</u></a> (GE) study conducted on GiveDirectly\u2019s program found an increase to consumption among non-recipient households that was roughly equivalent to the increase to consumption found among recipient households after 18 months. I model this for an additional 211 units of value.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>When taken together, explicitly modeling the health, wellbeing, and general equilibrium impacts of GiveDirectly\u2019s cash transfers could increase GD\u2019s cost-effectiveness by 6.7x or more, depending upon the moral weights assigned. I recommend following along in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zQgzktTbnIANOhwnQbguPuUUCR7nR5pZTUNqxdvdZik/edit#gid=1362437801\"><u>spreadsheet</u></a> as you are reading the narrative, as it makes it easier to follow the math.

While these additional considerations do not impact the cost-effectiveness of any charity in the near-term, I decided to take the opportunity provided by this contest to include them because I believe they are important in the long term for GiveWell. The relatively smaller change to GiveDirectly\u2019s cost-effectiveness analysis may not merit the effort of incorporating wellbeing into your moral weights, but I believe these other factors may.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Carolina Toth"}}, {"_id": "oMBKeyx7ir8Jnbenz", "title": "Make a $50 donation into $100 (6x)", "postedAt": "2022-11-02T18:42:59.087Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>UPDATE November 14th</strong>: This donation matching opportunity has expired as of November 14th, 2022.<br><br>Last November EAs from all over the world directed <strong>over $400k</strong> from <a href=\"https://www.every.org/@william.kiely\">Every.org</a>'s donation matching pool to effective nonprofits in their November 2021 Fall Giving Challenge (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZhDbbTQs5EAdCGzxt/make-a-usd100-donation-into-usd200-or-more\">details</a>).</p><p>Every.org just launched another <a href=\"https://blog.every.org/fallgivingchallenge-the-monthly-match/\">$50,000 donation match</a> and we now have the opportunity to direct the money from typical nonprofits to highly effective ones while the <a href=\"https://blog.every.org/fallgivingchallenge-the-monthly-match/\">matching funds</a> last.</p><p>In summary, each person can direct up to $300 to any three 501(c)(3) nonprofits of your choice through a 1:1 donation match.

For the first time, humanity had detonated an atomic bomb, and after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki later that year, society struggled to come to terms with the forces unleashed. Amidst the cacophony of devastation and the uproar of anti-nuclear movements, there were those who caught whispers of a dark threshold quietly crossed. One such thinker, Bertrand Russell, stood in the House of Lords to describe the shadow of a new kind of threat:</p><p><i>We do not want to look at this thing simply from the point of view of the next few years; we want to look at it from the point of view of the future of mankind. The question is a simple one: Is it possible for a scientific society to continue to exist, or must such a society inevitably bring itself to destruction? ... As I go about the streets and see St. Paul's, the British Museum, the Houses of Parliament, and the other monuments of our civilization, in my mind's eye I see a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of rubble, surrounded by corpses.[1]</i></p><p>Russell recognised that the development of nuclear weapons marked the dawn of a new age: humanity had become its greatest risk to itself. Adam and Eve, in eating the forbidden fruit, opened the way to individual death, but we have now \u201ceaten more deeply of the fruit of the tree of knowledge\u201d and are now \u201cface to face with a second death, the death of mankind.\u201d[2] An antithesis of God\u2019s creatio ex nihilo, we have obtained our own absolutising power, the \u201cpotestas annihilationis,&nbsp;the reductio ad nihili.\u201d[3]</p><p>A philosophical response to this new power suggests that threat of nuclear apocalypse is but one example of a category of anthropogenic existential risks&nbsp;(AXRs). Other self-caused threats to humanity\u2019s future potential also include engineered pandemics, human-caused climate change, and unaligned artificial intelligence, all of which could cause existential catastrophe. Further AXRs still await discovery, and we have no reason to believe these will be less hazardous.[4] Without action, the danger humanity creates for itself will continue to grow and Ord, from Oxford\u2019s Future of Humanity Institute, argues such increasing risk is unsustainable. We will either learn to mitigate existential risks or one of them will eventually play out, causing a permanent loss of humanity\u2019s potential. In the past, survival could be taken for granted as natural threats to the human species are vanishingly rare on the timescale of human history, and technology had yet to develop existential threats of its own making. Yet Ord warns that now our \u201clong-term survival requires a deliberate choice to survive.\u201d[5] He illustrates his point by describing humanity in its adolescence, in urgent need of moral maturation; \u201cjust coming into our power, just old enough to get ourselves in serious trouble.\u201d[6] We would certainly be foolish to neglect mitigating natural existential risks,[7] but the possibility of human agency playing a role for species survival, by causing or mitigating anthropogenic risks, poses unique philosophical and theological questions.</p><p>How might a Christian respond to these? Why not scepticism? The psalmist assures that \u201cthe righteous shall inherit the land and live in it forever (Ps 37:29);\u201d Jesus himself told us not to worry about tomorrow for \u201ctoday\u2019s trouble is enough for today (Matt. 6:34),\u201d&nbsp;and asked, \u201ccan any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life (Luke 12:25-26)?\u201d&nbsp;Trust in providence, however, now coexists with awareness that good choices contribute to long and healthy living. By analogy, when any given generation\u2019s influence over mankind\u2019s long-term potential was negligible, trust was the believer\u2019s disposition towards the future. Now, however, faith in divine providence must coexist with awareness that our choices make a real difference for, and could even destroy, the future of humanity. I propose, on Newmanian terms, that theology needs to assimilate&nbsp;awareness of&nbsp;the potestas annihilationis, and so long as no discontinuity of principles arises, any theological implications and adjustments inferred by the discovery of AXRs would constitute authentic development of dogma.[8] There is much to learn about humanity\u2019s role within salvation history from even a brief return to the sources of faith in light of this new power. Assuming dystopian scenarios are the reserve of science fiction has become a dangerous option because we will not get a second chance if that assumption is proved wrong.</p><p>Before all else, Genesis reveals a fatherly love. God\u2019s will that humanity be fruitful (Gen. 1:28) culminates in His promise to make Abraham\u2019s \u201cdescendants as numerous as the stars in the sky (Gen. 26:4).\u201d Even in the fifth century Augustine understood it was \u201cnonsensical to be sure there are not stars that cannot be seen,\u201d[9] and we now know of at least two trillion galaxies, each with billions of stars.[10] Perhaps God\u2019s promise to Abraham can be taken literally after all? We know of no reason why humanity could not survive for millions of years,[11] so we discover the possibility of \u201ca truly staggering number of descendants, with the time, resources, wisdom, and experience to create a diversity of wonders unimaginable to us today.\u201d[12]</p><p>This vast potential future need not be dismissed as fanciful, for Jesus\u2019 commissions of evangelisation show no temporal limitation. In Matthew, the charge to \u201cmake disciples of all nations (Matt. 28:19, emphasis added),\u201d given at the ascension, binds expectation of the Lord\u2019s return to a universal mission, in response to Jesus\u2019 promise to be with us \u2018to the end of the age. (Matt. 28:19).\u201d Jesus\u2019s lordship is not limited to the world as known to his time on earth, as the Easter liturgy reminds us: \u201cHe is the Alpha and Omega, to whom all time belongs.\u201d[13] When the first Christians realised Jesus was not coming back soon, they realised the Church had a future of service to \u201ca cosmic Lord,\u201d with a horizon of discipleship \u201cas wide as the world.\u201d[14]</p><p>Saint Paul\u2019s letters exemplify the broad scope of the call to evangelise, as \u201cthe horizons of Christian mission are pushed beyond the ethnic boundaries of Jew and gentiles to embrace the entire universe:\u201d[15] Colossians celebrating how the Gospel grows in \u201cthe whole world (Col. 1:6.),\u201d and Ephesians lauding God\u2019s \u201cplan for the fullness of time (Eph. 1:9-10).\u201d Certainly by the time of writing of 2 Peter, the acceptance of the delay of the Parousia, and the significance therein for the Church\u2019s mission, were firmly established: The Lord, to whom \u201ca thousand years are like one day\u201d is being patient with humanity,&nbsp;\u201cnot wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance (2Pet. 3:8-9).\u201d</p><p>On such scriptural foundations, the spread of the Gospel became a measure of readiness for the Fathers of the Church, who prayed that salvation is not drawn to a close too soon that humanity might have the best possible chance to accept the Gospel in Augustine\u2019s \u201ctime of mercy.\u201d[16] Along these lines, Hays and his collaborators from the Oxford Postdoctoral Colloquium on Eschatology have argued from the Tradition that we cooperate within salvation history, and that the time of the eschaton is not just unknown, but un-fixed, contingent in some way on the action of humanity.[17] Many of the Fathers of the Church believed the eschatological timetable can be \u201cdelayed or hastened by the piety, prayers, and penitence of God\u2019s people.\u201d[18] Justin Martyr explains that \u201cGod delays causing the confusion and destruction of the whole world... because of the seed of the Christians, who know that they are the cause of preservation in nature.\u201d[19] Likewise, Tertullian prays for \u201cemperors, for their ministers and for all in authority, for the welfare of the world, for the prevalence of peace, for the delay of the final consummation.\u201d[20] Perhaps contingency helps to explain why Jesus tells his disciples that He does not know \u201cthe hour (Mark 13:32)?\u201d Our Lord says plainly that the \u201cgood news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world, as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come (Matt. 24:14).\u201d</p><p>Bringing the fixity of the eschaton into question has considerable ramifications for a Catholic response to AXRs, particularly considering human freedom, which \u201chas the power to make choices for ever, with no turning back (CCC&nbsp;\u00a71861).\u201d To paraphrase Newman, in my freedom and human weakness, I can fail to do the definite service God has created me for. I can fail to live out my vocation, and even a committed Augustinian notion of perseverance as entirely God\u2019s gift maintains that \u201ca man who does not persevere fails by his own fault.\u201d[21] By analogy, if human flourishing has a role to play in God\u2019s plan for the last-things, and humanity itself can utterlyfail&nbsp;by self-destruction through AXRs, then we must take seriously the idea that anthropogenic extinction could just be that, humanly, not divinely, caused. A cosmos without humanity is now conceivable, something Aquinas considered as an impossible supposition.[22] I therefore make a bold, but simple, claim: Awareness of humanity\u2019s newfound potestas annihilationis&nbsp;exposes a presumption that humanity will persevere until some appointed end moment. In the past, if human history were to be ending through some natural cause, a believer would have recourse to an eschatological explanation. Apocalyptic interpretation, however, cannot be uncritically applied to AXRs. Do believers have grounds to presume the Parousia would be triggered in response to mankind\u2019s self-extinction so as to ensure the end of humanity and the end of creation be coterminous?</p><p>I contend that theology cannot now remain unchanged because the potestas annihilationis was unthinkable throughout the formation of dogma. Pannenberg\u2019s view that \u201cwhat is undoubtedly true in science cannot be wrong in theology\u201d[23] suggests we need to consider the possibility that, by failing to mitigate AXRs, humanity could fail to live the fullness of life God would otherwise will for it. Some might argue that anthropogenic extinction would just be the final catastrophe scripture foretells, but to resist shouldering new responsibility on such apocalyptic terms constitutes little more than a projection of human failure onto a diminished eschatological screen, counsel to despair. Hays\u2019 case that the end of history is temporally undetermined establishes contingency on humanity succeeding to live out God\u2019s will, not on humanity failing, as if the eschaton were in some way history\u2019s safety net in case of man-made calamity. God trusts and hopes that we mature and develop the moral capacity necessary to mitigate the risks to our future we cause for ourselves.[24]</p><p>Consider a Christian adjustment of Ord\u2019s adolescent humanity: our species can be thought of as a young person, with both a vocation to sanctity and the capacity to squander it. Our loving God wills that His child grow in virtue and make the necessary choices to protect and answer His call. Like a young believer, humanity must now make a concerted effort to face the challenges to growth in the life of grace, and this does not exclude trusting in providence. Let us not forget that the command to take nothing for the journey, \u201cno staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money (Luke 9:3)\u201d was not the last word on the matter. After the disciples learned to trust in God, Jesus instructs them that \u201cthe one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag (Luke 22:35-37).\u201d As the mission on which Christ\u2019s followers were sent became more demanding, a pragmatism was embraced.[25] The challenges that face the spread of the Gospel now include threats to our very survival, so we too must adapt to protect our future from ourselves. We can thus collectively cooperate with grace, to answer God\u2019s calling for humanity. With potestas annihilationis&nbsp;comes the greatest responsibility, to ensure our descendants receive the best possible chance of living out their vocations, to pass on the gifts of life, faith, and the conditions and environment that make those possible. On these terms, hope for future health and wellbeing does not entail the eschatological reductionism such thought might otherwise attract. We do well to follow Augustine: \u201cBelief in the city of God does not mean that the earthly city is a point of indifference. The earthly city strives for peace, an end it shares with the City of God, as the two cannot be thought about as radically different as in this present transitory world, they are interwoven and mingled with one another.\u201d[26]One need not surrender belief in a transcendent finalising moment that will occur in history to have a sense of accountability, and legitimate hopes, for humanity and the Church in the time, of indeterminate length, between today and the Parousia.</p><p>Like the first Christians, we too face a little-evangelised world, and so are also grateful for the time of mercy, the opportunity to make disciples of all nations, including the potential trillions of descendants to come. If human history is just the beginning, if we are in the earliest time of the Church, then God could well bestow countless future graces: saints will be raised up, sinners will be forgiven, theologians will explore new depths, the faithful will experience new heights of spiritual experience, carried higher by new insights into the nature of prayer, fostered by the cumulative enrichment of religious tradition. Saint Peter could not have foreseen the baroque basilica that now stands at the place of his last earthly moments. The early Church could not have imagined the beauty of Durufle\u2019s motets on Gregorian themes. Augustine could not benefit from the spiritual exercises of Ignatius, Bonaventure had no way of anticipating the personalism of Saint John Paul II. The Church will be more and more at home in the spiritual richness that the human experience can offer, and perhaps, with the opportunity of millennia, even discover modes of spiritual experience, or categories of theological value, which are unknown today.[27] We rightly believe that the major event in Christian life has already happened in the paschal mystery, and we await the day when the Lord will draw all things to himself. Nonetheless, we can look forward to the future of humanity and wonder what prayer and worship we are blind to, what music are we deaf to. Let us dare to hope the Church has a long and bright future, and let us be unsettled by the threat of that future being lost: In light of scriptural and patristic sources, I have sketched out some conditions of possibility for allowing these sentiments of love and concern for our distant future without fear of doctrinal discontinuity. However, moral judgement is one thing, action is quite another.</p><p>Safeguarding humanity\u2019s potential tomorrow involves making sacrifices today, and faith might make its greatest contribution to mitigating AXRs by providing Christian reasons for motivating costly action. A post-Christian worldview lacks evaluative resources for adequately relating to humanity\u2019s future, having set aside beliefs which forged and sustained links between generations. Scheffler, for example, explains that many \u201cexperience the poverty of our evaluative thought about the future as a form of privation,\u201d recognising \u201can inchoate sense that other generations matter to us in way that we cannot easily explain,\u201d[28] so he, Ord, and others, develop theories of value, axiologies, with which one might find underappreciated reasons why we should care about the future of humanity. Faith can provide compelling and greatly needed reasons why the future matters, inspiring believers to act in charity towards our descendants.</p><p>Christians aspire to turn to the past with faith, the present with love, and the future with hope, but these triads can be paired in other ways. I propose that faith in the Gospel received from the past also shows how hope can shine more brightly in the present by a love of the future. We need to learn to appreciate the blessings to come in a new way, and a dialogical study of the future axiologies offered by philosophy helps express the rich evaluative resources available to the Christian imagination for overcoming temporal parochialism. Catholics are particularly good at experiencing meaningful communion with those in the distant past. Can we not do so for the distant future too? The stakes are potentially little less than human life itself, and with it the very phenomena of prayer, beauty, and value. In learning to love the future, we can grow not only in fraternity, but in parental love, the desire to \u201cbring life into existence out of nothing\u2026 which begins even before any child exists\u201d and does not attach any conditions for the beloved, \u201cit only wants him to be.\u201d[29] Sharing in the Father\u2019s desire that our descendants will be able to praise Him and follow Him as best they can, we learn to love and protect humanity\u2019s future. God realises his promises in the time to come, but that future is now, at least partly, in humanity\u2019s hands.</p><p><br>[1] Bertrand Russell, \u201cThe International Situation,\u201d in Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), vol. 138 (The House of Lords, 1945) 89.</p><p>[2] Jonathan Schell, Fate of the Earth (New York, N.Y: Avon Books, 1988) 115.</p><p>[3]&nbsp;G\u00fcnter Anders, as cited and translated in U K\u00f6rtner, The End of the World: A Theological Interpretation, (Westminster, 1995) 181.</p><p>[4] For a description of the full range of known existential risks, see Nick Bostrom, \u201cExistential Risks: Analysing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards,\u201d The Journal of Evolution and Technology, vol. 9, No. 1 (2002).</p><p>[5]&nbsp;Toby Ord, The Precipice (Oxford: Bloomsbury, 2020) 191.</p><p>[6] Ibid.,, 21.</p><p>[7] For more explanation of natural risks see Toby Ord, \u201cNatural Risks\u201d, 67ff.</p><p>[8] See Chapter 5 Genuine Developments Contrasted with Corruptions in John Henry Newman, An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine (Notre Dame: Notre Dame, 1989).</p><p>[9] Augustine, City of God,&nbsp;Penguin Classics (London\u202f; New York: Penguin Books, 2003), XVI, 23.</p><p>[10] Davide Castelvecchi, \u201cUniverse Has Ten Times More Galaxies than Researchers Thought,\u201d Nature, November 14, 2016.</p><p>[11] Toby Ord, 217ff.</p><p>[12] Ibid.,, 21.</p><p>[13] \u201cThe Easter Vigil in the Holy Night\u201d, in The Roman Missal, 2010, \u00a711.5.</p><p>[14] Donald Senior and Carroll Stuhlmueller, The Biblical Foundations for Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y: Orbis Books, 1983) 208.</p><p>[15] Senior and Stuhlmueller, 191.</p><p>[16] Augustine, The Works of Saint Augustine, vol. 1, Sermons on the Old Testament, 20-50 (New City Press, 1990) 369.</p><p>[17] For the claim that the eschaton is, at least partially, contingent on human agency, I closely follow Christopher M Hays et al., When the Son of Man Didn\u2019t Come: A Constructive Proposal on the Delay of the Parousia (Fortress Pr., 2017).</p><p>[18] Hays et al., 100ff.</p><p>[19] Justin Martyr, Opera Quae Exstant Omnia, vol. 6, Patrologia Graeca (Paris: Apud J.-P.

Jobst</p><h2>Rational choice</h2><p><strong>If there's no model ambiguity, no moral uncertainty, and no other agents,</strong> the standard recipe (using Bayesian rational choice theory) would probably go somewhat like this:</p><ol><li>Identify all relevant <i>actions</i> you could take now or later.</li><li>Idenfity all relevant <i>strategies</i> you might pursue to decide what to do in the current situation and in each possible future decision situation.</li><li>Identify all possible relevant <i>features of the world</i> that may influence the consequences of your actions.</li><li>Identify all possible <i>outcomes</i> (possible trajectories of future states of the world) that may arise from all possible combinations of your possible strategies and the possible relevant features of the world.</li><li>Identify all possible <i>mechanisms</i> that may lead from all those possible strategy-feature combinations to those possible outcomes.</li><li>Represent these mechanisms by a suitable deterministic or, more likely, probabilistic <i>causal model</i>.</li><li>Estimate the <i>conditional probabilities</i> occurring in the individual steps in that causal model. (Maybe use Bayesian updating on the basis of some prior plus some data for this)</li><li>Identify other <i>parameters</i> of the model.</li><li>Model your <i>beliefs</i> about what the actual features of the world and the remaining parameters of the model are in the form of a <i>subjective joint probability distribution</i> over all possible features-parameters combinations, taking into account possible correlations between these features and parameters. (Maybe use Bayesian updating for this as well)</li><li>Use your beliefs, the causal model, and its conditional probabilities to calculate for each possible strategy an resulting probability distribution over all possible outcomes of that strategy.</li><li><i>Evaluate each possible outcome</i> according to your <i>moral value system</i> and condense this evaluation into one numerical evaluation for that outcome. (You might or might not call this evaluation the \"utility\" of the outcome)</li><li>Use the outcome probability distribution and the outcome evaluations to <i>evaluate each possible strategy,</i> taking into account your <i>risk attitudes.</i> E.g., calculate the <i>expected value</i> of the outcome evaluation given the outcome distribution under that strategy (as in expected-utility theory), or use some <i>other aggregation formula</i> that aggregates the possible outcome evaluations into a strategy evaluation given the outcome distribution under that strategy (e.g., some form of (cumulative) prospect theory).</li><li>Identify the <i>strategy with the largest evaluation</i> and adopt it. (One might or might not call this the \"best\" or \"optimal\" strategy.)</li></ol><p>Complicated as this might seem, e.g. because there might be infinitely manys possible actions, features, parameter values, or consequences, it is at least a relatively clear procedure.</p><p>But what if there is any form of ambiguity or uncertainty that does not fit well with the Bayesian approach of dealing with probabilistic uncertainty?</p><p>Let me next look at what happens if there are <i>other relevant agents</i> in the world than just you. Since this turns out to become quite complicated, you might want to skip the next section.</p><h2>Game theory</h2><p><strong>Assume there's no model ambiguity and no moral uncertainty, but there are other agents, but we can assume all of them to be </strong><i><strong>rational</strong></i><strong>.</strong> Then a possible approach goes somewhat like this (or possibly even more complicated, depending on the version of Bayesian or epistemic game theory one adopts):</p><ol><li>Proceed as above until step 9, but additionally:<ol><li>Identify <i>other relevant agents</i> and their possible <i>actions and strategies.</i></li><li>Incorporate this into the <i>causal model.</i></li><li>Estimate the <i>other agents' non-strategic beliefs</i> (like you did your own in step 9 above), <i>value systems, and risk attitudes,</i> and model them via a large joint subjective probability distribution.</li></ol></li><li>Now comes the complicated part: Instead of proceeding as above from step 10 on, we first need to resolve the additional uncertainty that all agents have about what everyone will do, which will influence what they themselves are likely to do. Because we assume everyone is rational, we can do this by identifying <i>all possible <strong>consistent profiles of strategic beliefs</strong> of all agents about all other agents' strategies</i>. One version of how one might do this in theory is the following:<ol><li>Assume each agent will ultimately encode their beliefs of the other agents in the form of another joint subjective probability distribution over all possible combinations of strategies of the other agents. Call these possible probability distributions the possible <i>strategic beliefs</i> of the agent.</li><li>Call each possible combination of strategic beliefs, one for each agent, a possible <i>strategic belief profile.</i> For each possible strategic belief profile (called the \"assumed strategic belief profile\" in what follows), do the following:<ol><li>For each agent, including yourself, do the following:<ol><li>Use that agent's non-strategic and strategic beliefs, the causal model, and its conditional probabilities to calculate for each possible strategy of that agent a resulting probability distribution over all possible outcomes of that strategy (similar to step 10 above)</li><li>Use your beliefs about that agent's moral value system and risk attitudes to identify which of their strategies that agent will evaluate the largest if they proceed as in steps 11\u201313 above. This results in one or, less likely, several \"best\" strategies for that agent.</li></ol></li><li>Check whether the resulting combinations of all agents' \"best\" strategies are compatible with what you assumed that all agents believe about everyone's strategies. More precisely:<ol><li>For each pair of agents X, Y, and each of Y's strategies that have a <i>positive probability</i> in the assumed strategic beliefs of X (!), verify that this strategy was indeed identified as a <i>\"best\"</i> strategy for Y. If this is not the case, then X's belief that rational agent Y might use strategy S is not a rational belief.</li><li>If at least one of these tests fails, then the assumed strategic belief profile is <i>not consistent</i> with (common knowledge of) rationality: If agents would hold these beliefs, at least one of them would act in a way that violates these beliefs.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Each possible strategic belief profile that passes this consistency test is a <i>consistent</i> strategic belief profile. (Game theorists call such a thing an \"equlibrium\" of some kind)</li></ol></li><li>If we are <strong>lucky</strong> and there is <i>exactly one consistent strategic belief profile,</i> we may proceed as in steps 10\u201313 above, using these consistent strategic beliefs to identify our own \"best\" strategy, and then adopt it.</li><li>If we are unlucky and there are <i>several</i> consistent strategic belief profiles, we face what game theorists call an <i>equilibrium selection problem</i>. This can be seen as <i>yet another form of ambiguity:</i> the ambiguity about what everyone's strategic beliefs are.</li><li>If we are extremely unlucky, there is <i>not even one</i> consistent strategic belief profile and the strategic belief ambiguity becomes even larger.</li></ol><p>So, even in a Bayesian rational choice setting, as soon as there is more than one agent, there might easily arise ambiguity that can <i>not</i> easily be dealt with <i>within</i> the Bayesian rationality framework itself.</p><p>Let's look at something slightly simpler next:</p><h2>Evaluation under model ambiguity</h2><p>Let's assume that we are the only agent and the only uncertainty is what values certain features of the world and certain parameters of our causal model have, but that that uncertainty is not quantifiable in the form of subjective beliefs as required in step 9 of the original recipe. In other words, we might have an idea of what values these features and parameters might have, but not how likely each possible value is. Let's call this <i>model ambiguity</i>.</p><p>If our goal is only to <i>evaluate</i> a certain possible strategy rather than making a choice between several strategies, we might basically follow the original recipe for each possible value of the respective features and parameters and in the end use the \"Hurwicz criterion\" (Hurwicz 1951, <a href=\"https://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/cdp/s-0370.pdf\">https://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/cdp/s-0370.pdf</a>):</p><ol><li>Proceed as in steps 1\u20138 of the original recipe.</li><li>For each combination of values of the ambiguous features and parameters that you deem possible, perform steps 9\u201312 of the original recipe to calculate a <i>conditional evaluation</i> of the given strategy under the assumption of that possible combination of values.</li><li>Among all these conditional evaluations for different feature and parameter combinations, identify the smallest (\"worst-case\") conditional evaluation, W, and the largest (\"best-case\") conditional evaluation, B.</li><li>Calculate the <i>overall evaluation</i> of the strategy by putting <i>h W + (1 \u2013 h) B</i>, where <i>h</i> is a number between 0 and 1 which represents your <i>degree of ambiguity aversion.</i></li></ol><p>Fine. But normally we only evaluate strategies because we want to make a <i>choice</i> between several strategies.</p><h2>Choice under model ambiguity</h2><p>To choose under model ambiguity, we could of course simply apply step 13 of the original recipe on the basis of the overall evaluations derived above, using the same value of <i>h</i> for each strategy.</p><p>The problem is that we might also want to do it differently...</p><p>Assume we have two strategies S and S', and their worst- and best-case evaluations are W(S)=B(S)=1, W(S')=0, and B(S')=2. Then it might seem that if <i>h&gt;1/2</i>, we should adopt strategy S and otherwise strategy S'. But what if there are thousands of possible parameter values and <i>for all but one parameter value strategy S' is better than strategy S?</i> Shouldn't we maybe rather adopt S' then?</p><p>The difference between the two approaches is basically this:</p><ul><li><i>Either deal with model ambiguity first and identify \"best\" strategies later.</i> Evaluate each strategy separately, taking into account ambiguity as above, and only then compare strategies' overall evaluations as the last step to identify a \"best\" strategy.</li><li><i>Or identify \"best\" strategies first and deal with model ambiguity later.</i> For each possible scenario (=feature-parameter combination), identify a \"conditionally best\" strategy, and only then deal with the model ambiguity by picking an \"overall best\" strategy in some way from all these \"conditionally best\" strategies?</li></ul><p>It seems that many deliberation processes happening in the real world are more like the second form: What should we do if X? S! What should we do if Y instead? S'! Given these two optimal strategies and the fact that we do not know whether X or Y is true, should we now actually do S or S'?</p><h2>Moral uncertainty</h2><p>In principle, we might deal with moral uncertainty in exactly the same way as with model ambiguity:</p><ul><li><i>Either deal with moral uncertainty first and identify \"best\" strategies later.</i> Evaluate each strategy separately, taking into account moral uncertainty in the same way as taking into account model ambiguity above: overall strategy evaluation = <i>h W + (1 \u2013 h) B</i>, where W and B are the worst- and best-case evaluations across all possible moral value systems you consider. Only then compare strategies' overall evaluations as the last step to identify a \"best\" strategy.</li><li><i>Or identify \"best\" strategies first and deal with moral uncertainty later.</i> For each possible moral value systems, identify a \"conditionally best\" strategy, and only then deal with the moral uncertainty by picking an \"overall best\" strategy in some way from all these \"conditionally best\" strategies?</li></ul><p>I am <i>no</i> expert on moral uncertainty <i>at all,</i> so my questions are here:</p><ul><li>Is this in line with philisophical theory on moral uncertainty?</li><li>How is it done in reality?</li></ul><h2>Other forms of ambiguity</h2><p>It is straighforward to use the exact same two possible approaches as above to also deal with all kinds of other ambiguities, such as...</p><ul><li>Strategic ambiguity arising from non-uniqueness or non-existence of consistent strategic belief profiles</li><li>Ambiguity arising from the inability of attaching subjective probabilities to the strategies of other agents in the first place, e.g. because they might not be rational or too different from us, or because one feels that this makes no sense if agents have free will.</li></ul><p>But it might also turn out that different forms of ambiguity should be treated in different ways, e.g., sometimes using the first and sometimes using the second approach, or using different values of <i>h</i> for each form of ambiguity.</p><p>I think this means there is also a meta-form of ambiguity: <i>methodological ambiguity</i>.</p><p>I'll end here with a final idea: <i><strong>Should we deal with some forms of ambiguity, maybe at least with methodological ambiguity, by making</strong></i> <strong>collective</strong> <i><strong>choices?</strong></i> <i>I.e.:</i></p><ul><li><i>Should we use some formal collective choice mechanism to decide on a case-by-case basis between the methodological options, or between assumptions or beliefs about relevant features of the world, key parameters, and/or strategies of other relevant agents?</i></li><li><i>And if so, what collective choice mechanism would be appropriate for this? One that focusses on efficiency like majoritarian mechanisms do, or one that focusses on consensus?</i></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Jobst Heitzig (vodle.it)"}}, {"_id": "CcLvEDnjEBvqJcSzn", "title": "BBC: Should extraterrestrial life be granted 'sentient' rights?", "postedAt": "2022-11-02T07:15:11.939Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I found this article interesting, and thought that others might, too:&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221101-should-extraterrestrial-life-be-granted-sentient-rights\">https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221101-should-extraterrestrial-life-be-granted-sentient-rights</a>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Forumite"}}, {"_id": "nGrmemHzQvBpnXkNX", "title": "What matters to shrimps?

All errors and shortcomings are our own.</i></p><h1><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h1><p>While many environmental conditions and farming practices could plausibly affect the welfare of shrimps, little research has been done to assess which factors&nbsp;<i>most&nbsp;</i>affect shrimp welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>This report aims to assess the importance of various factors for the welfare of farmed shrimps, with a particular focus on&nbsp;<i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> (also known as&nbsp;<i>Penaeus vannamei</i>, or whiteleg shrimp), due to the scale and intensity of farming (~171-405 billion globally per annum) (<a href=\"http://fishcount.org.uk/studydatascreens2/2017/numbers-of-farmed-decapods-A0-2017.php?sort2/full\"><u>Mood and Brooke, 2019</u></a>). Where evidence is scarce, we extend our research to other shrimps, other decapods, or even other aquatic animals. Further research into the most significant factors and practices affecting farmed shrimp welfare is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusions from our review are summarised below:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eyestalk Ablation:</strong> Shrimps demonstrate aversive behavioural responses to eyestalk ablation, and applying anaesthesia before ablation has therapeutic effects. We believe this is strongly indicative that eyestalk ablation is a welfare concern.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Disease:</strong> Infectious diseases cause significant mortality events. This is likely to both cause suffering prior to death and increase the total number of shrimps who are farmed and experience suffering.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stunning&nbsp;and Slaughter: </strong>Current slaughter practices (asphyxiation or immersion in ice slurry) are likely to be inhumane. While evidence on the optimal slaughter method for shrimps is limited, electrical stunning appears to be the most promising method to effectively stun and kill shrimps.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stocking&nbsp;Density: </strong>There is strong experimental evidence to suggest that reductions in stocking density indirectly improve welfare by improving water quality, reducing disease, and increasing survival. There is also some tentative evidence that stocking density directly impacts shrimp behaviour and measurable stress biomarkers (e.g. serotonin).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Environmental&nbsp;Enrichment (EE): </strong>Environmental enrichments (e.g. feeding methods that mimic natural behaviours, hiding sites, different tank shapes and colours, plants, substrates, and sediments) probably improve shrimp survival, but there is little evidence on their impact on shrimp stress or behaviour. There is moderately strong evidence that physical enrichment (such as physical structure, plant, and substrate) improves welfare for aquatic animals, including crustaceans.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Transport&nbsp;and Handling: </strong>Poor transport and handling practices are likely to lead to physical injury and stress, although research is limited on the welfare effects of current shrimp farming practices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Food:&nbsp;</strong>While some decapods appear resilient to lack of food, inadequate nutrition leads to risk of non-infectious disease and may lead to aggressive and abnormal behaviour.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Water Quality</u></p><ul><li><strong>Dissolved Oxygen (DO):</strong> Several studies indicate that insufficient DO levels increase mortality, which is likely to be preceded by suffering due to poor physical condition.

Animal welfare is typically characterised by three factors: the animal\u2019s emotional state (including the absence of negative experiences), ability to express natural behaviours, and normal physiological functioning (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7830356/#:~:text=To%20assess%20the%20animal%20welfare,management%20and%20the%20immune%20system.\"><u>Jerez-Cepa &amp; Ruiz-Jarabo, 2021</u></a>, p.1). Alternatively, under the \u201cFive Domains Model\u201d, welfare is characterised by the animal\u2019s nutritional, environmental, health, behavioural, and mental needs (<a href=\"https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/exprawel/7/\"><u>Mellor &amp; Reid, 1994</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Physiological biomarkers, often measured through haemolymph sampling, may be indicators of stress and welfare (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.886024/full\"><u>Albalat et al., 2022</u></a>, pp.8-9). Examples of potential biomarkers include immune measures (e.g. total haemocyte counts) and stress parameters (e.g. lactate). Decapods also possess neuromodulators, such as serotonin, which mediate responses to stressful situations (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24926022/#:~:text=Serotonin%20injection%20into%20unstressed%20crayfish,several%20underlying%20mechanisms%20during%20evolution.\"><u>Fossat et al., 2014</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.49) - thus high levels of serotonin may be interpreted as an indicator of stress (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39935\"><u>Bacqu\u00e9-Cazenave et al., 2017</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>To measure physical health, recent studies have looked at the gut microbiome of shrimps, while other approaches include pathogen screening, observing physical condition (e.g. physical damage, discolouration), and observing self-protective behaviour such as wound-tending (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.886024/full\"><u>Albalat et al., 2022</u></a>, pp.7-10). Survival rates are a clear indicator of welfare for two reasons. Increased mortality, holding constant genetics and environmental conditions, is a signal of poorer welfare prior to death. Higher mortality also increases the total number of animals who are farmed and may experience suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>Physiological biomarkers and physical health should be also assessed alongside observations of behaviour, such as lethargy and aggression. For example, well-managed high-density systems may allow shrimps to stay healthy and grow well, but not express their natural behaviours, harming welfare.</p><h1><strong>What matters for shrimp welfare?</strong></h1><h2><strong>Eyestalk Ablation&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We have&nbsp;<strong>very high confidence</strong> that eyestalk ablation is harmful for shrimp welfare. This conclusion is based primarily on evidence of aversive behaviour in response to ablation and the therapeutic effects of anaesthesia. Our standards require farms to not buy fry from ablated broodstock.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2az4ao49p2m\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2az4ao49p2m\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Eyestalk ablation involves crushing or cutting off at least one of the eyestalks of female shrimps, and is typically used to induce rapid maturation and spawning in&nbsp;<i>L. vannamei</i>. Eyestalk ablation may lead to numerous negative outcomes, such as physical trauma, stress, physiological imbalance, reproductive exhaustion, weight loss, high broodstock mortality, and reduced disease robustness among offspring. As a result, some maturation facilities in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, M\u00e9xico, and Thailand no longer use eyestalk ablation (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.886024/full\"><u>Albalat et al., 2022</u></a>, p.4).&nbsp;</p><p>A Review of the Evidence of Sentience in Cephalopod Molluscs and Decapod Crustaceans concludes that eyestalk ablation is a severe welfare risk (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.76). One study found that shrimps have a recoil reaction to ablation (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848603006616\"><u>Taylor et al., 2004</u></a>). In another study, ablated shrimps were more likely to flick their tails and rub the area of the wound (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159112001761?via%3Dihub\"><u>Diarte-Plata et al., 2012</u></a>). Furthermore, when the wound was covered or anaesthetic administered, the shrimps reduced these responses, which suggests ablation had been causing pain or distress.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent studies report a statistically significant harmful effect of eyestalk ablation on broodstock mortality (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848618312547\"><u>Zacarias et al., 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://brazilianjournals.com/ojs/index.php/BRJD/article/view/7274\"><u>de Menezes et al., 2019)</u></a>. Ablated shrimps require additional energy as a result of increased moulting frequency during a period of heightened nutritional demand (associated with egg production) (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848618312547\"><u>Zacarias et al., 2019</u></a>, p.464).

In addition, eyestalk ablation may lead to increased disease susceptibility among offspring. In a more recent study,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848620312576\"><u>Zacarias et al.</u></a> (2021) found that the offspring of ablated shrimps were less resilient to pathogen infection. After experimental infection with&nbsp;<i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, the offspring of ablated shrimps had almost half the survival rate compared to the offspring of non-ablated shrimps. They also had a slightly lower survival rate after infection with white spot syndrome virus, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant.&nbsp;</p><p>In the&nbsp;Appendix, we examine the effects of eyestalk ablation on aquaculture outcomes.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Disease&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We have&nbsp;<strong>very high confidence</strong> that diseases are harmful for shrimp welfare due to their significant adverse impacts on shrimp health and mortality.

However, evidence on shrimps specifically is more limited.&nbsp;</p><p>One study of shrimps (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30231519/\"><u>Weineck et al., 2018</u></a>) found that chilling in an ice slurry decreased heart rate in&nbsp;<i>L. vannamei</i>, but stunning was reversible after returning to warm water. Sensory responses were eliminated after 30 seconds of exposure to ice slurry. However, chilling may paralyse shrimps without anaesthetising them (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al. 2021</u></a>, p.73). In practice, tight packing or insufficient ice layering may cause some shrimps to die from asphyxiation because they have little contact with ice. This makes it challenging to extrapolate from experimental studies to aquaculture. Ice slurry could also cause pain from osmotic shock, as salinity drops when ice melts (<a href=\"https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.292\"><u>AHAW 2005</u></a>, p.104).&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30231519/\"><u>Weineck et al.</u></a> (2018) also reported that heart rate decreased after electrical stunning, but it increased again with irregularity within 1-2 minutes of electrical stun. Neither electrical stunning nor ice slurry caused detectable differences in neuromodulators serotonin and octopamine. Both methods induced a tail flipping response, although the authors suggest this may be reflexive rather than indicating pain or stress.&nbsp;</p><p>Pharmacological anaesthesia, such as eugenol, is also an alternative stunning method. While eugenol has been shown to immobilise&nbsp;<i>P. monodon&nbsp;</i>(tiger shrimp) (<a href=\"http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-HYKX201203005.htm\"><u>Cai et al., 2012</u></a>), more research is needed to assess consciousness during anaesthesia (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.72).&nbsp;</p><p>Electrical stunning induces a \u201cseizure-like\u201d state in lobsters (<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162894\"><u>Fregin and Bickmeyer, 2016</u></a>), but this does not guarantee total anaesthesia or absence of pain (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.72). The welfare implications of electrical stunning may depend on the quality and species suitability of the stunning equipment (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.72). Even if shrimps are effectively stunned, they still need to be killed humanely. Crustastun (an electrical stunning machine) is designed to stun&nbsp;<i>and kill&nbsp;</i>large decapods, but electrical stunning is less established for smaller decapods (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.71).&nbsp;</p><p>However, Tesco recently introduced electrical stunning into 80% of its Hilton Seafood supply chain for&nbsp;<i>L. vannamei</i>.

At a commercially viable stunning voltage of 60-75 volts, only 2-3% of shrimps still had leg movement after electrical stunning.&nbsp; Furthermore, of those who had no leg movement, less than 2% continued to demonstrate heart and gill bailer activity (which indicate neuronal and respiratory function).

Stocking density probably affects welfare through indirect mechanisms (e.g. improved water quality, reduced disease and mortality), while there is also some evidence that stocking density directly impacts shrimp behaviour and measurable stress biomarkers (e.g. serotonin).&nbsp;</p><p>In intensive farm systems, stocking density might be a relevant hindrance to welfare, as shrimps have limited space to turn around or crawl (Waldhorn, forthcoming). On the other hand, stocking density may not be optimal at extremely low levels (6 shrimps/m2), at which dominance hierarchies become more prominent, and feed consumption diminishes due to the absence of social cues (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848620323760\"><u>Bardera et al., 2020</u></a>). Studies of fish have also shown some negative effects of extremely low stocking densities, such as aggression and poor feeding response (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.930221/full?fbclid=IwAR1JGn3J98D_-nrEvidNKBSVT07VEGPCqO8feNkKlzJNVj_2GT4kw6CYB1E#B11\"><u>Saraiva et al., 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>For semi-intensive systems, which represent a significant portion of total production volumes worldwide, SWP&nbsp;<i>tentatively&nbsp;</i>recommends a stocking density of 6-15 shrimps per m<sup>2</sup>. We currently estimate a ~70% likelihood that the optimal density for welfare (or \u201cgolden stocking density\u201d) lies within this range on the typical semi-intensive farm. However, the golden stocking density on each individual farm may be higher or lower depending on other environmental factors, such as feeding, water quality, pond design, pond maintenance, shrimp size, and shrimp life stage (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.930221/full\"><u>Saraiva et al., 2022</u></a>). We intend to conduct further research into how the optimal density varies across different environments. We hope this research will allow us to develop an algorithm for estimating optimal density as a function of several environmental factors, and to subsequently publish our findings in an updated version of this report. In the absence of this research, we believe 6-15 shrimps per m<sup>2</sup> is a reasonable approximation for the optimal range on a typical semi-intensive farm.</p><p>Optimal stocking density may be important to prevent social stress in decapods (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.67).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/are.12550\"><u>Da Costa et al.</u></a> (2016) found that shrimps at lower density (50 shrimps/m<sup>2</sup> instead of 75 or 100) distanced themselves from each other, indicating a preference for a less crowded environment. Shrimps also moved less frequently at lower stocking density, which may be associated with reduced stress. Moreover, shrimps at lower density were able to access feed more easily.

We have&nbsp;<strong>high confidence</strong> that EE is beneficial for shrimp welfare. While there has been little research on the impact of EE on shrimp stress or behaviour, there is strong evidence that substrate use improves survival. Moreover, physical enrichment (such as physical structure, plant, and substrate) improves various welfare measures for aquatic animals including crustaceans.&nbsp;</p><p>EE aims to increase complexity within the animal\u2019s environment, leading to increased social interaction, less abnormal behaviour, and reduced captivity-related stress (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/raq.12620\"><u>Arechavala-Lopez et al., 2022</u></a>). In the wild, decapods spend much of their time sheltering in the dark, and should therefore be given access to dark environments (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.70). For&nbsp;<i>L. vannamei</i> maturation tanks, tanks with dark backgrounds and rounded shape are recommended (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/y5040e/y5040e.pdf\"><u>FAO, 2003</u></a>, p.22).&nbsp;</p><p>There is moderate evidence that substrates and sediments enrich the environment and improve survival rates for shrimps. Substrates may enrich the environment by giving shrimps a place to shelter and additional surface area for refuge, such as a rolled packing filler (<a href=\"https://thefishsite.com/articles/using-substrates-in-shrimp-biofloc-could-help-improve-growth-say-researchers\"><u>The Fish Site, 2022</u></a>). In one study, substrates (elastic packing fillers) improved water circulation, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and survival (<a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.08.479639v2.full\"><u>Huang et al., 2022</u></a>). However, in two experiments of super-intensive nursery tank systems, artificial substrates did not have a statistically significant impact on survival (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2004.tb00121.x\"><u>Moss &amp; Moss, 2007</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0144860919301864\"><u>Tierney et al., 2020</u></a>), although they slightly improved dissolved oxygen levels in the latter study. In a biofloc nursery, a polyester-type substrate had no statistically significant effects on water quality, but reduced sludge production (<a href=\"https://www.scielo.br/j/rbz/a/zwJ68YsLNYKJmc3BwLhs3Qj/?lang=en\"><u>Legarda et al., 2018</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Sediments on the bottom of a tank, such as sand, can provide a source of nutrients and a place to burrow, although&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004484860000538X?via%3Dihub#BIB5\"><u>Bratvold and Browdy</u></a> (2001a, p.82) suggest&nbsp;<i>L. vannamei</i> may exhibit limited burrowing behaviour. In one study,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/effects-of-sand-sediment-vertical-surfaces-on-intensive-shrimp-production/\"><u>Bratvold and Browdy</u></a> (2001b) found that while a sandy tank bottom was beneficial, it was particularly effective in combination with an artificial substrate (AquaMat). This combined treatment improved TAN, nitrate, and survival (although nitrite was worsened) relative to a) just sand; or b) no treatment. Results were similar between the sand and no treatment groups, but the no-treatment group had higher nitrate and required more maintenance to reach minimum pH. Similarly, among other decapods, complex substrates such as pebbles, seaweed, and shells reduce aggressive and cannibalistic behaviour more than sand (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23308249.2016.1221379?needAccess=true\"><u>Romano &amp; Zeng, 2017</u></a>, p.50).&nbsp;</p><p>Across all aquatic animals, a meta-analysis of 147 studies found that EE (specifically physical enrichment, such as physical structure, plant, and substrate) has a moderately positive effect on welfare (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/raq.12641?saml_referrer\"><u>Zhang et al., 2021</u></a>). Moreover, when the sample is limited to crustaceans, the effect on welfare remains statistically significant. Welfare measures include aggression and other behaviours (sheltering, foraging, abnormal behaviour), survival, and stress and disease resistance. Physical enrichment likely improves welfare through the mechanism of reduced aggression, which is commonly linked to stress levels, since physical enrichment makes it easier to shelter and reduce contact with other individuals (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/raq.12641?saml_referrer\"><u>Zhang et al., 2021</u></a>, pp. 10-12). Sheltering may also reduce population density in open areas, creating familiarity between individuals when stocking density is low enough.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Transport and Handling&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We have&nbsp;<strong>high confidence</strong> that inappropriate transport and handling is harmful for shrimp welfare. Although research is limited for shrimps, poor transport and handling practices are likely to pose a significant risk to their physical and mental health.&nbsp;</p><p>Careful handling of decapods is important to reduce physical injury and stress (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.65-66). Shrimps caught by trawling are particularly at risk of injury. Imposing maximum packing weights for live transport would help prevent the crushing of shrimps at the bottom of containers and prevent hypoxia for shrimps awaiting loading into large containers (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.78).</p><h2><strong>Food</strong></h2><p>We have&nbsp;<strong>high confidence</strong> that inadequate food and nutrition is harmful for shrimp welfare. While some decapods may be resilient to insufficient food intake, inadequate nutrition can lead to non-infectious disease and behavioural abnormalities.&nbsp;</p><p>Inadequate nutrition can lead to non-infectious diseases in&nbsp;<i>L. vannamei</i> such as soft shell syndrome (<a href=\"https://www.longdom.org/open-access/loose-shell-syndrome-lss-in-litopenaeus-vannamei-growout-ponds-andits-effect-on-growth-and-production-2150-3508-1000151.pdf\"><u>Raja et al., 2015</u></a>).

Overfeeding, on the other hand, may lead to the build-up of toxic ammonia (<a href=\"https://thefishsite.com/articles/how-to-handle-ammonia-spikes-when-farming-shrimp-water-quality\"><u>Alune, 2020</u></a>) and increased turbidity (<a href=\"https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-coastal-research/volume-86/issue-sp1/SI86-027.1/Stress-Quantification-in-Penaeus-vannamei-Exposed-to-Varying-Levels-of/10.2112/SI86-027.1.short\"><u>Kathyayani et al., 2019</u></a>, p.177).&nbsp;</p><p>Evidence from some decapods suggests that they may be resilient to starvation. Studies of lobsters and crabs found that lack of food did not reduce weight or increase mortality, as long as temperatures were cool. However, lack of food still has gradual physiological effects (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf\"><u>Birch et al., 2021</u></a>, p.70).

Nitrate is less toxic than un-ionised ammonia or nitrite, but shrimp health and survival still deteriorates at high concentrations (<a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/high-nitrate-levels-toxic-to-shrimp/\"><u>Kuhn et al., 2011</u></a>).

However, higher nitrate may also help control the accumulation of hydrogen sulphide, which is toxic for shrimps (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848619327474?via%3Dihub\"><u>Torun et al., 2020</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h3>pH</h3><p>We have&nbsp;<strong>high confidence</strong> that deviations from optimal pH are harmful for shrimp welfare due to detrimental effects on health, immunity, and susceptibility to disease. Our standards recommend a pH of 7.8 to 8.2. We also have&nbsp;<strong>high confidence</strong> that sudden fluctuations (within the optimal pH range) are harmful. While we have not found consistent supporting evidence in the academic literature, our conversations with farmers and aquaculture specialists suggest sudden pH fluctuations are a major concern for shrimp health.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref415n33h08wj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn415n33h08wj\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>High pH, in particular, appears to reduce survival. As pH exceeds the optimal range, toxic ammonia builds up, depressing immunity and increasing disease susceptibility (<a href=\"https://www.aquaculturealliance.org/advocate/the-oft-overlooked-water-quality-parameter-ph/\"><u>Kubitza, 2017</u></a>). Outside the optimal range, at pH of 6.5 or 9.5, the health of the animal is weakened (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352513419304715\"><u>Yu et al., 2020</u></a>).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10236244.2015.1086539\"><u>Furtado et al., 2015</u></a> found that survival dramatically fell when pH was outside a range of 4.5 to 9.5. However, in a study with a super-intensive, zero water exchange, high aeration system, the effect of pH on survival was minimal (<a href=\"https://www.aesweb.org/presentations/biofloc/SanAntonio2007/Effect%20of%20pH%20on%20Pacific%20White%20Shrimp%20Litopenaeus%20vannamei%20on%20growth%20and%20survival.pdf\"><u>Wasieleski Jr et al., 2006</u></a>, slide 16).&nbsp;</p><p>While low pH is typically also harmful to shrimp survival, gradual reductions in pH may provide resistance against disease outbreaks.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0147651317308060?via%3Dihub\"><u>Han et al., 2018</u></a> gradually adjusted pH from 8.2 (control pH) to either 9.64-9.81 (gradual-high pH) or 6.65-6.78 (gradual-low pH). The gradual-high pH group had substantially higher mortality than the control group, while the gradual-low pH group only had slightly higher mortality than the control group. In addition, under a&nbsp;<i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> bacteria challenge, gradual-low pH actually enhanced disease resistance, which reduced mortality relative to the other experimental groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies of catfish indicate that&nbsp;<i>sudden changes&nbsp;</i>in pH can cause significant stress and mortality for aquatic animals, even if the changes occur within the optimal pH range (<a href=\"https://thefishsite.com/articles/managing-high-ph-in-freshwater-ponds\"><u>Banrie 2013</u></a>). Our consultation with farmers and aquaculture specialists suggest this is also the case for shrimps. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/the-inevitable-ph-fluctuations-of-aquaculture-pond-water/\"><u>Boyd (2017)</u></a> argues that daily fluctuations from the optimal range may not be highly detrimental for shrimps, despite the concerns of many aquaculturists. We would therefore like to see further research on this issue.&nbsp;</p><h3>Temperature</h3><p>We have&nbsp;<strong>high confidence</strong> that high temperatures are harmful for shrimp welfare, as the water retains less oxygen, toxic ammonia increases, and survival worsens. We have<strong> medium confidence</strong> that low temperatures are harmful, since shrimps may be adaptive to small deviations below optimal temperature.

At above-optimal temperatures, the water retains less oxygen, leading to higher risk of hypoxia (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/ac210e/AC210E09.htm\"><u>Kungvankij &amp; Chua, 1986</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.886024/full\"><u>Albalat et al., 2022</u></a>, p.7). Moreover, higher temperatures raise the proportion of total ammonia nitrogen that is toxic (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2006.00033.x\"><u>Kir &amp; Kumlu, 2006</u></a>, p.231).

In contrast, during chronic infection, as shrimps become afflicted with disease, a higher temperature (33\u00b0C) was found to increase stress and accelerate disease progression.&nbsp;</p><h3>Salinity&nbsp;</h3><p>We have&nbsp;<strong>medium confidence</strong> that deviations from optimal salinity are harmful for shrimp welfare. While it is likely that extreme salinity levels or fluctuations are harmful, the experimental evidence is mixed for small deviations from the recommended salinity range.</p><p><i>L. vannamei</i> are typically able to survive salinities between 0.5\u2030 and 45\u2030 (<a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/influence-of-stressors-on-shrimp-susceptibility-to-white-spot-disease-part-1/\"><u>Millard et al., 2021</u></a>). Our standards recommend 10\u2030 to 20\u2030 to ensure shrimps are healthy. Large fluctuations in salinity within a short period, rather than the level of salinity, may play a larger role in influencing disease susceptibility (<a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/influence-of-stressors-on-shrimp-susceptibility-to-white-spot-disease-part-1/\"><u>Millard et al., 2021</u></a>). This is particularly concerning in the face of climate change, which is expected to increase the occurrence of extreme weather events.&nbsp;</p><p>Salinity may also affect welfare through its interactions with other water quality parameters. As salinity increases, dissolved oxygen becomes less soluble (thereby increasing the risk of low dissolved oxygen and hypoxia), but the toxic component of total ammonia nitrogen is diminished (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4615-5407-3\"><u>Boyd &amp; Tucker 1988, p.94</u></a>). In a recent study, increasing salinity from very low levels (1\u2030 to&nbsp;3\u2030) reduced&nbsp;the toxicity of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00128-018-2355-z.pdf\"><u>Valencia\u2011Casta\u00f1eda et al., 2018</u></a>). Similarly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848603002205\"><u>Lin and Chen</u></a> (2003) found that nitrite became less toxic as salinity increased from 15\u2030 to 35\u2030.&nbsp;</p><p>Experimental evidence suggests higher salinities may be preferable for survival.

These include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN)</strong>: High levels of TAN, which consists of both toxic un-ionised ammonia and non-toxic ionised ammonium (NH4+), restrict the maximum biomass of shrimps in a pond before oxygen needs to be replenished. This may lead to hypoxia and a stressful environment for shrimps (<a href=\"https://thefishsite.com/articles/how-to-handle-ammonia-spikes-when-farming-shrimp-water-quality\"><u>Alune, 2020</u></a>). Higher TAN has also been shown to hinder survival (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10454438.2019.1593911?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;journalCode=wjaa20\"><u>Rostami et al., 2019</u></a>). Our standards recommend TAN of &lt;1ppm (pH dependent).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hydrogen sulphide:&nbsp;</strong>Hydrogen sulphide is toxic for shrimps (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848619327474#:~:text=Nitrate%20amendment%20controlled%20sulphide%20accumulation%20in%20a%20simulated%20shrimp%20pond.&amp;text=Nitrate%20addition%20worked%20better%20as%20a%20curative%20rather%20than%20a%20preventive%20strategy.&amp;text=Frequent%20addition%20of%2012.5%20mg,up%20to%2090%25%20sulphide%20accumulation.\"><u>Torun et al., 2020</u></a>, p.2).

It also inhibits nitrification, thereby increasing the accumulation of ammonia in the pond (<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.270.5236.623\"><u>Joye and Hollibaugh, 1995</u></a>). Our standards recommend hydrogen sulphide of &lt;0.1ppm (pH dependent).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alkalinity</strong>: Alkalinity levels above 120ppm promote nitrification and can prevent the build-up of toxic ammonia (<a href=\"https://thefishsite.com/articles/how-to-handle-ammonia-spikes-when-farming-shrimp-water-quality\"><u>Alune, 2020</u></a>).

Our standards recommend water turbidity (secchi disk visibility) of 40-45cm.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ozone levels:&nbsp;</strong>Adequate ozone levels (below 0.1-0.15 mg/L) help protect shrimps against soft-shell damage (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23308249.2016.1221379?needAccess=true\"><u>Romano &amp; Zeng, 2017</u></a>, p.45).&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>This report aims to identify which factors are most important for shrimp welfare (with a particular focus on&nbsp;<i>L. vannamei</i>), drawing on evidence from academic literature and conversations with farmers and aquaculturists. We are most confident in the importance of addressing eyestalk ablation, disease, stunning and slaughter, dissolved oxygen, and un-ionised ammonia to improve shrimp welfare. For these factors, we have very high confidence that small to medium improvements would reduce harm to shrimps. Of the remaining factors that we investigated, we have high confidence in the importance of addressing stocking density, environmental enrichment, transport and handling, food, pH, and high temperature, while we have medium confidence for salinity and low temperature. We would encourage further research into the welfare effects of these environmental factors and farming practices. We would also welcome further research on how best to measure shrimp welfare.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669764084/mirroredImages/nGrmemHzQvBpnXkNX/f5n4vuahwpwlhm65ehhx.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/acd49198e71fc4c95cccac80b0b55f2a3ccc9df22e3c7f0f.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/acd49198e71fc4c95cccac80b0b55f2a3ccc9df22e3c7f0f.png/w_180 180w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/acd49198e71fc4c95cccac80b0b55f2a3ccc9df22e3c7f0f.png/w_260 260w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/acd49198e71fc4c95cccac80b0b55f2a3ccc9df22e3c7f0f.png/w_340 340w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/acd49198e71fc4c95cccac80b0b55f2a3ccc9df22e3c7f0f.png/w_420 420w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/acd49198e71fc4c95cccac80b0b55f2a3ccc9df22e3c7f0f.png/w_500 500w\"></figure><h1><strong>Appendix</strong></h1><h2><strong>Eyestalk Ablation - Impact on Aquaculture Outcomes</strong></h2><p>See above&nbsp;(section \"Eyestalk Ablation\") for the impact of eyestalk ablation on welfare.</p><p>Evidence is mixed on the effects of eyestalk ablation on aquaculture outcomes. Recent studies by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848618312547\"><u>Zacarias et al.</u></a> (2019) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://brazilianjournals.com/ojs/index.php/BRJD/article/view/7274\"><u>de Menezes et al.</u></a> (2019) compared the reproductive performance of ablated and non-ablated&nbsp;<i>L. vannamei</i>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848618312547\"><u>Zacarias et al.</u></a> found that tanks with ablated shrimps produced ~80% more eggs and nauplii per day, whereas&nbsp;<a href=\"https://brazilianjournals.com/ojs/index.php/BRJD/article/view/7274\"><u>de Menezes et al</u></a>. found the reverse effect, with ablated shrimps producing around 10-15%&nbsp;<i>fewer&nbsp;</i>eggs and nauplii per day. A likely explanation is that ablation had a stronger effect on mortality in the latter study (39% up from 29%), compared to the former (2% up from 1%). This suggests that ablation may be more harmful for reproductive performance when shrimps are susceptible to disease and mortality.&nbsp;</p><p>The two studies are in accord regarding the detrimental impact of ablation on egg/nauplii production&nbsp;<i>per spawned female</i> (i.e. the number of eggs and nauplii produced per female who has mated and started spawning). This is likely because ablation requires shrimps to expend additional energy (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848618312547\"><u>Zacarias et al., 2019</u></a>, p.464).&nbsp;</p><p>Based on these studies, the sole benefit of ablation, in terms of reproductive success, is an improved mating rate per female.

Similar competitions should consider using less top-heavy structures. (</strong><a href=\"https://strainhardening.substack.com/p/personal-review-of-participation\"><strong>Crossposted</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><p>My colleagues and I recently submitted an entry to Open Philanthropy\u2019s Cause Exploration Prize, and received an honorable mention, which came with a prize of $500. Open Philanthropy also awarded each good-faith entry with $200, awarded the first-place entry $25,000, and the three second-place entries with $15,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Our entry was the culmination of a few months of work, started for a different project, so the OP contest was not particularly out of our way. However, in order to do extra research and write and polish the draft, another colleague and I dedicated essentially all of our work hours to the CEP draft alone, and the third member of our team dedicated another significant percentage of his time. Counting only the two of us who worked on it full-time, I would estimate that we spent about two full work weeks on it\u2014assuming a 50-60 hour workweek (call it 55), this means that we dedicated about 220 hours on this project alone<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref53na8j3eguj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn53na8j3eguj\">[1]</a></sup></span>, not even counting our third author\u2019s efforts or the research we had done for the project prior to deciding to work on the CEP. This, of course, a terrible value for money if the prize is $500, especially since the honorable mention is relatively close in quality to the other entries. (The first-place award is 50 times the honorable mentions awards, but the report isn\u2019t 50 times as good as any random honorable mention I read. I\u2019d be hard-pressed to compare the quality nebulously, but intuitively I\u2019d call the first-place entry perhaps 2-3 times as good as a random honorable mention entry, depending on what the judges\u2019 criteria were.)&nbsp;</p><p>That\u2019s not to say I wasn\u2019t excited to receive the award! I felt great about the recognition, but realistically, the main reward was that people liked the report and found it valuable. It definitely wouldn\u2019t have been worth it to enter the contest if I thought writing the report would distract from my work.&nbsp;</p><p>The balance of considerations becomes more extreme when you consider the award for a good-faith entry. I was proud of the report we turned in, because the deadline was extended by a week, so we were able to do extra research and the report was far more thorough than it would have been otherwise. On the other hand, considered from a purely financial perspective, this was a terrible choice\u2014assuming we didn\u2019t have the extra week, and could only spend 110 hours on the draft, we still would have received the good-faith entry prize. But we also would have received the good-faith entry prize if had done zero extra work and exclusively committed to writing up our existing research at the time, without adding any extra research\u2014let\u2019s say that would have taken ~20 hours (and, to be clear, would have been a wildly low-quality report). We would have spent ~10% of the time to receive 40% of the prize. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that this was already part of my job, this would actually be better time use!</p><p>So, okay, given that this <i>was</i> part of my job, was there really any issue? Was there a better way to spend our work hours, or did this stage of the project justify at least two full work weeks across two authors? I think yes, it was justified. We\u2019re in the process of revising the report significantly to more closely fit our original project goal, but it was incredibly helpful to us to have a forcing deadline; we had yet to give ourselves a deadline to produce a polished draft of anything. We\u2019re reusing a lot of the writing; I think that forgoing the OP contest would probably have saved about 20% of the time spent, or ~44 hours, not quite a full work week for one person, and not a bad time outlay given the benefits. We\u2019ve since sent the report around to some collaborators to provide background on our project. Also, on a personal level, I figure it\u2019s generally good for me to produce public writing; maybe the other authors would say the same. The work tradeoff mostly came in the form of anxious false starts, time spent just on polishing writing, and letting other work fall by the wayside; aside from ditching another project to work on this one, I was fairly burned out in the week following the sprint to submit (although that\u2019s a risk for any project).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1v821784698\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1v821784698\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>A prize competition structured like this one is weighted very heavily toward the ends\u2014there\u2019s a strong reason to put in tons of effort if you think you have a shot at winning first or second place; there\u2019s also a decent reason to submit any good-faith entry regardless of quality.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefemux1qlyer9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnemux1qlyer9\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But given that most people <i>don\u2019t</i> get first or second place, you should probably assume you won\u2019t, and this might mean that you shouldn\u2019t put much effort into your submission unless writing it is actually just your day job. Given that structure, probably lots of people enter reports related to their existing projects, which is good, but also maybe the competition organizers will have to spend a lot of time reading much lower-quality reports than might otherwise be produced. I can also say that outside of work, I would be generally more likely to enter a competition with a smoother prize gradient.</p><p>It would be a simple fix to restructure the prizes to be less top-heavy. For example: twenty honorable mentions were awarded, for a total of $10,000. If each were $1,000 instead of $500, they\u2019d be five times the size of the good-faith entry awards. To avoid adding the $10,000 to the grantor\u2019s cost, the top-tier prizes could each be reduced by $2,500 each, leaving even the second-place prizes at over 12 times the honorable mentions. I expect that in this and similar competitions, many of the honorable mentions were close to the winners in quality and usefulness, so that type of restructuring seems reasonable. &nbsp;</p><p>I wanted the main thrust of this post to be the specifics of the OP Cause Exploration Prize, but it\u2019d be incomplete if I didn\u2019t mention that my thinking about this specific prize has made me more concretely skeptical of essay/report prizes in general as great uses of time for either the judges or participants. Consider that if I\u2019d spent 20 hours writing up our existing research into a report that would net the good-faith entry award, I\u2019d receive $200, or $10/hr. It\u2019s not totally fair to compare prize money to normal wages; prize organizers definitely get more participation than they could afford at normal research contractor rates. However, prize structures potentially discourage people with high opportunity costs from participating, and it seems easy for judges to get swamped with low-quality entries. I said above that I\u2019d be more likely to enter a competition with a smoother prize gradient\u2014this is true, but actually I\u2019m pretty unlikely to use free time to enter a prize competition at all. This situation makes me skeptical of prizes as incentives for problem-solving, rather than as rewards for something already achieved for other reasons (like Nobels).</p><p>That said\u2014whether a specific essay competition is a good use of time is, of course, up to the organizers to decide. I can easily imagine the organizers having priorities that favor the top-heavy structure because they only care that they receive a few great entries, and care less about the quality of everything below the top tier. And anyway, I\u2019m all for organizations experimenting with new ways to get input and information.</p><p>Many thanks to Austin Chen for the idea about how to restructure prizes and also for listening to my description of the problem in the first place and saying, \u201cHey it sounds like you should write an EA Forum post about that.\u201d Also, seriously, thanks to the Open Phil judges for awarding us an honorable mention\u2014I was legitimately delighted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn53na8j3eguj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref53na8j3eguj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Those 220 hours don\u2019t literally mean that all of those hours were spent on the report\u2014my estimate of a 55-hour workweek includes various workday distractions.

These ~8-week-long discussion groups have some virtues: they\u2019re scalable, high fidelity, accessible, and not that weird looking.

Most other EA programming occurs in classroom-type settings where people are used to engaging with ideas intellectually but not taking them seriously as action-relevant, life-affecting things.\u201d</li><li>Or, in Duncan Sabien\u2019s terms, retreats make people\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/the-mud-rock-spectrum-c72914916b86\"><u>minds muddier</u></a>\u2014more flexible, open to new ideas.</li><li>The flip side of intro fellowships being \u201caccessible\u201d or \u201cnot weird\u201d is that there is no manic magic\u2014instead, people show up, have intellectual debates often in a&nbsp;<i>literal classroom setting</i>, and never seem to realize how life-changing all those ideas would be if they really took them seriously.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Faster/more interesting for fellows:</strong> this is a key point of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LaZjDF5uhdCozBBLZ/we-need-alternatives-to-intro-ea-fellowships\">Ashley\u2019s post</a> and is supported by ~2/10 of my closest engaged EA friends saying they would have never signed up for/made it through an intro fellowship, and wouldn\u2019t have gotten into EA if that was the on-ramp presented to them. Worse, it seems that the most curious/driven/agentic people are most likely to feel this way. Retreats are less likely to lose that demographic.</li><li><strong>Social bonding:</strong> People are way more likely to feel drawn to engage with EA more if they have friends there, feel a sense of community there, and doing so lets them talk to people that they like. EA can also be intimidating\u2014probably particularly for minority demographics in EA\u2014so feeling comfortable reaching out/asking \u201cdumb\u201d questions to more highly engaged members of the group seems important. Retreats leave more time for socializing in general, in particular for late night mushy/emotional conversations, and have people together at more vulnerable/less put together times (sleeping in the same rooms, hanging out in PJs, eating all meals together). I felt far closer to these intro fellows after the retreat than I have ever felt to a typical cohort.</li><li><strong>Faster path to doing impactful things: </strong>getting people on board in 4 days instead of 8 weeks adds 52 days to their more impactful career.</li></ul><p>One notable thing I did with this retreat was to mix intro fellows with in-depth fellows, university EA organizers, and EA professionals. The advantages of this were:</p><ul><li>Less Dunning-Krueger effect: it\u2019s common for people after the intro fellowship to feel like they understand EA pretty extensively, and having a bunch of in-depth people there shows them what\u2019s coming next/how much engagement these questions demand.</li><li>Not relying on one facilitator as the source of truth on EA or as a prototypical EA.</li><li>Makes EA feel less like \u201cjust a college club\u201d and more like a thing that adults seriously apply to the biggest decisions of their lives.</li></ul><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995185/mirroredImages/LEDXWzixD56yXsCDp/vwwbsvm7xpmbdri5kf3b.jpg\"></p><h3>Disadvantages of Retreats</h3><p>However, there are some reasons retreats might be worse than intro fellowships:</p><ul><li><strong>Higher time cost</strong>: I\u2019d&nbsp;<i>very roughly</i> estimate that it\u2019s about 1.7x the total organizer/professional time cost of an intro fellowship per intro fellow. Back of the envelope calculation goes something like:&nbsp;<ul><li>For 12 people at a retreat (because having full intended attendance would have added no time): 30 hours of in-advance ops work for me (not including planning programming, which will get cheaper every time) + 60 hours of professional guest time + 140 hours of organizer time at the event.</li><li>For 12 people in an intro fellowship: ~20 hours (???) of backend ops + 72 hours of organizer time for 3 cohorts of 4 to meet each week for 8 weeks.</li><li>Then adjusting multiplier down because: organizers benefitted from sense of community/meeting professionals + the counterfactual isn\u2019t that they spend those 36 hours doing EA things + intro fellows should be meeting those professionals anyway, only by default it might happen at other club events\u2026so I think overall the extra time sink is more like 1.7x instead of 2.5x of an intro fellowship.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Higher monetary cost</strong>: about $9k for the 8 fellows (though I think it could have been done for $11k and 12-14 fellows, given that the airbnb was just underfilled) vs. an intro fellowship which would be ~$1800 for 12-14 fellows for books and meals at meetings + a couple of socials.</li><li><strong>Less material covered</strong>: I didn\u2019t have people do reading in advance, though as we\u2019ll get to later, I\u2019m uncertain about this choice. I feel like we got all the very key points across and they got more conversations with highly engaged EAs where they saw EA reasoning put into practice, such that at the end they\u2019d absorbed the key stuff just as well (if not better), but perhaps I\u2019m underestimating how hard it is to absorb because it\u2019s been in my head for so long now.</li><li><strong>It\u2019s harder to get people to come</strong> (see outreach section). I think this also had the upside that the people who did come are more interested and so the quality of conversations felt higher.</li><li><strong>Optics</strong>: some people were concerned about the cost. I actually picked one of the cheapest airbnbs that could fit everyone, but looked fancy, and we went to Maine which seemed unnecessary + expensive. In my opinion, going to a beautiful place in Maine in fact provided a lot of value and would be easily worth it if not for optics, but alas, optics matter. May also seem culty or pattern match to religion.</li></ul><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995185/mirroredImages/LEDXWzixD56yXsCDp/i9hnfep2dd03um5cwnqr.jpg\"></p><h2><br>Thoughts on Outreach</h2><ul><li><strong>It\u2019s much harder to get signups for Intro Retreats than Intro Fellowships.</strong> In order to get signups, you need to do more reaching out 1-1, and just more outreach period.</li><li>Above said,&nbsp;<strong>I do not recommend doing&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>broad</strong></i><strong> outreach for a retreat</strong>\u2014don\u2019t put it on posters/mailing lists. Why?<ul><li><strong>Weird optics</strong>? Retreats may seem extravagant.</li><li><strong>Without permission from the school, your club may not be allowed to host an event like this,</strong> and because of the other downsides in this list, it\u2019s not worth the risk of getting in trouble. I know uni group organizers have a general preference for blissful ignorance of student organization regulations, but this seems like a high risk/low payoff thing to advertise.</li><li><strong>Attendees should have more EA knowledge before committing</strong> to a retreat than to an intro fellowship. Unlike in an intro fellowship, if someone comes and a couple sessions in decides that EA isn\u2019t for them, they\u2019re basically forced to stick around and have a bad time, which makes other attendees\u2019 experiences worse and makes them more likely to go off and be EA detractors. In other words, it\u2019s more important that retreat attendees know what they\u2019re getting themselves into than that intro fellows do.</li><li><strong>It doesn\u2019t get many signups anyway. My experience was that reaching out 1-1 was more effective than slightly broader outreach (like announcing at club meetings, sending to our mailing list/slack, etc.) relative to intro fellowship outreach.</strong></li></ul></li><li>In general with retreats,&nbsp;<strong>expect high dropout rates</strong>, especially if you had a low barrier to entry in the first place.&nbsp;<strong>Aim for 25-50% more RSVPs than you could possibly fit</strong> into your space. Dropout rates are inversely correlated with the size of your barrier to entry\u2014expect lots of drop outs if signing up is easy and fewer if people had to apply or were personally/exclusively invited. If it\u2019s a local thing, most drop outs will happen in the 3 days just before the event.</li><li><strong>Prestige &amp; exclusivity leads to more signups:&nbsp;</strong>This might be obvious but I neglected this for a while and it made a huge difference. This is accomplished by clean emails, a pretty web/notion page, inviting professionals and advertising that, and reaching out to people individually in a way that makes them feel special.</li></ul><h2>Event Overview</h2><p><i>If you\u2019re interested in running an event like this yourself, see the appendix for details on programming and outreach.</i></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995185/mirroredImages/LEDXWzixD56yXsCDp/pvwsmf24wpikbdgeuvy0.png\"></p><p>The arc of the event went like\u2026</p><ul><li>Day 1: Got settled, got acquainted, set expectations for the weekend.</li><li>Day 2: Speed-ran all the fundamental content. The intro fellows covered cognitive biases, global health, triage, long tails, ethics, animal welfare, existential risk, longtermism, and AI-risk.</li><li>Day 3: Learned about EA in the real world. We started the day by zooming out to the EA landscape and discussing critiques of the movement, before diving into specific corners of EA through 1-1s, lightning talks, and professional talks. Ended the day with a career workshop.</li><li>Day 4: Reflected on the weekend and made actionable plans.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Only about half of our waking hours were spent on content though. The rest of the time we spent cooking and eating meals together, walking to the beach and to the lighthouse, playing board games, doing structured bonding activities like Askhole and Hamming Circles, and just hanging out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995185/mirroredImages/LEDXWzixD56yXsCDp/d3xsdhju1f1rc38guinm.jpg\"><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Results</h2><p>The data from the post-retreat feedback form looks similar to the numbers from typical intro fellowships. This was surprising to me, since people seemed more excited/engaged than any intro fellowship cohort I\u2019ve seen, and I felt much closer to the attendees than I ever had to intro fellows. We have also had higher rates of sustained engagement after the retreat than we do after intro fellows (2 immediately joined the in-depth fellowship, 1 is going to a more advanced retreat this weekend, and 1 of the others have participated in our events since the retreat). There are also strong selection effects on retreat attendees vs. intro fellows (see outreach section in appendix) which makes analyzing this all the more confusing.</p><p>Some cherry-picked quotes from attendees:</p><ul><li>\u201cI really liked the weekend retreat idea. I think it was good to step out from the day to day of school life and be in a different setting to engage with big picture ideas.\u201d</li><li>\u201cThe group of students and leaders was great, and the sessions we had were very informative about the specific things I wanted to learn. The conversations we would get into after were also very fun and interesting, and the fact that there were outdoor destinations around the house was perfect for one-on-one walks. I think the closing session will have an impact on my life.\u201d</li></ul><p>&nbsp;For anonymized feedback results, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z79SmcuCzdKcO411UHE9xei6TQcQhNvsihrzYGzY5fs/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h2>Conclusion &amp; Ideas for Next Time</h2><p>Overall, I remain agnostic about the value of retreats vs. intro fellowships. I\u2019d be excited about hybrid things that combine the benefits of each, like hosting a retreat at the beginning or end of an intro fellowship, or doing 4 weeks of reading/discussion and then a retreat. I mostly want EA organizers to experiment more so we as a community can make sure that the standard EA intro program is closer to optimal.</p><p>I\u2019m likely going to run another version of this retreat in the winter for Boston Area students, and next time I will do the following differently (in order of importance/confidence):</p><ul><li>Market from the beginning the way I did at the end: polished + featuring professionals + exclusive + open to more schools.</li><li>Aim to get more people (12-14): obviously I was trying to do this before, but it seems doable with the above point. This will make it more time/money efficient and provide more data.</li><li>Redo most of the in-depth content: I did this last minute and it was not very well thought out. In-depth people I still think got a lot of benefit, but it came more from 1-1s and less from content. I do think what in-depth people might actually get the most from is more independent looking into cause prio/cruxes/careers, and programming can be made for this that takes advantage of the retreat format over the regular in-depth fellowship.</li><li>Let people choose their own 1-1s sometimes.</li><li>Have students help more: especially for EA events run by college students for college students, being a little less polished is okay, and having people help more (put on their sheets, clean in the morning, cook, etc.) makes them more bought into the event, is good for bonding, good for vibes, and of course, saves organizer effort.</li><li>Remember to defrost the Beyond Burgers\u2026</li><li>Make people read in advance? This was my original plan, and it was actually suggested by two people in our final feedback form, but it was hard enough to get people to sign up even without that barrier, so I\u2019m unsure.&nbsp;</li><li>Make the thing shorter? I\u2019m very uncertain about this. It\u2019s hard to get all of the content in as is, and the extra day does lead to more immersion/bonding, but this was also suggested by one person in the feedback form.</li></ul><hr><h2>Appendix: Programming &amp; Outreach</h2><p><i>Read this section iff you want to run an event like this.</i>&nbsp;</p><h3>How I (Haphazardly) Did Outreach</h3><p>Originally, this was supposed to be a Tufts-only event. We had a universal intro program application, where students checked boxes for the programs they were interested in and stated preferences among the Intro Fellowship, the Precipice Reading Group, and the Intro Summit (as it was then called). Broad outreach focused on the former two, while our mailing list/website/announcements at the GIM and weekly meetings gave details on all three, and in meetings I emphasized the advantages of the retreat over the intro fellowship. This did not work: of the 21 people who filled out the general application, only 4 expressed interest in the retreat, and 2 had it as their first choice.</p><p>Then, about a week and a half before the event, I made a pretty notion page, started calling it the \u201cGlobal Priorities Summit,\u201d and got a couple professionals to agree to come and reached out to people I\u2019d spoken to who seemed to be some combination of careful thinkers/reasoners and excited about EA to individually invite them. Those invites had a ~50% hit rate.</p><p>I also reached out to other group organizers in the Boston area and got 3 signups this way, though 2 dropped out last minute. I think this could have been more successful had I done it earlier, made it easier for organizers to invite people by writing blurbs for different contexts, and bugged them more to actually do it.</p><p>All of the above is for intro fellows; I got my in-depth fellows entirely through 1-1 invites. Sample was small and I didn\u2019t put much thought into this so I don\u2019t have much to say here.</p><p>In conclusion, outreach for this was hard, but could have been successful had I gotten my shit together earlier or had anticipated just how hard it would be.</p><h3>How I Planned Programming</h3><p>I spent more time planning the programming in advance than I did doing all other in-advance ops things combined, and I think I made lots of good choices (and some bad ones).&nbsp;</p><p>I planned my programming by first reading Duncan Sabien\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WotMLgX9hHXzBxKCB/how-to-a-workshop-or-anything\"><u>How to: A Workshop (or Anything)</u></a>, then doing lots of brainstorming, guided by a combination of my list key ideas from the intro fellowship that alums must understand, my list of crazy EA things that stick in people\u2019s heads and make them take actions (\u201choly shit [insert: x-risk/super long tails/factory farming moral catastrophe/drowning child framing]\u201d), and sessions from other retreats that I\u2019ve found particularly valuable. Then I trimmed/combined/ordered sessions, and added in time for breaks, walks, and 1-1s based on how much these happen at other retreats.</p><p>I ordered things guided by the principle that the most memorable/important parts of the event are:</p><ul><li>Beginning: set purpose/expectations, be organized/welcoming and give people a good first impression that they remember.</li><li>Climax: the 11th hour, usually the last night of the retreat, people are feeling peak levels of the magical retreat mania, are most open to new ideas.</li><li>End: clear plans, good vibes. What do you want to stick in people\u2019s heads?</li></ul><h3>Sessions</h3><p>Here\u2019s the whole weekend schedule\u2014blue means intro, red means in-depth, yellow means combined, and everything else is not learning time. Below are descriptions of every session, with stars next to all the ones that don\u2019t clearly correspond to any week in the intro fellowship/may not be obvious to include, but that I\u2019m very glad I did include.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995185/mirroredImages/LEDXWzixD56yXsCDp/lvd1bpvq7jdie7xafndu.png\"></p><p><strong>Opening Session*:</strong> Got people comfortable/introduced, set purpose/expectations, and gave some advice to get the most out of it.

We spent ~10 minutes on each bias and discussed why our minds work this way, how it can get in the way of doing good, and strategies to combat the bias.</p><p><strong>Aumann\u2019s Agreement Theorem &amp; epistemic modesty:&nbsp;</strong>Went over the things in the title + intro Bayesian reasoning. I don\u2019t have strong takes about what\u2019s the most important thing to go here, but I think starting both tracks with some sort of rationality/how to think thing sets a good tone for the rest of the weekend.</p><p><strong>Long tails &amp; triage in global health:</strong> Had fellows read Toby Ord\u2019s The Moral Imperative Towards Cost-Effectiveness in Global Health, discussed how the same concepts\u2014long tails and triage\u2014apply to doing good beyond global health, and how this motivates&nbsp;<i>effective</i> altruism.</p><p><strong>Tentative cause prio and cruxes:</strong> Explained what a crux is, had people reflect on their tentative cause prioritization and what empirical/philosophical changes could shift their prioritization.</p><p><strong>Morality taken seriously*:</strong> Explained drowning child thought experiment and had fellows reflect on their values and what it would mean to take them seriously. Included discussion on \u201cmoral realms,\u201d i.e. by default people tend to think of personal relationships or politics as places where morality is relevant, while they think of careers as personal choices that have little to do with morality, but this doesn\u2019t make any sense impact-wise.

This is changing because \u2013 among other things \u2013 we now have concrete ideas for how to construct AI in a safer manner.</p><p>However, it\u2019s not enough for us to merely have ideas of what to build.

It consists of a software framework and an interactive visualiser:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995942/mirroredImages/pHKsedBYAvzFCniDF/gllh31bsc3pyk0snotws.png\"><figcaption>ICE visualiser</figcaption></figure><p>On the back-end, we\u2019re looking for better ways to instrument the cognition \u201crecipes\u201d such that our framework stays out of the user\u2019s way as much as possible, while still giving a useful trace of the reasoning process. We\u2019re using some meta-programming, and having good CS fundamentals would be helpful, but there\u2019s no ML experience required. Plus working on open-source projects is super fun!</p><p>If you are more of a front-end developer, you\u2019ll appreciate that representing a complex deductive process is a UX challenge as much as anything else. These execution graphs can be very large, cyclic, oddly and unpredictably shaped, and each node can contain masses of information. How can we present this in a useful UI which captures the macro structure and still allows the user to dive into the minutiae?</p><p>This work is important for safety because AI systems that have a legible decision-making process are easier to reason about and more trustworthy. On a more technical level, Factored Cognition looks like it will be a linchpin of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/iterated-amplification\"><u>Iterated Distillation and Amplification</u></a> \u2013&nbsp;one of the few concrete suggestions for a safer way to build AI.</p><h3>For product managers</h3><p>At first, it might not be obvious how big of an impact product managers can have on AI safety (the same goes for designers). However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thesephist.com/posts/representation/\"><u>interface design is an alignment problem</u></a> \u2013 and it\u2019s even more neglected than other areas of safety research.</p><p>You don\u2019t need a super technical background, or to already be steeped in ML. The competing priorities we face every day in our product decisions will be fairly familiar to experienced PMs. Here are some example trade-offs that we regularly navigate for our app,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://elicit.org/\"><u>Elicit</u></a>:</p><ul><li>Delivering&nbsp;<strong>terse, valuable insights</strong> to users vs. exposing the&nbsp;<strong>inner-workings of the system</strong>.<ul><li>Simple answers and compact summaries make our product feel magical and save users\u2019 time.</li><li>On the other hand, revealing what is happening under the covers makes our product more trustworthy and builds trust.</li></ul></li><li>Follow&nbsp;<strong>familiar product paradigms</strong> vs. imagine&nbsp;<strong>radical new workflows</strong>.<ul><li>Users get more immediate value from interfaces which feel familiar.</li><li>On the other hand, language models offer opportunities for novel interaction styles which might be more valuable in the medium-term.</li></ul></li><li>Help users&nbsp;<strong>get quick answers</strong> to their questions vs.&nbsp;<strong>help users carefully think</strong> their way through a complex task.<ul><li>Quick answers let our users power through well-defined tasks.</li><li>On the other hand, perhaps we offer more lasting value by acting as a reasoning assistant \u2013 it certainly better fits our overall mission.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Compensate for the limitations</strong> in today\u2019s language models vs. build&nbsp;<strong>functionality which will scale</strong> to more powerful models in the future.<ul><li>Language models have various known limitations, and our current product is valuable to users when we work around those limitations.</li><li>On the other hand, the limitations are going to retreat and change with every improvement to language models \u2013 we want our work to be super-charged by change, rather than deprecated by it.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995942/mirroredImages/pHKsedBYAvzFCniDF/tusmmj2v9hlawnmxhpsq.jpg\"><figcaption>Elicit product questions</figcaption></figure><p>In my opinion, the main thing which makes product management at Ought different from other places is that we are working on the frontier of new technology. We regularly dream up features which turn out to just not be possible \u2013&nbsp;even using today\u2019s most powerful models<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflm70rhvaf9q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlm70rhvaf9q\">[1]</a></sup></span>. Our product direction isn\u2019t only informed by our strategy and our users, it\u2019s also influenced by what can be realised on the cutting edge of machine learning.</p><p>Great product managers can have an enormous impact on AI safety by helping us find the right balance between:</p><ol><li>Proving our app is useful, and</li><li>Proving our approach is safer</li></ol><p>If we lean too much towards adding crowd-pleasing widgets to our product, we won\u2019t make enough progress on our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pYcFPMBtQveAjcSfH/supervise-process-not-outcomes\"><u>mission to prove out process-based systems</u></a>. On the other hand, if we lean too much towards researching process-based systems, we will \u2013 at best \u2013 prove they\u2019re theoretically interesting rather than actually useful.</p><h3>For infrastructure engineers</h3><p>Because of the nature of the research we\u2019re doing and the design of the product we\u2019re building, we\u2019re hitting a bunch of different ML APIs to do different jobs in different places.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995942/mirroredImages/pHKsedBYAvzFCniDF/ob9y0niy3umdqsyoytcn.jpg\"><figcaption>Some of the models we use for different tasks in Elicit</figcaption></figure><p>At the moment, we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to record all of these interactions with 3rd party and internal models. We\u2019d like to insert an abstraction layer between our code and the ML models to achieve a few things:</p><ul><li>The ability to fallback to alternatives when a model goes down or has increased latency (this is still quite common with 3rd party models).</li><li>Build up datasets of task/result pairs, which we can then use to train our own models in the future. These training data would, by their nature, be representative of the queries our users are interested in. We could even enrich the dataset with user feedback from the app: if someone marked one of our answers as \u201cnot good\u201d, we can use that to improve the models on the next iteration.</li><li>Enable us to split traffic to a couple of different back-end models, so that we can compare them head-to-head. We\u2019d like to understand how operational metrics like latency, throughput, and error rate compare between different APIs, using real traffic.</li></ul><p>Implementing this abstraction layer would be challenging work. Obviously, when running in our production environment performance and reliability is critical. In contrast, for internal experiments we\u2019d like the system to be highly flexible and easy to modify. There are&nbsp;<i>some&nbsp;</i>tools for tracking datasets and versioning, but it\u2019s a relatively immature space compared to conventional infrastructure: there\u2019s not an enormous toolchain for you to learn!</p><p>This is a key component of our AI safety work because building up these datasets of task/result pairs is one way to do the \u201cDistillation\u201d part of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/iterated-amplification\"><u>Iterated Distillation and Amplification</u></a>. For example, imagine we have a complex and expensive Factored Cognition process running in our infrastructure. After 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 examples, we could hot-swap in a new model trained on the real data captured at your abstraction layer.</p><h2>Why would you do this?</h2><p>Hopefully the examples above show that there is a wide range of product building work which can help with AI safety. But there are lots of exciting opportunities out there! What makes this area so special?</p><p>Here are some of the things that excite me the most about working on AI safety:</p><p><strong>Impactful work.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\"><u>80,000 Hours</u></a> rates AI safety as one of its highest priority causes because the risks are astronomical, there are tangible things we can do to help, and talent is currently the main constraint.</p><p><strong>The people are fantastic.</strong> Because it\u2019s a nascent field with an altruistic bent, your colleagues and peers will generally have strong prosocial motivations. They will be gifted, dedicated, interesting team mates who aren\u2019t just doing it for a paycheck.</p><p><strong>Talking of paychecks\u2026</strong> Many of the organisations working on AI safety (including Ought!) are well-funded. You&nbsp;<i>can</i> work on something important without needing to sacrifice your creature comforts, or priorities like Earning To Give.</p><p><strong>Interesting, challenging work every day.</strong> Nowadays, a lot of product development work is highly commoditised. We have enough frameworks, methodologies, tools, and services to make software projects feel like building a Lego set, rather than a truly novel challenge. This is not yet true with AI. New models, architectures, and techniques are being developed all the time, and there\u2019s a tight feedback loop between academia and industry.</p><p>In fact, if you fit the profile of the audience of this post, and the points I just made above resonate with you, you might find that AI safety is your Ikigai \u2013&nbsp;I did!<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995942/mirroredImages/pHKsedBYAvzFCniDF/kdedncfzahkctnybfjc2.png\"></p><h1>What to do now?</h1><p>If this post has resonated with you and you\u2019d like to know more about Ought:</p><ul><li>Try our app,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://elicit.org/\"><u>Elicit</u></a>, to better understand what we\u2019re building.</li><li>Go through our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://primer.ought.org/\"><u>Factored Cognition Primer</u></a>, through which you\u2019ll develop hands-on experience with the approach we\u2019re taking.</li><li>Read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pYcFPMBtQveAjcSfH/supervise-process-not-outcomes\"><u>Supervise Process, not Outcomes</u></a> to learn more about the framework within which our work sits.</li><li>Take a look at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ought.org/careers\"><u>open roles</u></a>!</li></ul><p>If you\u2019re interested in working in AI safety more generally:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\"><u>Preventing an AI-related catastrophe</u></a> is a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the cause area.</li><li>80,000 Hours also offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/\"><u>1-1 advice</u></a> to people looking to move to a high-impact career.</li><li>We\u2019re starting a reading group aimed at the same sorts of people that this post is catered to.

The more time you put\ninto your decision the better it's likely to be, but at some point you\nneed to stop looking and actually make the donation.  The more you're\ndonating the longer it makes sense to go, since it's more valuable to\nbetter direct a larger amount of money. Can you get the benefits of the\ndeeper research without increasing time spent on research?  Weirdly,\nyou can!  About five years ago, Carl Schulman </span>\n\n<a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2016/03/creating-donor-advised-fund-lottery.html\">proposed</a>\n(and \n\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WvPEitTCM8ueYPeeH/donor-lotteries-demonstration-and-faq\">ran the first</a>) \"donor lottery\".\n\n\n\n</p><p>\n\nSay instead of donating $1k, you get together with 100\nother people and you each put in $1k.  You select one of the people at\nrandom (1:100) to choose where the pool ($100k) goes.  This turns your\n100% chance of directing $1k into a 1% chance of directing $100k.  The\ngoal is to make research more efficient:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>If you win, you're working with enough money that it's worth it\nfor you to put serious time into figuring out your best donation option.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>If you lose, you don't need to put any time into determining where\nyour money should go.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThis isn't that different from giving your money to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> or similar to decide how\nto distribute, in that it's delegating the decision to someone who can put\nin more research.  Except that it doesn't require identifying someone\nbetter at allocating funds than you are, it just requires that you\nwould:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Make better decisions in allocating $100k than $1k\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Prefer a 1% chance of a well-allocated $100k to a 100% chance of a\nsomewhat less well-allocated $1k.\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIf you come at this from a theoretical perspective this can seem\nreally neat: better considered donations, more efficient use of\nresearch time, strictly better, literally no downsides, why would you\nnot do this?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nDespite basically agreeing with all of the above, however, I've not\nparticipated in a donor lottery, and I think they're likely slightly\nnegative on balance.  There actually are downsides, just not\nin areas that the logic above considers.\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe biggest downside is that it makes your donation decisions less\nlegible: it's harder for people to understand what you're doing and\nwhy.  Lets say you're talking to a friend:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nFriend: You're really into charity stuff, right?  Where did you decide to\ndonate this year?\n<p>\nYou: I put my money into a donor lottery.  I traded my $10k for a 1%\nchance of donating $1M.\n</p>\n<p>\nFriend: Did you win?\n</p>\n<p>\nYou: No, but I'm glad I did it!  Let me explain why...\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThere are a few different ways this could go.  Your friend could:\n\n</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n\n<li><p>Listen to your explanation at length, and\nthink \"this is really cool, more efficient donation allocation, I bet\nEA is full of great ideas like this, I should learn more!\"\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Listen to your explanation at length, and think \"maybe this\nworks, but it seems like it could probably go wrong somehow.\"\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Not have time or interest for the full explanation, and be left\nthinking you irresponsibly gambled away your annual donation.\n\n</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI think (b) and (c) are going to happen often enough to outweigh both\nthe benefit (a) and the benefit of the additional research.  And this\nis in some sense a best case: your friend thinks well of you and is\nlikely to give you the benefit of the doubt.  The same conversation\nwith someone you know less well or who doesn't have the same baseline\nassumption that you're an honest and principled person trying to do\nthe right thing would likely go very poorly.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe other problem with that conversation is that you're not really\nanswering the question!  They're trying to figure out where they\nshould donate, and are looking for your advice.  Even if they come\naway thinking your decision to participate in the lottery makes some\nsense, they're unlikely to decide to participate the first time they\nhear about the idea, and so do still need to decide where to\ngive. It's much better if you can explain what charity you picked,\nhow you were thinking about it, and be able to answer followups.\nImportantly, I think this is better than explaining the donor lottery\nat illustrating EA thinking and helping people figure out if learning\nmore about EA is something they'd enjoy.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI also have two smaller objections to donor lotteries:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>If with some research you have a good chance of identifying\nbetter donation opportunities than \"give to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> or <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/\">EA Funds</a>\", I'd be\nexcited for you to do that and write up your results.  I think you'd\nlikely influence other funders enough that the time investment would\nbe worth it, and you'd learn a lot.  If this goes well you get the\nbenefit of winning a donor lottery without having to actually win!\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>When I was earning to give I was in a position similar to\nsomeone who had won a donor lottery, in that I had enough money to\nallocate that it would be worth putting in substantial time deciding\nwhat to do with it.  But in practice I didn't end up putting in that\nmuch time, the time I did put in didn't shift my views, and I <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/donations\">ended up</a> donating to the same places I expect I\nwould have if I'd been donating much less money.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n(I think the tradeoffs were less against donor lotteries in 2016 when they were first proposed, because there were many fewer people\nworking full time on how to allocate EA money.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02kmxWjQEskacv2wgzrybDdfc7BNCPogmxaEry7X7HZ92J1BFTejCLq2HmiFsVCbW4l\">facebook</a></i></p>", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "y7JzLaCAJkBxeh2rz", "title": "Which are the best examples/resources of positive futures you can think of?

A lot of these projects require complicated operational support. RP\u2019s Core Operations team is focused on ensuring RP's day-to-day functioning, and often these special projects require additional capacity beyond what the Core Ops team has or exploration of novel areas that are outside the purview of the Core Ops team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although we currently expect Special Projects staff to primarily focus on operations activities, this is unlikely to solely be day-to-day operations tasks, and there are also many other activities we would be excited for the team to engage in. Some possible examples include developing budgets, writing business plans for entrepreneurial projects, fundraising, liaising with stakeholders, researching legal/operational issues, scouting for talent for the projects, helping run prizes or requests for proposals, and grantmaking.&nbsp;</p><p>We expect that most of these projects will be in the longtermism space, although that is not a requirement. SP plans on fiscally sponsoring, incubating, or otherwise hosting several of these projects over the next few years. We expect to run regular hiring rounds to increase the SP team\u2019s capacity to manage these projects, as required. Many of the special projects may spin off from RP after incubation \u2014 Special Projects staff may be well-suited to join these (or perhaps even help lead them), which will help ensure the operational success of the projects after the spinoff.&nbsp;</p><p>Roles on this team would liaise between the RP Core Operations and General Longtermism teams and with the staff of each special project.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read about the current SP team members&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/team#Special\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the Special Projects program launched, we\u2019ve achieved the following:</p><ul><li>Supported the launch of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epochai.org/\"><u>Epoch</u></a>, an AI research organization, and are now providing them with ongoing fiscal sponsorship</li><li>Organized LAISR, an AI strategy retreat&nbsp;</li><li>Supported&nbsp;<a href=\"https://condor.camp/\"><u>Condor Camp</u></a>, an EA outreach program in Brazil/Latin America</li><li>Supported the launch of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eapathfinder.org/\"><u>EA Pathfinder</u></a>, an EA outreach and advice program for mid-career professionals</li></ul><p>In addition to the above, we\u2019re looking to potentially launch highly-scalable longtermism projects related to civilizational resilience and biosecurity.</p><h2>Key Responsibilities</h2><h3>Special Projects Associate</h3><p>Special Projects Associates serve as liaisons between their projects and RP Core Operations, completing operations tasks for their projects and helping ensure their operational success. Each Associate will manage a portfolio of 2-4 special projects and assist in the planning process for future projects.

One section of GiveWell\u2019s cost effectiveness model is dedicated to \u201csupplementary adjustments\u201d</strong></p><p>Supplementary adjustments refer to considerations which GiveWell considers to be potentially relevant, but which are not rigorously modelled.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples include the possibility that malaria nets might prevent stillbirths, that mass deworming could lead to drug resistance, or that seasonal malaria chemoprevention could have side effects.</p><p>The full list of \u201cout of model\u201d supplementary adjustments is provided in Appendix 1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. GiveWell\u2019s priors are (implicitly) that the effect size of each adjustment is zero</strong></p><p><br>GiveWell\u2019s methodology for unmodelled supplementary adjustments is described below.

A prior of zero is not sceptical and uncertainty-averse if applied to negative adjustments</strong></p><ul><li>If the adjustment is positive, the prior that the adjustment is zero is consistent with GiveWell\u2019s usual sceptical approach.<ul><li>For example, one of the adjustments is for the possibility that deworming could have benefits relating to HIV</li><li>Applying a prior of zero is appropriate here \u2013 our default or \u201cprior\u201d assumption on this should not be that tackling worms reduces the risk of HIV, it\u2019s only something we should believe with sufficient evidence.</li></ul></li><li>This is no longer true if the adjustment is negative (a downside of the intervention)<ul><li>In this case, choosing a prior of zero is actually&nbsp;<i>favourable</i> to the charity\u2019s intervention; this is inconsistent with GiveWell\u2019s usual sceptical prior.</li><li>For example, defaulting to a prior of zero impact means that GiveWell\u2019s default/prior position is that:<ul><li>in the absence of deworming programmes, people would never receive deworming pills (e.g. by going and getting them themselves); or&nbsp;</li><li>mass deworming has zero chance of leading to drug resistance; or&nbsp;</li><li>there is zero chance that there would be negative effects from decreased immunity when people are protected from malaria.</li></ul></li><li>We do not believe that any of the above statements are reasonable priors.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2b. We recommend investing more effort in modelling some of the adjustments</strong></p><p>In order to improve on this approach, we believe that one of the two following approaches is legitimate:</p><ol><li>Use a prior which is better justified than a prior of zero, in particular avoiding the scenario where an unjustified prior tends to&nbsp;<i>reward</i> higher uncertainty adjustments</li><li>Invest more effort in determining the estimate of the adjustment</li></ol><p>Given that it\u2019s hard to come up with a suitable prior without investing more effort in determining the size of the adjustment (i.e. it\u2019s hard to do the first without doing the second), we recommend the second approach.</p><p>Step 1 is to narrow down the list of adjustments \u2013 the full list has more than 60 items (see Appendix 1). Doing more detailed analysis on all of these would be excessive.</p><p>Here are some criteria for narrowing down the list:</p><ul><li>Adjustments where the sign is positive are arguably covered adequately by the current method: the prior is more suitable as outlined above.</li><li>There are 18 adjustments where the sign is negative.</li><li>Of those, 11 adjustments have a magnitude of \u2265 10% (i.e. are \u2264 -10%), and of those, 9 have magnitudes exactly equal to -10%, according to GiveWell\u2019s raw \u201crough best guess of effect size\u201d (listed below).</li></ul><p>Hence it seems that, at the least, it would be suitable for GiveWell to invest more effort into the two adjustments with the largest magnitude of raw \u201crough best guess of effect size\u201d, which are:</p><ul><li>Unprogrammed deworming: -35%</li><li>Crowding out of New Incentives: -25%</li></ul><p>It may further be justifiable to invest effort into all of the 11 items listed below.</p><p><i><strong>Table 1: List of adjustments where the effect is negative</strong></i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.7421872500000001pt solid

This could be self-administered (the beneficiary \u2013 or their family \u2013 purchases deworming tablets themselves).

The fact that we haven\u2019t identified areas of improvement for other charities doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we fully endorse the adjustment size in each case, but may be more a reflection of our time constraints, as set out in Appendix 2.</p><p>As well as specific details about SCI and GiveDirectly outlined below, we also argue that GiveWell could be more sophisticated about the size of the adjustment, rather than always using an adjustment of 5%. This would involve considering the specific circumstances of the organisation being modelled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) SCI Foundation does a package of interventions, not just Mass Drug Administration (MDA</strong>)</p><p>SCI is seeking to grow its work in areas which will enable it to support the WHO goal of elimination of schistosomiasis and other parasitic infections.&nbsp;</p><p>The work of conducting Mass Drug Administrations (MDA) \u2013 what many in the EA community think of as deworming \u2013 is typically associated with control of worms.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside continuing to support MDA, SCI is increasingly focusing on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://schistosomiasiscontrolinitiative.org/eliminating-ntds/\"><u>series of cross-cutting approaches</u></a> to help it move from just controlling NTDs to eliminating them, in line with WHO goals. Such approaches include:</p><ul><li>environmental and behaviour-change interventions to support safe water contact (including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://schistosomiasiscontrolinitiative.org/eliminating-ntds/wash\"><u>WASH</u></a>-related interventions);&nbsp;</li><li>morbidity management and prevention for groups not reached by traditional mass drug administration programmes, such as women at risk of female genital schistosomiasis; and</li><li>veterinary public health interventions to address human-animal disease transmission (a One Health perspective).</li></ul><p>The cross-cutting interventions intended to achieve elimination are typically not the MDA intervention modelled by GiveWell.</p><p><strong>(2 &amp; 3)There is a risk that donations to SCI could \u201cfunge\u201d, but GiveWell models this as having zero chance of occurring</strong></p><p>GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness model already acknowledges the possibility of \u201cfunging\u201d, or what is sometimes also called \u201cillusory restrictedness\u201d. This refers to the fact that a donation to a charity intended for one activity (e.g. MDA to deworm children) might free up funds, with the end result that the charity is enabled to do something else (e.g. WASH work, or another intervention).</p><p>This is accounted for in a row in the GiveWell model called \u201cWithin-org fungibility\u201d. In the case of SCI Foundation, this is set to zero, and justified in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=1346718756&amp;range=A58\"><u>comment</u></a> with the words \u201cNot applicable: single program organization.\u201d</p><p>As noted above, SCI today does things other than MDA.</p><p>Furthermore, as SCI increasingly moves towards the goals set by the WHO, it is possible that interventions other than MDA may grow more quickly than their MDA work. Note that the at-the-margin impact of a donation may at times be more governed by where an organisation is directing more resources to at the margin. This means that even if MDA remains a large portion of what SCI does (and we expect this to be the case), the at-the-margin impact of a donation may be more likely to fund a small but growing part of the organisation's work.</p><p>In light of this, we believe that a within-org fungibility adjustment of 0% is almost certainly too low.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(4) We don\u2019t have the data needed to determine a within-org fungibility adjustment. We think the correct number is in the range 1%-100%, and our placeholder figure is 10%&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As can be seen in Appendix 2, GiveWell typically uses a fungibility adjustment of 5% if it thinks there is any fungibility risk, or 0% for an organisation which does just one thing.</p><p>As outlined above, we believe that this is relatively unsophisticated and doesn\u2019t capture organisation-specific circumstances.</p><p>We will now expand on how we might incorporate these considerations more carefully for SCI.</p><p>The expected extent of funging depends on:</p><ul><li>SCI\u2019s planned spend on MDA</li><li>The extent to which donations are restricted to MDA</li><li>SCI\u2019s planned spend on non-MDA activities</li><li>The extent to which donations are restricted to non-MDA activities</li><li>The proportion of income which is unrestricted</li></ul><p>The last of these items (proportion unrestricted) is both relatively easy to monitor and a fairly material driver.</p><p>It appears that the proportion of income which is unrestricted has been fairly high in recent years</p><ul><li>c50% in 2020-21 and c75% in 2021-22</li></ul><p>It is complex to forecast how this will evolve in the coming years</p><ul><li>In the future, we expect there to still be donations to SCI directly from GiveWell, and some donations from individuals who follow GiveWell\u2019s donations. However we expect the latter category to decline substantially, largely because of GiveWell\u2019s decision to no longer categorise SCI as a Top Charity. The latter is also more likely to be unrestricted.</li><li>Furthermore a material proportion of historic donations have been from GiveWell, and if GiveWell both restricts donations to deworming and encourages other donors to restrict to deworming, this would reduce the proportion of income which is unrestricted.</li><li>To the extent that the unrestricted proportion remains high, this tends towards a high probability of funging.</li></ul><p>The amount of donations received by SCI for MDA may decline as a result of them no longer being a GiveWell Top Charity, and organisations typically want to maintain their existing programmes and not see them decline or shut down.</p><ul><li>This may lead to the amount of donations which are restricted to MDA being low compared to SCI\u2019s planned/intended spend on MDA.</li><li>This would lead to a low probability of funging.</li></ul><p>We can imagine some scenarios under which the adjustment should be close to 100% (because the money would almost certainly go to non-MDA work) and others in which the adjustment should be close to 1% (because the money would almost certainly go to MDA work).</p><p>Given this wide range of uncertainty, it\u2019s hard to select a specific figure that GiveWell should use, and our most confident recommendation is that GiveWell should consider the factors outlined in the appendix and use those to form a view on the within-org fungibility adjustment.&nbsp;</p><p>However if pressed to select a value, we would choose the geometric mean of the upper and lower bounds, which comes to 10%.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that implicit in this modelling is the assumption that the non-MDA interventions have zero value. This is consistent with the GiveWell approach of having sceptical priors. As part of this review, we have not investigated whether SCI\u2019s work on non-MDA interventions such as WASH may, in fact, be high impact. If it were believed that this were the case, this should be reflected within the model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(5) Using a 10% within-org fungibility figure leads to a 13% decline in cost effectiveness, from 13.5x cash to 11.7x cash</strong></p><p>We determined this estimate of a 13% decline in cost effectiveness by taking a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SruChi2nuGEQfzMA5toUW_QTurR6HbjivKb2WEWwWIA/edit#gid=1960372681\"><u>copy</u></a> of GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness model and changing the \u201cwithin-org fungibility\u201d figure in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SruChi2nuGEQfzMA5toUW_QTurR6HbjivKb2WEWwWIA/edit#gid=1346718756&amp;range=58:58\"><u>relevant row</u></a> in the model.

The increase in utility is a less big increase because:<ul><li>the model assumes that consumption is 3% higher at t=2 (see the assumption of g=3% above)</li><li>The model assumes diminishing marginal returns on utility (indeed this is built into the structure of the isoelastic utility function, and is governed by the value of \u03b7)</li></ul></li></ul><p>The more common approach (the Ramsey model) would lead to 4.77%:</p><ul><li>The Ramsey model is an equilibrium approach which assumes that an optimisation problem has already been solved</li><li>The derivation is fairly lengthy, and involves comparing the welfare-preserving rate of return on savings with the rate at which society is willing to swap consumption today with future consumption.

In order not to interrupt the flow of this document, this argument is expanded upon in Appendix 4.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(6) GiveWell should consider the amount of uncertainty in their discount rates and consider whether declining discount rate considerations apply</strong></p><p>Imagine that there is uncertainty about the correct choice of discount rate.

The essay uses the tools of theoretical economics to contribute to the AI alignment problem.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psychologists are familiar with the notion of cognitive dissonance, the discomfort when a person\u2019s behavior conflicts with that person\u2019s beliefs and preferences. Cognitive dissonance is accompanied with seemingly irrational behavior such as motivated reasoning and self-deception. It is basically an example of misalignment: decisions are not aligned with values. In that sense, perhaps cognitive dissonance can shed some light on the AI-alignment problem (Bostrom, 2014): how to create safe artificial intelligence that does things that we (creators, humans, sentient beings) really want? How can the decisions of AI-machines become aligned with our values and preferences? Even a small misalignment between our values and the goals of superintelligent machines (that are more intelligent and hence powerful than us) could cause very serious problems. And we will never be intelligent enough to solve those problems once the misaligned machines are more intelligent than us.</p><p>Computer scientists who study the AI-alignment problem speak a different language than psychologists who study cognitive dissonance. But new studies in behavioral economics, especially some new theoretical models about cognitive dissonance (Hestermann, Le Yaouanq &amp; Treich, 2020), can perhaps bridge this gap between computer scientists and psychologists. The language of economists, when they speak of e.g. utility functions, optimization, expected value maximization, game-theoretic strategic behavior and Bayesian updating, is closer to the language of computer scientists who develop AI.&nbsp;</p><p>The cognitive dissonance models in behavioral economics are well illustrated by the meat paradox (Hestermann, Le Yaouanq &amp; Treich, 2020): many people are animal-loving meat eaters, and their high levels of meat consumption are not aligned with their concern for animal welfare. They do not want to cause unnecessary animal suffering, but they know that meat consumption involves unnecessary suffering when there are alternatives (e.g. plant-based meat) that cause less or no suffering. When those people do not switch to a meat-free diet, they start rationalizing their meat consumption, denying a mind to farm animals (Bastian e.a. 2012), derogating vegetarians (Minson &amp; Monin, 2012) and actively avoiding information from animal farming and slaughterhouses. This example of cognitive dissonance, known as the meat paradox (Loughnan &amp; Davies, 2019), is striking, because it shows that such dissonance can have large scale consequences: billions of animals are killed every year.</p><p>The basic model of the meat paradox starts with a utility function: a person values meat consumption, animal welfare and reliable knowledge. These values or preferences are variables in the utility function. The animal welfare preference in the utility function depends on the subjective belief or estimate of the level of farm animal suffering. And this belief depends on the received information about how farm animals are treated and what their mental capacities are.</p><p>The model has an intrapersonal game-theoretic framework. A person is modelled by having two selves. The first self receives external information about the welfare of farm animals used for meat production (for example information about the treatment of farm animals or their mental capacities to experience suffering). That first self can decide to transmit that information reliably (truthfully) or wrongly (deceptively) to the second self, who will use that transmitted information to form a belief about animal suffering and consequently makes the decision how much meat to buy. Hence, the first self chooses the information to send at time T1, the second self makes the consumption decision at a later time T2.</p><p>The crucial assumption is that the first self incorporates the utility function of the second self, i.e. they both value the same things. The utility functions of the two selves are fully aligned: the first self internalizes the utility of the second self, including the beliefs of the second self. Hence, the utility of the first self, and especially the term that contains the preference for animal welfare, is not based on the true value of animal welfare (the true, external information received by the first self), but on the believed value (believed by the second self and based on the transmitted information from the first self). &nbsp;</p><p>Suppose the external information about animal welfare is bad news, i.e. the farm animals experience too much suffering. If the first self reliably transmits this information to the second self, and animal welfare is part of that person\u2019s utility function, the second self may decide not to buy meat. The first self does not like that outcome (as she values meat consumption). So the first self can decide to deceive the second self by transmitting a good news message that the farm animal welfare is fine. This self-deception comes at a cost, however, as reliable knowledge is also part of the person\u2019s utility function. Self-deception has a cost, a negative term in the utility function.&nbsp;</p><p>Both selves start an interaction and play a strategic game. The two selves are strategic rational agents who perform Bayesian updating. The second self considers the possibility that the first self might be lying about the true state of farm animal welfare. The second self can start to distrust the first self if that first self is prone to deception. The first self knows that the second self may distrust her and adapts her decisions accordingly. When receiving bad news, the first self can strategically decide to reliably transmit this bad news to the second self, or give good news instead.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, a game-theoretic perfect Bayesian equilibrium is reached. Depending on the parameters in the utility function, such an equilibrium could consist of self-deception, where the person is information averse, i.e. is not open for information about animal suffering. Especially a person with both a high level of meat attachment (who really wants to eat animal meat) and a high concern for animal welfare (who really feels guilty when causing animal suffering) might experience a strong cognitive dissonance resulting in a high level of self-deception and information aversion. Only if the preference for reliable knowledge is strong enough (if the cost of deception is large), self-deception can be avoided.&nbsp;</p><p>This cognitive dissonance model predicts many phenomena of the meat paradox studied by psychologists. But it can also be very relevant and instructive in the study of AI-alignment, where the utility function translates into the goal function of an AI-machine. When applying this model to AI-alignment, we can give two interpretations of the model.</p><p>In the first interpretation, the first self is the AI-machine, the second self is the human. The AI does nothing more than receiving information, analyzing data and transmitting the processed information to the human. The human can ask the AI a question, the AI calculates and gives the response. That doesn\u2019t look dangerous, as the human can always decide to neglect the information received by the AI. But what if the AI is clever enough to deceive the human? Then the human can decide to do terrible things. To solve this problem, you may think it is sufficient for the AI to be aligned with the human, i.e. that the AI shares the very same utility function as the human. If the human values the truth and does not want to be told lies, why would the aligned AI tell lies? But as the cognitive dissonance model shows, even that solution is not enough. Even a well-aligned AI might deceive humans, just like humans might deceive themselves as in the case of meat consumption. What is required, is a sufficiently strong preference for realism, for reliable information, for transmitting the truth. The goal function of the AI-machine should include a term that measures the cost of deception, similar to the term in the utility function of the cognitive dissonance model. The marginal cost or disutility of deception, when the AI tells one more lie, should be sufficiently large to avoid misalignment.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps a concrete illustration of this first interpretation of AI-misalignment is the spread of disinformation on social media. Social media algorithms are very good at deciphering what human users of social media prefer and want. When they learn about human preferences, they basically incorporate the human utility functions in their newsfeed algorithms. But there is no cost for the AI to spread disinformation as long as the human users keep their trust in the social media. If the AI is smart enough, it can spread disinformation in such a way that humans still trust the AI. In the end, the human users can be confronted with disinformation and start making bad decisions based on that deception.&nbsp;</p><p>In the second interpretation, the AI-machine becomes a real agent instead of merely an information source. The AI-machine can make influential decisions that change the world. In this interpretation, the AI consists of two selves or algorithms. The first algorithm receives data from the outside world, analyses it and decides to transmit the processed information to the second algorithm who uses that information to make real world decisions. Even if both algorithms share the same utility function, and even if this is the same utility function as that of a human, misalignment can occur, just like cognitive dissonance can occur in intelligent humans. As in the first interpretation, the goal function of this AI-machine should include a term that measures the cost of deception.</p><p>So what do we learn from this analogy between the behavioral economics model of cognitive dissonance and the AI-alignment problem? First, that mere alignment in terms of equality of utility functions is not enough. Second, that the utility function of an AI-machine should contain a sufficiently large term that measures the cost of deception. And third, more generally that behavioral economics models can be useful in solving AI-misalignment problems, as these models use a language that is very similar to those of computer scientists who develop AI.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>References</p><p>Bastian, B., Loughnan, S., Haslam, N., &amp; Radke, H.

Some people think pictorially or in some other fashion, but most people, most of the time, construct their thoughts as something-like an ongoing sentence made up of words.&nbsp;</p><p>For most people, this is a really useful feature! When you want to share things with somebody, the level of 'translation' from your thoughts to language is very low. Everybody I know who struggles with verbal speech thinks in a non-verbal format (which could of course cut both ways causally).&nbsp;</p><h2>Less-verbal thought</h2><p>There are three key problems introduced by rationalism to the usual process above; jargon, the rationalist desire for intense precision, and thinking truly weird thoughts in general.</p><p>This is less specific to rationalism/EA, but many people think in words which other people don't know. Even when they try to translate their jargon into something more understandable, they underestimate the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/inferential-distance\">inferential distance</a>, or they map words poorly (where an equivalent doesn't exist in 'normal English') such that most of the meaning is lost.&nbsp;</p><p>When this is combined with the rationalist desire for extreme precision in speech and thought, it contributes to unpleasant listening and bad communication. If people can get a 1-sentence summary which means 90% the same thing as what you're thinking, this is (usually!) better than people getting an hour-long lecture on your specific subdomain of AI alignment just to understand a peripheral point. It's ok if people don't know your precise epistemics for a passing comment. No really, I promise.</p><p>This is worsened further by the fact that a key recommendation for rationalists is 'thinking weird thoughts'. Rationality often involves inspecting the terms you're using, defining them as narrowly as possible, and trying to <i>actually use them in this way</i>. This is good for thought, but bad for communication. If you're planning to use a word a lot, or if your definition varies a lot from the standard one, it's worth defining it-- but track this actively! Some of the time it's ok to be misunderstood a little to avoid being unlistened to a lot.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/average_familiarity.png\" srcset=\"//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/average_familiarity_2x.png 2x\"><figcaption>There's <i>always</i> <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2501/\">a relevant XKCD</a></figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Remember to interpret</h2><p>So, if you're a rationalist who thinks very strange thoughts and/or has invented a whole buch of concepts for which only you have verbal handles, remember to translate your thoughts back into English before saying them aloud. Similarly, if you seem to be miscommunicating about something important, try interpreting <i>again</i> into something closer to your true thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a worked example (which is by its nature hard to give, because the 'less-verbal' thought necessarily has to be verbalised to be written down):</p><p><strong>Precise, but lengthy: </strong><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00952998209002608\">Benzodiazepines</a> are [<i>unlikely to cause physiological withdrawal symptoms if stopped appropriately, compared to other drugs</i>] but probably [<i>cause people to narrow the level of anxiety they find tolerable] </i>and<i> [cause them to become less accustomed to using other coping mechanisms, such that people are practically worse off for a period after stopping benzodiazepines</i>], and this is <i>[likely a major contributor to the creation of guidelines which encourage doctors to limit the length of a course of benzodiazepines</i>].</p><p><strong>Less precise, but easier to read:</strong> Benzodiazepines are not very <i>physiologically </i>addictive (withdrawal symptoms are rare), but may be psychologically addictive (people get used to how they feel), and this is why doctors don't like to prescribe benzodiazepines.</p><p><strong>Imprecise and very brief</strong>: Benzodiazepines are not very physiologically addictive, but may be psychologically addictive, so doctors try to limit their use.</p><p>Note I'm not claiming any of these is superior to the others! Each of these has its place, depending on audience and importance. The first one is closest to my thoughts, and is represented in a much more concise way inside of my brain such that it's hard to notice how compressed it is until I attempt to verbalise it. The square brackets in the first example are each roughly a single thing I can point at in my head easily, but which I doubt are that for most readers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All speech sits along an axis of thought-like-ness (thoughtiness?). Most of the time, thought-like-ness is a secondary concern to speed and immediate clarity, but not always.&nbsp;</p><p>Actively tracking thought-like-ness, or having it come to mind when you find yourself confused about a disagreement or find yourself being misunderstood, may be a useful skill to improve your ability to communicate well with a wide variety of audiences.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "brook"}}, {"_id": "XvgS6baCNTp8Mu6Rv", "title": "How Important is \"Getting Out the Vote?\"", "postedAt": "2022-11-01T09:53:41.958Z", "htmlBody": "<p>One of the first things I learned about as a political science student was the \"paradox of voting,\" which is simply the observation that the cost associated with voting (i.e., the opportunity cost of taking the time to vote) outweighs the expected benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>While the outcome of a political race may be highly consequential, it is extremely unlikely that you will have any impact on that outcome. The reason for this is that unless your vote is&nbsp;<i>decisive</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>it has no effect on who wins<i>.</i> And in an election where millions of people are casting ballots\u2014as is typical in a high-stakes election\u2014the odds of your vote being decisive are extraordinarily low.</p><p>Even though I have some minor issues with the above argument, I still believed that the core of the argument was correct. In other words, in cost-benefit terms, I thought it was probably true that the cost of voting exceeds the expected benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>However, once I actually tried to calculate the expected value of a single vote, I changed my mind entirely. In fact, according to the cost-benefit model, I\u2019m now convinced that the so-called \u201cparadox\u201d of voting isn\u2019t a paradox at all. This is because I now believe that, in most elections, the expected benefit from voting&nbsp;<i>far exceeds&nbsp;</i>the associated cost<i>.&nbsp;</i></p><p>How can this be? Let's look at a hypothetical two-way election to sketch out the argument:</p><p>Assume two candidates are running for president. Because politicians are&nbsp;<i>not </i>all the same, let's assume that Candidate A is more desirable than Candidate B. Why? Well, with Candidate A in office instead of Candidate B, the $4 trillion national budget will be 10% better every year for 4 years.&nbsp; As such, the expected value of Candidate A defeating Candidate B is $1.6 trillion.</p><p>Of course, in reality the president affects far more than just the national budget. The president also significantly shapes the social fabric, the foreign policy landscape, and many other important things. However, for my argument, I will just stick to national budget effects because\u2014at least relatively speaking\u2014they are easiest to quantify.</p><p>Assume that 150 million people are expected to vote in this election. Also assume that the election will be close, probably within the range of 5 percentage points. A plausible final tally would be 78 million votes for the winner and 72 million for the loser. Of course, it could also be much closer, with the winner earning only a couple thousand more votes than the loser.</p><p>But what are the odds that this election is decided by a&nbsp;<i>single</i> vote? Alas, my math skills are not good enough to precisely answer this question. But if we assume that the election will be decided by at most 8 million votes, then I'll assume the odds that the election is decided by a single vote are roughly 1 in 8 million.</p><p>Now that we have everything we need to calculate expected value, let's calculate it. Fortunately, my math skills&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>good enough to make this calculation: $1.6 trillion divided by 8 million =&nbsp;<strong>$200,000</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you shocked at how high the expected value is? I certainly was. But even if you were to assume (which I don't) that this figure is off by an order of magnitude, a single vote would still be worth $20,000. Even if it were off by&nbsp;<i>two</i> orders of magnitude, a vote would still be worth $2,000. Before doing any math, I would have guessed a single vote was worth around $50. Turns out I was off by a factor of 400.</p><p>When I saw these numbers, I immediately thought a few things. First, I should&nbsp;<i>definitely</i> vote this election cycle. Secondly, I should&nbsp;<i>definitely</i> remind all of my friends to vote. Hell, I should&nbsp;<i>definitely</i> canvass for a close Senate race to get out as many people to vote as possible.</p><p>If I assumed that every 20 hours of helping to \"get out the vote\" would convince 1 person to vote who would not have otherwise, what would be the expected value of an hour of my work? The answer:&nbsp;<strong>$10,000</strong>! That's a pretty extraordinary use of my time. Again, even if I assumed that my calculation was off by two orders of magnitude, each hour would still be worth $100. That's still more valuable than probably &gt;99% of my hours.</p><p>Of course, I sketched out an extremely broad argument here. But I don't think it's unreasonable to say that most of its logic applies to the upcoming US midterm elections, which will (probably) be close and highly consequential.</p><p>Does this mean that everyone should stop everything they're doing right now and work for a campaign? Probably not, although I hope at least some people do this! So what should you do? Well, you should definitely vote. And you should probably encourage all of your friends to vote. And you should possibly encourage as many people as you reasonably can to vote.</p><p>P.S. A caveat to this argument is that you should not merely encourage people to vote, but encourage people to vote&nbsp;<i>for the better choice</i>. Fortunately, in the upcoming election, I don't think it's especially hard to discern the better choice.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Ceteris Paribus"}}, {"_id": "hycChZFhDQjcGcLXD", "title": "Should AI focus on problem-solving or strategic planning?

The program ended up being ten weeks long and included an optional final project. It incorporated office hours, discussion sections, speaker events, conceptual readings, paper readings, written assignments, and programming assignments. You can see our full curriculum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jKAeq6Sm9HTuA8N3545fZrhTxIw-gFYa4tBmNZPJAXE/edit#heading=h.5ww50cowac9h\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h2><strong>Survey Results</strong></h2><p>All MLSS graduates filled out an anonymous survey. What follows is a mostly visual depiction of the program through the lens of these survey results.</p><h3><strong>Overall Experience in MLSS</strong><br>&nbsp;</h3><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/ad3xtfoytxk7y63cq9l0.png\"></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/yi0kk7vvl8q2ooa04ofw.png\"></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/wojwwyc0r62o8qdtjruz.png\"></p><p><i><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/uhczyxgznqaefvvqwrkk.png\"></i></p><p>Of course, this sample is biased towards graduates of MLSS, since we required them to complete the survey to receive their final stipends (and non graduates didn\u2019t get final stipends). However, it seems clear from the way that people responded to this survey that the majority had quite positive opinions of our program.</p><p><strong>We also asked students about their future plans:</strong></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/gz2e2cifp3oicpzp5qf2.png\"></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/q7mrllzn3hzf3th5ljgx.png\"></p><p>The results suggest that many students are actively trying to work in AI safety and that their participation in MLSS helped them become more confident in that choice. MLSS did decrease some students\u2019 desire to research AI safety. We do not think this is necessarily a bad thing, as many students were using MLSS to test fit; presumably, some are not great fits for AI safety research but might be able to contribute in some other way.</p><p><strong>We asked students about why they chose to do the program:</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/ryhysqischrlyrqweaxe.png\"></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/xzgnl99cljxb31jcughj.png\"></p><p>We conclude that the stipend was extremely useful to students, and allowed many students to complete the program who wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been able to. Nearly all graduates said they were interested in learning about ML safety in particular.</p><p><strong>We asked students about the quality of the support from their TAs:</strong></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/wqnncbna2xpmz06iccfb.png\"></p><p><strong>We asked students a few questions about what they thought about AI x-risk:</strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/kt7xpzmgm1udaqalwpvu.png\"></strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/mnj8wxutxun7tlkqyxhk.png\"></strong></p><p><strong>Lastly, we asked how many hours students spent in the course:</strong></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/tkfpyqzrjnwmloumxqby.png\"></p><h3><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h3><p>To a large extent, we think these results speak for themselves. Students said they got a lot out of MLSS, and I believe many of them are very interested in pursuing AI safety careers that have been accelerated by the program.&nbsp; The real test of our program, of course, will come when we survey students in the future to see what they are doing and how the course helped them. We plan to do this in the spring.</p><h1><strong>Full Report</strong></h1><p>This full report contains my full analysis of MLSS, including strengths and areas of improvement.</p><h2><strong>About our students</strong></h2><p>Here is some information on our&nbsp;<i>graduates</i>:</p><ul><li>Many different schools: Georgia Institute of Technology (6), UC Berkeley (5), Stanford (3), Yale (3) Australian National University (2), MIT (2), NYU Abu Dhabi (2), UCLA (2), UCL (2), University of Toronto (2), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (2), Brown (1), Columbia (1), Dublin City University (1), IIT Delhi (1), Institut Teknologi Bandung (1), London School of Economics (1), Lousiana State University (1), McGill (1), McMaster (1), NUS (1), Oxford Brookes (1), Pitzer (1), Reed (1), Trinity College Dublin (1), TU Delft (1), UC Davis (1), UC Irvine (1), UCSD (1), University of Bristol (1), Cambridge (1), University of Copenhagen (1), University of Michigan (1), Oxford (1), University of Queensland (1), University of Rochester (1), UT-Austin (1), University of Waterloo (1), University of Zagreb (1), UW-Madison (1)</li><li>Many different countries: USA (32), UK (8), Canada (5), Australia (3), Netherlands (2), Ireland (2), India (2), Singapore (2), Croatia (1), Denmark (1), Estonia (1), Indonesia (1), Turkey (1), UAE (1)</li><li>Class year breakdown (the class year the students are currently in as of Fall 2022)<ul><li>First year undergraduate: 18%</li><li>Second year undergraduate: 32%</li><li>Third year undergraduate: 21%</li><li>Fourth year undergraduate: 15%</li><li>Already completed undergraduate: 15%</li></ul></li><li>Gender breakdown<ul><li>Man: 78%</li><li>Woman: 19%</li><li>Nonbinary/other: 3%</li></ul></li><li>66% had previously read a book on AI safety.</li><li>29% had previously completed AGI Safety Fundamentals or a similar reading group.</li><li>48% had previously taken an online ML course</li><li>34% had previously taken an ML/DL course in their university</li><li>26% had previously done ML in a job.</li><li>90% had previously had some interaction with EA or AI safety.</li></ul><h2><strong>Anonymous graduation survey</strong></h2><p>At the end of the program, we administered an anonymous survey to all graduates. We also made them say in another (non-anonymous) survey that they had completed the anonymous survey. Completion of the non-anonymous survey was required in order for students to receive their stipend. As a result, we successfully achieved a 100% response rate for our anonymous survey. All survey data in this report is based on this anonymous survey.</p><h2><strong>Overview of the Curriculum</strong></h2><p>You can also view the final curriculum we used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jKAeq6Sm9HTuA8N3545fZrhTxIw-gFYa4tBmNZPJAXE/edit#heading=h.4i9yvu3tvmd1\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>MLSS was split into four main sections:</p><ul><li>Machine learning (weeks 1-2)</li><li>Deep learning (weeks 3-5)</li><li>Introduction to ML Safety (week 6-8)</li><li>Final Project (originally week 9, ended up being week 9-10)</li></ul><p>The final project was optional, but students who didn\u2019t choose to complete their final project received a stipend that was $500 lower.</p><p>The following graphs show survey data on student opinions of each component:</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/hd95bywehead3dfgb8zp.png\"></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995948/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/pnsj9eupf5rq6hrtjyx7.png\"></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995948/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/baynuetup5cu4awhzt4n.png\"></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995948/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/w8vkhxhr1urufvtosjhi.png\"></p><h2><strong>Components of MLSS</strong></h2><p>MLSS included many moving parts, which I\u2019ll detail here.</p><h3><strong>TA office hours</strong></h3><p>Each TA had two office hours every week, for a total of 16 office hours per week. Students could attend any office hours they wanted. We spaced out office hours so there were roughly a proportionate number of office hours in each timezone region. That meant that we had office hours at all times of day, but they were concentrated in the daytime for the Americas.</p><p>Most students attended office hours, and found them useful:</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/uisq7jajoxutf4ccka3q.png\"></p><p>Most office hours were well-attended, although sometimes office hours had too many students, or not very many, depending on the time of week and day.</p><h3><strong>Discussion Sections</strong></h3><p>Each week, we had three one hour discussion sections. Students were required to attend at least one. We didn\u2019t have enough TAs to facilitate small group discussions, so we had TAs run the overall meeting and put students into breakout rooms, and then go between the breakout rooms. We don\u2019t think that the discussion sections went that well, and that they really needed to be facilitated. Though some students said they got a lot from discussion sections, others reported that other students often had their cameras and videos off in the breakout sessions, so they couldn\u2019t talk to anyone. In the future, we will only do discussion sections if we have a designated facilitator for them.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/fceh2cdfyj9zwdxlup8r.png\"></p><h3><strong>Speaker Events</strong></h3><p>We held speaker events and Q&amp;As throughout the program. Specifically, we had events with Joseph Carlsmith, Victoria Krakovna, David Krueger, Dan Hendrycks, Sam Bowman, Alex Lawsen, and Holden Karnofsky. Most events were attended by 15-20 students. Overall, most students attended at least one speaker event, and found them fairly helpful. In general, I thought that students asked very good questions.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/lghmenlyfcwr1bybusuf.png\"></p><h3><strong>Conceptual readings</strong></h3><p>We gave students conceptual readings every week, to be discussed in their discussions. By \u201cconceptual,\u201d we don\u2019t mean particular conceptual research agendas, but rather broader readings like Joseph Carlsmith\u2019s&nbsp;<i>Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk</i>? I thought the readings were quite important, since the online courses, focused as they are on ML, do not give the same foundation. Students mostly liked them.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/wfuibpogvobxacrx7jw9.png\"></p><h3><strong>Paper readings</strong></h3><p>Paper readings were introduced partway through the course on the suggestion of Dan Hendrycks. Students read papers (initially ML papers, later safety specific papers) and had to summarize and give a non-trivial strength and weakness of each paper. Students overwhelmingly liked paper readings, with many mentioning them specifically in freeform responses.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995948/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/v558dijxyarndimuvnib.png\"></p><h3><strong>Written Assignments</strong></h3><p>We assigned students a number of written assignments throughout the course. First, we required students to respond to paper readings, and we also had designated written assignments for the ML safety portion of the course. We think these assignments were important for accountability.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/rfgzecc7zvyed9cno3bk.png\"></p><h3><strong>Piazza</strong></h3><p>We used the Piazza question-answering platform to allow students to ask written questions outside of office hours. I assigned one TA each week to be in charge of answering these questions. I think this was a useful thing to do, but it certainly is no substitute for office hours and more involved questions are difficult to answer.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/iy0yzmnl1gx7rdhlw4js.png\"></p><h3><strong>Programming assignments</strong></h3><p>All three portions of the course included programming assignments. These were meant to ensure students had a solid foundation in the concepts (it is one thing to think you understand something, and another to know how to implement it). Students found these assignments quite challenging, but overwhelmingly found them useful. There were some bugs in some of the programming assignments, which led to some people not liking them, but we hope to fix these in a future iteration.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/vnspwcgnl7zf2bkef0lz.png\"></p><h2><strong>Goals of MLSS</strong></h2><p>The MLSS courses are all online (Introduction to ML Safety was not made for MLSS, and would have been released anyway). That means that anyone who wants to can self-study the course. In addition, people can apply to the long-term future fund or other funding sources for their self-studying. As such, MLSS needed to provide a value add over these existing programs.</p><h3><strong>Help students understand the importance of AI safety</strong></h3><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>In my view, it\u2019s easy for students to be told of the importance of AI safety but not be given dedicated time to really think through various arguments that have been made. By requiring students to engage with AI safety conceptual and technical materials, and respond to them critically, we hoped to provide students with a more grounded understanding.</p><p><strong>What went well&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Students were very engaged with the AI safety content, and rated the Introduction to ML Safety course highly. In addition, 44 out of 63 graduates said MLSS made them think AI safety was a more important problem, while only 1 said it made them think it was less important.</p><p><strong>Areas for improvement</strong></p><p>I think we could have included more counterarguments to AI risk arguments. For instance, I would now include Katja Grace\u2019s counterarguments if I were running this today.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Give students technical fluency in machine learning and deep learning</strong></h3><p><strong>Description&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Knowledge of deep learning is important for all kinds of AI safety research (in my view, this includes conceptual research). By giving students time to understand deep learning concepts, we hoped to provide them with this knowledge.</p><p><strong>What went well</strong></p><p>Students rated the deep learning portion of the course highly, with 62% rating it \u201cvery useful.\u201d They by and large completed the assignments, and from anecdotes it seems like students learned a lot in these areas. Students mostly also did well on a final exam we administered. Lastly, students especially liked that they were assigned published papers to read, with many noting that it made them feel much more confident and less intimidated to read papers.</p><p><strong>Areas for improvement</strong></p><p>The deep learning content was too fast paced, whereas the machine learning content was less useful for people. In the future, I would recommend cutting out the machine learning portion and lengthening the amount of time allotted for the deep learning portion.</p><h3><strong>Help students understand the latest topics in ML-focused AI Safety research</strong></h3><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>There is a lot of research that goes on in machine learning safety. We hoped to give students an overview of this research and equip them with the tools to stay up to date with it on their own.</p><p><strong>What went well</strong></p><p>Students liked the ML safety portion of the course and rated it as useful. In addition, their exam results and reading responses suggest that they had some grasp of the material.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Areas for improvement</strong></p><p>The difficulty of the deep learning content meant that people spent less time on the ML safety component than we had hoped (we estimate that students spent about 2 weeks, rather than the 3 we intended). We would dedicate more time to ML safety in the future.</p><h3><strong>Provide students accountability to do what they set out to do</strong></h3><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>It\u2019s very difficult to stay accountable while self-studying. By giving students structure and checking if they completed their work, we make it much easier to stay on track and accomplish what you set out to accomplish.</p><p><strong>What went well</strong></p><p>47% of students reported spending more than 30 hours per week on MLSS, and 78% spent more than 20 hours per week. This indicates that students were sufficiently motivated to spend a significant portion of their time doing the necessary work for the program. We also anecdotally had several students tell us that MLSS provided accountability for them.</p><p><strong>Areas for improvement</strong></p><p>Our deadline process could have been improved (see below). In addition, we had a significant number of students (40%) not complete the course (more on this below).</p><h3><strong>Streamline access to funding</strong></h3><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>Many students can\u2019t spend their summer self-studying ML without any kind of income source. It\u2019s possible to apply for funding, but many people are intimidated by this. In addition, many funders don\u2019t have the same level of monitoring of grant recipients as we do in MLSS, so they might be more wary of giving grants to people who don\u2019t have a track record. During MLSS, we ensured students completed all assignments before dispensing grants.</p><p><strong>What went well</strong></p><p>We thought this went quite well. We had aimed for a program that could support people who didn\u2019t have the financial means to go without any income source, while avoiding having many students who were mainly motivated by money. When we asked, most of our graduates said that they wouldn\u2019t have done MLSS without the stipend, indicating that the stipend&nbsp; made MLSS significantly more accessible to people.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/q2e8cbupfdojvl22vxui.png\"></p><p><strong>Areas for improvement</strong></p><p>There were five students who said they were&nbsp;<i>mainly</i> motivated by the stipend in their decision to do MLSS, but we think this is a small price to pay for being able to graduate 30+ students who were motivated but otherwise couldn\u2019t have done the program. In addition, it appeared that at least two students enrolled in the program with the intention of plagiarizing on all of the assignments and no interest in the content. Presumably these students wouldn\u2019t have done this if we hadn\u2019t included a stipend. More on plagiarism is below; needless to say, these particular students were expelled from the program and did not receive stipends.</p><h3><strong>Support from TAs</strong></h3><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>If you get stuck while self-studying, it\u2019s possible to get unstuck by consulting other online resources. But this can be a slow and demotivating process. Having designated TA office hours can help speed up the learning process.</p><p><strong>What went well</strong></p><p>I thought our TAs were very good. Students for the most part did as well. I think it was very positive that we had the number of office hours that we did, because they were pretty well utilized, and I would advise anyone doing a similar program to ensure office hours are held well.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995947/mirroredImages/pb7Q9awb5nsx3mRzk/cnllbo1yrhs7g4vs3ay6.png\"></p><p><strong>Areas for improvement</strong></p><p>Based on feedback, there are a few ways we could improve office hours. First, some students were not familiar with the concept of \u201coffice hours\u201d and thus were not sure what they were. Having a more specific description of office hours would be great. Second, sometimes students were struggling and found it difficult to get all their questions answered at office hours. In the future, I would probably have TAs have schedulable office hours in addition to open office hours, so students can directly book a block of time to talk to a TA.</p><h3><strong>Providing a more legible credential</strong></h3><p>\u201cSelf-studying\u201d is very hard to put on your resume. MLSS might be a much more legible credential, particularly among those who know about it. Even outside the community, having a formal program with a stipend and an association with the Center for AI Safety is better than no credential at all. It\u2019s relatively unclear how legible MLSS graduation will be, but maybe this post can help with that!</p><h3><strong>A community of students</strong></h3><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>Having other students available to cowork and ask questions can be pretty useful. Having other students in the program also provides a sense of community you can\u2019t get while self-studying.</p><p><strong>What went well</strong></p><p>Some students made heavy use of coworking, and the slack was pretty active. Several groups of students also worked together who hadn\u2019t known each other beforehand, indicating there was some sense of community.</p><p><strong>Areas for improvement</strong></p><p>I think we could have done more to build community; I generally prioritized other aspects of the program, and though I don\u2019t really regret that, I would like to spend more time on this in the future. We had one social at the beginning of the program that was pretty well attended, but nothing after that. It\u2019s very hard to build a virtual community!</p><h2><strong>Statistical Analyses</strong></h2><h3><strong>Grades</strong></h3><p>We performed a linear regression that attempted to predict student grades from other factors. There were no significant correlations with any of the following variables (considering only graduates):</p><ul><li>Whether the student had taken an online ML course</li><li>Whether the student had taken multivariable calculus</li><li>Whether the student had taken advanced college level math courses</li><li>Whether the student had completed AGI Safety Fundamentals or a similar reading group</li><li>The gender of the student (based on subjective evaluation, as we did not have self-reported data for all students until the completion survey)</li><li>Whether or not the student was from the USA</li><li>Various factors related to our analysis of student applications (these won\u2019t be noted here as we don\u2019t want future applicants to be able to use this to game our application)</li></ul><h3><strong>Attrition</strong></h3><p>We had attrition from the program for several reasons:</p><ul><li>Some students turned out to not have time for the program. Some of these students had thought we were exaggerating when we said the program was 40 hours per week.</li><li>Some students had family/health issues that prevented them from finishing the program.</li><li>Some students dropped out for plagiarism related reasons.</li><li>Some students dropped out of the final project because they had school or had fallen behind.</li></ul><p>In total we had 41 students drop out of the program. Below are the reasons students gave (these reasons are not mutually exclusive):</p><ul><li>Personal/family/health reasons (13)</li><li>Wanted to spend time on other things (12)</li><li>Content more difficult or time consuming than expected (8)</li><li>Student had plagiarized (8)</li><li>Didn\u2019t submit the first assignment and never communicated with us (4)</li><li>Work/school that took up time (3)</li><li>Confused due to miscommunications from staff around expectations (2)</li><li>Unspecified (6)</li></ul><p>We think much of our attrition could be solved by being more explicit about the time commitment for the program. For this iteration, we asked people \u201cAre you available 30-40 hours per week for the duration of this program?\u201d and they needed to check yes. However, in conversations many students had thought that this must be an exaggeration, and had enrolled expecting it to be less than that. For future programs, we would probably add a further disclaimer that says something like \u201cIn the last iteration, many students read this and assumed that it must be an exaggeration. But then it really did take them 30-40 hours a week. Remember that all students in this program are very strong, so you should expect it to be a challenging and time consuming program.\u201d</p><p>We ran an analysis on drop out rates from the program using the same factors we used to analyze grades. We found that women were significantly more likely to drop out of the program (odds ratio: 5.5 (80% CI: 2.6-12)). None of the other factors were significantly related to dropout rates.</p><p>To try to see why women dropped out at higher rates, we analyzed the gender breakdown of the reasons above:</p><ul><li>Personal/family/health reasons (20% of women/9% of men)</li><li>Wanted to spend time on other things (13%/8)</li><li>Content more difficult or time consuming than expected (13%/11%)</li><li>Student had plagiarized (17%/5%)</li><li>Didn\u2019t submit the first assignment and never communicated with us (3%/4%)</li><li>Work/school that took up time (3%/3%)</li><li>Confused due to miscommunications from staff around expectations (3%/1%)</li><li>Unspecified (7%/5%)</li></ul><p><br>It appeared that women more frequently dropped out due to other commitments and personal, family, or health reasons. There was also a higher incidence of (detected) plagiarism. I asked for feedback from students who dropped out of the program, and feedback was fairly similar to feedback overall. In particular, many students wished the program had a lower workload and some suggested having a lower-workload track for students with more other commitments. While we were fairly accommodating of people who needed extensions for personal reasons, I think I could have done much better at communicating that and actively offering extensions to students who needed them. I would also have been better upfront with policies around assignments. For example, we ended up allowing students to not submit two assignments, but it would have been beneficial to make this known upfront. Lastly, more individualized support, especially in the early part of the program, would go a long way to make sure everyone felt supported. In retrospect, I should have spent more time actively following up with students who were falling behind, especially women.</p><p>Additional user interviews and qualitative analysis of attrition is ongoing.</p><h3><strong>Survey Results</strong></h3><p>We also tested the following survey variables in logistic regressions on gender (this time self-reported), class year, and regional location (conditional on graduation):</p><ul><li>Completion of the final project</li><li>Said that MLSS was overall \u201cvery useful\u201d</li><li>Said that MLSS was overall \u201cvery enjoyable\u201d</li><li>Has already recommended MLSS to a friend, or 90%+ chance of doing this</li><li>Already actively taking steps towards an ML safety career, or reported 90%+ chance of doing this in the next year</li><li>Spent 30+ hours on MLSS per week</li><li>Thinks AI x-risk probability is greater than 50%</li><li>Says MLSS made them think AI safety was a more important problem</li><li>Says MLSS made them think they were a good fit for working in AI safety</li></ul><p>We only found a few significant correlations:</p><ul><li>People based in Asia were least likely to say they spent 30+ hours a week on the course, with people in Europe most likely to say this.</li><li>1st and 2nd year undergrads were significantly more likely to say MLSS made them think they were a good fit for ML safety research. Meanwhile, students based in the US were significantly less likely to say this compared with other regions.</li></ul><h2><strong>Policies</strong></h2><h3><strong>Assignments</strong></h3><p>Students were originally required to pass all of the assignments in the course. Passing typically meant 70%+, but was occasionally lower for particularly difficult assignments. Students were originally told they needed to complete all the assignments, but ultimately were required to pass all but two assignments. I made this change because there were about 6 students who probably wouldn\u2019t have graduated in time without the change. In the future, I would probably announce a similar policy upfront, so students could choose for themselves which assignments not to submit.</p><p>In cases where students didn\u2019t pass an assignment, they were given an extension and time to resubmit the assignment for a passing score. The vast majority of the time, when students resubmitted they passed.</p><h3><strong>Plagiarism</strong></h3><p>We found a suspected total of 19 students who had plagiarized on assignments. To protect the integrity of our plagiarism process, I won\u2019t publicly state how we checked for and detected plagiarism, but if you are running a similar program feel free to contact me.</p><p>I was surprised by the amount of plagiarism. I suppose I had naively assumed that people involved in EA would not be the type to plagiarize. While some of the students who plagiarized were part of the small group we admitted who didn\u2019t have a background in EA, there wasn\u2019t any significant relationship. However, it was certainly the case that people struggling more with assignments were plagiarizing more. Lastly, it is of course the case that the existence of stipends likely increased plagiarism, as there was money on the line. In my view, this is easily outweighed by the number of very high quality students who wouldn\u2019t have done MLSS without a stipend (see above).</p><p>There are a number of ways we could potentially reduce plagiarism in the future:</p><ul><li>Being clearer about our plagiarism policy upfront. At the beginning of the course, I didn\u2019t have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14XdJ2xnZxYH13K8FtR_m25nukciDoouGTfdq7XR6khg/edit\"><u>explicit, well-documented plagiarism policy</u></a> with many examples. This wasn\u2019t good. For example, I spoke with one student who genuinely didn\u2019t seem to know what plagiarism rules are for programming assignments. As such, I would highly recommend making a policy as early as possible.</li><li>A more liberal extension policy. Especially at the beginning, we were quite hesitant to give extensions except for health reasons or similar. Having explicit late days (or something of the sort) might reduce plagiarism, which usually occurs when people are submitting assignments at the last minute.</li><li>Being \u201cscarier\u201d about warning people about plagiarism upfront. Maybe if students read this report, they will think twice before plagiarizing.</li></ul><h3><strong>Deadlines</strong></h3><p>Assignments were typically due on Monday a week after their designated week ended. For example, an assignment for week 5 would be due on Monday, the first day of week 7. I did this because it\u2019s a pretty typical schedule for a class.</p><p>I had forgotten that students really, really procrastinate, especially with difficult material. Because of this, having too many things due on one day (readings, programming assignments, etc.) was very difficult for students. In university classes, even if students procrastinate on the assignment, they still have to show up to class. For an online course, giving students \u201ca week to finish the week 5 assignment\u201d means that students don\u2019t actually start week 5 at all (including lectures) until week 6, which is not what you want. I would recommend having very frequent, spaced out, assignment deadlines that are due immediately after you want students to complete the work.</p><p>Several times during the course I extended deadlines for all students because it was clear they were mostly behind. In one case, I canceled an assignment entirely.</p><h3><strong>Extensions</strong></h3><p>MLSS is very fast paced, and there was limited time in the summer for us to extend it after the original end date. As such, I was initially hesitant about giving people extensions if they didn\u2019t have good reasons (e.g. a health reason). I think this was a mistake.</p><p>Prior to the course, I didn\u2019t really consider what I would do if a student really tried but wasn\u2019t able to complete an assignment on time. In practice students ended up doing one of the following:</p><ul><li>Asking for an extension, even though our extension policy technically didn\u2019t cover these cases. We would nearly always give an extension in these cases.</li><li>Drop out of the program. It\u2019s really hard for me to know how many students dropped out of the program because they thought they wouldn\u2019t be able to get an extension, but I suspect this number is nonzero.</li><li>Plagiarism. When students feel backed into a corner, they will cheat. And students did.</li></ul><p>In the future, I would probably do something like the following:</p><ul><li>Having some amount of designated late days that students can use as they see fit, for any reason. This would dramatically reduce the stress on students, and would make it less stressful for students to ask for extensions (since they wouldn\u2019t have to).</li><li>Making it very clear that we can offer additional extensions for health, personal, family reasons.</li></ul><p>I suspect these changes would have helped more students stay in the program, particularly those more hesitant to ask for extensions. It could also have helped improve our retention of women.</p><h2><strong>Day to Day Operations</strong></h2><h3><strong>Prior to MLSS</strong></h3><p>We advertised MLSS on the EA Forum, LessWrong, EA Virtual Programs, and various EA groups. Our sense is that word of mouth significantly contributed to knowledge of MLSS, as we got some applicants who we don\u2019t think frequently read any of these sources.</p><p>We also needed to hire teaching assistants. I reached out to people in my network for this, and also on the AGI Safety Fundamentals slack. I evaluated TAs based on their experience with machine learning and ML safety, as well as their track record in teaching (e.g. being a TA for another course). Overall I was expecting hiring good TAs to be much harder than it was; when one TA got sick, it was relatively hard to&nbsp;</p><p>We also needed to set stipends for TAs and students. We paid students stipends of $4500 for the 9 weeks of the program ($500/week), which is comparable to what was previously paid by CHAI (this amount is now higher for next year) and what is often paid to undergrads who get summer research grants. We think that in most cases, students who already have the ability to do research themselves should not be doing MLSS, so stipends were relatively low so as to not create any perverse incentives. We asked students afterwards what they thought about the size of the stipends, and 78% said the stipends were around the right size (of course, this is biased, because this is only students who chose to do the program knowing the size of the stipend). I think in the future, we might set the stipend slightly higher, but probably not much higher.</p><p>I won\u2019t go into details of our application process in this public post, as I don\u2019t want it to create any distortive effects for future MLSS cohorts. However, you can see the application we used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrNYFhCRTjY54FIO\"><u>here</u></a>. We received over 450 applications and admitted just over 100 students.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>During MLSS</strong></h3><p>Every week, TAs needed to grade all student assignments. I would assign each TA to a particular assignment and have them grade it by a week later. Many students also asked for extensions; I assigned a TA to handle this specifically and grant extensions as appropriate. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for students to fail to submit assignments, and in this case we had a TA follow up with them to see what kind of extension they would need to complete the assignment. We also needed to do follow up in the rare cases that students failed assignments so that they could resubmit.</p><p>There was also a very high amount of administrative work, most of which I can\u2019t easily describe here. Managing a program with 100 students involves many edge cases that need to be dealt with all the time. I probably spent at least 30 hours a week on MLSS when it was running.</p><h2><strong>Miscellaneous other improvement suggestions</strong></h2><p>This report includes a number of areas of improvement. Here are a few others that don\u2019t really fit in any section:</p><ul><li>Assign students a dedicated TA who checks in with them weekly and asks them how they are doing.</li><li>Some students clearly did not have the programming background required for the course. In the future, the application should more clearly require evidence that the student is comfortable writing a relatively large amount of code.</li><li>Release the MLSS application earlier. Many students had already made other summer plans when we released the application.</li></ul><h2><strong>Anecdotal comments</strong></h2><p>Some students also shared anecdotal comments (lightly edited for spelling and grammar only): Here are some that stood out to me (lightly edited for spelling and grammar only):</p><p>\u201cWhen there is so much AI-related content out there and little accountability or reward for learning it, it's hard to stay motivated. Having an authority like MLSS filter out the most important content and give incentives for doing it made learning much easier and more effective. Especially since there were incentives for doing useful work which one might otherwise find tedious, like summarising papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a great course, I reckon if I knew about it sooner I could have set aside the right amount of time this course deserves\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, this course was something of an experiment, but I think in the future changing more between runs and less within them would be for the best, even if some people are dissatisfied in the first couple weeks.\u201d</p><p>[When asked about their favorite part of MLSS] \u201cpaper summaries! I felt like I was roleplaying as a researcher. It was very cool to demystify the idea of a paper and know that they're totally readable and approachable if I give them time. Plus I can now say that I've read a paper\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm still fairly unsure how good a fit I am for technical ML Safety research, though that was not an explicit goal of the program, and I'm not sure there's time to incorporate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I participated in the AI Seminar at [school] I felt like some stuff was going over my head and wondered if I would be able to pursue AI Safety as a career. I felt that, with MLSS, I got down to the \"source\" of what I did not know. I still don't feel I am there 100%, but I feel like I have a great first exposure and more knowledge of where to go to solidify the ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a lot of students complain about difficulty, however I don\u2019t think that it should be made easier in future iterations. It is a very positive thing it is challenging!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cit probably accelerated my knowledge of AI safety by at least 1 year, maybe more\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am currently in the planning process for an ML safety reading group at my Uni, which would not be the case if not for this amazing opportunity\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel as though MLSS has not only accelerated my knowledge in AI by years, but it has also instilled in me several new characteristics. I feel far more open to rigorously considering ideas that make me uncomfortable. I have a newfound confidence in going out and reading papers, brainstorming research, and following through with ideas I generate. I also have more confidence in myself and my own capabilities to learn and participate in the field. I feel more motivated than ever to keep learning and start contributing and for that, I am immensely grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came into the program not really knowing what to expect, and I can honestly say that I am more than impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou've produced a sizable batch of people excited about working on saving the universe and doing it pragmatically - so I'd say this summer was a huge success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big thank-you to all the wonderful TAs! Your patience, understanding and helpfulness have meant the world to me. From the course, I\u2019ve learned more than I have in years.&nbsp; MLSS has encouraged me to pursue a future in AI.&nbsp; I\u2019m beyond grateful to&nbsp; MLSS for giving me so many opportunities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have paid to have a group so what MLSS has done for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis program has definitely altered the course of my career.\u201d</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>I would congratulate you for reaching the end of the report, but statistically, you probably just scrolled directly to the bottom to read this conclusion.</p><p>Overall, I\u2019m really happy with how MLSS turned out. There were times when I was really worried it wasn\u2019t going to, but I think that it really did. I\u2019m extremely excited about all of the students in the program, and I think that some of them are going to make great AI safety researchers. There are certainly a lot of areas of improvement that can be made, and I think that the next MLSS can be even better than this one.</p><p>I think it\u2019s right for me to end this report in the way I started it: by again linking the list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrLh8ZaWQxPEcKk0\"><u>all the graduates</u></a>. Every one of them completed a very rigorous and challenging program and is potentially a great candidate for an entry-level AI safety role.</p><h2><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></h2><p>I would like to thank all the students in MLSS for providing helpful feedback throughout the course and bearing through some hiccups. You all really made this program worth it for me.</p><p>I would like to thank the fantastic TAs: Abra Ganz, Ansh Radhakrishnan, Arush Tagade, Daniel Braun, JJ Balisanyuka-Smith, Joe Kwon, Kaivu Hariharan, Nikiforos Pittaras, and Mohammad Taufeeque. The course materials and policies were designed in close collaboration with Dan Hendrycks, who was an invaluable resource throughout the program. Thank you also to Oliver Zhang for occasionally providing operational support for the program.</p><p>While working on this program, I was personally supported by a grant from the Long-Term Future Fund in the first half and as an employee of the Center for AI Safety in the second half.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to thank the FTX Future Fund regranting program for their financial support of MLSS.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "ThomasWoodside"}}, {"_id": "KJtS4Dk2RkZRBe78i", "title": "Giving What We Can October Newsletter 2022", "postedAt": "2022-11-01T03:08:55.369Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hello and welcome to our October Newsletter!</p><p>Our favourite season is almost upon us\u2026Giving Season!

But (at least) the former is well-known, and acknowledged often by GiveWell researchers. More concerningly, the body of publicly released research from GiveWell displays a lack of imagination surrounding how the moral weights approach can be improved to better track the effect of different outcomes on the balance of happiness in the world.</p><p><strong>The recommendation we are most sure of is that GiveWell should hire (perhaps on a part-time or project basis) one or more philosophers specializing in the kinds of questions the moral weights approach attempts to answer.</strong> We argue for this recommendation by outlining the doubts we have about the validity of the current approach, especially those that hit on deeper philosophical questions which we believe generalists are ill-placed to adequately answer.&nbsp;</p><p>Our submission is notably light on actual philosophical argument; we may come across as being satisfied with merely gesturing at big problems without expressing confidence in any particular solution. This is the point\u2013as undergraduates in philosophy (and economics), it would be irresponsible to claim definitive answers to the gnarly questions. Our hope is that this submission encourages GiveWell to invest resources into providing satisfactory answers to such questions.</p><h1>1. Why is this an area of priority to improve?</h1><p>In short, differences in moral weights might significantly alter GiveWell\u2019s cost effectiveness ranking of giving opportunities. Charities avert deaths and increase logged consumption\u2013to take an example of two outcomes to which moral weights are applied\u2013in different proportions to one another. Although specific quantitative estimate of the value of additional information on these parameters is outside the scope of this submission (but see a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Nb2HnrqG4nkjCqmRg/quantifying-uncertainty-in-givewell-ceas\"><u>recent EA forum post</u></a> by Sam Nolan, Hannah Rokebrand, and Tanae Rao), it is plausibly valuable enough to warrant implementing some or all of our recommendations, given that the moral weight parameters appear in every GiveWell CEA. Beyond their use in existing CEAs, updates to GiveWell\u2019s moral weights might also change the organization\u2019s priorities for future research, incubation grants, etc.</p><p>GiveWell seems to pre-empt this view in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/comparing-moral-weights\"><u>a 2017 post</u></a> on their website, in which they state (emphasis ours):</p><blockquote><p>Our initial analysis suggests that using relatively \"standard\" moral weight assumptions (i.e., the assumptions in the previous two bullet points) instead of our staff's moral weights&nbsp;<i>would not change our overall view of the relative cost-effectiveness of our current top charities</i>. It may affect how we view some interventions in the future, particularly those that disproportionately focus on averting deaths for young children or adults.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The problem with this line of argumentation (if used to refute us) is that GiveWell is not in the business of using standard practice as a yardstick against which its own performance is to be graded. The relevant counterfactual to using current moral weights is&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>using \u201cstandard\u201d assumptions, but rather investing in radically improving the moral weights approach.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if the doubts expressed in section 2(c) of this submission lead GiveWell to scrap or give much lower consideration to preference surveys in calculating its moral weights, it is plausible that whatever replaces the surveys currently used will be &gt;10% different than current parameter values. If GiveWell hires a practical ethicist to do the kind of work we specify in section 3, the magnitude of the changes (if any at all) to the moral weights approach are difficult to predict; they could be minimal, or be large enough that it no longer makes sense to even call the parameters \u2018moral weights\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, our uneducated guess is that this area of research is neglected as compared with GiveWell\u2019s examination of other parameters in its CEA. For example, we did not come across any public announcements about GiveWell hiring or collaborating with trained moral philosophers to review its methodology in determining moral weights. If we are right about this, this might be on par with its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/about/our-mistakes#to_2016:_Failure_to_prioritize_hiring_an_economist\"><u>failure to prioritize hiring an economist</u></a> in terms of the mistake's effect on the accuracy of GiveWell\u2019s recommendations to its donors.</p><h1>2. What is wrong with GiveWell\u2019s current approach?</h1><p>We assume our readers are familiar with GiveWell\u2019s current approach to moral weights, as the primary intended audience of this submission is GiveWell researchers. For a primer on the moral weights approach, we found Olivia Larsen\u2019s lightning talk (text version&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8whqn2GrJfvTjhov6/measuring-good-better-1\"><u>here</u></a>) useful.</p><h2>(a) The IDInsight 2019 survey measures the preferences of beneficiaries inaccurately.</h2><p>This section will be brief. We do not have anything novel to add to the list of existing flaws acknowledged by GiveWell and other researchers, but felt that the submission would be incomplete without a restatement of key issues in the most well-known study on this topic.</p><p>Some of the problems include:</p><ul><li>Participants displayed a poor understanding of low probabilities, which may have systematically skewed their responses in such a way as to not reflect their genuine preferences.</li><li>The presence of social desirability and related biases, skewing participants in favor of prioritizing averting death over increasing logged consumption.</li><li>Large differences in elicited VSL depending on how questions were phrased, followed by a simple averaging of elicited VSLs which differed by &gt;100%.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>(b) GiveWell donor surveys have an unclear methodology, and are weighted very heavily.</h2><p>From a presentation by GiveWell researcher Olivia Larsen at the EA Global San Francisco 2022 conference (text version <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8whqn2GrJfvTjhov6/measuring-good-better-1\">here</a>), the components of GiveWell\u2019s current moral weights are:</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995611/mirroredImages/dHZZirCrKgyhb3NEZ/n1dhg6iefziqkwrtmpcr.png\"></p><p>As far as we can discern, the methodology of GiveWell\u2019s donor survey\u2013which constitutes a&nbsp;<i>majority</i> of its moral weights\u2013is not easily accessible to the general public.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefip3dui4n36\"><sup><a href=\"#fnip3dui4n36\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;GiveWell should publish this, or link it more prominently on its website if already released.</p><p>Although GiveWell donors may indeed have thought about these questions extensively, it is unclear that they are better positioned to answer them than the beneficiaries themselves. From the outside, it can look as if the views of a group selected for having similar views as GiveWell researchers (i.e., donors, who might have donated elsewhere if they had substantial disagreements with GiveWell staff) were prioritized in part because GiveWell researchers thought that their views were more plausible than those of beneficiaries.&nbsp;</p><p>We are fairly confident that the preceding paragraph oversimplifies the actual situation, but GiveWell should communicate more details about the donor survey to challenge this perception, and open themselves up to more specific criticism.</p><p>As it stands, we (weakly) hold that some of the same problems present in the IDinsight 2019 survey (and more) appear in the donor survey. Specifically,&nbsp;<i>most&nbsp;</i>of us are bad at considering small probabilities, the lack of lived experience in the same situation as the average beneficiary of a GiveWell top charity makes responses significantly less reliable, and questions about abstract scenarios are not well-placed to capture genuine moral intuitions.&nbsp;</p><h2>(c) GiveWell\u2019s published material lacks a (sorely needed) defense of preferences as a reliable measurement of moral weights.</h2><p>In this section, we argue that using people\u2019s preferences to measure moral weights is far from obviously a reliable method. It follows that GiveWell should release a more detailed defense of this method than is currently available, and/or acknowledge massive uncertainties in relying on preferences.</p><p><i>Even if&nbsp;</i>beneficiary preferences could be more accurately elicited (e.g., by fixing some of the issues in the IDinsight 2019 survey), it is unclear precisely what role such data&nbsp;<i>ought&nbsp;</i>to play in determining GiveWell\u2019s moral weight parameters. Roughly, there are two reasons why beneficiary preferences might be important:<br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Maximizing beneficiary preferences is our end goal.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Beneficiary preferences give us useful information to estimate some other value, such as the amount of happiness preserved / generated by averting a death, increasing consumption, etc.</li></ol><p><br>(1) is a departure from a hedonistic theory of the good, towards a position resembling preference consequentialism. Without presuming too much about the average GiveWell donor, it is at least plausible that maximizing beneficiary preferences is not their intended goal. When asked why they donate to GiveWell, we would not be surprised if most donors answer that they want to improve one of happiness, wellbeing, etc. in the most cost effective way. To be clear, we are not dismissing (1) entirely, but merely pointing out that it is far from an obvious stance.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxlqxh0g5f1c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxlqxh0g5f1c\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>We expect that (2) is much more intuitive to most people. When trying to best improve the happiness or well being of a group of people, it is natural to ask members of that group how this could best be achieved, in order to develop more accurate empirical beliefs. However, on closer examination, beneficiary preferences may not be fit for this purpose. For example, qualitative findings from the 2019 IDinsight survey suggest that many participant responses were influenced by religious or spiritual beliefs that the value of life is absolute. The view that averting death is discontinuously valuable as compared with increasing household consumption may be a genuine preference. But the fact that religion or spirituality (which are perhaps not proper epistemic grounds) played a significant role in the formation of said beliefs should give us pause in integrating them into our moral weights.&nbsp;</p><p>More generally, we are concerned that considering beneficiary preferences will lead to (unintentional) \u2018creeping\u2019 of ethical theories not held by the average GiveWell donor into donor decision making. For example, a utilitarian donor might find themselves supporting&nbsp;<i>clearly&nbsp;</i>non-utility maximizing causes, because they mistook the preferences of deontologist survey respondents that A &gt; B (where A and B are different incomes they can obtain with the same dollar donated towards different charities) as evidence for u(A) &gt; u(B), rather than that B violates some rule, while A does not. Allowing ethical positions we disagree with to creep into our own internal ethical deliberations would be imprudent, and we risk this happening by using beneficiary preferences as part of the moral weights parameters.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh1dvdcfohz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh1dvdcfohz\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>This objection is not limited to beneficiary preferences. Different ethical views of GiveWell staff, or other donors, can also creep into donor decisions. Although we expect self-selection effects to mean that most GiveWell staff and donors share similar positions on the relevant issues, staff and donors are not a homogenous group of people who agree fully on the normative questions. This might undermine the position that surveyed preferences are a reliable way of estimating moral weights.&nbsp;</p><p>An analogous objection can probably be avoided by some competing methods, such as DALYs, as they do not entail asking people questions whose answers depend on personal ethical views. With such competing methods, we know what we're getting (e.g., a list of charities optimized by the total years of life increased, adjusted for disabilities) in a way we cannot when depending on the confused normative mixture produced by surveys.</p><p>Our recommendation is that GiveWell should publicly explain why it uses preferences\u2013of staff, donors, and beneficiaries alike\u2013to calculate moral weights. This might involve defending using preferences against some of the obvious concerns outlined above, highlighting uncertainties regarding some of these philosophical questions more extensively, or another approach not listed here.</p><h1>3. GiveWell should hire practical ethicists to review its current approach to moral weights.</h1><p>Our most direct and implementable recommendation is that GiveWell should hire specialists in this field (especially practical ethicists) to review its current approach. We use the term \u2018hire\u2019 loosely; we are not arguing that these would need to be full-time employees of GiveWell. For example, GiveWell could partner with ethicists in academia on a short-term project basis. There is likely existing interest in conducting this kind of research among academic philosophers, especially in collaboration with a grantmaker of GiveWell\u2019s size.</p><p>We refer to practical ethicists in a loose way here, and would include most moral philosophers whose work is not particularly attached to one normative ethical theory.</p><p>We believe that practical ethicists will be able to offer insight in the following areas:</p><h2>(1) On whether or not moral weight is actually a good idea:</h2><p>[We expect that GiveWell, quite reasonably, will not prioritise this in comparison with our recommendations (2) and (3).]</p><p>There is in-depth discussion in philosophy about comparing cardinally similar items without a single unit of measurement. It is not immediately obvious to us that moral weight can actually be reasonably calculated, under any methodology. We would point to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/theo.12096\">Derek Parfit\u2019s work on&nbsp;<i>Imprecise Comparatibility</i></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/339673?fbclid=IwAR0z6tKIoCl0lfRDC15WrarqpODCPyevtvx63DwUo3mC-_fcTDOB32EOcts\"><u>Ruth Chang\u2019s work on&nbsp;</u><i><u>Parity</u></i></a><i>.&nbsp;</i>Parfit\u2019s work rejects that differences between cardinally ranked items can always be measured by a scale unit of the relevant value. In addition to rejecting the same proposition as Parfit, Chang\u2019s work rejects that all rankings proceed in terms of trichotomy of \u2018better than\u2019, \u2018worse than\u2019 and \u2018equally good\u2019. It seems like moral weight requires a similar implicit assumption (that different moral concepts can be weighed against each other). We think, then, the work of some ethicists is relevant to GiveWell\u2019s moral weight question.</p><h2>(2) On balancing utility and preference:</h2><p>There seem to be two broad, competing schools of thought when it comes to moral weights. On one side, GiveWell uses individual preferences, mostly elicited from surveys of donors and beneficiaries. On the other side, mainstream health economists, as well as the Happier Lives Institute, advocate for measures which purport to measure the overall happiness produced by a specific outcome (e.g., doubling consumption by one person-year). These include DALYs, WELLBYs, and similarly rhyming terms.</p><p>It is plausible to us that a practical ethicist could provide implementable advice to GiveWell about how it should balance the two positions (if at all). Specifically, a specialist could:</p><h3>Offer answers to how GiveWell should decide between using utility or preference as the scale of measurement.&nbsp;</h3><p>We point to existing literature in decision theory being incredibly useful here, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/abs/utility/56CF937C558E9733551694609069B2E1\"><i><u>Utility</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;</i>by John Broome,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951715\"><i><u>Internal Consistency of Choice</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;</i>by Amartya Sen, and Jurgen Eichberger &amp; David Kelsey\u2019s work on <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/EICA-2\">Non-expected utility</a>. We believe that ethicists will offer additional insight to the debate, beyond our common intuitions.</p><h3>Offer justification for a specific percentage split between utility and preference (if any).&nbsp;</h3><p>Ethicists well-trained in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/15/3/article-p324_324.xml?language=en&amp;fbclid=IwAR1w8ie9QiIAinLtgbuADwTSLE4AnYauyoJRobtRkABUBTIk8XaX7yzCY08\"><u>intertheoretic value comparison</u></a> could contribute a lot here. We think that GiveWell\u2019s current methods of measuring preference will probably be criticized by most ethicists. We suspect that accounting for utility directly (e.g., through WELLBYs) would at the very least pose a significant conceptual change to how GiveWell currently calculates moral weight.</p><h3>Improve preference measurements (if they are still used).&nbsp;</h3><p>A well-trained economist can point out the difference between revealed and stated preferences and list out the advantages and disadvantages for using each one in a given experiment. The same applies for ethicists, who can identify the relationship between our moral intuitions (which is relevant to IDInsights survey, as people relied heavily on their intuitions when responding) and stated preferences across different scenarios. Our moral intuitions are not equally valuable across all cases\u2013sometimes they misrepresent our actual preferences. Ethicists will be able to identify these (often non-obvious) cases more easily.&nbsp;</p><h2>(3) On setting an agenda for future improvements:</h2><p>This perhaps is the hardest item on this list for GiveWell to implement without external specialists. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit#heading=h.tk1qhbd8rhbp\"><u>2020 public update</u></a> to GiveWell\u2019s moral weights lists three future improvements, all of which are slight adjustments to survey methodology (e.g., asking slightly different questions, increasing sample size).&nbsp;Although we acknowledge that this list was probably not intended to be exhaustive, it is still noteworthy that the big picture question of whether or not the information gathered through surveys can act as a sufficient basis for justifying beliefs about moral weights is omitted from this list. GiveWell acknowledges the limitations of donor surveys themselves, but treats these limitations as a necessary part of any system similar to moral weight.<br><br>Moreover, there does not seem to have been much improvement between the 2020 public update and the description provided at EAG SF 2022. This suggests to us that external assistance may be especially helpful; although not all problems are best solved by hiring, we believe we have made a compelling case that this particular problem requires specialist intervention.</p><hr><p>The combination of these three things will probably lead to major changes to the moral weight parameters.</p><p>We don\u2019t think that generalists can conduct these research sufficiently well to address our concerns (although we can certainly make some progress). These are complex moral issues. When non-philosophers do philosophy, they tend to make mistakes more frequently.&nbsp; Moral weight is fundamentally an ethics proposition, which is best understood by ethicists.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>We (Tanae Rao and Ricky Huang) are unaffiliated with GiveWell, IDinsight, and any other organization referred to in this submission, unless stated otherwise.

Specifically, GiveWell\u2019s assertion that every $5,000 spent on SMC saves a life is a stronger claim than the literature warrants on three grounds: 1) the effect size is small and imprecisely estimated; 2) co-interventions delivered simultaneously pose a threat to external validity; and 3) the research lacks the quality markers of the replication/credibility revolution.

EA is on a BAU trajectory, built up of small intentional decisions (eg. rough growth rate, name &amp; branding), nudges from community leaders, and natural social dynamics. This post analyzes different domains where we could change trajectory, and key considerations for assessing these - without advocating any particular approach.</p><p>The domains identified group into:</p><ol><li>How much EA should stay as a single entity and identity vs. splitting branding / outreach / identity into philosophical or cause-specific areas.</li><li>How EA mixes social and professional, and how much it interacts with outside communities and professional networks.</li><li>Growth rate, level of demands of members, and where growth is targeted (eg. do we continue the focus on top universities in high-income countries, or diversify?)</li><li>Level of centralization of funding and decision making.</li></ol><p>These could affect decisions on location of hubs, onboarding content, target audience of projects or events, branding, funding choices and much more.</p><p>Considerations on many uncertain questions such as TAI timelines, costs vs. benefits of insulation, who EA needs to attract etc. could influence what course changes are best.

They do not constitute an exhaustive review</p><p><strong>Malaria prevention</strong></p><p>1. GiveWell assumes that a large fraction (34%) of the total effects of anti-malaria bed nets come from the extra income children will later earn due to reduced malaria exposure. However, GiveWell provides little explanation or justification for these numbers, which are strikingly, indeed suspiciously, large: taken at face value, they imply that bednets are 4x&nbsp;more cost-effective at increasing income than cash transfers.</p><p>We were unsure what the income-increasing effect of bednet should be, so we investigated a number of factors, which we enumerate as the next six critiques.</p><p>2. The evidence GiveWell uses to generate its income-improving figure for bednets is from contexts that seem very different from that of the charities it recommends. While GiveWell does discount this evidence it uses for \u2018generalisability\u2019, we suggest a larger discount would be consistent with GiveWell\u2019s reasoning regarding deworming and would reduce the total cost-effectiveness by at least 10%.</p><p>3. We present possible mechanisms for malaria prevention to income benefits, but they do not explain most of the effects. It\u2019s unclear how this would change the cost-effectiveness results.</p><p>4. We demonstrate how GiveWell\u2019s analysis does not sufficiently adjust for differences in context by looking at malaria prevalence. Malaria prevalence was higher in the context of the evidence than in AMF\u2019s context. When we adjust for this, we expect this will lead to around a&nbsp;17% decrease in AMF\u2019s total cost-effectiveness,&nbsp;with low confidence.</p><p>5. GiveWell has missed some evidence for the effect of malaria prevention on income. We expect this decreases the total cost-effectiveness of AMF by 14%, with moderate confidence.</p><p>6. GiveWell may underestimate the differences in benefits between women and men. We expect with moderate confidence that incorporating more evidence would decrease the total cost-effectiveness of AMF by 6% [note: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/a-dozen-doubts-about-givewell-s-numbers?commentId=5KiQP6ikBkzCGbLvd\">this was previously 16%</a>].</p><p>7. GiveWell assumes, without clear justification, that the income effects of malaria prevention will endure in just the same way as they suppose the effects of deworming do. We\u2019ve previously called deworming\u2019s benefits into question (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MKiqGvijAXfcBHCYJ/deworming-and-decay-replicating-givewell-s-cost&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900409563&amp;usg=AOvVaw23-pNnyZmh1mo9Pc2m_iNO\"><u>McGuire et al., 2022</u></a>), incorporating the adjustment proposed there would decrease the total &nbsp;cost-effectiveness by AMF by 3.4% to 10.2% (low confidence)</p><p>We\u2019ve presented these changes in cost-effectiveness for changing only one variable at a time. If we implement all of them at once (excluding critiques 3 and 7 for which we are more uncertain how they\u2019ll change the results), then the effects decline by 26% (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D1693974187&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900410382&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VDo9FsZGu2tKX2hFXdV-7\"><u>see row 202 of \u201cAMF total\u201d tab</u></a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><strong>Cash transfers</strong></p><p>8.

Using more data we show that recipients of GiveDirectly cash transfers are actually 70% richer than assumed in GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness analysis. Hence, the relative increase in consumption from GiveDirectly cash transfers decreases from 0.35 to 0.22 log-units (i.e., a decrease of 27%, which leads to an overall 38% decrease in cost-effectiveness).</p><p><strong>Deworming</strong></p><p>9. GiveWell\u2019s analysis relies on one long-term study from Kenya (the PSDP; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00481.x/full&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900412982&amp;usg=AOvVaw0liL3LqlDmXBju75X5_8qA\"><u>Miguel &amp; Kremer, 2004</u></a>). We&nbsp;found another long-term study by Liu and Liu (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id%3D3504079&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900413455&amp;usg=AOvVaw15B9PFn4QtFddRhLT4ztz_\"><u>2019</u></a>), which was from China. We\u2019re not sure how comparable these are but if we naively average the income effects, the cost-effectiveness of deworming goes up by 22%. If we add some adjustments based on context (although we have not fully considered these), then the effects of deworming <i>decrease</i>&nbsp;by 22%.</p><p>10. GiveWell subjectively applies a large 87% \u2018replicability\u2019 discount to deworming to (in part) account for the fact it relies on only one long-term study. Given there are now two studies, that indicates GiveWell could reduce the replicability discount by some fraction, which would increase the cost-effectiveness of deworming. If, for example, the replicability discount decreased to 80% (a total guess), then the effects of deworming would increase by 21%.</p><p><strong>Criticisms about country-level analyses</strong></p><p>GiveWell split their cost-effectiveness analyses at the country level. However, they fail to consider the granularity across two important factors&nbsp;at the country level that might change the cost-effectiveness of the charities:</p><p>11. Granularity about the age at which recipients would have died from a cause and how this relates to GiveWell\u2019s moral weights.</p><p>12. Household sizes differ across countries which would affect the calculation of household spillovers.</p><h1><strong>General methodology</strong></h1><p>Unless specified otherwise, we follow the same process in each of our critiques for quantifying how a change in an input in GiveWell\u2019s analysis alters the overall cost-effectiveness estimate. First, we identify a value that we think should be changed. Then, we plug this into our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D735069126&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900416050&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jf74a7K5zw_wE6qzIft-W\"><u>copy of GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness spreadsheet</u></a> and report how great a change (in percentage) this causes to the overall (average) cost-effectiveness of the charity. GiveWell\u2019s models are complicated, so we are not always able to explain why a tweak to a model changes the results.</p><h1><strong>Malaria Prevention&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>GiveWell\u2019s malaria prevention CEA considers two sources for the value of malaria prevention: (1) saving lives by preventing malaria deaths, and (2) increasing later consumption&nbsp;by preventing children from suffering from malaria. In their malaria prevention analysis, they estimate that increases in income stemming from malaria prevention comprise 34%<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D1364064522&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900417651&amp;usg=AOvVaw3RRaenA-5k_O9QZnIbHId5\"><u>see row 141 of \u201cAMF\u201d tab</u></a>) of the total value of malaria prevention. We investigated this part because some of the numbers looked suspicious; we haven't closely examined or noticed problems with the numbers relating to the prevention of deaths.</p><h2><strong>1. Income effects of malaria prevention are surprisingly large yet mostly unexplained.</strong></h2><p>GiveWell estimates that malaria prevention with bed nets is four times more cost-effective at improving economic outcomes than GiveDirectly cash transfers (see <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D1364064522%26range%3DB224&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900418953&amp;usg=AOvVaw3dxDQSqLZiADkgiJZSdkVr\"><u>row 224, sheet \u201cAMF\u201d</u></a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[5]</a></sup></span>. This is a surprisingly large effect, as we assumed that cash transfers, given they aim to improve economic outcomes, would be more effective at doing so. What\u2019s more, we expected that if GiveWell were aware of this result and sincerely believed it, they would strongly advocate that donors should fund bednets rather than cash transfers via a form dominance reasoning: not only are bed nets&nbsp;4x better at reducing poverty, you also get to save lives \u2018for free\u2019.</p><p>However, this is not a &nbsp;result that GiveWell draws much attention to or explains. It is based on their estimates of how a year of malaria prevention&nbsp;increases lifelong economic outcomes by 2.3%. The most information GiveWell provides for the reasoning behind these figures is in a note (row 109, sheet \u201cAMF\u201d).</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThis figure [2.3%] represents a midpoint between the findings of two natural experiments </i>(<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/app.2.2.1&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900420531&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pTs1eekR3_0WXQuknWTbE\"><u>Bleakley, 2010</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/app.2.2.72&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900420906&amp;usg=AOvVaw09AUyHD7J441NMONYcx2Dd\"><u>Cutler et al., 2010</u></a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[6]</a></sup></span><i>.

We cannot detect any change in their analysis since then. While&nbsp;we cannot follow GiveWell\u2019s full rationale, we suggest some problems with GiveWell\u2019s present figures. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2. GiveWell\u2019s generalisability discount for malaria prevention\u2019s income effects is too small.</strong></h2><p>An issue that GiveWell clearly recognises is that the evidence for the life-long income benefits comes from a very different context than the one the AMF works in and is thus tricky to generalise:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>They [</i><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810960/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900425376&amp;usg=AOvVaw10L5LHN6XnnRkUud_CWcxe\"><i><u>Bleakley 2010</u></i></a><i>;</i><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kremer/files/malaria_aej_applied_2010.04_sunday_two.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900425805&amp;usg=AOvVaw3J9QDyEOzJuF_qk0pGQQV6\"><i><u>&nbsp;Cutler et al. 2010</u></i></a><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kremer/files/malaria_aej_applied_2010.04_sunday_two.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900426168&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jBGnsu31Mq382e7OTVOS8\"><i>]</i></a><i>&nbsp;study <strong>different malaria interventions</strong>&nbsp;that operated in <strong>different places and time periods</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;generated larger reductions in malaria prevalence</strong>&nbsp;than the programs we are currently modelling.

To explain why, let\u2019s walk through the ways in which the context differs between the evidence and AMF.</p><p>The first difference between&nbsp;the evidence and AMF is that the natural experiments studied permanent malaria eradication through mass spraying of DDT<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2013 an infamous neurotoxin \u2013 in areas with a high prevalence of mosquitoes. This intervention is very different from the insecticide-treated bednets distributed by AMF.</p><p>Another uncertainty is whether it is appropriate to extrapolate the effects of <i>malaria eradication </i>(i.e., preventing exposure for the rest of one\u2019s life) to <i>malaria suppression</i> (i.e. protection for a single year) which is what AMF does (explained in a footnote<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[8]</a></sup></span>).</p><p>The location and time period of the evidence also differs dramatically between the evidence and implementation contexts. The malaria eradication campaigns studied by Bleakley (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/app.2.2.1&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900428503&amp;usg=AOvVaw30KJhsX3o6h2Axra3TeB-y\"><u>2010</u></a>) and Cutler et al.

We think this discount is oddly small, given that GiveWell, to adjust for the differences between the contexts of the deworming studies and charities, applies uses a 90% discount<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[9]</a></sup></span>, even though the evidence-implementation gap for deworming appears less severe, as we illustrate in Table 2 below.</p><p><strong>Table 2</strong>: Summary of the evidence to implementation gap for malaria prevention and deworming</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/imm9q359hw3fkjvckfnt.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/mf28yq4klwnp1b8qmizz.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/qmjirttwry5al8lphy1u.png 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/fcaaaoug6scqwlaxiht6.png 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/df9lifvqwqnmxr9uxx10.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/lrijaptwiedtxdkotzwr.png 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/pxvcafisfnrbkv3fct39.png 1800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/xw3lw4wqqjidvf42lakc.png 2100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/k8f5gnbkd4bvjietlkst.png 2400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/sbxq87x9g7lod3zmjzgv.png 2700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/sjyhhfo2ktjol5hsulho.png 2912w\"></figure><p>In GiveWell\u2019s analysis of deworming, they extrapolate the causal effects of evidence from one context to a slightly different context. The evidence and implementation for deworming share an intervention (pills), a continent (Africa), and have a smaller gap in the time period. When it comes to malaria prevention, all of these factors differ, yet it receives a smaller discount. This makes us sceptical that the generalizability discount for this effect would remain at 30%. One precise reason for a larger discount is attempting to incorporate the differences in malaria prevalence between contexts. We turn to that in the next critique.</p><h2><strong>3. Malaria prevention\u2019s income mechanism remains unclear.</strong></h2><p>GiveWell does not explain or defend malaria prevention\u2019s mechanism for increasing incomes like they attempt to do for deworming (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-F5sZBq6FD6E73SWkKFhwMR9gCdKUCTfp9dOe0I-1vw/edit&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900441939&amp;usg=AOvVaw2M9BBU2Ciu5dhj46hiYrR7\"><u>GiveWell, 2020</u></a>). We tried to evaluate the case for its causal mechanisms \u2013 what about keeping children from getting malaria increases their future incomes? We think that malaria prevention can plausibly increase future income. This is important because the generalisability of malaria prevention\u2019s income evidence will strongly depend on the mechanism. Unfortunately, the details of the mechanisms are still unclear to us. We provide more details below.</p><p>We are inclined to believe that malaria eradication campaigns in the 20th century increased income for two reasons. First, the quasi-experimental studies we cited above appear to have been carefully performed and consistently find lasting changes to income: the effect of malaria prevention for a year ranges from 0.53% to 3.33% increases in adult income<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[10]</a></sup></span>. The magnitude of these causal effects is roughly consistent with cross-sectional analyses comparing incomes in countries and regions with differences in malaria prevalence (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6896867/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900442765&amp;usg=AOvVaw3QezvRvDTqiZ8zu7rZzmhO\"><u>Sarma et al., 2019</u></a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[11]</a></sup></span>. And at least one of the papers we cite, Bleakley (2010) has held up to replication (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://files.givewell.org/files/droodman/Bleakley-malaria-replication-5.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900443058&amp;usg=AOvVaw032t0fRV_25AwwG4gNJOIZ\"><u>Roodman, 2018</u></a>).</p><p>Second, whilst the general mechanism appears plausible, we are unsure about the detail. It\u2019s an established finding that negative shocks to childhood can have permanent economic consequences (see <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle%3Dhein.journals/wajlp57%26div%3D8%26id%3D%26page%3D&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900443497&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zpiznnqSlud3XOsRk_Vtj\"><u>Schanzenbach, 2018</u></a>, for a discussion), so we think the general mechanism is through protecting a child\u2019s development. The exact mechanism is unclear to us (we haven\u2019t rigorously reviewed the literature), but seems to plausibly be through improvements to educational attainment<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[12]</a></sup></span>, health, or cognitive function<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[13]</a></sup></span>. There appears to be evidence supporting each of these mechanisms, but none seem to fully explain the results. Note that we only quickly reviewed this literature.</p><p>If - as appears to be one plausible pathway supported by the evidence - malaria prevention increased school attendance which then boosted incomes, then that may be less relevant for today\u2019s malaria prevention actions because schooling is much more common everywhere \u2013 even in Africa (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-years-of-schooling?time%3D1945%26country%3D&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900444215&amp;usg=AOvVaw2KscjqxA1kTK-qI1yj72dT\"><u>OWID, 2022</u></a>). On the other hand, schooling may be much more necessary for the present and future labour markets. A similar challenge faces cognitive function as a pathway. IQ scores rose dramatically in the 20th century (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ourworldindata.org/intelligence&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900444485&amp;usg=AOvVaw3kDVRdK5KpKd19lwDsK8oY\"><u>OWID, 2022</u></a>), so relative increases in cognitive function will be smaller, but a greater share of work may reward intelligence.</p><p>While we think the case that malaria eradication campaigns improved income is relatively sound, we are <i><strong>much</strong></i>&nbsp;less sure how well this predicts future malaria prevention efforts for reasons we've enumerated in critiques 1 and 2.</p><h2><strong>4. GiveWell omits relative prevalence adjustments between evidence and AMF.</strong></h2><p>We now show that the discount might be closer to 64% if we adjust for differences in malaria prevalence (using fatality rates as a proxy), which would reduce the overall cost-effectiveness of malaria prevention by 17%.&nbsp;Prevalence is only one factor amongst many that differ between the evidence and charities' interventions, so the discount is likely different from exactly 64%.</p><p>GiveWell mentions in a comment (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D508617996%26range%3DA110&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900445741&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oRECtcQH1bguFLtDi4Yl6\"><u>see row 110 of the \u201cAMF\u201d tab</u></a>) that the malaria income studies they use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/app.2.2.1&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900445976&amp;usg=AOvVaw3kvNaL5sI1b3Jpfeb1Yofx\"><u>(Bleakley, 2010</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/app.2.2.72&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900446202&amp;usg=AOvVaw0nvEwJrmjw0_ZGhY5rJDV3\"><u>Cutler et al., 2010)</u></a> <i>\u201cstudy different malaria interventions that operated in different places and time periods and<strong>&nbsp;generated larger reductions in malaria prevalence than the programs we are currently modelling\u201d</strong>.</i></p><p>As we highlighted above, it seems like previous attempts at malaria prevention led to more dramatic reductions in malaria prevalence than occur today. We can try to estimate some of these differences, such as the difference in prevalence between contexts. While we can\u2019t find prevalence information across the countries studied, we use malaria fatality rates as a proxy to compare the study countries with countries where AMF currently operates.</p><p>In the countries where AMF operates, the average malaria fatality rate (if they don\u2019t provide bednets) is 73 per 100,000 people (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/malaria-death-rates?tab%3Dchart%26country%3DCOD~TGO~NGA~UGA~TCD~GIN&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900447104&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_svsyp-VZzHftF_RzK0Ra\"><u>OWID, 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;However, the average death rate in the pre-eradication era across the causal studies is 203<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[14]</a></sup></span>.

If we adjust for this difference in prevalence, then the generalisability discount would increase from GiveWell\u2019s subjective guess of 30% to 1 - 36% = 64%.

However, we want to strongly caveat this because (1) we have not had time to explore this new study in-depth, and (2) this new study is from a different context to that of the PSDP, so it is unclear how generalizable the effects are (cf the issues mentioned in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSOBFCc4hcv13A01LALtqiHVwzqWISyROjxhXxSdgB92q6XDH3ruCP3IbrHI7RE2V5LNM-cgxiZbSmX/pub#h.akaskjlo5ssd\"><u>our critique of Malaria</u></a>&nbsp;above).

For instance, if we decrease the replicability discount slightly from 87% to 80%&nbsp;(a complete guess) then this would increase the overall cost-effectiveness of deworming by 55% (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D71277016%26range%3DA220&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900480555&amp;usg=AOvVaw0wpf4WHAldGn9fG0CK6d33\"><u>row 220, sheet \u201cDtW t2.5\u201d</u></a>).&nbsp;Combining this with the higher estimated economic benefit (see above) increases the cost-effectiveness of deworming by 21% (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D735069126&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900480926&amp;usg=AOvVaw3p98uRBGRnTGL4RlopwVOs\"><u>see</u></a><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D735069126&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900481209&amp;usg=AOvVaw3KBrcgDKYu9b5O9wz4jLE9\"><u>&nbsp;row 222 of \u201cDW t3\u201d</u></a>).</p><h1><strong>Criticism&nbsp;about country-level analyses</strong></h1><p>GiveWell applies their cost-effectiveness analyses to different countries in which the charities operate. By adding this level of analysis detail they can capture how the cost-effectiveness of charities varies across different countries. We think GiveWell\u2019s analysis lacks granularity at the country level in two areas: (1) age of death and moral weights, and (2) household size and spillovers.</p><h2><strong>11. Age of death and moral weights</strong></h2><p>GiveWell attaches different values to saving lives at different ages (this is more complicated than simply that the youngest are most valuable; see <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uN2lEYioSBsLPu37RcYULH0AkvNx0WQ5xusp2vU9ja4/edit%23gid%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900482213&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FPJkIcmBY-Ev4uV0DCDzR\"><u>GiveWell\u2019s 2020, moral weights</u></a>). However, in their analyses, they split the life-saving effects simply into under-5s and over-5s \u2018buckets\u2019; Hence, they treat saving the life of a six-year-old as the same as an eighty-six-year-old. This inconsistency matters for two important reasons.</p><p>First, because their moral weights relate to age in more detail than only the two categories of \u2018under-5-year-olds\u2019 and \u2018over-5-year-olds\u2019. See Figure 1 below for GiveWell\u2019s distribution of moral weights across ages.</p><p><strong>Figure 1:</strong>&nbsp;GiveWell\u2019s disvalue of death at different ages in units of doubling consumption&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/od4bzgyi3vpbj27yjmu6.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><i>Note:</i>&nbsp;This graph comes from GiveWell (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit%23&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900483270&amp;usg=AOvVaw2eWNBqjIetu-u1q6BUGOTc\"><u>2020</u></a>).

The age of people who die from malaria who are over 5 years old shifts considerably across countries (see Figure 2). This means the average disvalue of the death should shift too \u2013 but in GiveWell\u2019s CEA, each over-5 saved is given the same value. We haven't yet calculated how much difference this could make, but we guess country-specific cost-effectiveness figures could shift considerably.</p><p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: The share of deaths from malaria per age for AMF countries</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673952088/mirroredImages/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/u2xqtqp76b979y7favyk.png\" alt=\"\"></p><h2><strong>12. Household size and spillovers</strong></h2><p>Household spillovers are the benefits an intervention has on the members of the recipient\u2019s household. For example, a cash transfer to an individual might benefit the rest of the household if the money is shared or if household goods are purchased. GiveWell\u2019s household spillovers model lacks granularity across the interventions and the countries in which they operate.</p><p>For&nbsp;all non-cash transfer interventions that lead to economic benefits, GiveWell assigns a blanket 2x \u2018household resource sharing\u2019 multiplier<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[24]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vSae9Vr4Pes6_C-F9kC6xOa9fXQLNiTJ_RaP5CiT_pQ/edit%23gid%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900485468&amp;usg=AOvVaw1cKIrydWuTzmf7SCkq5beX\"><u>model</u></a>&nbsp;for this multiplier&nbsp;assumes a 4.5-person household that transitions to a 2-person household after 18 years. We suggest that GiveWell should update this model with country-specific household sizes; the data <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://population.un.org/Household/index.html%23/countries/566&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900486238&amp;usg=AOvVaw3UVcNPhVyyBlf5EADJ5nb8\"><u>is easily accessible</u></a>. As it stands, their current model overestimates the cost-effectiveness of interventions in areas where the average household is less than 4.5, and vice versa when the average household is over 4.5. For example, if we update Deworm the World\u2019s Pakistan programme with the household multiplier that comes out of Pakistan having a household size of 6.8 (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://population.un.org/Household/index.html%23/countries/586&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900486607&amp;usg=AOvVaw3KQ9V2m1DrNTdkPya0hL9H\"><u>UN, </u></a><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://population.un.org/Household/index.html%23/countries/586&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900486870&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tk4OYnNqQq0PnyGhj8xQy\"><u>2019</u></a>), this increases its cost-effectiveness by 47% (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIm15kkYz5HUOvCzo4Izkk8tlRaxjF3jxGr517Fb-Ig/edit%23gid%3D10603561%26range%3DC220&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667270900487201&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qLX_A7RpI57X2jHQQK5Lr\"><u>see row 220, \u201cDtW t4\u201d sheet</u></a>).&nbsp;Note that Pakistan has an unusually large average household size, so this shift is an upper bound. We did not have time to explore how implementing this change would affect other country-charity cost-effectiveness combinations.</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>In this document, we demonstrated a range of critiques of GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness calculations that substantially alter the results. These were shallow explorations, so we expect the numbers to change with further scrutiny. That being said, we think that taken together, these critiques make a case that GiveWell should consider investing relatively more resources into updating their CEAs, reviewing its past research, and setting higher standards for future research that will guide the allocation of millions of dollars.</p><p>There are many areas of GiveWell\u2019s analyses we&nbsp;have not reviewed. We did not review GiveWell\u2019s analysis of vitamin-A supplementation, conditional cash transfers for vaccines, how they calculate costs, nor how they make their various other adjustments.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn5gx3khdb0t7\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref5gx3khdb0t7\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Joel produced the critiques and did most of the reasoning, calculations and writing.

First, they assume that all the benefits are due to preventing malaria in the first 15 years of life (and that is why they divide the total effects by 15 to have the effect over a year, see our explanation of their calculations). However, if part of malaria eradication\u2019s benefits is driven by a reduction in exposure over the next few decades of their life (years 16 and older), this would shrink GiveWell\u2019s estimate of the yearly benefit. For example, if the life-long economic benefits of malaria prevention increased up until the age of 30, then the benefits would be split across a longer period of time so less of it will be concentrated in childhood (years 0-15). Second, they assume a linear dose-response relationship between malaria prevention and later increases in income. This seems plausible, but not the only option. The first few years of exposure reduction could be more beneficial (which would make GiveWell\u2019s estimates larger), or one may require multiple years of prevented exposure for the benefits to kick in (which would make GiveWell\u2019s estimates smaller).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnmwjnklqiwfo\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefmwjnklqiwfo\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;We\u2019ve identified three factors that are related to generalisation in GiveWell\u2019s cost-effective analysis: an adjustment in relation to dosage (the charities provide deworming medication for more years), an adjustment based on how many children (vs adults) the charities target, and an adjustment based on the relationship between the worm prevalence in the study\u2019s context and the contexts of the charities.

These analyses are used to guide organizational decisions about the allocation of philanthropic resources. In response to this call, this essay offers some recommendations to GiveWell about best practices in CEA, along with some warnings about common CEA pitfalls.&nbsp;</p><p>I should start by noting that GiveWell is an impressive organization. I endorse their efforts to make philanthropy more evidence-based. Moreover, CEA is a useful tool for achieving that objective. With that said, there are also some systematic problems that tend to arise in cost-effectiveness analysis. These problems largely fall in two categories:</p><ol><li><i>Confusing Discounting Practices</i> \u2013 Outcomes in CEAs are often weighted based on moral criteria depending on their timing. Sometimes additional moral weighting/discounting occurs within time periods. These practices conceal the true impacts of interventions, making analysis confusing and not transparent.</li><li><i>Opportunity Cost</i> <i>Neglect </i>\u2013 Ongoing impacts associated with created or displaced investments are often not accounted for properly in CEAs, resulting in costs incorrectly tabulated.</li></ol><p>Both of these issues may be relevant to GiveWell CEAs to varying extents, so next we explore them in more detail. &nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Confusing Discounting Practices</strong></h3><p>The discount rate in CEA does not reflect the rate of return to capital (as is <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/social-discount-rate-primer-policymakers#:~:text=James%20Broughel&amp;text=The%20social%20discount%20rate%20used,and%20costs%20are%20worth%20today.\">sometimes</a> incorrectly assumed), but rather is an ethical parameter about the relative value of present versus future benefits. GiveWell CEAs, because they include a social discount rate, incorporate some moral weighting. GiveWell is <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/comparing-moral-weights\">straightforward </a>about this. However, GiveWell also takes care <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">to note</a> that it does \u201cnot make charity recommendations solely on the basis of cost-effectiveness calculations.\u201d Thus, the organization considers factors besides cost-effectiveness in its decisions about which interventions to fund\u2014as well it should\u2014however these factors are considered at a separate stage in decision making.</p><p>This raises questions about why some ethical criteria are included in CEAs, while other factors are left to be considered outside the CEA framework. By including \u201cmoral weighting,\u201d including social discounting, in CEAs, analysts arguably conceal the true impacts of interventions, thereby making analysis less transparent. These practices may undermine the legitimacy of the decision-making process by arbitrarily excluding some important ethical criteria from the economic analysis, while including other ethical concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>A further issue is that a social discount rate converts outcome measures like lives saved or illnesses prevented into a measure of \u201cwellbeing.\u201d Typically, wellbeing in an economic context is thought of as an <i>ordinal </i>measure, i.e., a ranking. However, cost per unit of benefit, which is what cost-effectiveness is, is not a particularly meaningful concept when the outcome measure is ordinal.&nbsp;</p><p>To make this issue more clear, consider an intervention that costs $50 per unit of utility saved. Moving from one unit to two units on the utility scale is not necessarily equivalent to moving from 50 units to 51 units, since distances between utility units are not necessarily equivalent. The entire concept of cost-effectiveness becomes problematic when dealing with ordinal outcome measures. One could argue that CEAs are evaluating <i>cardinal </i>wellbeing changes instead, as this avoids problems associated with ordinality. However, this raises a whole host of other concerns, such as whether the cardinal wellbeing measure is even justified.</p><p>Recommendation 1: <i>It would be best if GiveWell analysts simply avoided including ethical criteria in CEAs, leaving economic analysis to focus exclusively on tradeoffs, while allowing ethical concerns to be incorporated into decision making at a separate stage in the funding process</i>.</p><h3><strong>Opportunity Cost Neglect</strong></h3><p>GiveWell CEAs make some effort to account for counterfactuals. &nbsp;However, it is very common in the CEA literature for the opportunity cost of investments to be dealt with incorrectly or to be ignored altogether. For example, one common mistake is to confuse the investment rate of return with the <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/social-discount-rate-primer-policymakers#:~:text=James%20Broughel&amp;text=The%20social%20discount%20rate%20used,and%20costs%20are%20worth%20today.\">social discount rate</a> (as discussed above).&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s say for example that an intervention results in expenditures of $10,000 made by a donating organization like GiveWell. The cost of the intervention is not $10,000, because in absence of the intervention, some fraction of the $10,000 would likely be invested and grow at some rate of return over time. (Or, perhaps in GiveWell\u2019s case, it would be donated to some other cause, which can be thought of as an investment.) Imagine, for example, a simple case where half of the expenditure would have been invested at a 7 percent annual return, while the other half would have been consumed.&nbsp;</p><p>In that case, the total cost of the intervention is $5,000 in consumption plus $5,000 x <i>SP</i>, where <i>SP</i> is the shadow price of investment. Then &nbsp;<img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/48f37fa3868b2a70bc27479154988007fba73b08cf7e56e1.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/48f37fa3868b2a70bc27479154988007fba73b08cf7e56e1.png/w_104 104w\">, where <i>t</i> is number of years the investment is held before being cashed in and its returns consumed.&nbsp;</p><p>The opportunity cost of investment must also be accounted for on the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d side of the CEA ledger. Let\u2019s say, for example, a health intervention saves the life of an infant. Presumably the infant will then grow up and produce something of value during its adult lifetime. Like with the opportunity cost of monetary expenditures, this benefit can be subdivided into consumption and investment components, and a shadow price should be applied to investment flows to account for investment growth over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Recommendation 2: <i>GiveWell analysts should account for the opportunity costs of investment by dividing monetary flows into their corresponding consumption and investment components, and then applying a shadow price to the investment flows.</i></p><p>After subdividing the financial costs and benefits in this way, and applying a shadow price to the corresponding investment streams, positive savings should ideally be subtracted from negative costs so as to identity the total \u201cnet\u201d cost of the intervention. There may still be value in identifying the \u201cgross\u201d cost, since this may be the expenditure amount that is most relevant to a donor. However, the net cost is more relevant from a society-wide perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, some interventions may even have negative net costs, meaning they save more resources than they cost society. Such interventions are said to be \u201ccost saving\u201d or to have negative cost-effectiveness. These interventions in essence \u201cpay for themselves\u201d and constitute a kind of \u201cphilanthropic free lunch.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Recommendation #3: <i>GiveWell analysts should prioritize identifying cost-saving interventions, as these will tend to be the most cost-effective interventions .</i></p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Value judgments related to ethical criteria should be avoided wherever possible so that CEAs offer a clear representation of the actual economic tradeoffs associated with interventions. Interventions that are not cost-effective may be worth funding for other reasons, such as ethical ones. However, these ethical reasons should be made transparent, not hidden away as technical parameters in CEAs. To the extent possible, GiveWell should remove all ethical parameters from CEAs.&nbsp;</p><p>GiveWell analysts should also be careful to account for the opportunity costs of investment correctly. This generally involves subdividing financial flows into consumption and investment components and then applying a shadow price to the investment streams. Examples of how to do this can be found in a <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/15/10/481\">recent article</a> co-authored by this author and Andrew Baxter, as well as in a forthcoming book chapter (see references).&nbsp;</p><p>Because interventions tend to both induce investments (e.g. by saving lives) and offset investments (by displacing investment activity that would happen otherwise), the social costs of interventions will in some cases be negative. &nbsp;In general, these are the most cost-effective interventions and should be prioritized by philanthropic funders.</p><p>I commend GiveWell for its openness to challenge and its search for new and improved ways of conducting CEA.

This is not a book about concrete proposals as to how to tackle existential or long-term problems. It is a submission of tentative ideas on how to get people into a deep time mindset.</p><p>Written by Vincent Ialenti, a cultural anthropologist,&nbsp;<i>Deep Time Reckoning</i> suggests \u201creckonings\u201d as tools to think about the long-term future. These are mental exercises, a collection of ideas on which to reflect to help us imagine the deep future.</p><p>\u201cThis book\u2019s core goal is to encourage as many people as possible to do two things: (1) to pursue independent, expert-inspired, long-termist learning themselves, and (2) to support the highly trained, too-often-ignored, long-termist experts already in our midst.\u201d</p><p>The author combines the methods of academic Anthropology, the long-termism of Finland\u2019s nuclear waste expertise and the writing style of popular science journalism.&nbsp; It is written in a semi-poetic style and muses on different questions, challenges, thought-experiments and ways of imagining the future.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p><i>Deep Time Reckoning</i> aims to unblock our myopia in imagining the future over vast time spans. Long term thinking is required not only by geologists, palaeontologists, cosmologists, etc. but by all citizens. We all need to become skilled \u201cdeep time reckoners\u201d, to reposition ourselves in a long-term context.</p><p>Although others have attempted strategies to encourage deep time thinking, Ialenti\u2019s approach is different. He conducted anthropological fieldwork research on experts involved in Finland\u2019s nuclear waste repository project at Olkiluoto (the Safety Case). High level nuclear waste storage requires making projections over enormous timescales. The Finland Safety Case\u2019s brief was to come up with a way of storing nuclear waste that would remain within the current legal limits for radiation for hundreds of thousands of years. To give some idea of the enormous time-scales being discussed, the Safety Case experts prepared reports with titles such as&nbsp;<i>Climate Scenarios for Olkiluoto on a Time-Scale of 120,000 Years</i>, looking at possible forces such as glacial movements in a future ice age or how groundwaters and chemicals might corrode the copper canisters used for storage.</p><p>How the Safety Case experts projected the far future suggests to us methods for dispassionately forecasting the future over hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p>The author highlights two overlapping crises: the arrival of the Anthropocene epoch and the \u201cdeflation of expertise\u201d.&nbsp; The former refers to the fact that humankind now has the power to impact the ecology and geology of the planet over several hundred thousand years. The latter refers to the popular disdain for expert scientific research. The book aims to combat this \u201cdeflation of expertise\u201d.</p><p>Whether or not the Anthropocene epoch is a valid concept, it inspires thought as to how current human actions may influence outcomes over vast geological time periods.</p><p>The experts at the Finnish Safety Case project needed to demonstrate that the nuclear storage facility could withstand climatic, geological, ecological, hydrological and societal changes over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. Their long term view must be made more public. Ialenti looks at the possibility of translating the deliberations of these scientists from jargonistic technical language to lively prose accessible to lay people.</p><p>A challenge to this project is public scepticism about expert knowledge, which the book calls \u201cthe deflation of expertise\u201d. An anthropologist's view can bridge this gap. Ialenti presents a practical toolkit of \u201creckonings\u201d to help readers envisage long-term futures.</p><p>The book uses the word \u201creckoning\u201d in three different ways:</p><p>(i)&nbsp; how the Safety Case experts calculated and reckoned with various parameters to plan for the far future in Finland.</p><p>(ii) how the author reckons with the Anthropocene crisis and the deflation of expertise crisis to foster long-termism in the reader.</p><p>(iii) the reckoning, i.e. judgement of past mistakes by humanity which created the planetary problems of today.</p><p>The rest of the introduction gives details about the nuclear waste disposal project in Finland, which proposes to store 6500 tons of nuclear waste in copper canisters in underground holes.&nbsp; The burial of the waste will begin in the 2020s and the underground repository will be backfilled, sealed off and decommissioned in 2120.</p><p>Although the far future may be very alien in terms of climate ecology, future human and trans-human societies, culture and language, the author found that the \u201creckonings\u201d he collected \u201cended up pertaining to some of the most common features of human experience. These included the power of analogy (chapter 1), the power of pattern-making (chapter 2), the power of shifting and reshifting perspectives (chapter 3), and the problem of human mortality (chapter 4).\u201d</p><h2>How to pursue expert-inspired, independent, long-termist learning</h2><h3>Chapter 1: Using analogues to visualise the far future</h3><p>Analogies can be a useful tool to \u201creckon\u201d (i.e. forecast) the far future. Drawing on multiple lines of evidence and reasoning from a variety of disciplines strengthens deep time reckoning.</p><p>However, though analogies are necessary for thinking about the future, they are not sufficient.&nbsp;</p><p>The Safety Case experts looked at examples around the world where materials, artefacts and human remains have been preserved over long periods of time. These had some similarities, which provided clues as to what may occur in the long term future for their own nuclear waste disposal project.</p><p>This method is subject to criticism, as analogies are not precise and can break down.&nbsp;</p><p>Probing analogical arguments by pointing out disanalogies improves our long-termist thinking.&nbsp; \u201cTrying to be honest with oneself and others about one\u2019s limitations is the first step in becoming a more nuanced, careful, and modest deep time reckoner.\u201d</p><p>To resist the deflation of expertise, all citizens, not just experts, can study publicly available findings of experts in various fields, such as space exploration, nuclear waste disposal, carbon sequestration and climate change.</p><p>Ialenti then makes suggestions for thought experiments that one might perform to foster one\u2019s long-term thinking. For example:</p><ul><li>Imagining what well-known present-day cities would look like to archaeologists digging them up thousands of years in the future.&nbsp;</li><li>Imagining a present-day local coastal area submerged in the future or in the process of fighting off sea-level rise.</li><li>Imagining one\u2019s own locality during different geological periods.</li></ul><p>These \u201cimaginings\u201d can be brought into sharper focus by reading up on scientific findings about nearby ecosystems and faraway analogues.</p><p>One can also contemplate the provenance and the future effect of facilities, artefacts and infrastructure within an urban environment, e.g. factories and landfill sites.</p><p>A sense of awe can also expand one\u2019s time horizons.</p><p>However, the above exercises should be done in a spirit of scepticism and a recognition of their limitations.&nbsp;</p><h3>Chapter 2: Using repeating patterns to project the far future</h3><p>The Finnish Safety Case scientists used quantitative modelling by computer simulation to project various scenarios into the future up to 1 million years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Quantitative modelling provides an unemotional description of the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Modelling by one section of the Safety Case community gave data outputs from one model fed in as input to another data model. For example, the groundwater flow model fed into the radionuclide transport model. This along with the biosphere description model, the terrain and ecosystems development model, the landscapes model, and the radionuclide assessment analysis fed into a higher level model, the Biosphere Assessment model. Each lower level model needed to be concluded before the next level could be complete.</p><p>These input/output chains helped the Safety Case\u2019s many models hang together into a more unified future projection. Parts of models were found in other models, which became parts of other models, which became parts of still other models, etc.</p><p>The reports of each model enabled the derivation of each part of the model to be tracked.</p><p>Pattern derivation and modelling can be used by lay citizens as a tool to envisage the far future. They could scour daily routines and patterns for routes into better organising our own deep time learning.</p><p>Basic patterns, found right in front of us, may help us overcome the overwhelming feelings of meaningless, awe, mystery, terror, or anxiety that people can feel when pondering the far distant future.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some examples of patterns which are likely to endure over long time periods:</p><ol><li>Two part logical patterns: input/output patterns; if \u2026 then \u2026 patterns</li><li>Alternatives:&nbsp; even if X happens, then Y could save us; either X could happen, or Y could happen; X could cause Y, which would have the effect Z.</li><li>Part/whole patterns: e.g in the Finnish Safety Case project the Groundwater Flow model was seen as a part of the Radionuclide Transport model, which in turn was seen as part of the Biosphere Assessment model. Understanding relationships between parts and wholes has been a tool of thinking for millennia and can be used in reckoning the future.</li></ol><h2>How to support highly trained long-termist experts we already have</h2><h3>Chapter 3: Zooming in and out to gain perspectives at different time scales and from different angles</h3><p>Deep time reckoners are skilled at toggling back and forth between short and long time scales.</p><p>This chapter first zooms out from the Safety Case: it approaches the entire project as only one momentary blip within the deeper human and geological history of Finland.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, it zooms in on the collaborative forces that held Posiva\u2019s elaborate Safety Case projects together across weeks, months, years, and decades.</p><p>After that, it zooms in even further to examine how Safety Case experts maintained their motivations to endure their work\u2019s intellectually taxing day-to-day demands.</p><p>The purpose of zooming in and out is to get present-day institutions to embrace more sophisticated multi-angled, multi-perspective, multi-scale perspectives and to support experts in developing their long-term perspectives.</p><p>In order to conjure up a time perspective, the book surveys a 72,000 year history of Finland, of which the nuclear waste Safety Case project covers just a very small, recent part. Even this 72,000 year time span is very brief compared with the 1 million years + future scenario which the experts were researching. In fact the history of the nation of Finland itself is just an instantaneous moment compared with vast geological time scales.</p><p>At each moment in history, various circumstances could have taken a different direction and events could have turned out differently. Each event was contingent on complex chains of circumstances, causes and effects that went far back through time. It is possible that Finland may never have had a nuclear power program in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>A project such as the Safety Case is an example of \u2018distributed cognition\u2019.&nbsp; Zooming in and out enables each member of the team to reflect on how his/her small area of research contributes to the whole. Meta-analyses of reports revealed top-level models of the general conclusion of the research (seeing the \u201cforest\u201d rather than individual \u201ctrees\u201d).&nbsp; It is necessary to routinely \u2018zoom out\u2019 in order to avoid getting bogged down in one\u2019s own work. One should intentionally alter the perspective\u2014and level of generality or specificity\u2014from which one approaches a problem to remind oneself how one\u2019s work slots into the project as a whole.</p><p>Another form of \u2018zooming out\u2019 is when one takes a step back from one\u2019s professional work for leisure pursuits. The Safety Case workers had varying work styles, hobbies, personalities and backgrounds.</p><p>In this chapter, Ialenti also raises the question of how we can persuade today\u2019s institutions to adopt a more multi-temporal world view and also how deep time reckoners can be given more say in today\u2019s society.&nbsp;</p><p>The chapter concludes with five suggestions:</p><ol><li>Multi-timescale awareness training for personnel of large corporations, agencies and research institutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Though most companies are relatively short-lived, they should have a long-term safety department divided into a days division, a decades division, a centuries division and even a multi-millennial division.&nbsp;</li><li>A global deep-time reckoning association. This would connect experts in different fields around the world who have understanding of long-term global impacts.&nbsp; E.g. climate scientists could link up with nuclear waste experts, palaeontologists with archivists, evolutionary biologists with theologians, etc.. This \u201cDeep Time Reckoning Association\u2019s\u201d main mission would be to nudge long-sighted experts toward identifying themselves within a pragmatic multidisciplinary community on which global society must rely to avert planetary collapse.</li><li>The above association would set up meeting rooms, conferences, informal gatherings and clubs to facilitate cross-pollination of ideas between experts.&nbsp; There would also be leisure facilities to help deep time reckoners to build a community.&nbsp;</li><li>Employees and citizens in general should be encouraged to see their work and life from different angles and time perspectives.</li></ol><h3>Chapter 4: Avoiding the death of knowledge through the death of one or more experts.</h3><p>This chapter examines the problems within the culture of a research organisation if some researchers are too self-seeking or career-minded. It highlights the dangers of allowing one person to gain too much knowledge without recording and disseminating that knowledge before his/her demise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a Safety Case worker or expert in some particular file dies, the knowledge he/she has acquired dies with him/her.&nbsp; This is especially true for experts in highly specialised fields with knowledge accumulated over many years.</p><p>This in fact happened to one of the Safety Case workers, Seppo. His sudden death necessitated trawling through his personal computer folders and attempting to interpret his scribbled notes in the margins of his reports.&nbsp; His volatile personality had kept others away from closely getting to know his research.&nbsp;</p><p>Seppo had not trained up successors to himself, but had hoarded knowledge, \u201cempowering himself by successively controlling specialist knowledge that nobody else had.\u201d He had thus made himself indispensable.&nbsp; It was unwise to rely too heavily on a single specialist.&nbsp;</p><p>The case of Seppo demonstrates the influence that a strong, dominant personality can have over the direction and conduct of research and this can last even after that person\u2019s death.&nbsp;</p><p>The death of Seppo resulted in tighter policies as to how documents were to be written, requiring more detailed knowledge oversight and lengthier procedures.</p><p>Similar problems occurred with the retirement and later death of Seymour Sack of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the USA, who had an intimate knowledge of the construction of nuclear weapons. These weapons likely posed a threat to the future of humanity, yet he had not left behind detailed reports of his work.</p><p>Another example is given of a computer scientist at the Technical Research Centre of Finland, who was the only one that knew how to use a certain type of computer code.&nbsp; When he died suddenly, approximately 20 years of experience was wasted.</p><p>Considering the rarity of experts with knowledge likely to have a bearing on deep-time thinking, it is important for institutions to recognise who these people are and take steps to preserve their knowledge.</p><p>The chapter concludes with the following suggestions:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Today\u2019s societies must embrace an ethic of predecessor preservation. carefully absorbing, tending to, and disseminating insights from prolific deep time researchers, so that their contributions to humanity\u2019s long-termism do not die off upon their biological deaths.</li><li>Organisations that employ deep-time researchers should implement protocols requiring a more decentralised network of leaders.&nbsp; Their offices should never be concentrated in one location. They should never all fly in the same aeroplane or travel in the same vehicle together. Voters could push for laws mandating this on corporations.</li><li>Candid discussions should take place within organisations to prevent experts from hoarding information, notwithstanding their possible volatile personalities.&nbsp; Policies should require workers to document their knowledge and to mentor their successors.&nbsp;</li><li>Associated colleagues and co-workers of deep time thinkers should be interviewed with a view to archiving the expert\u2019s thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The knowledge archived from the above should be kept in an internationally accessible database backed up and made available online to other experts and to lay citizens concerned about the long-term future.</li><li>Co-workers of the deceased should reflect on which aspects of the deceased\u2019s work can and should be carried on by them and which aspects of the deceased\u2019s thinking were not helpful and should not be transmitted.</li></ol><h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2><p>The author reiterates the importance of long-range thinking in the general populace and not just in small groups of experts.&nbsp;</p><p>The book concludes with a few more suggestions for embedding deep-time thinking in society:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>&nbsp;A radical new education program that introduces entire populations, from an early age, to humanity\u2019s inventory of long-term thinking tools. The author gives numerous suggestions as to how deep-time thinking can be embedded into wide areas of the school curriculum.</li></ol><p>The guiding principles of such an education would be:</p><ol><li>Holistic ecological thinking</li><li>Multi-disciplinary inquiry, multiple lines of reasoning</li><li>An embrace of receptivity, sensitivity, and appreciation of one\u2019s wider world as opposed to yearning for mastery, escapism, and mechanistic thinking</li><li>Everyone has something to teach and something to learn</li><li>Imagining diverse futures</li></ol><p>Before graduating high-school, each student would write an essay on \u201cHow can I be a good ancestor?\u201d</p><p>(2) In addition to being educated into greater time-literacy, society can be reorganised to more holistically embrace future-thinking in the following ways:</p><ol><li>Deep-time thinking can be embedded in the culture of society from TV game shows to essential reading lists to religious discussions to corporate training schedules, even how we write dates, e.g. 002022 instead of 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>To combat the \u201cdeflation of expertise\u201d, avoid the jargon and perceived elitism of experts.&nbsp;</li><li>\u201cSoft\u201d disciplines such as anthropology, philosophy and history should be given equal status to the so-called STEM subjects.</li></ol><h2>Comments</h2><p>The book\u2019s suggestions are somewhat nebulous.&nbsp; It spends many pages describing the author\u2019s interactions and discussions with the Finnish Safety Case workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The intention of the book is to fire the imagination rather than give a concrete plan of action. It therefore oscillates between narrative and making specific proposals, which makes it difficult for the reader to grasp the main points.</p><p>The author may wish in a later edition of the book to put in bullet pointed summaries at the end of each chapter.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "vinegar10@gmail.com"}}, {"_id": "nTZWjN2apfhRAzCiN", "title": "Insect farming might cause more suffering than other animal farming", "postedAt": "2022-11-01T09:54:38.209Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The edible insect market has been growing and is projected to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220614005656/en/9.6-Billion-Edible-Insects-Markets-2030-Whole-Insect-Insect-Powder-Insect-Meal-Insect-Oil-Crickets-Black-Soldier-Fly-Mealworms---ResearchAndMarkets.com\"><u>continue increasing</u></a> rapidly in the future.

For example, lobbying in the United States is responsible for lower taxes on solar power, increased taxes on tobacco, and the establishment of a program to detect asteroids (Lerner 2020). In the animal advocacy movement specifically, one recent victory is the 'End the Cage Age' initiative. This lobbying campaign led to a commitment by the European Commission to phase out the use of cages for hens, sows, calves, and numerous other farmed animals (European Commission 2021).</p><p>When evaluating campaign strategy, it is important to have a good way to project the success of competing legislative opportunities. Ideally, this would involve predicting the degree to which lobbying effort makes a legislative opportunity more likely to succeed, compared to the scenario where that additional effort does not take place. We refer to this as the counterfactual impact of lobbying. Understanding this would provide insight into how campaigning can be most effective.</p><p>Currently, we do not know the best way to measure the counterfactual impact of lobbying. One promising option is to use the academic literature on lobbying. The published studies on lobbying could be used to derive estimates of policy success and, ideally, the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><p>The purpose of this report is to find out whether this academic literature contains quantitative estimates that could be useful in gauging the counterfactual impact of lobbying. We answer this question by reviewing the literature on lobbying and examining studies that have published estimates of the rates of policy success.</p><p>Overall policy success is made up of two components: a baseline rate of policy success, and the counterfactual impact of lobbying. Therefore, to measure the counterfactual impact of lobbying, we need to be able to do two things: 1) measure overall policy success, and 2) break down this overall policy success into the baseline rate of success and the counterfactual impact of lobbying (see Figure 1 below).</p><p>We find that measuring overall policy success using the academic literature is unlikely to work. The lobbying literature contains many well-known weaknesses which cast doubt on researchers' ability to measure policy success. As well as this, our systematic review found a strange result, which suggests that the published estimates of policy success should not be taken at face value.</p><p>We find that there is insufficient evidence to break down overall policy success into the baseline rate of success and the counterfactual impact of lobbying. There is only a single study that identifies the counterfactual impact of lobbying. That study was limited to a single policy issue and a single context, and so its findings need to be replicated across other issues and contexts before we can draw any sound conclusions.</p><p>In summary, the academic literature does not contain sufficient information to gauge the counterfactual impact of lobbying. For these reasons, we recommend against using estimates from the published literature when modelling the effects of lobbying. Instead, we recommend that researchers choose a different option for incorporating information on the prospects of success. We conclude by highlighting two promising options that deserve further exploration: expert judgement and panels of superforecasters.</p><p>Although we conducted this research to guide our own research process at Animal Ask, this report may also be useful to other researchers. In particular, we expect this to prove useful to researchers who forecast legislative outcomes, as well as those interested more generally in the academic literature on lobbying.</p><p><i>Figure 1: The overall observed success rates of policies are made up of two parts: the baseline success rates of policies (grey puzzle piece) and the counterfactual impact of lobbying (blue puzzle piece). Assessing the counterfactual impact of lobbying would be very useful for evaluating campaign strategies. However, academic research has mostly focused on studying the overall success rates of policies, and that research has encountered serious difficulties. There is currently insufficient evidence to gauge the counterfactual impact of lobbying based on the academic literature.</i></p><p><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c2b5df_6e1904d6ef1841b685db76bcef994cd8~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_740,h_372,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/c2b5df_6e1904d6ef1841b685db76bcef994cd8~mv2.jpg\"></p><h2><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2><p>When conducting research to guide policy and social movement strategy, a common goal is to recommend which campaign opportunities have the greatest prospect of success<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying#viewer-bu9ba\"><u>\u00b9</u></a>. This often involves systematically comparing different campaign opportunities. Many campaigns involve lobbying government officials, and so research into this often involves trying to predict the outcome of lobbying government officials for particular policy goals.</p><p>Overall policy success is made up of two components. First, there is a baseline rate of policy success. Bills introduced to a legislature naturally have some baseline probability of passing without any additional effort. Second, there is the counterfactual impact of lobbying. This describes the degree to which lobbying effort increases the probability of policy success. For example, lobbying legislators to support a bill might make it more likely to pass by a certain percentage.</p><p>When evaluating campaign opportunities, it would be very helpful to understand the counterfactual impact of lobbying. If there are multiple competing campaign opportunities, and one opportunity appears particularly receptive to lobbying, then it would make sense to focus lobbying resources on that particular opportunity. This would help limited resources be used most effectively.</p><p>How might we go about assessing the counterfactual impact of lobbying? The principal option that we explore in this report is to use information published in the academic literature on lobbying.</p><p>To measure the counterfactual impact of lobbying from the academic literature, we need to be able to achieve two goals: 1) measure overall policy success, and 2) split this overall policy success into the baseline rate of success and the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><p>Currently, it is unclear whether the academic literature contains sufficient information to achieve these two goals. To determine this, we review the academic literature on lobbying, beginning with a broad overview of the lobbying literature and the serious difficulties that have been encountered in trying to measure overall policy success. We then elaborate on the need to understand the counterfactual impact of lobbying, before turning to our systematic review of published studies.</p><h2><strong>MEASURING POLICY SUCCESS: A SUMMARY OF THE LITERATURE</strong></h2><p>Broadly speaking, the academic research on lobbying has identified a few well-supported findings. Perhaps most importantly, this includes the finding that lobbying is often successful in general (de Figueiredo and Richter 2014; Lerner 2020), as well as for animal advocacy in particular (Animal Charity Evaluators 2022). However, measuring the effectiveness of lobbying is 'extraordinarily challenging' (de Figueiredo and Richter 2014).</p><p>There are numerous methods available to researchers who seek to measure the effectiveness of lobbying (Oeri, Rinscheid, and Kachi 2021). Bernhagen, D\u00fcr, and Marshall (2014) provide a useful way to classify these methods, based on categorisation as subjective or objective data. Subjective data may involve surveys that ask lobbyists to estimate the success of themselves and others, while objective data involves assessing the actual outcomes of lobbying efforts. It has been documented that when lobbyists estimate their own success, the resulting estimates are higher than would be calculated using objective data (Lyons, McKay, and Reifler 2020).</p><p>Separately, the scale of measurement can be binary or continuous. A binary scale generally considers lobbying efforts to be either 'successful' or 'not successful' (or a limited number of intermediate options), while a continuous scale considers the level of success along a continuum<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying#viewer-bu9ba\"><u>\u00b2</u></a>. The validity of particular methods remains under debate (Adriana Bunea and Ibenskas 2015).</p><h2><strong>Problems with studying influence and estimating success</strong></h2><p>In the academic literature on lobbying and interest groups, many studies have attempted to measure the influence or success of lobbying. However, these studies have very mixed results (Anzia 2019; Lerner 2020). It has been shown multiple times that many of these studies - sometimes, even a majority - have found results that indicate either no effect or an effect that is different to what is predicted by theory<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying#viewer-bu9ba\"><u>\u00b3</u></a> (Burstein 2019; Burstein and Linton 2002; Lowery 2013; Uba 2009; Burstein 2011). Substantial results occur only a small proportion of the time (Burstein 2011).</p><p>Nevertheless, the belief that lobbying is a worthwhile endeavour remains widespread among academics, the public, and lobbyists themselves. Lobbying is a multibillion dollar industry because it involves large opportunities and risks (Baumgartner et al. 2009). While nobody seriously believes that lobbying is ineffective (Leech 2010), academic research has found it difficult to prove its effectiveness - a scientific challenge that dates back to at least the 1960s.</p><p>There are many barriers faced by researchers on this topic. As two primary examples, this topic is inherently difficult to research (substantive challenges), and there are weaknesses in researchers' approach (methodological challenges). We summarise these challenges in Table 1 and we discuss them in further detail below.</p><p><i>Table 1: The main challenges in the academic literature on lobbying.</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Inherent difficulties (substantive challenges)</strong></p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Weaknesses in researchers' approach (methodological challenges)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Lobbying success depends on many complex, unobservable forces.</p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Methodology, frameworks, and vocabulary are inconsistent.</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>The status quo is powerful.</p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Many studies are exploratory or descriptive, making generalisations problematic.</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Beyond winning and losing, other 'faces' of power might be even more important but are usually unobservable.</p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>There are numerous different scales of measurement.</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Studies are usually limited to a handful of pathways to influence, ignoring many others.</p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>There is a strong bias towards the US and the EU.</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Lobbying can happen over very long periods of time, making it difficult to observe causality.</p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>There is a bias towards the US federal government (where lobbying is likely to be least effective).</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Interest groups are more likely to lobby when they are likely to succeed, so the decision to lobby involves selection bias.</p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>There is a bias towards controversial, highly salient issues (where lobbying is likely to be least effective).</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Lobbying is two-sided, and a success for one group usually means a failure for another group.</p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>There is a bias against publishing null findings.</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>An actor's initial position on an issue is shaped by the presence of other actors, which represents an important but unobservable influence.</p></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Many studies ignore important variables like public opinion.</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Influence goes both ways - politicians can influence interest groups.</p></td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1pt solid #000000;border-right:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" colspan=\"3\"><p>Measuring influence may be fundamentally impossible.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2><strong>Studying influence: Substantive challenges</strong></h2><p>When trying to measure the success of lobbying efforts, researchers face a number of substantive challenges. Some of these challenges are so profound that they might prevent researchers from ever being able to measure lobbying success, even in principle. However, some authors, like D\u00fcr (2008b), are more optimistic. Here, we will list the substantive challenges that researchers face, in no particular order.</p><p>Success in lobbying is highly contingent and context-dependent (Leech 2010). Lobbying involves complex interactions in dynamic systems and depends on exogenous forces like timing, tactics, targets, salience, party power, political mood, lobbying resources, dominant issue frames, the other issues on the agenda, and the behaviour of other interest groups (Leech 2010; Lowery 2013; Sentience Institute 2020; de Figueiredo and Richter 2014). Many of these forces are inherently unobservable (de Figueiredo and Richter 2014).</p><p>In particular, there is a powerful influence of the status quo (Baumgartner et al. 2009; Mahoney 2008). The status quo is strong, and lobbying to change it is difficult (Lowery 2013). There are several reasons for this: policymaker attention is scarce; lobbyists in favour of the status quo can effectively raise general doubts and fear of costs associated with change; the difficulties in creating bipartisan coalitions; the interests that gatekeepers have in maintaining existing policy; and the idea that the status quo already reflects the relative abilities of competing lobbyists (Baumgartner et al. 2009). Lerner (2020) concludes that lobbying for the status quo is more likely to succeed than lobbying against the status quo. Lerner also proposes a way to take advantage of this phenomenon by lobbying to retain beneficial policies that already exist. Relatedly, one study found that lobbying against a proposal is more effective than lobbying for a proposal (McKay 2012a). However, this may be an artefact of studies failing to consider the counterfactual. If the status quo is likely to remain, then lobbying in favour of the status quo might make no difference. In this case, a small amount of lobbying might appear to have a very high probability of success, making lobbying in favour of the status quo appear more effective than it is. Separately, businesses are more likely than advocacy groups to lobby in favour of the status quo (Garlick 2016; Mahoney 2008). If businesses are better at lobbying than advocacy groups, this might confound the relationship between status quo and success, though we emphasise that we have seen no convincing evidence that businesses are better at lobbying than advocacy groups.</p><p>Defining influence and power is inherently very difficult. Theorists hold that there are several 'faces' of power (Lukes 2004). The first face of power is to do with who wins and loses on particular policy issues. The second face is to do with who can control the agenda on which those issues appear or do not appear. The third face is to do with manipulating the preferences of others, such as via ideology (D\u00fcr 2008a; Finger 2019; D\u00fcr 2008b). Through the second and third faces, many actors can exercise influence in a way that is totally invisible to researchers (Lowery 2013). For example, if an interest group wants to maintain the status quo, they may lobby to keep a potential reform off of the agenda. If this group succeeds, by definition there would be very little observable behaviour (Lerner 2020). Despite the importance of the second and third faces in understanding lobbying success, few studies have attempted to unravel these (Leech 2010), though some studies do exist (Pedersen and Binderkrantz 2014; Fellowes, Gray, and Lowery 2006; Garlick 2016; Binderkrantz and Rasmussen 2015; Yackee 2012).</p><p>D\u00fcr (2008a, [b] 2008) also identifies numerous pathways to influence. Studies often only focus on one or a handful of these pathways, limiting researchers' ability to detect the full scope of influence. These pathways to influence include access (directly expressing information or demands to decision makers), selection (helping aligned people to win power by influencing the selection of politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), voice (the use of outside lobbying methods, including media statements, rallies, and petitions), and structural coercion (the ability of businesses to influence politicians with minimal or no effort because politicians are incentivised to create a favourable environment towards business). A business can also have substantial structural power due to the popularity of its products with consumers. When a product is perceived as important by consumers, the line between a business's commercial activity and political activity becomes blurred. In this case, deliberate activity like lobbying may not be a useful way to think about political influence (Woll 2019).</p><p>Similarly, lobbyists have a number of techniques available by which to exercise their influence. These include authority and respect, friendship and benevolence, rational persuasion, selling and suggestion, fraud and deception, and coercion (Lowery 2013; Banfield 1961).</p><p>There are many reasons why it might be difficult or impossible to detect true influence. Lowery (2013) identifies many such reasons: some lobbying efforts are inherently more difficult to succeed in than others; groups have other goals than winning (such as organisational survival); professional lobbyists may be incentivised to misrepresent their clients' interests; and, of course, interest groups might actually be weak, with the weak evidence simply reflecting this. Another important reason is that lobbying happens over long periods of time, with earlier efforts affecting later efforts (Baumgartner et al. 2009; Sentience Institute 2020; Lowery 2013; Mahoney 2008). There may even be substantial time lags between cause and effect (Selling 2021), further complicating the process of assessing influence.</p><p>Interest groups are more likely to lobby when they think they are likely to succeed. This is a form of selection bias, and it means the decision to lobby is non-random (de Figueiredo and Richter 2014; Marie Hojnacki and Kimball 1998). This is particularly problematic for the inferences that we seek to make. Studies cannot analyse lobbying efforts that were never attempted, though some true experimental work has been conducted (Bergan 2009; Cluverius 2017; Sekar 2020). This means that these studies can only make valid inferences about lobbying efforts that <i>were</i> attempted. However, research in effective altruism and policy often focuses on hypothetical lobbying efforts, some of which have limited or no precedent in public policy. Even if robust estimates of the base-rate of success of lobbying were available, it would not be clear that these estimates would apply to the hypothetical lobbying efforts that we generally consider.</p><p>Lobbying is two-sided, and in the vast majority of cases, there are lobbyists on two or more opposing sides of an issue (Baumgartner et al. 2009). A failure for one group often means a success for an opposing group (Lowery 2013; Leech 2010).</p><p>Given these factors, it is very difficult to determine the counterfactual - in other words, what would have happened if a certain group did <i>not</i> lobby (Lowery 2013). There are studies that attempt to circumvent this problem, either by looking at all decisions across a given issue or by identifying prior positions (e.g. Yackee and Yackee 2006; Gamboa, Segovia, and Avenda\u00f1o 2016). However, due to the complex nature of lobbying, with many actors interacting in complex ways, even these methods may struggle to determine the counterfactual. A true experimental study may overcome this limitation, but there have been few such studies (e.g. Bergan 2009; Cluverius 2017; Sekar 2020).</p><p>When an actor takes an initial position on some issue, that position is shaped by the anticipated reactions of other actors. This shaping of the initial position of one actor represents true influence on the part of those other actors, yet lobbying research cannot feasibly capture this dynamic (Lowery 2013). Lastly, influence is not a one-way street, and politicians can often manipulate interest groups (D\u00fcr 2008a; Lowery 2013).</p><h2><strong>Studying influence: Methodological challenges</strong></h2><p>In essence, research on lobbying has focused up to now on two broad questions. Firstly, there is the question of influence, looking at how interest group behaviour affects policy outcomes. Secondly, there is the question of success. This involves looking at the extent to which policy outcomes satisfy the preferences of groups (Bernhagen, D\u00fcr, and Marshall 2014).</p><p>Even if answering these two questions is possible in principle, there are many problems that have been identified with the methodology of lobbying research in practice. These methodological challenges cast doubt on whether such measures can be extracted from the existing literature given the current state of research.</p><p>The existing literature suffers from fragmented methodology, frameworks, and vocabulary (Beyers, Eising, and Maloney 2008; Burstein 2019). There is also a large number of exploratory, descriptive studies, making generalisations problematic (Bunea and Baumgartner 2014). There are numerous scales of measurement, and the choice of scale affects a study's results (Bernhagen, D\u00fcr, and Marshall 2014; McKay 2012b). Together, these factors make synthesising the literature and drawing conclusions very difficult.</p><p>Additionally, there is a strong bias towards focusing on wealthy democracies, such as the United States and the European Union, making it difficult to assess the value of lobbying in other places<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying#viewer-bu9ba\"><u>\u2074</u></a> (Bunea and Baumgartner 2014; M. Hojnacki and Kimball 2012; Burstein 2019).</p><p>Meanwhile, there are several research biases that may lead to lobbying influence being underestimated. Within research on the United States, there is a strong focus on the federal government (Anzia 2019). Separately, there is a strong focus on controversial, highly salient issues with lots of interest groups present (Uba 2009; Leech 2010; Anzia 2019; Lowery 2013). In both of those contexts, there are theoretical reasons to expect that lobbying would be less effective. Added to this, there is a consistent focus on studying the interest groups' behaviour, rather than measuring influence from other perspectives (Lowery 2013; Bernhagen, D\u00fcr, and Marshall 2014). Finally, there is also a focus on the size of resources and the way they are deployed; this is at odds with the deployment of resources itself, which theory predicts to be important (Burstein and Linton 2002).</p><p>There are also research biases that may lead to lobbying influence being <i>overestimated</i>. There is a bias against publishing null findings (Burstein and Linton 2002; Leech 2010), as well as a common failure to include potentially important variables like public opinion (Burstein and Linton 2002).</p><h2><strong>Studying influence: Overall outlook for measuring policy success</strong></h2><p>Based on the considerable substantive and methodological challenges, some researchers argue that estimating rates of policy success is fundamentally the wrong approach (Leech 2010; Sentience Institute 2020). These researchers maintain that the world of lobbying is governed by uncertainty between lobbying behaviour and outcomes (Lowery 2013; Heinz et al. 1993), with context proving critical (Baumgartner et al. 2009). One such researcher, Frank Baumgartner, compared lobbying to the weather. Under this analogy, lobbying research is more like climate science than weather forecasting: while understanding the complex dynamics at play is both possible and useful, giving point predictions is impossible (Sentience Institute 2020). A different analogy comes from Robert Salisury, who argued that we might as well ask, 'Who is the most influential member of the U.S. Senate?' or 'What is the influence rank among the Supreme Court Justices?'. In other words, since the success of lobbying depends so strongly on context, we are posing a question that is utterly meaningless (Salisbury 1994 cited in Leech 2010)</p><p>Similarly, Lerner (2020) concludes, in the context of effective altruism, that 'it's not advisable to attempt to extract any quantitative estimate of the effectiveness of lobbying from the published work'. This conclusion seems to be based on the literature's methodological challenges. Under this view, achieving a detailed understanding of policy success may be possible in principle, but would not be feasible until the research field advances.</p><p>However, D\u00fcr (2008b) is more optimistic, concluding that 'the difficulty of measuring influence should not be exaggerated'. They argue that measuring policy success is not substantially different from other questions commonly tackled in academic research.</p><h2><strong>THE COUNTERFACTUAL IS CRITICAL</strong></h2><p>The challenges outlined above provide numerous reasons why the academic literature might not contain sound estimates of the rates of policy success. But even if the literature does contain such estimates, we need to go one step further and understand the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><p>It is helpful to think of policy success as the sum of two components (Figure 2). Firstly, there is the baseline success rate of policies (grey puzzle piece). This might represent the general probability of success for a bill to pass without any additional effort from interest groups. Secondly, there is the counterfactual impact of lobbying (blue puzzle piece). This might correspond to the additional probability of success that can be attributed to extra lobbying effort. These two components both make up the overall, observed rates of policy success<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying#viewer-bu9ba\"><u>\u2075</u></a>.</p><p>For the purposes of evaluating campaign strategy and comparing different opportunities, the most useful piece of information is the counterfactual impact of lobbying. It is this counterfactual impact that best determines where limited lobbying resources should be focused. On this basis, even if the academic literature contains sound estimates of policy success, we need to see if any studies go one step further and uncover the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><p><i>Figure 2: The overall, observed success rates of policies are made up of two parts: the baseline success rates of policies (grey puzzle piece) and the counterfactual impact of lobbying (blue puzzle piece).</i></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c2b5df_fbe31ad28ca24821903e8f2413738a12~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_740,h_286,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/c2b5df_fbe31ad28ca24821903e8f2413738a12~mv2.jpg\"></p><h2><strong>OUR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LOBBYING LITERATURE</strong></h2><p>The purpose of this report is to find out whether the academic literature on lobbying contains quantitative estimates of policy success - and, ideally, the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><p>To gather all available published studies on success rates of policy, we performed a systematic review of the literature (for a detailed explanation of methods and results, see Appendix 2). From our systematic review, we obtained 16 papers that estimated a probability of success of lobbying. These studies mostly focused on the United States and Europe, although many issues and types of lobbying (i.e. lobbying for both social causes and economic causes) were represented. Of the 16 papers we obtained, 14 were based on observational studies, and two were based on experimental studies. Details about the 16 papers, including their methodologies, are summarised in the Appendix 2 (Table 2). We do not list each paper's estimate of policy success rates as we do not want to encourage the reader to place a high weight on the evidence we extracted from these studies.</p><h2><strong>Is the academic literature sufficient to assess rates of policy success?</strong></h2><p>In the 14 observational studies, the estimated rates of policy success were narrowly distributed around 50%. This pattern was unexpected and strange. There is a hypothesis that could explain this pattern, though we note that we are speculating here, and hypothesising after having seen our results. For any particular issue, there are usually both winners and losers (Baumgartner et al. 2009). A single policy outcome might be recorded as a success for one group and a failure for an opposing group. Indeed, many of the observational studies highlighted that most issues were contested by multiple groups. So, across many issues and a large sample size, a researcher might naturally observe that around 50% of lobbying efforts succeed (Lowery 2013; Leech 2010; Baumgartner et al. 2009). If this reason is indeed why we have observed that the probability estimates tend to sit around 50%, then our evidence might contain useful information on the big picture of the world of lobbying, but it would not contain useful information on the success rate of any particular policy or group of policies.</p><h2><strong>Is the academic literature sufficient to estimate the counterfactual impact of lobbying?</strong></h2><p>Our systematic review identified two studies that are experimental rather than observational. In general, experimental studies are ideal when seeking to uncover counterfactual effects (Robinson, McNulty, and Krasno 2009). Accordingly, the two experimental studies that we identified provide the best prospects for obtaining evidence on the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><p>In one experimental study, Bergan (2009) conducted an experiment in which emails from an anti-smoking coalition were delivered to state legislators in New Hampshire, United States. There was a treatment group consisting of 72 legislators, who did receive emails, and a control group of 71 legislators, who did not receive emails. Bergan analysed the actual votes of legislators during two pivotal votes on a smoke-free workplace bill. In the vote on whether to table the bill, 48% of legislators in the control group voted in favour of the bill, compared to 62% in the treatment group<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying#viewer-bu9ba\"><u>\u2076</u></a>. In the vote on passing the bill, 42% of legislators in the control group voted in favour, compared to 50% in the treatment group. It is unclear whether it is more appropriate to view this experiment as a single lobbying effort targeting one bill, or a series of many lobbying efforts, each targeting one legislator. Therefore, while this study does appear to show that the counterfactual impact of lobbying in this context is positive, it is difficult to conclude what the exact value of that counterfactual impact is more generally.</p><p>In another experimental study, Cluverius (2017) conducted a hypothetical experimental study, delivered as a survey to state legislators in seven states in the United States. The survey included a hypothetical email from imagined constituents asking legislators to take action on an issue. The survey asked legislators which action they would take in response to the hypothetical email. Cluverius found that 8.5% of legislators would introduce a bill; 19.3% would cosponsor a bill; 32.6% would vote for a bill; and 16.3% would urge fellow legislators to support a bill. These results did vary across the salience of the issue (e.g. gun control vs GMO labelling) and across the volume of emails that the survey asked legislators to imagine they had received. However, the study's design did not include a control group. This means that the counterfactual impact of lobbying cannot be inferred from the results. Also, since the survey was entirely hypothetical, there is no way to validate whether the legislators' actual behaviour would match their stated behaviour.</p><p>Given the lack of control group in the experiment by Cluverius (2017), we believe that the experiment by Bergan (2009) provides the most relevant piece of evidence for estimating the counterfactual impact of lobbying. However, Bergan's study has not been replicated or even repeated across other contexts (e.g. different states and countries, different policy issues, and different types of government officials), so it is impossible to know how accurate and generalisable the findings are. Until the study is replicated, it would be unwise to draw any conclusions on the basis of this single study in a single context.</p><h2><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2><p>The purpose of this report is to find out whether this academic literature contains quantitative estimates that could be useful in estimating policy success and, specifically, in assessing the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><p>There are numerous serious challenges that cast doubt on whether the academic literature is sufficient to make meaningful estimates of lobbying success rates. These doubts are reinforced by the surprising and strange results that we obtained in our systematic review. Even ignoring these challenges, we only identified a single empirical study that estimated the counterfactual impact of lobbying. This study was limited to a single policy issue in a single context. Until this study is repeated across a wider range of policy issues and contexts, it is insufficient to provide sound conclusions on the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><p>Gauging the counterfactual impact of lobbying would provide valuable information for evaluating campaign strategy and best directing limited advocacy resources. Our findings provide evidence against the value of academic literature as an option for assessing this counterfactual impact. However, even if the academic literature is ruled out as an option, several options remain:</p><ul><li>The intuition of individual researchers. We do not believe that individual intuition should be accepted as much more than a wild guess<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying#viewer-bu9ba\"><u>\u2077</u></a> (Smith 2019). However, since this is the option that is most often used - usually implicitly - when evaluating campaign strategy, this provides a baseline against which other options can be compared.</li><li>The judgement of people who are experts within a specific context and policy area. The key benefit of using these domain experts is that they often have on-the-ground expertise on particular policy issues. The principal weakness is that their judgement is unlikely to have been validated over many questions. We have also found that experts are often hesitant to assign specific probabilities, which may necessitate the use of qualitative categories (e.g. asking experts whether lobbying is likely to be <i>very helpful, somewhat helpful</i>, or <i>not helpful</i>). There are some systematic methods available for analysing expert judgement (e.g. Meyer and Booker 1987; Linstone and Turoff 1975).</li><li>Forecasts made by paid panels of superforecasters. The key benefit of using superforecasters is that their judgments have been shown to achieve a significant degree of accuracy over many forecasts (Tetlock and Gardner 2016). However, superforecasters are unlikely to have on-the-ground expertise on particular policy issues, so they might miss important factors.</li></ul><p>We think that it is particularly worth exploring the latter two options: expert judgement and superforecasters. Although these options suffer from weaknesses, they are both likely to represent large improvements over the intuition of individual researchers. At Animal Ask, we intend to explore these options in the future. We encourage readers to get in touch with us if they have tried (or intend to try) either of these options, or have ideas for other options to assess the counterfactual impact of lobbying.</p><h2><strong>APPENDIX 1: OUR FOLLOW-UP QUESTION</strong></h2><p>Recall that there are several faces of power: the first face of power is to do with who wins and loses on particular policy issues, while the second face is to do with who can control the agenda on which those issues appear or do not appear (Lukes 2004).</p><p>In this report, we found that there are serious challenges with measuring the counterfactual impact of lobbying. This work was focused on who wins or loses on particular policy issues, which is the first face of power.</p><p>But it is possible to take a step back and consider how policy issues appear in the first place. If an organisation is concerned with which pieces of power make it into a legislature to begin with, then that organisation is focused on the second face of power.</p><p>Introducing new pieces of legislation (the second face of power) is indeed a focus for some animal advocacy organisations. These organisations might campaign to submit a new Bill into Parliament or Congress, or they might seek to add a new regulation that is not already under consideration.</p><p>For these organisations, it is most useful to know the base rates of success of different types of policies. For example, an organisation might already be in contact with Members of Parliament and thus have the ability to introduce a new Bill. Here, the organisation might just want to know what type of policies are most likely to succeed - is it better to introduce a narrow, obscure Bill that limits the expansion of new insect farms, or is it better to introduce a broader, more popular Bill that restricts pollution from chicken farms?</p><p>In this case, the counterfactual impact of additional lobbying, as we have investigated in this report, is less relevant. What really matters is the baseline rate of success of a policy. Building on the previous example, it might be possible to examine all Bills introduced to Parliament in a particular time-frame. Hypothetically, we might observe that Bills that are narrower, more obscure, and focused on smaller industries tend to pass into law more than Bills that are broader, more popular, and focused on larger industries. In this case, it would be wiser for animal advocacy organisations to focus their efforts on the types of Bills that tend to pass into law more often<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying#viewer-bu9ba\"><u>\u2078</u></a>. Or, we might observe that Bills related to one species pass into law more often than Bills related to another species - that would be one reason to focus an organisation's efforts on the former species for the time being.</p><p>It would be useful for the animal advocacy movement to learn which types of Bills tend to pass into law.</p><h2><strong>Our pilot study</strong></h2><p>We conducted a pilot study to determine whether it is possible to gain insight into this question. Our pilot study involved an analysis of pro-animal Bills. For the pilot study, we chose to analyse Bills in Australia, which is a country that has a political system very similar to countries that are high-priority for animal advocacy (namely, the UK). The lead author is also familiar with the Australian context. Specifically, we analysed Bills in one Australian federal Parliament (42nd Parliament, 2008-2010) and one state Parliament (New South Wales, 56th Parliament, 2015-2019).</p><p>Our goal was to uncover whether it was possible to link the success of Bills to particular characteristics. For example, were more successful Bills generally focused on a particular species? Or did they have a particular scope, or a particular level of public engagement?</p><p>We quickly found that Bills introduced by the government had all been successful, and Bills introduced by other Members of Parliament (private members) were never successful. We expect that this is because Australia has a two-party system and a strong party whip, which is also the case in the UK. This trend may be less strong in other countries. For example, US legislatures have weaker party whips, and many European countries have multi-party systems. However, it is clear that the success or failure of Bills depends strongly on the context of a particular political system. So, we think that analysing Bills in a particular country might produce useful insights for organisations working in that country, but these insights would be unlikely to generalise to other countries.</p><h2><strong>APPENDIX 2: METHODS AND RESULTS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEW</strong></h2><h3>Methods of systematic review</h3><p>For our systematic review, our main information sources were the databases Web of Science and HeinOnline. We conducted less formal searches on Google Scholar and Google. Once we had conducted these searches and identified all relevant review papers, we also looked through those review papers' reference lists, citing papers on Google Scholar, and similar papers on ConnectedPapers. Our search terms are given below (Box 1). Studies were evaluated by a single researcher (the primary author of this report).</p><p>Note that our systematic review differs from many traditional reviews in that we are mindful of the diminishing returns to extra research effort. Given this perspective, which is unconventional among researchers conducting systematic reviews, we made some simplifying assumptions in our inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p><i>Box 1: Search terms in our systematic review.</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Web of Science Search 1:</p><p>(TI=(lobby*) OR</p><p>TS=(((\"interest group*\") (\"member of congress\" or congressm* or congresswom* or \"member of parliament\" or parliamentarian or legislat* or politician* or \"elected official*\" or \"elected representative*\" or government* or MP or MPs or moc* or policy)))) AND</p><p>TS=(data* or survey or empirical or model or analy* or review or systematic or quantitative or estimat*) AND</p><p>Date range: 2000-01-01 to 2023-01-01</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Web of Science Search 2:</p><p>(TI=(\"interest group\" policy) NOT</p><p>[search 1]) AND</p><p>Date range: 2000-01-01 to 2023-01-01</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HeinOnline:</p><p>Title: lobby OR lobbying OR \"interest group\" OR \"interest groups\"</p><p>Year: 2000 to 2023</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Google Scholar (informal):</p><p>Search 1: Lobbying</p><p>Search 2: Interest groups</p><p>Year 2000 to 2023</p><p>Searched first five pages of results for each search term, sorted by relevance.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Google (informal):</p><p>Search 1: lobbying probability of success</p><p>Search 2: effectiveness of lobbying</p><p>Search 3: interest group success</p><p>Searched first five pages of results for each search term</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>We adopted the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:</p><ul><li>We sought to include any study that gives a quantitative estimate of the success rate of policies or lobbying in legislatures or other government policymaking bodies.</li><li>We only considered estimates measured at the level of the organisational campaign. This is the specific combination of a lobbyist campaigning for a particular policy, sometimes referred to as the 'policy-lobbyist dyad'. This is because we were interested in the impact of lobbying on policy adoption. We did not consider estimates at the level of the policy (which would measure policy adoption) or at the level of the lobbyist (which would measure the success of lobbying over time).&nbsp;</li><li>We only considered studies that gave a binary (dichotomous) measure of success. There are many good reasons to prefer measuring success along a continuous scale for lobbying research in general (see above section, 'Studying influence: Methodological challenges'). But we intend to apply our results in modelling potential lobbying campaigns, and a continuous scale is not suited to that context.</li><li>We only included studies that gave useful information on the probability of success given some lobbying effort (the output of lobbying). This meant that we excluded other questions, like access to politicians or the reasons why groups decide to lobby (the input of lobbying).</li><li>We only included studies that analyse democratic countries. While research on lobbying in non-democratic countries is an intriguing and useful line of inquiry&nbsp;(Weil 2018; Popovi\u0107 2020), our focus as an organisation has generally been in democratic countries. There are likely to be different political mechanisms for animal advocacy in non-democratic countries&nbsp;(Chung, Anderson, and Li 2021; Wulderk et al. 2022), and different contexts and levels of success for lobbying in general&nbsp;(Uba 2009; Weymouth 2012). We classified a country as democratic if it was categorised as 'full democracy' or 'flawed democracy' in the 2021 Democracy Index&nbsp;(Economist Intelligence Unit 2022).</li><li>We only included studies published after the year 2000. This is an arbitrary choice, but one that saved substantial time by reducing the number of database results by 20%. We suspect that the results that this excluded are generally the least relevant, particularly as quantitative methods in evaluating lobbying have evolved over the last couple of decades.</li><li>We only include publications with full-texts in English. We believe that studies in languages other than English are likely to be useful. However, we were constrained by the time and language skills to find and evaluate such publications.</li><li>We did not include purely qualitative case studies on specific instances of lobbying.</li><li>We did not include theoretical modelling papers, like game theory studies or simulation studies.</li><li>We did not count direct payments of money (e.g. campaign contributions) as lobbying, following the definition of lobbying in de Figueiredo and Richter&nbsp;(2014).</li><li>We did not include studies where the person or group lobbying was a government or a government official. This mostly occurred where a local government lobbies a state or national government - this phenomenon is not relevant to our focus on lobbying by interest groups or grassroots campaigns.&nbsp;</li><li>We did not include judicial lobbying. The context of judicial lobbying is inherently different from legislative and regulatory lobbying, and we rarely focus on judicial lobbying in our work.</li><li>We did not include studies where corporations lobby governments for contracts.</li><li>We only included lobbying within a country, not lobbying across borders.</li><li>We automatically obtained the full-text of any paper we encountered on the topic of animal advocacy, even if it did not meet our criteria. None of these ended up being useful for this study, even for qualitative information.</li></ul><p>There were also many studies on the determinants of lobbying, lobbying strategies, lobbying ethics and regulations, and related topics. None of these are within the scope of this report, despite being commonly researched topics&nbsp;(A. Bunea and Baumgartner 2014). Also, as our focus was on measuring the success of lobbying, we did not include any studies looking at how to lobby.</p><h3>Results of systematic review</h3><p>Our initial search resulted in 3,997 results from Web of Science and 579 results from HeinOnline (including duplicates). After scanning the titles and abstracts of these, we obtained 182 papers. We also obtained a further 58 papers through other search methods or that were citing, cited by, or connected to the review papers we had obtained. After scanning the full-text, we retained 74 papers. Of these, there were 16 studies with quantitative estimates of rates of lobbying success and 24 review articles (or similar). These results are summarised in the flow chart below (Figure 3).</p><p>The 16 studies in our final sample mostly focused on the US and Europe across a range of lobbying contexts. Fourteen of these studies were observational, while two were experimental. The details of the 16 studies are summarised in the table below (Table 2).</p><p><i>Figure 3: Flowchart summarising the number of papers identified and obtained throughout our systematic review.</i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995458/mirroredImages/XyEKTDtfMH4DukhaF/mo6fpntfqtirmiwwhtlt.png\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><i>Table 2: Our systematic review identified 16 papers that make an estimate of rates of policy success.

In this report, we compare success and failure. It is also possible for policies to partially succeed. Many academic studies use methods that capture partial success (see footnote on binary vs continuous methods below). We think that modelling partial success is even more difficult than modelling success vs failure, and so we ignore partial success here.</p><p>2. We use the terms 'binary' and 'continuous' to avoid confusion. In the literature, these are often called 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' respectively. However, these terms carry a different meaning in this report, so we avoid them in this instance.</p><p>3. These 'informal meta-analysis' papers rely on vote counting, which is a very problematic way to integrate information across multiple studies (Borenstein et al. 2021). However, we agree with the authors of these papers that the ideal method, formal meta-analysis, would be poorly suited to studies on lobbying and interest groups due to the inconsistent methods used in this field.</p><p>4. This problem is less severe for this report, as we deliberately limit our focus to democratic countries (see Appendix 2).</p><p>5. We do not think that these two components literally sum together in a simple way, since lobbying involves complex interactions within a dynamic system. This is just a useful way to think about the two components of policy success.</p><p>6. Tabling the bill would have defeated the bill. In the vote on tabling the bill, to vote in favour of the bill means to vote against tabling the bill.</p><p>7. There might be an exception if individual researchers track these guesses over time as a way of validating their intuition.</p><p>8. Ideally, this information would be considered along with the many other pieces of information that make an ask impactful, like the number of animals affected, the amount of suffering prevented, and so on.</p><h1>REFERENCES</h1><p>Animal Charity Evaluators. 2022. \u201cWhat Is the Effect of Legal Work on Improving Animal Welfare Standards?\u201d Animal Charity Evaluators. 2022.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/research-briefs/what-is-the-effect-of-legal-work-on-improving-animal-welfare-standards\">https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/research-briefs/what-is-the-effect-of-legal-work-on-improving-animal-welfare-standards</a>.</p><p>Anzia, Sarah F. 2019. \u201cLooking for Influence in All the Wrong Places: How Studying Subnational Policy Can Revive Research on Interest Groups.\u201d&nbsp;<i>The Journal of Politics</i> 81 (1): 343\u201351.</p><p>Banfield, Edward C. 1961.&nbsp;<i>Political Influence: A New Theory of Urban Politics</i>.

Despite out best efforts, it's likely there are some inconsistencies remaining in our work. We have aimed to make our claims and reasoning as easy to follow as possible. Uncertainty is quantified, but we are uncertain about many of our uncertainties! We are aware of several errors and areas of improvement, and try to highlight these explicitly. If you disagree with any of these claims, feel free to comment either on the EA Forum or in Observable. We intend to keep this notebook updated with any adjustments that need to be made.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: We have quantified the uncertainty in GiveWell CEAs by translating them into <a href=\"https://www.squiggle-language.com/\">Squiggle</a>. This allows us to put a number on how uncertain we are about each of the cost-effectiveness parameters, and therefore the overall cost-effectiveness value of an intervention.</p><p>Quantifying uncertainty allows us to calculate the value of future research into the cost-effectiveness of interventions, and quantitatively see how funding this research might compare to donating to the current expected <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>.</p><p>As an example of this, we use our uncertainty quantification to calculate the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value_of_perfect_information\">Expected Value of Perfect Information</a> on all GiveWell Top Charities, and find that the cost would outweigh the benefits if GiveWell were to spend more than 11.25% of their budget on research for this information. We then break down this value of information into the value of research into individual charities.</p><p>We also demonstrate how to estimate the value of information for individual parameters within a model, using the Catherine Hamlin Fistula Foundation as a case study. We believe this kind of analysis could help give a clearer idea of what, specifically, it would likely be cost-effective to research.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669155794/mirroredImages/Nb2HnrqG4nkjCqmRg/qnpacsi2ftgqx7jhltej.png\"><figcaption>There is always a relevant XKCD</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> writes <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">cost-effectiveness analyses</a> to calculate and present how much good we can expect to do by donating to different charities. One of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CuuCGzuzwD6cdu9mo/methods-for-improving-uncertainty-analysis-in-ea-cost\">most criticised components</a> of their process for this is that they do not quantify uncertainty, meaning we don't know how sure they are about the estimated effectiveness of the charities. Quantifying uncertainty offers several benefits. Here, we will focus on one of the most significant of these - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information\">value-of-information</a> analysis. We will also touch on how quantifying uncertainty can also improve calibration over time, communication and correctness.</p><p>We go through an example methodology for value-of-information analysis. We are uncertain about this exact methodology but believe value of information could be a helpful measure in the research pipeline, whether formally or informally calculated.</p><h2><strong>Uncertainty in the Cost-Effectiveness of GiveWell Charities</strong></h2><p>Our methodology for quantifying uncertainty in each of GiveWell's Top Charity CEAs are in the Supplemental Notebooks section below, alongside sensitivity analysis, per-country breakdowns, and additional considerations. In quantifying the uncertainty in these, we have attempted to be as faithful as possible to GiveWell's current CEAs. The purpose of this decision was primarily to investigate the impact of uncertainty quantification alone. We discuss other alterations that could be made in the Possible improvements to GiveWell models section.</p><p>After <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@hazelfire/quantifying-uncertainty-in-givewell-ceas#cell-145\">quantifying uncertainty in GiveWell top charities</a>, we have found that the cost-effectivenesses of <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.malariaconsortium.org/\">Malaria Consortium</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newincentives.org/\">New Incentives</a>, and <a href=\"https://helenkellerintl.org/\">Helen Keller International</a> (all from <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell's top charity list</a>) in '<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/estimating-moral-weights/\">doubling of consumption</a> year equivalents per dollar' (DCYE/$) are distributed as follows.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669155794/mirroredImages/Nb2HnrqG4nkjCqmRg/rsryhcytxhpxkeljxutu.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_150 150w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_450 450w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_750 750w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_1050 1050w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_1200 1200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_1350 1350w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b08088dc637fa14fededd5a6e440bcd4bdd7e51dfc77068c.png/w_1462 1462w\"><figcaption>Probability Distributions for the cost effectiveness of GiveWell charities.</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);border-bottom:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);padding:3px 6.5px 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:bottom\">Intervention</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);border-bottom:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);padding:3px 6.5px 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:bottom\">GiveWell</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);border-bottom:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);padding:3px 6.5px 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:bottom\">Our Mean</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);border-bottom:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);padding:3px 6.5px 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:bottom\">95% CI</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(210, 75%, 60%);border-bottom:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);padding:3px var(--length3) 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:bottom\">Diference</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-bottom:1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238);padding:4px 6.5px 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:top\">Against Malaria Foundation</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238);padding:4px 6.5px 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:top\">0.0375</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238);padding:4px 6.5px 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:top\">0.0384</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1px solid rgb(238, 238, 238);padding:4px 6.5px 3px var(--length2);vertical-align:top\">0.0234 -

It communicates the conventional decisions - GiveWell's top charities are at least 10x as effective as GiveDirectly, with Helen Keller International claiming the highest expected value. If we aim to donate to the charity with the highest expected value, all else being equal, why go to all the fuss of quantifying uncertainty?</p><p>Information about uncertainty is important because GiveWell doesn't only make decisions about <i>what to donate to</i>, but more frequently about <i>what to research</i>. Quantifying uncertainty in research provides inbuilt information about whether and where further research in that area is needed. Knowing how uncertain we are about existing research allows us to calculate what research directions are (and perhaps more importantly, are <i>not</i>) worth pursuing in the future. This is called the '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information\">Value of Information</a>' and can be calculated by Value of Information Analysis.</p><h2><strong>Value of Information</strong></h2><p>We can calculate the cost-effectiveness of charities by how many \u2018<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/estimating-moral-weights/\">units of value</a>' they create per dollar, but we're uncertain about exactly how cost-effective each charity is. One way to navigate this is to present effectiveness values as probability distributions, showing how likely each possible value is the be the actual cost-effectiveness value for a given charity.</p><p>If we want to donate to the charity that can do the most good with our money, we could</p><blockquote><p>a) donate to the charity we expect to be the most cost-effective based on our current best guesses (which, in this case, would be Helen Keller International); or</p><p>b) do more research so we can (hypothetically) know the actual effectiveness of the charities. For simplicity, let's imagine we could eliminate <i>all</i> uncertainty about <i>all</i> charities with this research.</p></blockquote><p>We call the value we expect to get from knowing the effectiveness of a charity for sure, \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value_of_perfect_information\">Expected Value of Perfect Information</a>,\u201d or just \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information#:~:text=In%20a%20perfect%20information%20scenario,information%20including%20consulting%20cost%20c.\">Value of Information</a>.\" It\u2019s equal to the difference between the amount of good we expect we could do with that knowledge and what we expect we could do without it. The concept of the Value of Information is intuitive and many questions relating to it can be answered without calculations. In the context of decision-making, information is more valuable when:</p><ul><li>It is more likely to change our mind about something, in a way that allows us to create more value with the decision</li><li>The decision being made has higher consequences - a greater potential for producing value or harm, given the resources devoted to it</li></ul><p>\"Cost Ratio\" is the maximum portion of a decision-maker's budget they could spend on obtaining this perfect information without the cost outweighing the expected benefit. Of course, this hypothetical research project does not perfectly reflect reality. No research project ever <i>completely</i> eliminates uncertainty. For this reason, the cost ratio could be considered a good <i>upper bound</i> for the amount worth spending on research into a given area. <a href=\"https://www.howtomeasureanything.com/\">Douglas W. Hubbard of Hubbard Decision Research</a> recommends spending but a tenth of this amount.</p><p>We call case (a) - where we donate to the expected best charity without researching - the \"uniformed state.\" In this state, we only know the effectiveness of each charity as a probability distribution. The maximum cost-effectiveness we could expect to obtain in the uninformed state (U), in units of value per dollar, is simply the highest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\">expected value</a> of all the interventions considered:</p><blockquote><p>If&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"X_1, ..., X_n\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.024em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

For instance, if we have $100,000 to donate, and a cost ratio of 20%, then the maximum amount it would be worth spending on research to eliminate all uncertainty would be $20,000. This should be considered an upper bound for research expenditure because in reality, we can only ever reduce uncertainty, which is necessarily less valuable. Consequently, we recommend a more conservative approach of spending closer to a tenth of the cost ratio on research (value of imperfect information). In this case, that means spending no more than $2,000 on research.</p><p>We use calculus to show what these values mean and how we could calculate them in terms of probability density functions, and look at the special case of investigating only one charity at a time in the appendix.</p><p>We can also sample real distributions to calculate this in Squiggle!</p><pre><code>voi(c) = mean(SampleSet.mapN(c, {|xs| max(xs)}))\nvou(c) = max(map(c, {|x| mean(x)}))\nvpi(x) = voi(x) - vou(x)\ncharities = [givedirectly, helen_keller_international, new_incentives, malaria_consortium, amf_effectiveness]\nvpi(charities)\t// Returns 7.74\u00b710-3</code></pre><p>This is the expected units of value per dollar gained by eliminating all uncertainty in all charities. However, whether we should research to reduce uncertainty is dependent on two factors:</p><ul><li>Research costs - information that would cost more of our finite resources to acquire should be justified by a higher value of information.</li><li>Size of investment - the greater the amount of money or other resources a decision is directing, the more important it is for that decision to be informed.</li></ul><p>Now, we can calculate the cost ratio, or proportion of GiveWell's budget it would be worth devoting to research that would reduce uncertainty in their Top Charities, relative to the cost of this research:</p><pre><code>vpi_cost(x) = {\n  my_voi = voi(x)\n  cost_ratio = (my_voi - vou(x)) / my_voi\n  cost_ratio\n}\nvpi_cost(charities) // Returns 0.113</code></pre><p>This means that GiveWell should spend no more than 11.3% of their budget on researching this their current Top Charities. This number is assuming that research would acquire perfect information. As this would not be the case and research would only decrease uncertainty, 10% of this value, or 1.13% of GiveWell's budget, may be a more appropriate amount.</p><p>We can also calculate the value of information on each GiveWell Top Charity individually. We do this by assuming the charities that we don't want to research have already reduced all their uncertainty and are set to their expected value, such that there is no value of researching any charity other than that/those selected<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefydsvr6g26zf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnydsvr6g26zf\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Charity under Research</td><td>VPI Cost ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Against Malaria Foundation</td><td>0.4%</td></tr><tr><td>GiveDirectly</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Helen Keller International</td><td>0.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Malaria Consortium</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>New Incentives</td><td>10.3%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>This indicates that it's valuable to reduce the uncertainty of current GiveWell top charities (at least, assuming the uncertainties specified in the supplemental notebooks). However, GiveWell is also focused on new interventions. Below is an example of how we evaluate the value of information for a new intervention.</p><h2><strong>Evaluating New Interventions, a Case Study with the </strong><a href=\"https://hamlin.org.au/\"><strong>Catherine Hamlin Fistula Foundation</strong></a></h2><p>GiveWell has previously <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/Fistula-Foundation\">investigated the Fistula Foundation</a>, evaluating the effectiveness of surgically <i>treating</i> obstetric fistulas in low-income countries, seemingly considering both the quality of life detriments and loss of income engendered by fistulas. However, the Catherine Hamlin Fistula foundation, which may be easily overlooked because of its similarity to the Fistula Foundation in name and approach to treatment, is a different charity which focuses on treatment but also prevention and rehabilitation.</p><p>Quantifying uncertainty allows us to evaluate this charity, using rough numbers and informed guesses to give us an idea of cost-effectiveness. This can then inform a quick value of information analysis indicating how valuable further research into this intervention is likely to be.</p><p>Hannah Rokebrand has used this method to do a rough three-day analysis of CHFF's cost-effectiveness.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669155795/mirroredImages/Nb2HnrqG4nkjCqmRg/xlxnzskvepskrkvovymy.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_120 120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_240 240w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_360 360w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_720 720w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_840 840w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_960 960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_1080 1080w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/77d8e9f2f4b213e100c1606fc2abbe2c4edce9366380e6b2.png/w_1122 1122w\"></figure><p>CHFF expected value: 0.057 doubling of consumption years equivalent</p><p>The above probability distributions show the probable cost-effectiveness values of three GiveWell top charities and the Catherine Hamlin Fistula Foundation in 'doubling of consumption year equivalents per dollar'.

Green blocks are moral parameters, horizontal bar is in percentage points of budget.</figcaption></figure><p>The calculations run in Squiggle find the cost ratio of researching each parameter contributing to our calculations of CHFF's cost-effectiveness. These indicate that the average number of midwives trained per year (<code>midwives_trained_per_year</code>) and <code>portion_of_career_midwife_not_with_chff</code> are the most impactful parameter for us to research to bring us closer to the true cost-effectiveness of CHFF.</p><h2><strong>Other Benefits of Uncertainty Quantification</strong></h2><p>Although we are fans of the value of information, there are several other benefits to uncertainty quantification, some of which we'll mention here.</p><h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3><p>Every measurement or observation we make is subject to uncertainty, and cannot know our calculated values to a greater level of certainty than the observed values from which they were calculated. Researchers commonly use error bars to help communicate the degree of this uncertainty so that we can compare and weigh different sources of evidence and consider the probability of results arising from the factors to which they are attributed, rather than random chance.</p><p>Quantifying uncertainty in the form of distributions also retains a dimensionality obscured by error bars. Distributions have a <i>shape</i> and can be combined in calculations to give us the shapes of distributions for calculated parameters, far more easily and precisely than current conventional methods of accounting for uncertainty.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/09/08/renaming-top-charities-fund/\">a post</a> explaining a name change of GiveWell's fund for the most rigorously evaluated charities meeting its cost-effectiveness bar, a new criteria of inclusion in the fund is highlighted: \"that we have a high degree of confidence in our expectations about the impact of their programs.\"</p><p>It may also be noteworthy that GiveWell has \"introduced a new giving option, the All Grants Fund. The All Grants Fund supports the full range of GiveWell\u2019s grantmaking and can be allocated to any grant that meets our cost-effectiveness bar \u2014 including opportunities outside of our top charities and riskier grants with high expected value.\"</p><p>We believe quantifying uncertainty may ease decisions about inclusion and exclusion from the Top Charities list, as well as communication about these decisions. This communication could potentially highlight uncertain but high expected value opportunities for individuals or organisations with lower risk aversion to consider.</p><h3><strong>Calibration</strong></h3><p>In some types of research, we need to estimate parameters that are difficult or impossible to measure, such as how we should weigh different sources of evidence, or the value we assign to lives saved compared to economic gains. Charity cost-effectiveness analyses are a prime example of this. Many of GiveWell's parameters are \"best guesses\" based on the information available to them at the time. If these values were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting\">forecast</a> as \"we are 95% confident that this value lies between x and y,\" rather than \"we expect this value to be z, but this is a rough estimate,\" these forecasts could be updated by further research and the scale of these updates could be used to calibrate future estimates and form a record of reliability for GiveWell's estimates, as we do with other types of forecasters.</p><h3><strong>Correctness</strong></h3><p>GiveWell aims to maximise the expected value of the charity to which they most heavily donate (with reasonable confidence), but they calculate the final expected values of charities by doing calculations with the expected values of the parameters contributing to it.

This may be worthwhile to avoid <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/optimizer-s-curse\">optimizer's curse</a>.</p><p><strong>More Information on GiveWell Funding Decisions</strong></p><p>One improvement we hope to make in our Value of Information Analysis is a better model of how GiveWell makes allocation decisions. We have been unable to find publicly-available, detailed information about how GiveWell decides where to allocate its funds, although an <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/our-giving-funds\">overview</a> of their system is available. We expect GiveWell may provide grants for the intervention they expect to have the greatest impact in each country they target, in which case the country-level estimates presented in our supplemental notebooks may be more applicable than the global aggregates used here. Pairing country-level data with the funding gap for each charity in each region would likely yield a higher value of information estimates than those in this notebook.</p><p><strong>More Considerate Choices of Distributions</strong></p><p>Currently, our uncertainty quantifications have been shaped by an aesthetic bias. This means that if a cost-effectiveness calculation presented itself with a significant probability in the negative, or extremely long tails, we assumed we were in error and 'fixed' the source of this unaesthetic presentation. It may be however, that the distributions are not nearly so aesthetic. When quantifying uncertainty, we found that the maths around 'other actors' and counterfactual donations could create somewhat poorly-behaved distributions.</p><p>Our analyses also currently use beta distributions for proportions and lognormal distributions for most other parameters. These choices was may not have been the most appropriate. We'd in interested in considering other distributions in the future.</p><p><strong>Moral Uncertainty</strong></p><p>GiveWell CEAs typically quantify the good done by an intervention in terms of the intervention's primary objective, e.g. lives saved. However, to make the cost-effectiveness of different interventions comparable, these are then converted into a general \"unit of value.\"</p><p>GiveDirectly is a charity with a highly researched and economic-based (objective) impact, which gives it a comparatively low-uncertainty cost-effectiveness value. Because of this, GiveWell generally measures the effectiveness of other programs they evaluate against GiveDirectly, and incorporate its units ('doubling of consumption years') in the universal units of value, into which all other programs' cost-effectivenesses are converted - 'doubling of consumption year equivalents per dollar' (DCYE per dollar).</p><p>This <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xFvjzL8eM2Mg8yH9Jr3EJH1iE2ZedOEiNPKBCHgJJC4/edit#gid=1198731594\">conversion process</a> requires answering tough questions like \"how much do we value saving the life of a four year-old child compared to that of his 32 year-old mother, compared doubling the spending power of a family in poverty?\"</p><p>For example, the value GiveWell assigns averting one death of a child under 5 from malaria is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=1362437801\">116.9 DCYEs</a>. This implies GiveWell's CEA's value averting this death equivalently to doubling consumption for 116.9 person-years. As explained in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8whqn2GrJfvTjhov6/measuring-good-better-1\">this talk</a>, these figures are determined by a combination of GiveWell staff opinion, a GiveWell donor survey, and an IDInsight survey of beneficiary preferences (low-income individuals in Ghana and Kenya).</p><p>These moral weights are often the most contentious part of a GiveWell CEA, and can hold considerable uncertainty. One way of doing this would be worldview diversification, where we look into a range of possible values for moral parameters and optimise for the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/31934/chapter/267645210\">highest expected choice-worthiness</a>.</p><p>Future lines of research related to moral uncertainty where quantified uncertainty could be useful include:</p><p>Incorporating uncertainty about beneficiary preferences. When participants in the <a href=\"https://www.idinsight.org/project/using-peoples-preferences-and-values-to-inform-funding-decisions/\">IDInsight survey</a> were asked about the value of life, their answers differed significantly depending on how the question was phrased. From an 'individual perspective,' averting an under-5 death was considered worth the equivalent of $40,763, while the 'community perspective' phrasing elicited a value of $91,049.</p><p>High uncertainty, exacerbated by methodological concerns, may deter GiveWell from weighting survey data more heavily. We are not arguing that survey data <i>should</i> be weighted more heavily, but incorporating quantified uncertainty into the CEA may make analysts more comfortable with weighing the data more heavily where warranted.</p><ul><li>Determining the value of information on the moral weights parameters. Obtaining this moral information if it is shown to be an effective use of GiveWell researchers' time, might include commissioning further beneficiary preference surveys, seeking preferences from a larger sample of stakeholders, spending more time on high-level considerations (e.g., using <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/estimating-moral-weights/\">WELLBYs</a>).</li></ul><p><strong>Correlated Uncertainties</strong></p><p>To get estimates comparable to each other, GiveWell CEAs use many variables that are the same across different charities. These include moral variables such as the discount rate and the moral weights, as well as a number or adjustment factors.</p><p>Because each of our CEAs was built in its separate notebook. Variables that should have more correlated uncertainty do not correlate. This means that our value of information analysis, considers the situation where one charity has a higher moral weight for the value of a child under 5 than a different charity, which would be impossible and unfair. These inconsistencies also have implications unrelated to VoI.</p><p>To account for this, you may want to adjust our value of information estimates downwards. However, we're not sure about the extent of this adjustment.</p><p>Squiggle is capable of developing models with correlated uncertainty, however, we ran into performance issues with developing individual notebooks, and having all the notebooks relate to each other would likely only increase the problem.</p><h3><strong>Possible improvements to GiveWell models</strong></h3><p><strong>Integration over age brackets</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/09/28/granular-AMF/\">Nuno Sempere is to be credited with this idea, and may be able to explain it better</a>. As a language, Squiggle makes integration a lot easier. Nuno has <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BDXnNdBm6jwj6o5nc/five-slightly-more-hardcore-squiggle-models#A_sketch_of_a_more_parsimonious_estimate_of_AMF_s_impact\">an example here</a>.</p><p>Some of GiveWell's CEAs focus on age-dependent interventions, such as infant vaccination, and breakdown the impact of these by age group. We have considered converting this format into one where impact is continuously modelled across all ages. However, in our experience, this has proved difficult to apply to GiveWell CEAs for two main reasons.</p><ul><li>GiveWell CEAs, particularly for age-dependent interventions, frequently cite <a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/\">IMHE</a> data which presents statistics like disease prevalence and mortality for discrete (typically 4-year) age brackets, rather than as a continuous trends. Even if this date were presented more continuously, it's it would be in a form that could be easily incorporated into a formulaic model of impact by age.</li><li>GiveWell CEAs use the units of doubling of consumption year equivalents, which to our knowledge, are not used by any other major organisation and do not have a continuous formula behind them. Because the 'equivalent' component of a doubling of consumption year equivalent is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xFvjzL8eM2Mg8yH9Jr3EJH1iE2ZedOEiNPKBCHgJJC4/edit#gid=1198731594\">calculated</a> by a combination of the continuous DALY formula, and discrete data about large age brackets and the values of surveyed stakeholders, it is difficult to model these units continuously.</li></ul><p>This is not to say that the process would be impossible, but more work is needed for us to understand how to consistently do it in a way that would add information that isn't present in the discrete presentation.</p><p><strong>Dimensional Analysis</strong></p><p>Using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis#:~:text=In%20engineering%20and%20science%2C%20dimensional,kilometres%2C%20or%20pounds%20vs.\">Dimensional Analysis</a>, it's possible to identify implicit assumptions within a model that could be incorrect or missing. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmQwtYEajNDuPdyZx/type-checking-givewell-s-givedirectly-cost-effective\">Sam Nolan has done this with GiveDirectly</a>, identifying two implicit assumptions, and highlighting the potential for a continuous Present Value formula.</p><p>A Continuous Present Value formula models <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value\">present value</a> where there are no discrete payouts, but continuous payouts over time. This may model the situation better, as the present value is supposed to represent benefits that accrue over time and do not occur annually. However, the change has minimal impact on overall estimates of cost-effectiveness.</p><h2><strong>Supplemental Notebooks</strong></h2><p>Each intervention has its observable notebook that goes through the CEA calculations. As most top charities operate in multiple countries, the distributions shown in this notebook are global means. If we knew exactly what portion of a charity's budget would go to each country, we could refine our cost-effectiveness estimates or do a different analysis where we consider the most effective intervention-country pairing.</p><p>The supplemental notebooks, which account for most of our work on this project, and on which this notebook is built, are indexed below. They are in no way complete, and we are still trying to make them as accurate as they can be.</p><h3><a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@hazelfire/givewells-givedirectly-cost-effectiveness-analysis\"><strong>Uncertainty Quantification of GiveDirectly</strong></a></h3><p>Author: Sam Nolan</p><p>Sam Nolan has written <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ycLhq4Bmep8ssr4wR/quantifying-uncertainty-in-givewell-s-givedirectly-cost\">a post on the EA forum about this model</a>.

This is a simple example of the value of information that I made to demonstrate the concept. This notebook doesn't serve a role in any of the calculations or results.</p><h2><strong>Appendix: Value of Information with Calculus:</strong></h2><p>This is an example of a special case of VoI where we are comparing the cost-effectiveness of charities (no consideration of risk or profit, only value per dollar), investigating only <i>one</i> at a time (rather than eliminating all uncertainty in all options at once), although this method could be extended by comparing each of n charities to the new expected best charity for every iteration. Calculating the value of information for all charities in a set is important because it we always be greater than the value of information from investigating only one charity, and as such may be used as un upper bound for the possible value to be gained from researching the charities in the set. This is particularly useful for larger sets, and can be calculated almost instantly using Squiggle. However, in practice we are more likely to be making decisions about investigating one intervention at a time, and the concepts explored here may be more intuitive from this application.</p><p>Case (a) (Without Research)</p><p>The units of value per dollar we could expect to obtain in the uninformed state (U):</p><blockquote><p>If&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"C = \\{X_1, ..., X_n\\}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

We examined GiveWell\u2019s water quality intervention cost-effectiveness model for errors or methodological issues. We discovered five potential findings and developed approaches to correct for these findings as best as possible given limited available public data on some of these topics. Our major changes to the cost effectiveness analysis were:</p><ul><li>Redoing GiveWell's meta-analysis on the effect of water chlorination on all-cause mortality to include Haushofer et al, 2021. This increases the estimated mortality effect size by ~40%, but due to structure of GiveWell's analysis, has no independent effect on overall cost effectiveness.</li><li>Using the studies on water chlorination and illness to calculate a full probability distribution for the effect of chlorination on all-cause mortality, not just a biologically plausible maximum. Together with the updated meta-analysis, this reduces the cost effectiveness of the interventions by ~7% for in-line chlorination and ~17% for Dispensers for Safe Water.</li><li>Adjusting the moral weight calculations to account for deaths averted from non-waterborne illnesses. This reduces the cost effectiveness of the interventions by ~2%.</li><li>Revising the cost estimate for in-line chlorination to use intervention-specific estimates rather than reuse cost estimates from Dispensers for Safe Water. This increases the cost effectiveness of in-line chlorination by ~13%.</li><li>Discounting future spending and benefits to account for time delays between funding provision and health impacts. This reduces the cost effectiveness of the interventions by ~12% in the long term and ~5% in the short term.</li></ul><p>Using our updated approach, the cost-effectiveness of in-line chlorination falls by 0.21% and the cost-effectiveness estimate of Dispensers for Safe Water falls by 23%. Our results are incorporated into an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnuHlq4b0NSDjDmcEZ-79gjqrsQdi89zVn4ifSkPQ5k/edit#gid=1031252506\">updated version</a> of GiveWell\u2019s water quality cost-effectiveness model spreadsheet, where cells with updated input data are highlighted in red.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of death and illness worldwide, causing more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/diarrheal-diseases\"><u>1.5 million deaths annually</u></a>. Since diarrheal diseases are commonly spread by contaminated water, interventions that clean water are natural areas of interest within global health. For many years, the evidence base on clean water interventions was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions/November-2013-version\"><u>small and relatively mixed</u></a>, leading GiveWell to not choose water quality as an area to make significant grants in. However, in 2022, economists Michael Kremer, Stephen Luby, Ricardo Maertens, Brandon Tan, and Witold Wi\u0119cek published a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BFI_WP_2022-26.pdf\"><u>Meta-Analysis</u></a> on water treatment interventions' impact. The authors found that water quality interventions led to major (~25%) reductions in all-cause child mortality, and that they are likely highly cost-effective methods of improving well-being.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkno7bjz0qdt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkno7bjz0qdt\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In response, GiveWell\u2019s staff undertook their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/04/06/water-quality-overview/#Whatledustoupdate\"><u>own updated analysis of water quality interventions</u></a>, concluding that water quality interventions led to a smaller (~14%) but still highly impactful reduction in child mortality, and that they are somewhere between four and nine times as effective as unconditional cash transfers at improving well-being. Based on these results, GiveWell provided a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-dispensers-for-safe-water-January-2022\"><u>$64.7 million grant</u></a> to Evidence Action\u2019s Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW) program in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The two water quality interventions that GiveWell examines in its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnuHlq4b0NSDjDmcEZ-79gjqrsQdi89zVn4ifSkPQ5k/edit#gid=1031252506\"><u>cost-effectiveness analysis</u></a> (CEA) are DSW and in-line chlorination (ILC). Both of these interventions work by adding a small amount of chlorine to drinking water to kill pathogens. DSW&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-dispensers-for-safe-water-January-2022#Dispensers_to_chlorinate_water\"><u>involves</u></a> placing chlorine dispensers next to water sources and teaching communities about the process and importance of using them, so that individuals can add chlorine to containers of water after filling them. ILC&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.evidenceaction.org/accelerator/\"><u>involves</u></a> adding chlorination systems in-line with the water sources, so that dispensed water is automatically chlorinated. In addition to these interventions, several studies have also tested the provision of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions#Randomized_controlled_trials\"><u>storage containers</u></a> designed to keep water clean after filling them, but GiveWell does not examine this type of intervention in its CEA.&nbsp;</p><p>Water quality interventions do not simply improve well-being by decreasing child mortality; they also improve well-being by decreasing adult mortality, decreasing health spending, creating economic benefits, and decreasing morbidity (time spent sick). GiveWell\u2019s CEA for water quality interventions attempts to account for all these benefits, estimating that approximately 30% of the benefits are provided by each of reducing child and adult mortality, approximately 20% of the benefits are provided by each of development effects and reduced medical costs, and a trivial fraction of the benefits are provided by reduced morbidity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftc78edp00fl\"><sup><a href=\"#fntc78edp00fl\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It is important to note that water quality interventions have been found to reduce death due to both waterborne and non-waterborne diseases, perhaps due to negative health effects of waterborne diseases making people more susceptible to other illnesses. This effect has been observed in a large number of contexts for water quality interventions, and is referred to as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions#Studies_of_historical_water_quality_improvements\"><u>Mills-Reincke phenomenon</u></a>. The Mills-Reincke effect is quite significant for the interventions in GiveWell\u2019s CEA, with GiveWell estimating that water chlorination eliminates approximately <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxRfhPnTBJ_UYAeoAyVd8u6Orxh4pR9hB3wvdfZcXFs/edit#gid=1674952052&amp;range=A23\">2.7 child deaths</a> from non-waterborne disease for every death averted from waterborne disease. This effect is accounted for in GiveWell\u2019s benefit estimates on child and adult mortality and medical costs averted.&nbsp;</p><p>To complete the benefit side of the CEA, GiveWell applies moral weights to the effects of the intervention and applies downside adjustments to account for issues such as wastage and displacing other donors\u2019 funding. GiveWell\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxRfhPnTBJ_UYAeoAyVd8u6Orxh4pR9hB3wvdfZcXFs/edit#gid=1362437801\"><u>moral weights</u></a> are based on the type of benefit (mortality, morbidity, or monetary), as well as the age and income of the recipient. While the weights are standardized between all of GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness analyses, applying them requires understanding the demographics of an intervention\u2019s beneficiaries. GiveWell\u2019s downside adjustments for water quality interventions are more ad-hoc, with justifications of \u201csubjective guess\u201d or \u201cwe would guess\u201d underlying several numeric values.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxhl3btpu7x\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxhl3btpu7x\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In particular, GiveWell applies a 10% downside adjustment to account for decreasing household sizes (which could cause fewer children under 5 to be reached than estimated), a 5% upside adjustment to account for possible positive spillover effects, and a 2-10% negative adjustment to account for other donors possibly funding water quality interventions if GiveWell did not.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgq52id9m7yc\"><sup><a href=\"#fngq52id9m7yc\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>The cost side of GiveWell\u2019s CEA for water quality interventions is based on available data for DSW. The interventions have fixed costs for installation and removal of the chlorination systems, as well as ongoing maintenance costs. As a result, the cost per person per year of a given intervention depends on the duration that the systems remain installed and operational. GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness analysis considers two cases: short-term and long-term. The short-term case is related to GiveWell\u2019s grant to Evidence Action in 2022, which covered 4 years of operation in Uganda and Malawi and 3 years of operation in Kenya, assuming that the program would be shut down at the end of the grant. The long-term cost is based on an assumed 10-year life of the equipment, and generally leads to lower cost per person impacted per year estimates than the short term case.&nbsp;</p><p>For the GiveWell Change Our Minds contest, we chose to examine GiveWell\u2019s water quality intervention CEA for potential improvements. We were especially interested in water quality interventions as one of the newest areas considered by GiveWell, and one not examined by Alex Bates in his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6dtwkwBrHBGtc3xes/a-critical-review-of-givewell-s-2022-cost-effectiveness\"><u>deep dive</u></a> into GiveWell\u2019s CEAs. We kept the basic structure of the CEA the same, looking for any places where we thought GiveWell\u2019s CEA was inconsistent with its standard approach or otherwise did not follow best practices. The next section discusses the 5 potential issues we identified within the water quality CEA, and the subsequent sections discuss the overall impact and implications of these potential issues. Our updated parameters and results are located in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnuHlq4b0NSDjDmcEZ-79gjqrsQdi89zVn4ifSkPQ5k/edit#gid=1031252506\"><u>copy of GiveWell\u2019s water quality CEA spreadsheet</u></a>, and additional technical data is provided in the appendices to this writeup.&nbsp;</p><h1>Potential Issues Found</h1><h2>Not Including Haushofer et al. (2021) in GiveWell\u2019s Meta-Analysis</h2><p>GiveWell\u2019s meta-analysis for the effect of water chlorination on all-cause mortality in children under 5 excludes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w29447\"><u>Haushofer et al. (2021)</u></a>. We think that this decision is most likely incorrect, and the decision to exclude the study biases their conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p>GiveWell gives two reasons why they exclude the Haushofer 2021 study from their meta-analysis:</p><ol><li>It studies the same intervention (Kenya WASH-B) as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29396219/\"><u>Null et al. (2018)</u></a>, so including it would cause the studies in the meta-analysis to not be independent.</li><li>GiveWell considers the effect size too large to be reasonable.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrslibl1cqec\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrslibl1cqec\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>We think that neither of these reasons are a reasonable justification for excluding this study.</p><p>Both Null 2018 and Haushofer 2021 are based on chlorine dispensers randomly assigned to villages during the Kenya WASH-B study,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefex9t7rthe1h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnex9t7rthe1h\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but this alone is not a good reason to exclude the study. Fundamentally, this concern would be equally well addressed by removing Null 2018 and including Haushofer 2021, so it cannot give any grounds for preferring one study over the other.&nbsp;</p><p>We also think that there is less overlap between the two studies than GiveWell suggests. The primary analysis in Haushofer 2021 does not include households who participated in the WASH-B study, and they also report subgroup analyses \"excluding all children of mothers with any children born within one year of WASH-B\". There should be no overlap in participants between the Null 2018 results and the Haushofer 2021 results for this subgroup, minimizing the correlation between the two studies. We therefore think it is appropriate to treat the Null 2018 results and Haushofer 2021 subgroup results as independent in our updated meta-analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>The second reason, that the reported effect size is implausibly large, contradicts current best practice for meta-analysis. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-10-3\"><u>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</u></a> states</p><blockquote><p>In general it is unwise to exclude studies from a meta-analysis on the basis of their results as this may introduce bias.</p></blockquote><p>Excluding studies for having too large of an effect runs the risk of biasing the results downward. We think a better approach is to include all the studies in the meta-analysis, regardless of outcome, and to incorporate additional information about the expected effectiveness of water chlorination using a Bayesian framework. This is the approach we adopt, and we discuss the Bayesian framework in more detail in the next section.&nbsp;</p><p>We therefore updated GiveWell\u2019s meta-analysis to include the results of Haushofer 2021. We took the Haushofer 2021 results that exclude \u201call children of mothers with any children born within one year of WASH-B\" and that are not conditioned on pre-intervention mortality rate (Table 7, column 4). Haushofer 2021 reported their results as the change in mortality rate between control and intervention arms. We translated this result into a log relative risk using the baseline mortality rate provided in the text (2.23%) and assuming an equal number of individuals in the control and intervention arms. This led to a calculated log relative risk for all-cause mortality in children under 5 of -1.39 +/- 0.56. In the updated meta-analysis, the large uncertainty in the result means that Haushofer 2021 contributes only 5% to the total weight.&nbsp;</p><p>Including Haushofer 2021 shifts the mortality effect size from a 14% reduction to a 19% reduction, a 42% increase.</p><h2>Using a Maximum Plausible Effect Size Instead of a Bayesian Framework</h2><p>GiveWell's analysis calculates the reduction of all-cause mortality due to water chlorination in two ways:</p><ol><li>Directly, using the results of randomized controlled trials measuring the effect of water chlorination on all-cause mortality.</li><li>Indirectly, using estimates of the effect of water chlorination on diarrhea morbidity and assumptions about the relationship between diarrhea morbidity and all-cause mortality to calculate a \"maximum plausible mortality reduction\"</li></ol><p>The overall estimate for the effect of water chlorination on all-cause mortality is&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

Does this correspond to the upper end of the 90% confidence interval, the 95% confidence interval, or something else?</li><li>While generous assumptions are made for the Mills-Reincke effect and how changes in diarrhea morbidity could affect diarrhea mortality, only the point estimate for the effect of water chlorination on diarrhea morbidity is used. When calculating a plausible upper limit, we think it would be much more appropriate to use the 95% upper confidence limit for the effect of water chlorination on morbidity.</li><li>More generally, we think the approach of only using the indirect estimate to set a hard upper cap on the mortality reduction is incorrect. We think that a better approach is to treat both the indirect and direct approaches as independent estimates of the mortality reduction, each with their own probability distribution, and select the estimate that maximizes the combined probability distribution from both approaches. This allows all the information from both lines of evidence to be considered at the same time. GiveWell takes a similar approach in their CEA for deworming interventions, in which they use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLbeSws1PcIQ6RpzG-iGZYfTLc98cmm0K4zWNhqaQoQ/edit\"><u>Bayesian methods</u></a> to combine data sets on deworming\u2019s short-term and long-term impacts.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>We therefore implemented our own combined analysis of the direct- and indirect- estimates using R and Stan. The code for this model is available on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/secondhandmaps/WQ-CEA-Analysis/blob/main/modeling_mortality_effect_via_stan_v3.R\"><u>github</u></a>, and the summarized results are included in our updated cost effectiveness&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnuHlq4b0NSDjDmcEZ-79gjqrsQdi89zVn4ifSkPQ5k/edit#gid=798836071\"><u>spreadsheet</u></a>. Our model follows the approach used in the current GiveWell CEA spreadsheet, but replaces the point estimates and upper confidence limits with explicit probability distributions for the parameters of interest. We also added two additional correction factors to the indirect estimate: an adjustment for the different levels of adherence in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004794.pub3/full\"><u>Clasen et al., 2015 meta-analysis for morbidity</u></a> and GiveWell's meta-analysis for mortality, and an algebraic correction for diarrheal diseases and other affected illnesses being more common in areas with lower levels of water treatment. A more in-depth discussion of the parameters in our model is provided in Appendix 1.&nbsp;</p><p>The combined effect of the updated meta-analysis and the Bayesian modeling is a 7-21% decrease in the estimated percent reduction in under-5 all-cause mortality and a 18-24% increase in the estimated percent reduction in under-5 morbidity due to diarrheal disease.&nbsp;</p><h2>Inconsistent Treatment of the Mills-Reincke Phenomenon</h2><p>In GiveWell\u2019s CEA, the Mills-Reincke phenomenon is used to explain the large reduction in all-cause mortality despite the low impact of water chlorination on diarrhea morbidity.&nbsp; However, the Mills-Reincke phenomenon is applied inconsistently to other areas of the analysis. We identified two additional areas where the Mills-Reincke phenomenon should be accounted for in the analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>First, GiveWell does not account for the Mills-Reincke effect was calculating the moral value of each death averted. Because GiveWell assigns different moral values to differently aged individuals, the moral values depend on the age distribution of deaths averted. GiveWell currently calculates moral values and number of deaths averted separately for people under 5 and over 5, but there are significant differences in moral values within these two categories. Currently, GiveWell calculates the moral value per death averted assuming that all deaths are caused by enteric infections (diarrheal diseases, typhoid, and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella in the <a href=\"http://ihmeuw.org/5wg0\">Global Burden of Disease dataset</a>). However, the Mills-Reincke effect means that enteric infections accounts for only a minority of deaths averted. Properly accounting for causes other than enteric infection shifts the age distribution of deaths averted, therefore changing the moral values. Because many of the deaths averted via the Mills-Reincke phenomenon are in neonates, which GiveWell assigns a lower moral weight than children aged 1-4, accounting for causes of death other than enteric infection lowers the average moral weight of each under-5 death averted by approximately 3%.</p><p>Second, GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness analysis applies a constant Mills-Reincke adjustment factor to the medical costs averted across all 3 countries. We replaced this constant factor with country- and intervention-specific adjustment factors that account for the relative prevalence of enteric infection morbidity and other infectious disease morbidity in the different countries. Using country-specific morbidity factors leads to a 1-30% reduction in the medical costs averted.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lack of Discounting Over Duration of Intervention</h2><p>GiveWell\u2019s CEA for water quality interventions treats both costs and benefits as if they happen immediately. However, both chlorine dispensers and in-line water chlorination systems are durable goods that deliver their benefits over a longer time period, which GiveWell assumes is approximately 10 years. Costs occur at the start of the intervention for equipment installation and project scaling up, during the intervention for maintenance, and at the end of the intervention for equipment removal and project scaling down. At the same time, the benefits of the intervention occur over the full time period the equipment is installed.&nbsp;</p><p>We think that the long duration of the intervention has several implications for the overall cost-effectiveness analysis. First, since not all the costs accrue in the first year of operation, we think that GiveWell should apply a discount factor to the later costs to account for the lower cost of future spending relative to current spending. Second, since the rate of deaths due to diarrheal disease in sub-Saharan Africa is decreasing, we think GiveWell should decrease the expected benefits of the intervention after the first year to account for this decreasing trend. Third, since some of the benefits of water quality interventions accrue in future years, we think that GiveWell should apply a discount factor to these benefits for consistency with how future benefits are modeled in other GiveWell analyses.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671302916/mirroredImages/6cJM2pWH8dz9TnBRy/c9osjrdncnabhfc1go3i.png\"></p><p><strong>Figure 1: Annual Diarrhea Deaths Per 100,000 Individuals, Sub-Saharan Africa (GBD)</strong></p><p>For other interventions, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=1176773164\"><u>New Incentives</u></a>, GiveWell both decreases its estimates of future effectiveness of an intervention based on expected future changes in disease burden and applies discount rates to the value of future lives saved and future economic benefits. GiveWell\u2019s standard value for discounting future lives saved is 0.5%/year,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp3cxslc287\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp3cxslc287\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and GiveWell\u2019s standard value for discounting future economic benefits is 4%/year.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu05iv94niv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu05iv94niv\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The discount factor for changes in disease burden depends on the expected trajectory of diarrheal illness rates absent additional interventions from GiveWell. As shown in Figure 1, the rate of deaths due to diarrheal disease in Sub-Saharan Africa has fallen significantly over the past two decades, with a consistent trend. We estimate the rate of decrease at 5.13%/year, meaning that in 10 years, we would expect that even without additional interventions from GiveWell, the rate of deaths due to diarrheal disease would be approximately 60% of what it is today.&nbsp;</p><p>We are not aware of a consistent methodology used by GiveWell to compare present and future costs. For this analysis, we assumed that GiveWell\u2019s discount rate on the value of its own spending is 4% per year, the same as how it values present vs. future economic benefits for aid recipients. However, this value is an extremely coarse estimate, and we recommend that GiveWell use a value that best reflects their estimated balance between the value of present and future dollars. Since installation costs are paid in the first year of the intervention, their cost should not be discounted. Maintenance costs are paid each year of the intervention, but GiveWell\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-dispensers-for-safe-water-January-2022#The_grant\"><u>current grants</u></a> to Evidence Action\u2019s Dispensers for Safe Water initiative cover 3-4 years of maintenance costs up-front. As a result, we assumed that 3 years of maintenance costs are always paid up-front. Since exit costs are paid in the last year of the intervention they should be fully discounted.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Table 1.

The discounting adjustment factor is the ratio between the discounted benefits and the discounted costs, and the adjusted benefit of the intervention is computed by multiplying the raw benefit by the adjustment factor. Due to the combination of spending being somewhat front-loaded and diarrheal disease rates falling at a faster rate than the rate at which we assumed costs were discounted, all discounting adjustment factors were computed to be less than one. The adjustment factors used are summarized in Table 1. The net impact of discounting is approximately a 5% reduction in short-term effectiveness (assuming a 4-year intervention life) and a 12% reduction in long-term effectiveness (assuming a 10-year intervention life).&nbsp;</p><h2>Reuse of Cost Numbers from DSW for ILC&nbsp;</h2><p>GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness analysis for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxRfhPnTBJ_UYAeoAyVd8u6Orxh4pR9hB3wvdfZcXFs/edit#gid=1680005064\"><u>in-line chlorination in Kenya</u></a> currently directly reuses cost numbers for Dispensers for Safe Water In Kenya, which is likely to have substantially different costs relative to in-line chlorination.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg59t15vs5on\"><sup><a href=\"#fng59t15vs5on\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Our best guess is that this re-use is intentional, perhaps due to a lack of high-quality cost data for in-line chlorination in Kenya. However, the lack of cost data specific to in-line chlorination does not appear to be documented in comments on the CEA spreadsheet, and no information is given in on either the \u201cILC Kenya\u201d or \u201cResults Summary\u201d tabs indicating that the ILC cost-effectiveness estimate is likely a coarser estimate than the DSW cost-effectiveness analysis. Moreover, GiveWell has referenced this cost estimate in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/sources/blog-post/water-quality-overview\"><u>writing on its website</u></a> without providing the context behind it. We think this may lead to confusion around the cost-effectiveness of ILC, especially since there is some evidence that ILC may in fact be cheaper to operate than DSW. &nbsp;</p><p>We conducted a basic literature review to identify information about the costs of ILC systems in previous trials. Evidence we consulted indicates that the average cost of commercially available chlorinators was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c08580#:~:text=The%20capital%20cost%20of%20commercially,USD%2C%20adjusted%20for%20inflation).\"><u>$140/system</u></a>. From&nbsp;<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2f12x5f1#page=54\"><u>limited case study information</u></a>, installing a chlorinator requires 1-6 person-hours, which would likely cost &lt;$10 at prevailing wages in Kenya. Data on operating costs is limited, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118397\"><u>research in Bangladesh</u></a> has suggested that annual operating costs for ILC systems would be in the range of $1.20/household/year for a household size of 4.6 people. Assuming a 10-year lifetime, installation costs $150 above DSW, exit costs $10 above DSW, and a 20% addition above the maintenance cost estimate from the Bangladesh study, this estimate indicates that the cost per person per year of ILC in Kenya is $1.48, compared to $1.68 for DSW. This would lead to a 13% increase in the cost-effectiveness estimate for ILC. However, this is a rough cost estimate based on limited literature, and we do not think it should be taken with high confidence. Rather, we think it indicates the extent to which ILC\u2019s costs are much less certain than DSW\u2019s. It may be that the DSW values are indeed the best current estimate of costs for ILC, but we think that if so, GiveWell should make this reuse clear in its documentation.</p><h1>Updated Results</h1><p>Our results are incorporated into an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnuHlq4b0NSDjDmcEZ-79gjqrsQdi89zVn4ifSkPQ5k/edit#gid=1031252506\"><u>updated version</u></a> of GiveWell\u2019s water quality cost-effectiveness model spreadsheet.

This result is the opposite of what we expected when we started the project, as our initial exploration of the topic area made us think that GiveWell was likely underestimating the cost effectiveness of water chlorination. We were surprised as we investigated more thoroughly that our analysis showed the opposite.&nbsp;</p><p>While we found several areas of disagreement with GiveWell\u2019s analysis, our examination of the CEA made us more convinced that the overall approach is sound and that water chlorination has a noticeable impact on all-cause mortality. Our five areas of improvement are all focused on improving how specific values within the CEA are calculated, rather than reconsidering the fundamental assumptions behind the CEA.&nbsp;</p><p>As two outsiders, we found GiveWell\u2019s water quality CEA to be clearly explained and deeply researched. But at the same time, it is clear that the water quality CEA is newer and therefore less well developed than the CEAs for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=1377543212\"><u>GiveWell\u2019s top charities</u></a>. The benefits from medical costs averted and development effects appear to have been investigated in much less detail than the mortality benefits, even though these two mechanisms account for an equal amount of value as the deaths averted.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefstw2r28mh5f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnstw2r28mh5f\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Similarly, the downside adjustments and cost estimates appear more superficial than in GiveWell\u2019s other CEAs. Many of our edits to the CEA involve replacing an ad-hoc adjustment with a more developed technique from other CEAs. This includes our discounting of future lives saved, which follows the technique from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=1176773164&amp;range=B124\"><u>New Incentives CEA</u></a>, and our use of Bayesian analysis to combine evidence from multiple lines of reasoning, which is similar to the approach used in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLbeSws1PcIQ6RpzG-iGZYfTLc98cmm0K4zWNhqaQoQ/edit#heading=h.1gijujhxfwgv\"><u>Deworm the World analysis</u></a>.</p><p>A 20% change in cost effectiveness is relatively modest compared to the range of cost effectivenesses considered by GiveWell. For comparison, the country-specific numbers in GiveWell\u2019s other cost effectiveness estimates range from -0.5x as effective as cash to 51x as effective. A 20% change in cost effectiveness in either direction isn\u2019t enough to make water chlorination GiveWell\u2019s most effective charity or its least effective, nor would a 20% increase be enough to push either DSW or ILC over GiveWell\u2019s current estimated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/07/05/update-on-givewells-funding-projections/\"><u>10x cash effectiveness bar for funding</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, a 20% decrease in cost effectiveness is large enough that it could potentially affect funding decisions. In early 2022, GiveWell used a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/07/05/update-on-givewells-funding-projections/\"><u>6x cash effectiveness</u></a> bar for funding, which DSW meets according to GiveWell\u2019s CEA but no longer does in our updated version. Our revised analysis also suggests that ILC is a more promising intervention than DSW. In GiveWell\u2019s original analysis, ILC and DSW were approximately equally cost effective. In our updated analysis, ILC is 33% more cost effective than DSW, although this result is highly sensitive to the estimated cost of ILC systems. Efforts to scale up and widely deploy ILC could therefore be more cost effective than expanding the DSW program. ILC is also a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.evidenceaction.org/accelerator/\"><u>relatively new intervention</u></a>, so there may be more potential for further development to reduce its cost or improve its adherence rates than there is for DSW.&nbsp;</p><h1>Appendix 1: Parameters used in Bayesian Analysis</h1><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/secondhandmaps/WQ-CEA-Analysis/blob/main/modeling_mortality_effect_via_stan_v3.R\">R</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/secondhandmaps/WQ-CEA-Analysis/blob/main/stan_model_for_water_quality_v3.stan\">Stan</a> code for our model is available on GitHub.

While we did not have sufficient time to fully investigate this possible issue and to incorporate it into our updated version of the model, we think it is worth flagging for further review. In line 138 of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxRfhPnTBJ_UYAeoAyVd8u6Orxh4pR9hB3wvdfZcXFs/edit#gid=1988241019\">GiveWell's DSW CEA spreadsheet</a>, a value is computed for the units of value created if another philanthropic actor were to fund DSW instead of GiveWell. This value is calculated by multiplying the units of value per $10,000 created by DSW by the percent of the DSW program funded by another donor (100%), then subtracting an estimate of the units of value that the other funder would have created had they not funded DSW. However, the subtracted units of value estimate is computed by multiplying the benefit per dollar of other funders' non-DSW spending, the percent of the program funded by the other donor (100%), the cost per person covered, and the number of dollars spent ($10,000). We think including the cost per person in the &nbsp;multiplication is most likely incorrect, as it leads to the result being the counterfactual value per 10,000 people covered, not per $10,000 spent. Since the downside adjustment section operates entirely in units of value per $10,000 spent, subtracting the counterfactual units of value per 10,000 people covered does not make sense to us. Because the cost per person covered is relatively close to $1/year, this potential error leads to a modest change in the overall cost effectiveness for DSW, which we estimate is approximately 2%. However, we have not done as deep an investigation into this item as we have for the others, and we may be misunderstanding the intent of this calculation.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnkno7bjz0qdt\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefkno7bjz0qdt\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The authors shared an early draft of the meta-analysis with GiveWell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/04/06/water-quality-overview/#Whatledustoupdate\"><u>in 2020</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntc78edp00fl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftc78edp00fl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>See lines 147-152 of GiveWell\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxRfhPnTBJ_UYAeoAyVd8u6Orxh4pR9hB3wvdfZcXFs/edit#gid=1988241019\"><u>DSW CEA spreadsheet</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnxhl3btpu7x\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefxhl3btpu7x\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>See comments in cell A106 of GiveWell\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxRfhPnTBJ_UYAeoAyVd8u6Orxh4pR9hB3wvdfZcXFs/edit#gid=1988241019\"><u>DSW CEA Spreadsheet</u></a> and cell E7 of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cCwtsgnz-Va6YXiq3YfCBS0tXhPCGwXft9-I3VIi2_I/edit#gid=1103475127\"><u>GiveWell\u2019s Funging Spreadsheet</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fngq52id9m7yc\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefgq52id9m7yc\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>See lines 87-141 of GiveWell\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxRfhPnTBJ_UYAeoAyVd8u6Orxh4pR9hB3wvdfZcXFs/edit#gid=1988241019\"><u>DSW CEA spreadsheet</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrslibl1cqec\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrslibl1cqec\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>\"First, it is a follow-up of the Null 2018 RCT, so it does not meet the independence assumption underlying this meta-analysis method.\"</p><p>\"Second we find the effect size implausibly large (including the bottom of the 95% confidence interval)&nbsp; given the modest intervention effect on chlorination rates\"</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnuHlq4b0NSDjDmcEZ-79gjqrsQdi89zVn4ifSkPQ5k/edit#gid=12326579\"><u>Source</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnex9t7rthe1h\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefex9t7rthe1h\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;See the \u201cMethods\u201d section of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29396219/\"><u>Null et al.

If past trends continue, future AI systems will likely be scaled up enough to eventually be able to create sophisticated, long-term plans for whatever mysterious goals they have evolved during training.&nbsp;</p><p>A system that can create long-term plans at a comparable or higher capability than humans is easy to make dangerous by accident. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that so far, nobody has found a way to robustly align an AI system towards a benign goal: or indeed, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml\">any specific goal</a>.</p><p>Many of us EAs prudently consider the societal risk posed by future unaligned AI to be one of the most pressing x-risks\u2014if not <i>the</i> most pressing x-risk\u2014in the world right now. <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">Hundreds of us EAs</a> devote our careers to AI safety, and the community as a whole donates about $50 million to AI safety every year. Our prudence, persistence, and self-sacrifice on this pressing issue deserve to be commended.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I have recently thought of a concern that, if true, implies that the impact of EAs\u2019 past and current efforts on AI safety may have been fundamentally limited by our suboptimal <i>modus operandi</i> for these efforts<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The concern is the following:</p><p><i>The corporation that creates the first AGI will (despite our best efforts) train it on as much data as possible, likely the whole Internet and potentially even private Google Docs. <strong>Any AI safety research that is likely to be in the AGI\u2019s training set should be assumed compromised.</strong>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>This is because whenever the misaligned AGI knows in advance of our plan \u201cIf we see Sign X of misalignment from the AI, we should shut it down and retrain,\u201d it can use this plan against us: for example, by hiding from us Sign X that it would have shown under normal circumstances. (Sign X could be a certain property of the AGI\u2019s output, of its internal weights, or of its modified environment.)&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Also, a plan based on stochastic gradient descent (to increase the probability that the AGI is aligned at the point it reaches high capabilities) might be easier to exploit\u2060\u2014by an emergent misaligned AGI aiming to protect its misaligned goal during the training process\u2060\u2014if the AGI has prior knowledge of the plan.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Moreover, the misaligned AGI may be able to use Internet information about itself and about the cybersecurity design of its sandbox to </i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p62bkNAciLsv6WFnR/how-do-we-align-an-agi-without-getting-socially-engineered\"><i>prematurely escape the sandbox</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Some AI safety researchers already refrain from posting some of their research on the Internet, in case that capabilities researchers may use it to increase AI capabilities (and thereby decrease the amount of time we have for solving AI safety). This is a prudent and commendable choice that I hope will continue. My additional proposition is that the risk of a misaligned AGI knowing our safety plans beforehand and using them against us should also be considered a strong reason to not post sensitive AI safety research on the Internet.</p><p>If true, this concern implies that past AI safety research may have lost some or all of their potential value (as well as the potential value of future AI safety research that will build on it) by not having been kept secret. It is even possible that an AI safety plan is made net-negative by being made public, because the plan can be ostensibly impressive enough to be used by AGI corporations but still make it into their AGI\u2019s training set. This would enable the AGI (which will likely be misaligned by default) to give alignment researchers a false sense of confidence.&nbsp;</p><p>Given this, we should vigorously investigate whether or not this concern is well-founded. This may run into the following practical difficulty. For the knowledgeable people who are best equipped to investigate this concern\u2014experienced AI safety researchers\u2014concluding that this concern is well-founded would be equivalent to concluding that they themselves may have reduced the value of their own past research by posting it on the Internet. This is an unfortunate source of potential cognitive bias. But realistically, our best option (as difficult as it is) may be to keep our cognitive biases in check as much as possible while vigorously investigating whether the aforementioned concern is well-founded. Outside perspectives from people who are new to the field of AI safety would be substantially helpful on this front, because they would not be investigating whether their own past practices were suboptimal.</p><p>Below is my own first attempt at investigating whether the aforementioned concern is well-founded.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint #1</strong>: If your AI safety plan requires secrecy to succeed, then it wasn\u2019t a good plan in the first place.</p><p><strong>My rebuttal</strong>: We should always be looking for plans that succeed regardless of the opponent\u2019s counterplay. But our existing theoretical and empirical knowledge of real-world adversarial interactions suggests that a lot of the EV will be in plans that require randomization and secrecy to be optimal.</p><p>AGI will likely be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13353\">misaligned</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683\">by</a> <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aaai.12064\">default</a>, so the two-player zero-sum game can be a decent model of the by-default adversarial interaction between:</p><ol><li>the alignment researcher (who is trying to train the AGI to be aligned and/or to convince management to stop trying to build AGI) and&nbsp;</li><li>the by-default misaligned AGI (who is trying to deceive the alignment researcher, protect its misaligned goal, and power-seek against humans at the first opportunity).&nbsp;</li></ol><p>In a two-player zero-sum game, the optimal strategy is called the <strong>minimax strategy</strong>, which maximizes the minimum gain. <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MinimaxTheorem.html\">Equivalently</a>, the strategy is to minimize the maximum gain for the opponent. Colloquially, the minimax strategy can be thought of as the least exploitable strategy.</p><p>Sometimes, the player\u2019s minimax strategy is a deterministic \u201cbest strategy,\u201d and guarantees the most favorable outcome assuming the worst-case scenario that the opponent will use the optimal counterplay. This is the case for sequential perfect-information games like chess and Go.</p><p>But in other times, the player\u2019s minimax strategy requires randomization and secrecy, because the other player will be able to optimally exploit any one deterministic strategy if it is known beforehand. This is the case for rock-paper-scissors, matching pennies, and other games where there are multiple strategies where none of them is absolutely better than any other.</p><p>There are many real-world adversarial interactions that require rock-paper-scissors-type randomization and secrecy to play optimally. The <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/666530\">use of divination</a> that essentially acts as a randomization device has consistently emerged in hunting and in warfare, likely because of the strategic benefits of randomization in these settings. Rock-paper-scissors cycles in strategies are central to adversarial games that are either <a href=\"https://kskdkarate.com/2021/02/16/best-fighting-style-rock-paper-scissors/\">real</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox2rUF8W_oE\">time</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pokernews.com/strategy/make-your-poker-game-less-exploitable-rock-paper-scissors-24419.htm\">imperfect</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ELzL9a3XpM\">information</a>, or <a href=\"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIIDE/article/view/12857\">both</a>.</p><p>A real-world example of the strategic benefits of secrecy is provided by General Douglas MacArthur. He is consistently ranked by historians as one of America\u2019s <a href=\"https://time.com/5724009/douglas-macarthur-is-one-of-americas-most-famous-generals-hes-also-the-most-overrated/\">most overrated</a> and <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/06/02/the-worst-general-in-american-history-2/\">least competent</a> generals, because of his poor decisions in the Korean War. Instead of prioritizing accurate intelligence and planning rationally, \u201c<a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2019/01/is-this-the-worst-intelligence-chief-in-the-us-armys-history/\">the general was focused on limiting and controlling the sources of intelligence, not allowing contrary or dissenting opinions, and simultaneously surrounding himself with yes-men</a>.\u201d But even the incompetent General MacArthur decisively won the Japanese front of World War 2 when he had prior knowledge of the enemy\u2019s plans, thanks to Alan Turing and his colleagues having broken the Japanese Empire\u2019s encryption.&nbsp;</p><p>Secrecy is likely of pivotal significance in real-world struggles that occur between intelligent adversaries. Whether or not one's plans are secret can even be the key difference-maker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Counterpoint #2</strong>: A misaligned AGI whose capabilities are high enough to use our safety plans against us will succeed with an equal probability (e.g., close to 100%) regardless of whether it can access these plans.</p><p><strong>My rebuttal</strong>: It is possible that a misaligned AGI whose capabilities is undergoing a fast takeoff will benefit from both (1) a fast convergence to game-theoretically optimal play and (2) an expanding strategy space that allows for an increasingly deterministic victory against humanity\u2019s smaller space of options.&nbsp;</p><p>However, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zoWypGfXLmYsDFivk/counterarguments-to-the-basic-ai-risk-case#Speed_of_intelligence_growth_is_ambiguous\">there is currently no strong case</a> for why we should expect AGI\u2019s capabilities takeoff to be fast. And there is at least indirect evidence from evolutionary biology and neuroscience that suggests that AGI\u2019s capabilities takeoff will be slow, as argued by Jacob Cannell in his <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xwBuoE9p8GE7RAuhd/brain-efficiency-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know\">insightful</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Yc7Pp7szcjPgPsjf/the-brain-as-a-universal-learning-machine\">posts</a>. If true, his argument has the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p62bkNAciLsv6WFnR/?commentId=22msTXuyYeSQyjpHp\">following implication</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFast takeoff traditionally implies time from AGI to singularity measured in hours or days, which you just don't get with merely mundane improvements like copying or mild algorithmic advances. [Eliezer Yudkowsky] (and perhaps Bostrom to some extent) anticipated fast takeoff explicitly enabled by many OOM brain inefficiency, such that the equivalent of many decades of Moore's Law could be compressed into mere moments. The key rate limiter in these scenarios ends up being the ability to physically move raw materials through complex supply chains processes to produce more computing substrate, which is bypassed through the use of hard drexlerian nanotech.</p><p>But it turns out that biology is already near optimal-ish (cells in particular already are essentially optimal nanoscale robots; thus drexlerian nanotech is probably a pipe dream), so that just isn't the world we live in.</p><p>\u2026 In a nutshell [Eliezer Yudkowsky/LessWrong] folks got much of their brain model from the heuristics and biases, [evolutionary psychology] literature which is based on the evolved modularity hypothesis, which turned out to be near completely wrong. So just by merely reading the sequences and associated lit [LessWrong] folks have unfortunately picked up a fairly inaccurate default view of the brain.</p><p>In a nutshell the brain is a very generic/universal learning system built mostly out of a few different complimentary types of neural computronium (cortex, cerebellum, etc) and an actual practical recursive self improvement learning system that rapidly learns efficient circuit architecture from lifetime experience. The general meta-architecture is not specific to humans, primates, or even mammals, and in fact is highly convergent and conserved - evolution found and preserved it again and again across wildly divergent lineages. So there isn't so much room for improvement in architecture, most of the improvement comes solely from scaling.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Whether the takeoff in AGI\u2019s capabilities will be fast or slow is of central importance to EAs\u2019 macrostrategy for AI safety. Thus, this scientific debate should vigorously continue, ideally with perspectives from as many different relevant fields of science as possible.</p><p><strong>[Edit</strong>: Linda Linsefors has pointed out the following crucial point. Even if most of the AGI\u2019s capabilities takeoff will come from scaling rather than architecture, as Jacob Cannell has argued, this leaves open the possibility of a takeoff by the AGI quickly getting more compute, such as by hacking other data centers. The probability of this occurring should be vigorously investigated as well.]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Counterpoint #3</strong>: We may be able to prevent the AGI from being misaligned on our first try.</p><p><strong>My rebuttal</strong>: Currently, we cannot. The default outcome is likely a misaligned AGI.&nbsp;</p><p>We should keep trying to find a way to reliably create an aligned AGI on our first try, because if this is possible in the timeframe we have, it would clearly be the best path forward.&nbsp;</p><p>But there is reason to believe that this is an extremely difficult problem. Parents cannot align their children or their pets on their first try. They must rely on reinforcement-learning-based approaches that heavily rely on trial and error, both from their own attempts and from others\u2019 past attempts in similar situations. Even in the more optimistic reference case of gene-editing, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aax2941\">trial-and-error is still likely crucial</a> for reliably achieving the desired properties in the edited code, especially given that the code will be subject to inherently unpredictable evolutionary pressures (natural selection and epigenetics, the analogues of stochastic gradient descent and adaptive learning) once it is deployed.</p><p>If we will probably need multiple trials to align AGI in the timeframe we have, then we should work to preemptively make the risk of any one trial causing a catastrophe as small as possible. And keeping our AI safety plans secret is likely to robustly help on this front.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Counterpoint #4</strong>: If AI safety researchers adopted security mindset to the point of keeping their sensitive research off of the Internet, then research would slow down too much.</p><p><strong>My rebuttal</strong>: This is a real tradeoff. A lot of us AI safety researchers (myself included) became interested in the problem by reading about it on Internet forums like the EA Forum and LessWrong. And the quick sharing of ideas on the Internet can in theory be helpful for innovation in general.</p><p>I do think that in practice, the net innovation benefits of the Internet are overrated. Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow famously said \u201c<a href=\"http://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/misc/solow-computer-productivity.pdf\">You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics</a>.\u201d The trend of advances in information technology like the Internet not leading to a significant increase in economy-wide innovation has been robust; if anything, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_paradox\">advances in information technology have coincided with times of economic stagnation</a>. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for this <i>productivity paradox</i>, one of which (set forth by economist Robert Gorden and embraced by EA economist Tyler Cowen) is that \u201c<a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2011/03/the-productivity-paradox-why-hasn-t-the-internet-helped-the-american-economy-grow-more.html\">perhaps the Internet is just not as revolutionary as we think it is</a>.\u201d</p><p>The success case to emulate in methodology is the Manhattan project. It adopted a strong security mindset among all participating researchers, and preemptive efforts to patch the vulnerabilities resulting from information technology during a time of war. (The research environment would likely have been airgapped if the Manhattan project had occurred in the Internet age.) And yet, very quick and successful innovation was produced.</p><p>To be fair, achieving a Manhattan-project-esque research collaboration among AI safety researchers would be a significant undertaking that would be difficult to bring about, at least in a decentralized manner. This kind of undertaking will probably require extensive discussion, planning, and execution by a collaboration between the AI safety research community and EAs of many different skillsets.</p><p>But even partial success on achieving security mindset can be helpful on the margin, and may plausibly tap into both the Internet\u2019s theoretical upside of facilitating communal innovation and the game-theoretic benefits of secrecy. For example, there is a change we EAs can start adopting right now without too much effort. The proposed motto is that \u201cfor AI safety, the Internet should be used primarily for recruitment and advocacy, while research should be kept off of the Internet if it has a chance of being sensitive.\u201d The security mindset of the field of biosecurity should be used as a role model for this. The challenge, of course, will be to achieve this while also achieving a high rate of communal innovation in AI safety research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Counterpoint #5</strong>: Each AI safety researcher is already optimally weighing the costs and benefits of posting their research online in an idiosyncratic manner, and a community-wide social norm that constrains them to act in a non-situation-specific manner can be counterproductive.</p><p><strong>My rebuttal</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519322000297\">My model</a> is that it is difficult to accurately estimate <i>a priori </i>the benefit-risk tradeoff of posting a given AI safety plan online. So, human cognition probably defaults to a heuristic-based estimate. And such a heuristic-based estimate will likely be insufficiently careful, given that the threat model is unprecedented: a superintelligent, by-default-misaligned AGI who can use the plan for its own purposes. Thus, even a blunt social norm of \u201cdon\u2019t post AI safety plans on the Internet if there is even a chance of it being sensitive\u201d can be robustly helpful compared to the counterfactual.</p><p>Even an AI safety idea that does not constitute a specific plan can be sensitive to post on the Internet. This is because future, more specific AI safety plans can be based on the earlier preparadigmatic idea. In essence, whenever an AI safety idea is posted online, this can compromise its \u201cdescendants\u201d on the \u201ctech tree\u201d of AI safety research, even the descendant ideas whose existence could not have been predicted beforehand at human-level capabilities.</p><p>Moreover, even if posting an AI safety idea online doesn\u2019t increase AGI catastrophe risk by itself, it can do so indirectly by increasing AI safety researchers\u2019 vulnerability to undeserved blame in unpredictable ways. A realistic assessment of the EA movement\u2019s AI safety research efforts and governance efforts so far is that at our current rate of progress, we will (despite our best efforts) likely fail to prevent the first AGI disaster. In the plausible event that humanity is not extinct after the first AGI disaster, there will be a blame game. Whichever corporation caused the AGI catastrophe will desperately try to hide their responsibility and blame anyone else (including its competitors, and potentially even its own safety team). Its potentially more safety-minded competitors will try their best to prove to the public that their hands are clean. And in this blame game, AI safety researchers (and the EA community as a whole) may find themselves at the receiving end of the blame in unfair and unpredictable ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the blame will be unfair, it is still realistic to plan for this possibility. One way to protect ourselves from this unfair blame is to have the bulk of our efforts (with the exception of things like recruiting and advocacy) off of the unsecure Internet, and therefore off of the AGI\u2019s training set and the crosshairs of the AGI corporations. Then, there would be nothing concrete for potential blamers to point towards to suggest that AI safety researchers or EAs should be blamed.</p><p>Yes, this is unfair. And we shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this unfairness. But relying on others\u2019 sense of fairness (especially that of desperate for-profit corporations) is probably not an EV-maximizing strategy.</p><p>Today is the first day in the rest of our lives. We should always seek to maximize EV, even when this may entail doing things that are contrary to our intuitions: like making use of secrecy and luck for high-stakes decision-making, communicating via secure channels, and treating AGI as an intelligent adversary rather than a standard object of scientific study.</p><p>-----</p><p><strong>Epistemic status (speculative)</strong>: Does posting an AI safety plan on the Internet reduce its value? I am reasonably confident (at least 80% probability) that the effect exists. I am highly uncertain about the magnitude of the effect, which would depend situation-specifically on the given AI safety plan. My current, highly speculative estimate is that there is at least a 5% probability that a Manhattan-Project-esque shift in AI safety research norms\u2014by a collaboration between AI safety researchers and the EA community\u2014will result in an x-risk reduction that is, on a per-dollar level, maximal among past and current EA projects on x-risk reduction (with the exception of field-building).</p><p>-----</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>: I am grateful to Michael Aird, Pablo Antonio Moreno Casares, Adam Gleave, Marius Hobbhahn, Alex Lawson, Patrick Levermore, Eli Lifland, Richard Mallah, Joe O'Brien, Ethan Perez, Javier Prieto, and Madhu Sriram for very helpful conversations about the topic.

These might be good discussion topics or companies to work on. 'Promising GCBR Interventions' are interventions with general consensus among biosecurity experts for being effective at preventing catastrophic pandemics.</p><p>Not all interventions are made equal. Some are much more effective than others, but I\u2019ve included the \u2018less-promising\u2019 interventions all the same. I didn\u2019t want my biases (or the biosecurity community\u2019s biases, for that matter) about what is and isn\u2019t promising to obscure solutions from a first-principles breakdown.</p><p>Though I consulted experts and peers, all final decisions were ultimately mine and may differ from the biosecurity community. The rest of the post will go over my rationale for certain decisions.</p><h2>GCBR vs. Covid-scale pandemics</h2><p>This map covers preventing pandemics, not just the catastrophic ones, but also the Covid-scale ones which might occur more frequently.&nbsp;</p><p>EA focuses a lot on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/preventing-catastrophic-pandemics/full-report/\">global catastrophic biological risk</a> (GCBR) pandemics. This seems pretty important given its neglectedness and potentially catastrophic impact. I\u2019ve outlined the interventions that I think would be promising for GCBRs.</p><p>At the same time, many in biosecurity consider the effects of AI to outweigh those from biorisks (the magnitude is usually 10-100x). Progress in alignment is influenced by factors like international cooperation, institutional distrust, and nuclear conflict. All of these factors are affected by Covid-scale pandemics, whether through decreases in trust, sudden scarcity of resources, or armed international conflict. Considering the&nbsp;possible<i>&nbsp;</i>detrimental effect of even small-scale but more frequent pandemics, it seems worth exploring interventions focused on this scale. There may be more low-hanging fruit than we imagine.</p><h2>Mitigate-Prevent breakdown</h2><p>I decided on a two-factor framework of Mitigate-Prevent because I think it covers the space of interventions well and because it resulted in a nice visual. Part of this framework is Survive which involves bunkers and food resilience. I didn\u2019t include it because I wanted more emphasis on preventing diseases from becoming pandemics in the first place, which is much more important than escaping to a bunker. If we\u2019re escaping to bunkers, then it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ve lost. That said, I could imagine creating another map that covers this axis of resilience.</p><h2>Thoughts on some specific interventions</h2><h3>Agricultural disease monitoring and farm-animal testing</h3><p>Factory farms practically incubate viruses due to the high concentration of animals. Because diseases can pass from animals to humans, more vigilance here could be an effective preventative measure. Wet markets experienced pushback for being viral breeding grounds, and it\u2019s about time that factory farms undergo the same scrutiny.</p><p>In addition to worrying about human and animal infection, crops are also vulnerable. Agricultural practices are monoculture in nature, meaning there is a lack of genetic diversity in the crops grown. Blights exist, and countries are surprisingly dependent on a few sources of food. Monitoring agricultural diseases through runoff water or random sampling seems worth consideration.</p><h3>Bioenhancement</h3><p>By bioenhancement, I mean health and performance-boosting drugs. Most people have a negative connotation with drugs, but there\u2019s evidence that supplements like caffeine pills, melatonin, and ashwagandha are relatively safe and effective (though this is not an endorsement of any of those products). Ultimately, bioenhancement means giving humans better control of their biology, whether through continuous glucose monitoring, increased alertness and productivity, or reduced anxiety. Increased productivity and reduced anxiety are multiplier effects for working on interventions, and it\u2019s possible that some bioenhancement interventions will increase our viral resistance, much in the way that better sleep makes people far less prone to disease and sickness.</p><h3>Policy and regulation</h3><p>All of these interventions can benefit from better policy or regulation, but some interventions are more dependent than others. For example, it\u2019s really hard to reform the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/\">BWC</a> without engaging with the policy side of things. I think most people should at least test their fit in policy, whether through a brief research position at a think tank or through learning about different people\u2019s experiences working in policy.</p><h3>Far-UVC</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w\">Far-UVC</a> is a specific spectrum of UV light at a wavelength of about 220nm. It\u2019s shown promise for being safer on human cells than regular UV light, allowing use for (limited) sterilization of surfaces and killing pathogens in the air.&nbsp; I think far-UVC has good potential for mitigating pandemics, but there\u2019s a lot more research that needs to go into this field. It\u2019s possible that it isn\u2019t as safe as many people claim and that its impact is constrained.</p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>I hope this gives a clearer picture of what the field of biosecurity is broadly working on and excited about. I want to highlight that the process of creating the visual map was quite simple and replicable. In my case, I just went on Fiverr to hire a graphic designer, and I proceeded to give suggestions and revision notes. I think it\u2019s seriously worth considering doing something similar if your cause area or idea would benefit from a clear visual or map.</p><p>I encourage people who are interested in learning more to reach out to people in the biosecurity space!

Factors in different dimensions, such as the price and deliciousness of an apple, can\u2019t be combined into one dimension (a single score) in the general case. There are fundamental mathematical and philosophical problems with combining dimensions. The same issue applies to evaluating ideas based on multiple factors, including updating credences based on multiple pieces of evidence. An alternative epistemology focused on decisive criticism and error correction doesn\u2019t have these problems. The main purpose of this article is to look at decision making (or idea evaluation) from a mathematical perspective and to show that some standard approaches don\u2019t work mathematically.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We make decisions based on many factors. This article is about how to make good decisions. It uses arithmetic to help analyze decision making.</p>\n<p>For example, consider buying a car. You\u2019ll consider price, brand, color, gas/hybrid/electric, crash test ratings, rear backup camera, sunroof, truck/sedan/SUV, new/used, buy/lease, financing offered, acceleration, handling, etc. Each of those is a <em>factor</em> in the decision. You could make a chart (spreadsheet) with each car (along the left) and each factor (along the top), and then fill in the information for each car (in the middle). Imagine you do research and gather all the data for the spreadsheet (many people don\u2019t bother and just keep some of the information in their head, but it\u2019s still useful to know how to do organized decision making even if you skip steps). Then how do you actually decide which car to get?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty easy to decide which car is best based on any <em>one</em> factor. E.g. you can rank cars by price, or you can rank them by how much you like the color. But it\u2019s harder to look at multiple factors at the same time and decide which car is best.</p>\n<p>What people often look for is an <em>overall evaluation</em> for each car. E.g. how good is this car on a scale of 0 to 100? Then you can rank cars based on the one factor of how good it is overall, and then pick the car that is best overall. People also use non-numerical overall evaluations like \u201cpretty good\u201d, \u201cgreat\u201d, and \u201dterrible\u201d.</p>\n<p>To get an overall evaluation, you have to <em>combine</em> many or all of the factors. The overall evaluation should somehow take into account whether the car has air conditioning, whether it\u2019s an automatic, the price, etc. Having air conditioning and having a lower price should both raise the overall evaluation. A typical approach is to score each factor, multiply that by a weighting for how important the factor is, and to add up the results.</p>\n<p>Although people usually do this using intuition, common sense and estimation, it\u2019s useful to look at how it works mathematically. Math provides a simplified model of how decision making works. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s easier to analyze.</p>\n<p>There are, perhaps surprisingly, <em>major difficulties</em> making the math work, at all, to get an overall evaluation based on multiple factors. It\u2019s a hard math problem to solve. I\u2019ll explain why it\u2019s hard, why some approaches don\u2019t work, and my original solution. My solution was developed first as a philosophy theory but it can be translated into working math, while many rival philosophy theories translate to math that doesn\u2019t work.</p>\n<h2>Charts</h2>\n<p>This chart shows an example multi-factor decision about choosing which pet to get.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>Cuteness</th>\n<th>Messiness</th>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Lifespan</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cat</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dog</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gerbil</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Snake</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Turtle</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The pets on the left are options we could choose, and the criteria along the top are factors we can use to evaluate options. A factor is a trait, characteristic or quality. A factor is also a sub-goal: a part of your overall goal. In this case, the overall goal is to get a good pet.</p>\n<p>People make multi-factor decisions frequently. Sometimes they use pro/con lists (each pro or con is a factor). Sometimes they used weighted score systems. Sometimes they just think about it or choose intuitively.</p>\n<p>For most of the article, I\u2019ll use a simple, abstract example chart. Our options are A, B, C, which could be pets or anything else. And the factors we\u2019ll consider are x, y, z, which could be price, cuteness and size, or anything else. For simplicity, we\u2019ll assume that no other factors matter.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>x</th>\n<th>y</th>\n<th>z</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>B</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Which option is best? We can\u2019t know from this chart. It depends on things like whether more or less of a factor is better, what units each factor is in, and how important each factor is.</p>\n<p>For simplicity, assume more is better for every factor.</p>\n<p>We can easily rank the options based on any <em>one</em> factor. E.g., for x, B is best (9 points), C second best (4 points), and A worst (3 points).</p>\n<p>We can also determine the best option if an option is the best for <em>every</em> factor. That option is <em>strictly</em> better. But in many cases, including our example, no option is strictly best. If the only options were A and B, and the only factors were y and z, then A would be strictly best.</p>\n<p>How can we mathematically <em>combine</em> multiple <em>factors</em> to get an <em>overall evaluation</em> that lets us <em>rank</em> the options to decide which is best?</p>\n<h2>Dimensions and Arithmetic</h2>\n<h3>Dimensions</h3>\n<p>Factors can often be combined when they\u2019re in the same dimension. A dimension is a type, kind or category of factor, such as length, weight, time, cuteness or color. When two factors are the same kind of thing, you can combine them with addition. For example, 3 miles can be combined with 5 miles for a total of 8 miles. (It\u2019s more problematic with some types of factors, like color. How do you add red plus red?)</p>\n<p>You can often tell two factors are in the same dimension when they use the same units, e.g. they\u2019re both in miles. Different units can also be in the same dimension when they\u2019re the same kind of thing. For example, meters and feet are in the same dimension (length). But they can\u2019t be added together, in one step, because they\u2019re different units.</p>\n<p>To add different units, we first <em>convert</em> them into the same units, and then we add. Conversions within a dimension work because the units all represent the same underlying thing, like length. 1 meter and 3.3 feet are the same amount of length (rounded to a reasonable precision). If our factors are 4 meters and 3.3 feet, they add to 5 meters (or 16 feet). This isn\u2019t a controversial matter of opinion that people debate; it\u2019s facts, definitions and arithmetic.</p>\n<p>Looking at our example chart again, suppose x, y and z were the amount of money we\u2019ll make, in dollars, from different parts of a project. Then we can add the factors together to combine them and get an overall evaluation of each option. C is the best option because it offers the highest total ($17).</p>\n<p>Now suppose x were in dollars but y and z were in yen, and that 100 yen are worth a dollar. They\u2019re all in the same dimension \u2013 money \u2013 so we can convert and then add. The best option is B ($9.03 total). Notice that the best option has changed.</p>\n<p>Similarly, grams can be converted to pounds or kilograms because they\u2019re in the same dimension (weight). But grams cannot be converted to dollars, inches or cuteness, because those are different dimensions, different types of things. (There are sometimes conversions in specific contexts, e.g. a particular store might offer a price in dollars per gram of gold you sell them.)</p>\n<p>When factors are in the same dimension, we often combine them and view them as one factor. E.g., when considering walking to a store, we look at the total distance instead of treating the length of each block as a separate factor.</p>\n<p>Factors with the same units shouldn\u2019t always be added. The width, depth and height of a desk shouldn\u2019t be added to get a total number of inches. But the width of the left half and width of the right half of a desk can be added to get the total width of the desk.</p>\n<p>Continuing our analysis, we\u2019ll suppose that x, y and z are all in different dimensions. This is a problem people often face. <em>How do you evaluate multiple factors in different dimensions?</em></p>\n<h3>Adding Factors</h3>\n<p>First we\u2019ll try combining factors by addition.

That makes sense because variables can be units, e.g. x could be 1 mile. Terms can only be added when every part is identical other than the number.</p>\n<p>The way fractions work&nbsp;is related. You can only additively combine fractions if the denominators are the same. If they\u2019re different, you have to convert them to the same denominator by multiplying by a conversion factor, which equals one, before you can add them into one term. That\u2019s like multiplying by a unit conversion factor, which equals one, before additively combining terms with different units in the same dimension (like meters and miles).</p>\n<p>Conversion factors also work with variables.

(Note: The conversion factor is just the fraction, not the whole equation, but I want to emphasize that all conversion factors are equal to one.) We can multiply the 3x by this conversion factor to change it from x units to y units, and we\u2019ll get 9y just like when we used the substitution method.

The different variables are like different units. To solve a system of linear equations you need, in short, one equation per variable. To reduce it to a single term you need one fewer equation. Since we can rank factors in one dimension without difficulty, reducing to a single unit/term/variable is adequate. E.g. we can compare 5x to 7x without needing to reduce them to constants/numbers (given that we know whether x is good or bad, or in other words a positive or negative factor). So e.g. if there are 7 factors or variables that we\u2019re using to evaluate options, then we need 6 equations or conversion factors.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll discuss this more later, but the short summary is: <em>since general purpose conversion factors are only available for units in the same dimension, addition doesn\u2019t solve the problem of multi-factor decision making</em>. You can only convert between factors in different dimensions in special cases, e.g. converting between grams and liters <em>of water at a particular temperature and pressure</em>. Those special cases are inadequate for our goal, which is a general purpose decision making method.</p>\n<h3>Multiplying Factors</h3>\n<p>Since we can\u2019t combine factors in different dimensions by addition, let\u2019s try multiplying.</p>\n<p><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"3x * 8y * 5z = 120xyz\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">3</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u2217</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">8</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;\">y</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u2217</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">5</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">z</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">120</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;\">y</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">z</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>This worked. Mathematically, you can multiply those three terms to get a single term, 120xyz.</p>\n<p>The result is 120 in the units xyz. Those are multi-dimensional units, e.g. acre-hour-grams. Those are logically valid units, but probably <em>not useful</em>. What do they mean? What is an acre-hour-gram? What should you do with it? Those units don\u2019t correspond to your goal (like getting a good pet or car) or to any known, useful concept in reality. Unfortunately, most multiplications of dimensions result in units that aren\u2019t useful.</p>\n<p>Multi-dimensional units mean that the dimensions are multiplied (and/or divided) together. This is familiar and useful in some cases. E.g. miles per hour is a multi-dimensional unit involving miles (a length dimension) divided by hours (a time dimension). Volume is a multi-dimensional unit involving three different length dimensions which are perpendicular (often called width, depth and height), which are all multiplied together. These useful multi-dimensional units are special cases and exceptions, but we\u2019re looking for a generic decision making method, not a method that works in just a few cases.</p>\n<p>If you multiply twenty factors, you\u2019ll get twenty-dimensional units. The problem is usually even worse than in my example with three factors.</p>\n<p>One problem with multi-dimensional units is that doing a unit conversion in any one dimension changes the number you get (e.g. it\u2019ll be 60 times larger if you convert from hours to minutes). The number depends on multiple choices of unit instead of just one. And choosing non-linear units in one dimension (like pH or the Richter scale, which are logarithmic) can change which option has the highest number. That reordering problem from switching units doesn\u2019t happen when working with single-dimensional units (given some reasonable mathematical constraints on what is a valid unit definition).</p>\n<p>Although there are major difficulties, <em>multiplying can combine different units, variables or denominators (and more) into one term.</em> In some limited sense, it does work, unlike addition.</p>\n<p>What we\u2019re dealing with here are fundamental aspects of how arithmetic works. Multiplying works to get one term because a term <em>is</em> a group of things that are multiplied together (I explain terms more later). But terms can only be added when they have exactly the same types of things being multiplied together, because addition means combining different amounts of the same thing/type/units. (Put another way, addition is a quantitative change that only works when there are no qualitative differences. Multiplication works regardless of qualitative differences and can change both quantity and quality.)</p>\n<p>When combining a large number of fractions by multiplying, the denominator can become large and inconvenient. That\u2019s somewhat similar to the inconvenient result when multiplying many independent variables or units from different dimensions. However, as long as there are no units or variables involved, fractions are all from the same dimension (numbers), so combining fractions with multiplication does always work OK. Regardless of how unintuitive a large denominator is, you can deal with it, e.g. by converting to a more intuitive decimal number. You can also combine fractions by adding since they\u2019re from the same dimension (numbers), so this isn\u2019t an advantage of multiplication over addition.</p>\n<p>Would dividing factors work better? Division is a type of multiplication, just like subtraction is a type of addition. Division means multiplying by the multiplicative inverse, like subtraction is adding the additive inverse. Division won\u2019t help us do better than multiplication. This also explains why I didn\u2019t consider subtraction above.</p>\n<h3>Now What?</h3>\n<p>We don\u2019t have a good solution yet. Combining factors from multiple dimensions is a hard problem.</p>\n<p>Using more advanced math, like exponents, calculus, or trigonometry, won\u2019t help. I don\u2019t know of any math operator that will solve our difficulty. We could combine factors with set operators like union, but then we\u2019d need a way to rank sets, so that wouldn\u2019t help. I also considered vector math and reached a similar conclusion, but that\u2019s harder to understand and doesn\u2019t help much. I think addition and multiplication are actually the best operators to analyze.</p>\n<p>My solution involves a way to set up the factors so that multiplication will always get a useful result. Multiplication is a more promising lead than addition because you actually can multiply factors from different dimensions, whereas you cannot add them at all. Multiplication gets multi-dimensional units, which have problematic usefulness, while addition isn\u2019t able to combine terms with different, non-convertible units. Interestingly, most attempts to solve this problem have focused on addition not multiplication. (In short, they try to convert between dimensions to enable addition. That\u2019s usually done by converting all factors into a generic goodness dimension.) I think one reason for the focus on addition is because people haven\u2019t laid out the problem in the way this article does.</p>\n<p>Before discussing my solution, I\u2019ll explain the problem and math more, and relate some common approaches to arithmetic.</p>\n<h3>Multi-Dimensional Units</h3>\n<p>Some multi-dimensional units are useful, such as miles per hour, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year\">DALYs</a> per dollar, dollar-days that an order is late, square feet or cubic meters. These correspond to meaningful concepts that we can think and reason about, and which have some meaning in reality. But the vast majority of multi-dimensional units, which are allowed by logic, don\u2019t correspond to concepts that make sense to us.</p>\n<p>Most useful combinations of dimensions use only two factors. Random combinations with many factors are very unlikely to be useful. And being able to make a decision that takes into account many factors is our goal.</p>\n<p>There are intuitive, useful examples with four factors, such as volume/time (e.g. how quickly you can fill a pool with water) or volume/dollar (e.g. how expensive it is to remove rock to build a tunnel). These follow a standard pattern, which is to take a meaningful concept and then divide it by the cost. That tells you how much of something you get for spending some amount resources (which are most typically measured in time or money). Because volume is three-dimensional, and dividing by cost adds one dimension, the final result is four-dimensional. Volume is the only easy, common, standard example of a three dimensional unit, without division, that has a clear, useful meaning. That\u2019s because we live in a three-dimensional reality (three spatial dimensions). Useful two-dimensional units are more common, including area. Some experts, like physicists, deal with more complicated multi-dimensional units sometimes. But they only use specific multi-dimensional units that have some connection with physical reality that makes them useful. They don\u2019t have a good way to use arbitrary multi-dimensional units.</p>\n<h3>Averaging Factors</h3>\n<p>Dimensions can\u2019t be added together at all, and they can only be usefully multiplied in special cases. What about combining factors by finding the average (mean)?</p>\n<p>To get an average, you sum quantities and then divide by the total number of quantities summed. This involves addition, so it runs into the same problems with addition that we\u2019ve discussed.

So averaging won\u2019t help. It could only be useful as a secondary technique if addition worked.</p>\n<p>Finding the median or mode (different types of averages) wouldn\u2019t work well either. Both of those would get a result in a single dimension rather than combining factors from different dimensions. And you\u2019d need to be able to rank all the factors from different dimensions, in a single ranking, in order to find the median.</p>\n<h3>Rank Ordering and Terms</h3>\n<p>The method of comparing options that we\u2019ve been considering is <em>ranking</em> them. E.g. if our options have values of 4, 3 and 8, we can rank them: 8 is the best, then 4, then 3. This is also called <em>ordering</em> or <em>sorting</em>. Ranking requires knowing which option is best but sorting doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard requirements for ranking options:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each value is <strong>only one term</strong>. E.g. we can rank an option with the value 4x but not with the value <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"2x + y\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">+</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;\">y</span></span></span></span></span></span> .</li>\n<li>They are <strong>like terms</strong>. We can rank 4x and 2x, but we can\u2019t rank 4x and 2y.</li>\n<li>We know whether the variable part is positive or negative. You might assume 4x should be ranked higher than 3x, but if x is negative then 3x is actually larger.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can sort with just (1) and (2). But for making a decision we\u2019ll want to rank them with the best one first, so we\u2019ll need (3) too.</p>\n<p>We can sometimes rank things without meeting all the requirements, but we usually can\u2019t. If we want a general purpose method, then they\u2019re required.</p>\n<p>Next I\u2019ll explain some of the terminology and what the ranking rules mean.</p>\n<p>A <strong>term</strong> is basically a single thing in math. A term has two parts, a number (the \u201ccoefficient\u201d or \u201cnumerical part\u201d) and everything else (the \u201cvariable\u201d or \u201cliteral\u201d part). For example, in the term 4x, the coefficient is 4 and the variable part is x. A term must have a coefficient but doesn\u2019t have to have a variable. 7 is a valid term. If you see a variable with no coefficient, like y, then the coefficient is 1. 1y and y are the same thing, so people usually don\u2019t write the 1.</p>\n<p>The two parts of a term are being multiplied together. For example, if the term is 2x, and we know that x is 3, then the value of the term is  <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"2x = 2 * 3 = 6\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u2217</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">3</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">6</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>The variable part of a term can be somewhat complicated. <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"5wx^3y\\sqrt{z}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">5</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">w</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">3</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;\">y</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msqrt\"><span class=\"mjx-box\" style=\"padding-top: 0.045em;\"><span class=\"mjx-surd\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">\u221a</span></span><span class=\"mjx-box\" style=\"padding-top: 0.236em; border-top: 1px solid;\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">z</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>  is one term.

Like terms can have any coefficient. x, 5x and 22x are like terms. The terms 3xyz and 17xyz are also like. But 5, 5y and 5x are unlike terms.</p>\n<p>Like terms which are added together can be combined into one term. That\u2019s a standard part of simplifying. E.g. we simplify 3x + 2x to 5x. Adding like terms is done by adding the coefficients while leaving the variable part alone.</p>\n<p>Like terms can be added that way because they are different amounts of the same thing. The coefficient is the amount and the variable part is the thing. This works with everyday things. 3 pounds of bacon is a term that can be added with 2 pounds of bacon to get 5 pounds of bacon. The result is a single term because they are like terms \u2013&nbsp;the \u201cpounds of bacon\u201d part is the variable part and it\u2019s the same for each term. You could also add apples to apples or slices of bacon to slices of bacon.</p>\n<p>However, you can\u2019t additively combine 3 pounds of bacon with 2 apples, nor with 2 pounds of apples, to get one term, because they are not like terms (the variable parts are different).

For example, you can convert pounds of bacon to calories, and you can also convert apples to calories. That lets you get a single number of calories for each option involving bacon and apples, and then you can rank them, with the most calories being at either the top or the bottom of the rankings depending on what you want. (Actually what people often want is a medium amount of calories \u2013 not too many nor too few. That is a complication that makes decision making based on ranking harder.)</p>\n<p>This shows how unit conversion matters (you couldn\u2019t combine them without doing a conversion first) and how your goals matter. Instead of ranking by calories, you could rank by carbohydrates, fat, protein or a nutrient like vitamin C. Which ranking(s) matter to you, and are suitable for making your decision, depends on your goals. However, often you care about multiple things, e.g. both calories and carbohydrates. No single ranking will take into account your goals about both calories and carbohydrates unless you find a way to convert calories and carbohydrates into the same dimension.</p>\n<p>When we see multiple terms added together, we should simplify first before counting how many terms we have. Alternatively, we could count unlike terms.</p>\n<p>The important thing, for our purposes, is whether there are two or more unlike terms (or two or more terms after simplifying). If there are, that prevents rank ordering.</p>\n<p>We can rank options that have different amounts of bacon. And we can rank options that have different numbers of apples. But we can\u2019t straightforwardly rank options that provide both apples and bacon.</p>\n<p>Mathematically, we can rank <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"7x, 3x\\ and\\ 11x\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">7</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">,</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">3</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.291em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">a</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">n</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">d</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.291em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">11</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span></span></span></span>  because those are like terms.

That\u2019s an example of strict superiority. It doesn\u2019t work as a general purpose approach.)</p>\n<p>To rank values involving two or more terms, we need conversion factors (or, equivalently, a system of equations). The basic idea is that you can only rank bacon plus apples, together, if you know how much bacon is worth one apple. You need a formula that tells you how to convert bacon into an equivalent amount of apples, which lets you reduce the foods to one term. But there\u2019s often no conversion factor, e.g. cuteness and price are different things and there isn\u2019t a specific amount of cuteness that\u2019s worth a dollar. I discuss conversion factors more later.</p>\n<p>Like terms are quantitatively different (the coefficient is the quantity, amount or degree) while unlike terms are qualitatively different (the variable part is the dimensions, types, kinds, qualities or categories). That means you can only rank order values which are in the same dimension(s).</p>\n<p>This is another way to see what I explained earlier about addition, multiplication and dimensions. Unlike terms \u2013 terms with different dimensions \u2013&nbsp;can\u2019t be combined into one term (the same dimensions) by addition, so they can\u2019t be ranked and compared. However, unlike terms can be multiplied to get a single term with a new, more complicated set of multiple dimensions (the variable part), like how <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"2x * 4y = 8xy\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u2217</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">4</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;\">y</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">8</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;\">y</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<h3>Adding and Multiplying Like and Unlike Terms</h3>\n<p>2x + 3x is like saying 2 apples + 3 apples, so you can just add it and get 5 apples</p>\n<p>2x + 3y is like saying 2 apples + 3 bananas, so you can\u2019t combine those terms. You can\u2019t simplify it into one term unless you convert. You can make it 2 fruit + 3 fruit = 5 fruit. They can be combined in that case because you converted so that the variable part is the same. You can\u2019t combine them, with addition, as long as the variable part is different.</p>\n<p>You can also see this with adding fractions.

Adding unlike terms is the one scenario where we end up with multiple terms instead of being able to combine stuff into one term.</p>\n<h2>Dimensions and Decision Making</h2>\n<h3>Pro/Con Lists</h3>\n<p>People define abstract goodness points and try to convert factors into those points so that they can add the factors up. People often do this without knowing that it\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. They may not know the math, or use numbers, but they still try to use an equivalent thinking process.</p>\n<p>A good mental model of what people often do is a pro/con list. Even when people don\u2019t write things out, many decision making processes are similar to using a pro/con list. People try to consider the plusses and minuses of different options and evaluate which is best overall.</p>\n<p>How do pro/con lists work? You list pros, list cons, and try to calculate or estimate how good the pros are minus how bad the cons are. But pro/con lists contain many factors from many different dimensions. So this is an attempt to combine factors from different dimensions by addition.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example article explaining a standard approach that I disagree with: <a href=\"https://leandecisions.com/2012/09/how-to-create-an-effective-weighted-pro-con-list.html\">How to Create an Effective Weighted Pro-Con List</a>. A similar approach is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisional_balance_sheet\">decisional balance sheets</a>. There are also more complex approaches that add weighted factors, e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process\">analytic hierarchy process</a>.</p>\n<p>How are pros added together despite being in different dimensions? One tries to judge how good they are. In other words, one converts each factor into another dimension (goodness). Then, once the factors are all in the same dimension, they\u2019re added together to get a sum total of goodness. The same is done with cons. They\u2019re converted to badness, which is just the negative numbers in the goodness dimension, not a separate dimension. Then the total badness is added with the total goodness to get an overall amount of goodness (because badness is a negative number, adding it is equivalent to subtracting its absolute value).</p>\n<p>Many decision making processes are comparable to pro/con lists. People, in some form (most often without numbers), try to add up the pros of each option and subtract the cons. Any kind of <em>weighted factor analysis</em> is also similar to using pro/con lists.</p>\n<p>This approach <em>doesn\u2019t work well</em> because there\u2019s no good way to convert from each dimension into a goodness dimension. The conversion factors are made up somewhat arbitrarily. This is basically an attempt to convert between dimensions using a two-step process, which isn\u2019t better.</p>\n<p>Conversions work in both directions (if you can convert miles to feet, you can also convert feet to miles). Suppose you can convert both friendliness and cuteness to goodness. That means you can convert from cuteness to goodness and then convert that from goodness to friendliness. This implies a conversion from cuteness to friendliness.</p>\n<p>In other words, suppose you come up with these two conversions (f is friendliness, c is cuteness, and g is goodness):</p>\n<p><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"f = 4g\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;\">f</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">4</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">g</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"c = 2g\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">c</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">g</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>Mathematically, that implies (using substitution):</p>\n<p><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"f = 2c\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;\">f</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">c</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t accurately compare friendliness and cuteness directly, you also can\u2019t convert them both to the same type of goodness.</p>\n<p>Below, I\u2019ll discuss problems with converting to goodness in more detail.</p>\n<h3>Goldratt\u2019s Pro/Con Lists</h3>\n<p>Although the standard use of pro/con lists involves adding factors, they can potentially be used in other ways. There\u2019s nothing wrong with brainstorming pros and cons. It\u2019s combining them by addition that\u2019s problematic.</p>\n<p>In <em>It\u2019s Not Luck</em> (ch. 21), Eli Goldratt discussed using a pro/con list to decide whether or not to buy a boat. He proposed looking at every con and trying to come up with a solution for it, and buying a boat only if every problem was solved (cons are problems). That\u2019s a decision making method which doesn\u2019t add factors. (It\u2019s actually combining factors with multiplication, as I\u2019ll explain later.)</p>\n<p>Goldratt also has other proposals, in the same chapter, like using if-then logic to casually connect an action, like buying the boat, to each con. How will taking the action cause each con? Map that out instead of relying on intuition to connect cons to the action. A solution has to address a con\u2019s causes. A solution changes something so that cause-and-effect (reality, nature, logic) no longer causes the con.</p>\n<h3>Converting Chess Dimensions</h3>\n<p>In order to add factors, people try to create unit conversions between dimensions. For example, if we say that 1 mile is worth 20 grams, then we\u2019ll be able to add length to weight. Like multiplying dimensions, this works OK in special cases. But it doesn\u2019t work most of the time. There are few contexts in which 1 mile is worth 20 grams. We usually can\u2019t make up a good conversion factor between dimensions. And no conversion factor between dimensions works in all contexts. And we should expect the conversion factor to always be approximate. The narrower the context, the better chance we have to come up with a decent conversion.</p>\n<p>An especially narrow context is board games. They have clearly defined options (the actions that the rules allow the players to take) and clearly defined objectives (how you win).</p>\n<p>Chess has two players, 64 squares, and a single starting position with 32 pieces on the board. Chess lacks the complexity of regular life, which makes conversions between dimensions work better.</p>\n<p>The dimensions in chess games include, for each player, the number of pawns, number of queens, king safety, piece mobility, center control, number of passed pawns, location of passed pawns, and it being your turn. Those are all different factors that can be taken into account when evaluating which side is winning.</p>\n<p>The only decisions in chess games are which moves to play, and the moves are done one at a time with the two players taking turns. In any position, there is a list of legal moves a player can play, and each move can be evaluated based on how it affects factors like pawn count, king safety, center control, etc.</p>\n<p>Typical chess software evaluates chess positions by converting between various dimensions, adding up all the factors, and getting an overall score for how good a position is for white compared to black (subtract black\u2019s score from white\u2019s to figure out which side is winning, which is what actually matters).</p>\n<p>The standard units of goodness are the number of pawns. The value of having a pawn is defined as one point. Everything else is converted into those points. For example, having a rook is worth 5 points, a queen 9.75 points, and a knight 3.25 points. For mobility, we can count how many different squares a piece can move to (how many legal moves can we currently make with that piece?), and multiply that by a factor based on which piece it is, and then add that many points. E.g. every square a bishop can currently move to is worth 0.03 points, so if a bishop can move to 10 squares that\u2019s worth 0.3 points.</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t work perfectly for all chess positions, and humans can evaluate some chess positions better than software does. But it works reasonably well in most positions that actually come up in chess games. It\u2019s good enough to play chess well when it\u2019s combined with also looking ahead at many possible moves and counter-moves with the speed and accuracy of a modern computer. Overall, this type of chess software is better than the top human players. Even without looking many moves ahead, this kind of chess software is better than most human players.</p>\n<p>How often and how well does life approximate chess? How often are situations so simple? Rarely. Especially for difficult decisions that involve many factors.</p>\n<p>In life, it\u2019s generally much harder to add factors from different dimensions to get a reasonable, approximate answer. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to create software that\u2019s good at deciding on chess moves based on many factors, but we don\u2019t yet have software to decide what groceries to get (let alone who to marry). In many ways, choosing groceries is actually way more complicated than chess and the factors involved are harder to convert between.</p>\n<h3>Dollars per Hour</h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at another example of converting between dimensions. In a sufficiently narrow context, you can approximately convert between time and money, since (hypothetically) you work for an hourly wage and work a flexible number of hours that you choose.</p>\n<p>But this is only approximate. You can only work 24 hours in a day at most, so that limits the rate of converting time to money. And once you retire, you can\u2019t convert money in the bank into more free time. You can\u2019t reduce your work hours below zero.</p>\n<p>Realistically, you could only work around 15 hours per day at most. And you\u2019d be miserable if you kept that up for very long. It\u2019s hard to give an exact number for how much you could work. That makes it hard to make the unit conversion formula accurate. (The proper formula, rather than just saying $20/hr, would also specify any limits on how much can be converted, and specify any changes to the conversion rate as more is converted, e.g. it\u2019d take into account overtime pay.)</p>\n<p>If you work long hours, you may get tired, bored or lonely \u2013 or just sad about missing your favorite TV show. You could even get a repetitive stress injury or be gradually poisoned by imperfectly safe working conditions. Working longer hours has downsides other than the amount of time it takes. So the conversion between time and money is only approximate, since it ignores other relevant factors. When you try to convert time with money, in either direction, other things happen too \u2013&nbsp;the effect is not purely to change your time and money.</p>\n<p>This kind of analysis works less well in most real situations. E.g., most jobs actually have pretty limited flexibility for how many hours you work. What some people do is make money from something on the side, and then if it does well enough they quit their job entirely. They don\u2019t gradually reduce the hours they work as their side project replaces that income.</p>\n<h3>Converting Dimensions to Goodness</h3>\n<p>Converting dimensions to goodness (or any similar dimension like awesomeness or desirability) is problematic because there\u2019s no good way to figure out what the conversion factors should be. There are no universally correct factors. It\u2019s not like converting inches to feet, where the objectively correct factor is <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"12 inches = 1 foot\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">12</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">i</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">n</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">c</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">h</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">e</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;\">f</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">o</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">o</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span></span></span></span></span>. You have to look at the context and then use approximate factors that try to take into account the context well. There are no straightforward or mathematical methods that tell you how to take into account context.</p>\n<p>In life, often large parts of your life are relevant context that is connected to a decision in some way. Chess software works well because there is no other context to take into account from outside the chess game. For human chess players, sometimes they actually do take into account outside context. For example, they may be bribed to lose on purpose in a game that people have placed bets on. Or they may lose on purpose while playing against their child. Or they they may leave a game in the middle, and forfeit, due to a family emergency. However, ignoring outside context usually works as a good approximation for humans while playing chess.</p>\n<p>How much is 5 points of goodness? Or 200 points? There are no fixed points in this made-up dimension to compare against. There\u2019s no way to get your bearings. People invent scales like 0 is neutral, -100 is the worst, and 100 is the best. But if something is pretty good, is that a 60 or a 70, or something else? There\u2019s no clear way to find out. And it\u2019s hard to be consistent for each factor you convert because \u201cpretty good\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the identical thing when you say those two vague words about different factors that are good in different ways. \u201cPretty good\u201d at making money and \u201cpretty good\u201d at not beating your wife shouldn\u2019t score the same amount of goodness points! If a used car seems pretty good for price and pretty good for safety, does that actually mean the same thing for both factors? Should both factors both we worth the same number of points? Doubtful.</p>\n<p>We can <em>measure</em> inches. We know what those units mean. But we can\u2019t measure goodness points.</p>\n<p>We can\u2019t measure cuteness of a pet either, but an individual can rank it. Which pet do you think is the cutest, second cutest, etc., in your opinion? And you can assign the pets numeric cuteness scores which are compatible with your rankings (highest ranked pet has the highest score, second highest ranked pet has the second highest score, etc.). You can also make cuteness scores approximate your opinion of how different the pets are. E.g. if the best two pets are similarly cute, and the third pet is much less cute, you might score them 85, 80 and 40. Those scores fine as long as you know they aren\u2019t real measurements like inches. The cuteness scores just mean two things: the rank ordering you assigned the pets and a rough approximation of how close or far apart the pets are for cuteness in your opinion.</p>\n<p>We can look at goodness of one factor in a similar way to looking at cuteness. We can convert from cuteness to goodness and get meaningful rankings or approximate numeric scores. Call that cuteness-goodness. And we an also convert from price to goodness and get meaningful rankings and more exact numeric scores. Call that price-goodness. But <em>cuteness-goodness and price-goodness are not really the same thing</em> and adding them still doesn\u2019t actually work. Converting everything to the <em>same</em> goodness dimension is harder.</p>\n<p>What do people do about that? They multiply by weighting factors that get results they think are reasonable. But that isn\u2019t actually a way of making decisions. How do they know what\u2019s reasonable? They must be using their intuition, common sense or something else other than weighted factor summing. So the weighted factor summing method doesn\u2019t work as a self-contained solution to decision making. It relies on pre-existing opinions reached some other way. People often make the math (or non-numerical estimate) come out to fit what they already think (without realizing they\u2019re doing it). For example, college rankings often start with the pre-existing idea that Harvard is good and then give high weightings to whatever factors Harvard is good at so that Harvard-like schools come out on top, which seems like a reasonable conclusion to people who already believed that Harvard is one of the best schools.</p>\n<p>Any method involving arbitrary choices (like what unit conversions or weights to make up) runs into a major problem: You have no good way to make an arbitrary choice unless you have pre-existing knowledge of what a good answer is.</p>\n<p>There are other difficulties with converting to the goodness dimension. I\u2019ll point out several more.</p>\n<p>How do you convert binary factors? Not everything is best represented as an amount. E.g. a plan might be legal or illegal, which is problematic to convert into goodness points and then factor into your overall evaluation. (One approach is to rule out any option with a dealbreaker factor, then score options by the goodness of the other factors and use that as a tiebreaker among the options with no dealbreakers. That is a two-part decision making process which makes goodness the less important part, so in a significant sense it\u2019s actually giving up on using goodness scores and moving away from that method.)</p>\n<p>How do you convert category-based factors, such as species? A pet could be a turtle, dog or rabbit. How do you convert those into points when there isn\u2019t even any clear ordering for them? (You could rank or score each species by how much you like it. But then you\u2019re converting a different factor \u2013 how much you like the species&nbsp;\u2013 rather than the species itself. And you\u2019d still run into all the problems discussed for cuteness above.)</p>\n<p>How do you check if your conversion to goodness is correct? Because you\u2019re making up something that\u2019s partly arbitrary, there\u2019s no good way to check your work. There\u2019s no answer key or objective right answer that you can compare against. This makes it hard to correct errors when using goodness conversions.</p>\n<p>How do you take into account contextual factors when converting dimensions to goodness? How do you know what parts of context matter and how much? How do you know what changes to your situation mean you need to reconsider? There\u2019s no clear answer. People try to muddle through this, usually using lots of intuition, common sense and traditional knowledge (we\u2019ve at least learned a little from the many mistakes of past generations). It\u2019s really hard to do this well in an explicit, rational or mathematical way.</p>\n<p>These are major problems, so let\u2019s look at alternative approaches.</p>\n<h3>Alternative Approaches</h3>\n<p>A different way to make decisions is to choose based on <em>one factor</em>. If we focus on a single factor, instead of trying to consider many factors from many dimensions, then evaluating options is much easier. With this method, we don\u2019t combine factors. This avoids the difficulty of converting between dimensions to add factors. It also avoids the difficulty of multiplying factors and getting multi-dimensional units that aren\u2019t useful. The downside is that we don\u2019t take into account multiple factors. This doesn\u2019t achieve our goal of making a decision based on many factors.</p>\n<p>Another common method is cost-benefit analysis. This works by looking at two factors, cost and benefit. Each of those factors uses only one dimension. E.g. benefit is measured only as the number of people helped and cost is measured only as dollars. A single benefit factor can work OK, as a reasonable approximation, if you\u2019re focusing on getting one type of benefit. Viewing all costs in dollars can work OK, as a reasonable approximation, because so many things are available for sale with prices in dollars. Sometimes viewing cost as time works too (you can add up the time every step in a project will take you, and divide the benefit by that much time).</p>\n<p>After determining the cost and benefit, the factors are combined by division, which is a type of multiplication. The resulting units are two-dimensional, and tell you how much benefit you get per unit of the cost. (That\u2019s similar to miles per hour, which is a two-dimensional unit that tells you how many miles you can travel per hour spent driving.) Cost/benefit analysis works well because multiplication is a valid way to combine dimensions and it creates two-dimensional units that are actually useful.</p>\n<p>For example, for one plan, your two factors could be \u201chelps 300 people\u201d and \u201ccosts 100 dollars\u201d. Then you\u2019d divide them to get <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"3\\frac{people}{dollar}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">3</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mfrac\"><span class=\"mjx-box MJXc-stacked\" style=\"width: 2.065em; padding: 0px 0.12em;\"><span class=\"mjx-numerator\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; width: 2.921em; top: -1.594em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">p</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">e</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">o</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">p</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">l</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">e</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-denominator\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; width: 2.921em; bottom: -0.704em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.003em;\">d</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">o</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">l</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">l</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">a</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">r</span></span></span></span><span style=\"border-bottom: 1.3px solid; top: -0.296em; width: 2.065em;\" class=\"mjx-line\"></span></span><span style=\"height: 1.625em; vertical-align: -0.498em;\" class=\"mjx-vsize\"></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

They are limited by only taking into account a few factors. They don\u2019t give a general purpose solution, that works in any situation, for looking at many factors from many dimensions.</p>\n<h2>Critical Fallibilism\u2019s Solution</h2>\n<h3>Binary Factor Multiplication</h3>\n<p>I propose a different approach. There\u2019s a way to combine unlimited factors from different dimensions without doing unit conversions. It uses multiplication not addition.</p>\n<p>The typical problem with multiplication is getting a result with multi-dimensional units that don\u2019t mean anything useful, e.g. the five-dimensional units gram-second-meter-dollar-Celsius. That result isn\u2019t logically wrong, but there\u2019s no good way to interpret the result and relate it to your life. This problem gets worse with more factors.</p>\n<p>But <em>we can multiply binary factors and always get a meaningful, useful result</em>. This allows using many factors and combining them into one result. It can also be combined with some other methods. You can look at a single factor, or a cost/benefit ratio, and then multiply that with an unlimited number of binary factors to get a useful result. The problems with multiplying dimensions actually come from multiplying non-binary factors, not any factors.</p>\n<p>Binary factors mean factors with only two possible values. Mathematically, the values are 1 and 0. Conceptually, they\u2019re pass and fail.</p>\n<p>Binary factors typically ask if something is good enough to meet some criterion; e.g., is this pet within my budget? Is this pet small enough for my kid to hold? Is this pet safe enough for my family? Is this pet cute in the opinions of all of my children? Binary factors can also consider if something fits in a category or not; e.g., is it black?</p>\n<p>You can combine binary factors with logical operators to get new binary factors. A typical combiner is \u201cand\u201d; e.g., is it cheap enough <em>and</em> also cute enough? You can also combine binary factors with \u201cor\u201d; e.g., is it black <em>or</em> orange?</p>\n<p>Multiplying binary factors is a way to check if any of them fail or not. If they all pass, the result of the multiplication is \u201cpass\u201d (1). If one or more fails, the result is \u201cfail\u201d (0). You can see this yourself by multiplying different combinations of 1s and 0s together and observing the results. <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"1a * 1b * 1c * 1d * 1e = 1abcde\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em;

No number of 1\u2019s can make up for, or cancel out, a single 0. Like all the math in this article, this is uncontroversial.</p>\n<p>Multiplying binary factors is equivalent to using the logical \u201cand\u201d operator on them. Thinking of it in terms of \u201cand\u201d can be helpful. Multiplying binary factors combines them by saying you want factor A to pass, <em>and</em> factor B to pass, <em>and</em> factor C to pass, and so on. The result is whether the whole combination passes or not, just like the logical \u201cand\u201d operator only outputs \u201ctrue\u201d if <em>every</em> input is true.</p>\n<p>The result of multiplying binary factors has multi-dimensional units. But the number in front of the units will always be 0 or 1, pass or fail. The problem of arbitrary numbers doesn\u2019t come up. And the result tells us something meaningful and useful: did the factors pass in every dimension or not?</p>\n<p>In this case, the multi-dimensional units are useful and appropriate. They\u2019re basically a list telling us which factors passed. And they fit our goal because we come up with binary factors by relating non-binary factors to our goals (what is good enough for success).</p>\n<p>So far, this solution works mathematically, and deals with many factors, which is an improvement over previous attempts. But it has a major limitation. It\u2019s limited to binary dimensions, not any dimensions. What if we want to take into account many non-binary factors like cuteness, size, price or time?</p>\n<p>So there\u2019s a second part to the solution which makes it more useful. We need a <em>method of converting from non-binary factors to binary factors</em>. This is similar to the problem of converting between dimensions. In fact, technically, it does involve converting between dimensions. However, it\u2019s much easier than converting between any two dimensions (like cuteness and weight). It\u2019s basically a simplified special case of converting between dimensions.</p>\n<h3>Converting to Binary Factors</h3>\n<p>For any non-binary dimension, there are many related binary dimensions. They\u2019re technically different dimensions, but they\u2019re similar to the non-binary dimension. Converting to them isn\u2019t like converting between arbitrary, separate dimensions.</p>\n<p>A reason converting to a related binary dimension is easier is that it\u2019s a one-way conversion rather than a symmetric conversion that works in either direction. It\u2019s <em>simplifying</em>. It tries to convert to something simpler not something equivalent. The conversion to a related binary dimension loses information, rather than attempting to retain full information. You can\u2019t convert back from \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d to the original value.</p>\n<p>Converting to from a non-binary dimension to a binary dimension is also easier because it doesn\u2019t attempt to convert multiple factors into the same dimension. Each non-binary factor gets its own related binary dimension. There\u2019s still no way to convert between any of the original factors. They remain separate. The goal of general conversion was to take fundamentally different things and treat them as the same. The goal of converting from non-binary to binary is to take something and find a simplified version of the same thing.</p>\n<p>Here are some example binary dimensions related to the price dimension. \u201cIs the price above $5?\u201d, \u201cIs the price above $6?\u201d, \u201cIs the price below $5?\u201d, \u201cDoes the price fit my budget?\u201d, \u201cAm I satisfied by the price?\u201d For each of these, you can actually convert from a non-binary price number, like $20, to an accurate answer in the binary dimension. It\u2019s not like converting between price and cuteness where you have to make stuff up. There are objectively correct answers to these questions.</p>\n<p>You can convert from any dimension to many related binary dimensions by asking yes-or-no questions about the binary dimension. The most important question is \u201cIs it good enough?\u201d and variations on that theme. Does this factor meet my needs and goals, or not? Am I satisfied, or not? Will the value of this factor cause failure at my goal, or not? Do I have a decisive criticism of this option, which is related to this factor, or not?</p>\n<p>So decision making basically works like this: Take your goal(s) and consider what is necessary for success rather than failure. Then evaluate factors in a binary, pass/fail way based on whether they will result in failure or they\u2019re good enough. Then multiply them together to get an overall, combined pass/fail result.</p>\n<h3>Paradigm Shift</h3>\n<p>This method may sound weird or undesirable. It\u2019s different than how people are used to thinking about multi-factor decision making. I ask you to give it a chance on the basis that <em>the math works</em>. That makes it worth consideration. There are no known general purpose alternatives with working math! The approach of adding different dimensions together works as an approximation in narrow contexts, but is fundamentally broken&nbsp;as a general method of thinking. It\u2019s in widespread use for e.g. Consumer Reports product evaluations, college rankings, and car rankings, but it actually makes a poor approximation in all of those cases. Malcom Gladwell wrote a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/14/the-order-of-things\">nice article</a> that explains concretely why college and car rankings don\u2019t work well.</p>\n<p>Besides math, my approach makes sense in terms of Critical Rationalism and Theory of Constraints. There is also some overlap with ideas in self-help and psychology literature, e.g. <em>maximizers and satisficers</em>.</p>\n<p>Maximizers try to make a perfect decision. They want to optimize all the factors to get the best answer they can. This leads to perfectionism and other problems. Trying to add up all the factors into an overall evaluation is a maximizer style strategy. The addition approach says that if one factor changes a little bit, the overall evaluation should also change at least a little bit. In other words, every detail matters. Whenever you get a little bit of new information, you should update your conclusion to a new, better, more perfect conclusion. This attitude can be seen with Bayesians who think it\u2019s rational and optimal to update on any new piece of evidence, rather than striving to design robust systems so that small differences don\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>Satisficers (based on the words \u201csatisfy\u201d and \u201csuffice\u201d) try to come up with criteria for what is good enough to satisfy them. They come up with achievable goals and they will pick any solution which meets their goals. This is similar to the binary factors approach which focuses on success, as against failure, rather than perfect maximizing. In this approach, decisions have resilience. The data could change a little and it probably wouldn\u2019t change the conclusion. Small changes to \u201cpass\u201d factors usually leave the conclusion as \u201cpass\u201d (and small changes to \u201cfail\u201d usually mean it still fails). This leads to optimizing important things and paying attention to big differences, but avoids perfectionist over-optimization of every minor detail.</p>\n<p>When data (and arguments or reasoning) is mapped to pass or fail conclusions, there is a many-to-one mapping, which makes conclusions resilient: the data (and arguments or reasoning) can change and still reach the same conclusion. By contrast, with a one-to-one mapping of data (and arguments or reasoning) to conclusions, any change in the data requires a new conclusion. Attempting one-to-one mappings is typical of maximization approaches, including adding up many factors to get an overall conclusion (if any one factor goes up, the overall evaluation should also go up).</p>\n<p>There are even self-help books that talk about binary goals. <em>How to Be an Imperfectionist</em> by Stephen Guise says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The secret to consistent success that compounds over time is to combine small goals with the binary mindset: one push-up a day = (binary) 1 = success. The binary mindset reframes what success and perfection are to you, and the small goal makes the target so easy it\u2019s nearly impossible to resist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The book has a section explaining what binary and analog are and how to use a \u201cbinary mindset\u201d. In short, it\u2019s impossible to do analog tasks perfectly, so perfectionists struggle. A binary mindset allows perfection (1 or pass is a <em>perfect score</em>), so perfectionists can be satisfied, happy and done. The book even talks about converting goals from binary to analog or vice versa. Understanding ideas like these can help make Critical Fallibilism more intuitive.</p>\n<h3>Sub-goals</h3>\n<p>When we evaluate options, we consider many factors. Why? Because we have one or more goals and we want to choose an option which does well at our goals. We think the factors are relevant to our goals.</p>\n<p>Factors should be sub-goals. Doing well on a factor is one part of your overall goal(s). If a factor wasn\u2019t a sub-goal, then why would you want to take it into account? It wouldn\u2019t matter to you.</p>\n<p>Using binary factors means using binary sub-goals. We can view goals in terms of success or failure instead of amounts of success or amounts of goodness. With clear (sub-)goals that unambiguously define what constitutes success (pass) or not (fail), we can then evaluate options in a pass/fail way. Does the option pass every sub-goal? In other words, evaluate each option for whether it passes or fails at each factor (sub-goal), then combine the factors by multiplying to get an overall pass or fail result which tells you whether using the option will succeed at all your (sub-)goals or not.</p>\n<p>An overall goal is a combination of (binary) sub-goals. You multiply them together to get the overall goal (also called a big-picture, final or combination goal). The overall goal is in multi-dimensional units involving every dimension you want to succeed in. An option, to meet that goal, should also be in multi-dimensional units \u2013 the same units. So to succeed at an eight-dimensional goal, we need an option involving eight factors, in eight dimensions, that we can multiply together to get an eight-dimensional result. It actually makes sense that the dimensions of an option we\u2019re considering should match the dimensions of the goal we\u2019re trying to achieve.</p>\n<h3>Philosophical Meaning of Binary Approach</h3>\n<p>If an idea passes at every factor or dimension, that means, in short, that there are <em>no known errors</em> with the option. We don\u2019t have a decisive criticism of the option. It\u2019s non-refuted rather than refuted. As best we know, it\u2019s a viable solution to our problem(s). It survived criticism and still seems adequate to achieve our goal(s). We think this option will accomplish our purpose. If we use this option, we can expect success rather than failure. (These are high level statements to give you a preview of what Critical Fallibilism says, and what kinds of concepts it deals with. You may also notice connections with Critical Rationalism.)</p>\n<p>Instead of assuming more goodness is better, we should learn to think in terms of how much is good enough and where the breakpoints are. Trying to get more goodness for every factor results in wasting time on local optima instead of only optimizing bottlenecks. In any stable, viable system, most factors have excess capacity and we don\u2019t need more of them. (This paragraph briefly indicated how Theory of Constraints ideas are used in Critical Fallibilism.)</p>\n<h3>History of Binary Approach</h3>\n<p>So far, this article hasn\u2019t fully explained the binary decision making method. If you think it\u2019s incomplete, you\u2019re right. There are more questions to answer about how and why it works. Those will be covered in future articles (and you can find some answers in my previous articles like <a href=\"https://criticalfallibilism.com/yes-or-no-philosophy-summary/\">Yes or No Philosophy Summary</a>). I think it\u2019ll be useful if I provide some background information before concluding.</p>\n<p>I first developed this method by trying to understand and improve on Karl Popper\u2019s philosophy, <em>Critical Rationalism</em> (CR). CR proposes an evolutionary epistemology instead of a justificationist one, and focuses on fallibility, criticism and error correction. It advocates using exclusively negative arguments, and criticizes positive arguments. It rejects induction and says we learn by critical discussion.</p>\n<p>I wanted to understand more precisely what criticisms and errors were, and how to organize a critical discussion to be highly effective. CR says you can evaluate ideas based on many factors by looking only at criticism (not positive, supporting or justifying arguments) and then judging how well ideas stand up to criticism. I thought that was too vague.</p>\n<p>My insight was that a criticism says a reason an idea is an error (or else it isn\u2019t a valid criticism). I rejected partial, halfway criticism. A criticism should contradict the idea it\u2019s criticizing. If it\u2019s possible to accept both the criticism and the idea being criticized, then that\u2019s vague and ineffective thinking. This is how I came to favor a binary approach. I only looked at it mathematically later.</p>\n<p>I also wanted a way to reach clear, confident conclusions. Some fallibilists hesitate and hedge endlessly, but I didn\u2019t want that. (I don\u2019t think that would satisfy Popper either.)</p>\n<p>I also connected my focus on decisive criticism with the way error correction works. Analog systems are fundamentally limited in their compatibility with error correction. Our computers are digital \u2013 and in particular binary \u2013&nbsp;because it better enables error correction.</p>\n<p>After I had developed this idea non-mathematically for years, as an improvement on CR, I found Eli Goldratt\u2019s <em>Theory of Constraints</em> (TOC). TOC explains many thinking tools, some of which help with the binary approach to epistemology. TOC\u2019s ideas about constraints and excess capacity were particularly helpful. Another connection is TOC\u2019s way of using a pro/con list by ignoring the pros and trying to make every con a pass rather than fail. I mentioned above that that uses multiplication. Hopefully you can see now that it\u2019s equivalent to evaluating every con as a 1 or 0 and then multiplying them together to get an overall score of 1 (go ahead and buy the boat) or 0 (do not buy the boat).</p>\n<p>I looked at some self-help and psychology literature recently. It didn\u2019t inspire my ideas, but it\u2019s nice to find more lines of thinking that independently converge on some of the same conclusions, like the ideas about maximizers, satisficers, and using the binary mindset to help with perfectionism.</p>\n<p>A major reason for developing this approach is that it applies to rational debate. When people try to add up strong and weak arguments and evidence, they are adding linearly weighted factors. Each argument or piece of evidence is a factor. Evidence and arguments are judged for strength, which means assigning them weights even if no numbers are used. Criticisms have negative weights. However, arguments are in different dimensions so they can\u2019t be combined by adding. While studying philosophy, I rejected this approach to debate in favor of evaluating ideas as refuted or non-refuted and evaluating arguments as decisive or indecisive. Translating from epistemology to math provided another way to understand and explain the issue.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this article has been to look at methods for evaluating complex options and to connect them to math. It has focused on how combining many factors from different dimensions is hard. Addition and multiplication are standard combining operations but both run into major difficulties. They don\u2019t work as general purpose solutions. That motivates looking for alternatives. Experts have been aware of some difficulties but haven\u2019t been able to find any good alternatives. The binary factor multiplication approach is a novel and promising alternative.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Elliot Temple"}}, {"_id": "cKtbkTXWSD95LF6bj", "title": "EA community values and attitudes survey / polls?", "postedAt": "2022-10-30T14:44:05.204Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Would it be interesting to get a better overview about the communities detailed EA-related values and attitudes such as their risk attitudes, level of inequality aversion, degree of social value orientation, trust in institutions, perceptions/definitions of what is good/efficient/fair, etc.?</p>\n<p>This information could be elicited in one large or several small surveys or polls.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Jobst Heitzig (vodle.it)"}}, {"_id": "hxtwzcsz8hQfGyZQM", "title": "An Introduction to the Moral Weight Project", "postedAt": "2022-10-31T09:13:08.624Z", "htmlBody": "<h1><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h1><ul><li>Our objective: provide \u201cmoral weights\u201d for 11 farmed species.</li><li>To make this tractable, we made four assumptions: utilitarianism, hedonism, valence symmetry, and unitarianism.</li><li>Given these assumptions, an animal\u2019s \u201cmoral weight\u201d is that animal\u2019s capacity for welfare\u2014the total amount of welfare that the animal&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>realize.</li><li>Capacity for welfare = welfare range (the difference between the best and worst welfare states the individual can realize at a time) \u00d7 lifespan.</li><li>Given welfare ranges, we can convert welfare improvements into DALY-equivalents averted, making cross-species cost-effectiveness analyses possible.</li></ul><hr><h1><strong>An Introduction to the Moral Weight Project</strong></h1><p>If we want to do as much good as possible, we have to compare all the ways of doing good\u2014including ways that involve helping members of different species.

The aim of this post is to introduce the project and explain how EAs could use its results.<br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>DALYs-averted and \u201cmoral weight discounts\u201d&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>If we want to do the most good per dollar spent\u2014that is, if we want to maximize cost-effectiveness\u2014we need a common currency for comparing very different interventions. GiveWell, Founders Pledge, Open Philanthropy, and many other EA organizations currently have one: namely, the number of \u201cdisability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted.\u201d A DALY is a health measure with two parts:&nbsp;<i>years of human life lost</i> and&nbsp;<i>years of human life lost to disability</i>. The former measures the extent to which a condition shortens a human\u2019s life; the latter measures the health impact of living with a condition in terms of years of life lost. Together, these values represent the overall burden of the condition. So, averting a DALY is averting a loss\u2014namely, the loss of a single year of human life that\u2019s lived at full health.</p><p>Historically, some EAs used a \u201cmoral weight discount\u201d to convert changes in animals\u2019 welfare levels directly into DALYs-averted. That is, they understood the basic question to be:</p><blockquote><p>At what point should we be indifferent between (say) improving chickens\u2019 welfare and preventing the loss of a year of healthy human life?</p></blockquote><p>Then, the task is to identify the correct \u201cmoral weight discount rate\u201d to apply to the value of some quantity of chicken welfare to make it equal to the value of averting a DALY.</p><p>This framing makes it tempting to think in terms of the value that (certain groups of) people<i> assign&nbsp;</i>to chicken welfare (or the welfare of the members of whatever species) relative to the value that (certain groups of) people&nbsp;<i>assign&nbsp;</i>to preventing the loss of a year of healthy human life. This amounts to reinterpreting the question as follows:</p><blockquote><p>At what point <i>are</i> we indifferent between (say) improving chickens\u2019 welfare and preventing the loss of a year of healthy human life?</p></blockquote><p>We can tackle this new question by surveying people. Originally, though, we weren't asking a sociological question, but a normative one. The task is to determine when people&nbsp;<i>ought&nbsp;</i>to be indifferent between improving chickens\u2019 welfare and preventing the loss of a year of healthy human life.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, this requires sorting through the many combinations of plausible moral assumptions, sorting through solutions to the problem of moral uncertainty, sorting through responses to uncertainty about how to handle moral uncertainty, and so on. It\u2019s a gargantuan task. In the interest of making some progress, then, we\u2019re going to make some moral assumptions and proceed accordingly. In particular, we assume:</p><ul><li><strong>Utilitarianism</strong>, according to which you ought to maximize (expected) utility.</li><li><strong>Hedonism</strong>, according to which welfare is determined wholly by positively and negatively valenced experiences (roughly, experiences that feel good and bad to the subject).</li><li><strong>Valence symmetry</strong>, according to which positively and negatively valenced experiences of equal intensities have symmetrical impacts on welfare.</li><li><strong>Unitarianism</strong>, according to which equal amounts of welfare count equally, regardless of whose welfare it is.</li></ul><p>There are familiar arguments for and against these assumptions. We won\u2019t discuss such arguments here. Instead, we\u2019ll simply flag that while some aspects of the Moral Weight Project depend on these assumptions, much of it doesn\u2019t. In fact, we devote an entire post to discussing the impact of rejecting hedonism. So, we hope that our work still proves useful to those with other philosophical views.</p><p>In any case, given these assumptions, people ought to be indifferent between improving chickens\u2019 welfare and preventing the loss of a year of healthy human life&nbsp;<i>when the gain in welfare is equivalent.&nbsp;</i>And if that\u2019s the case, then the task is to determine when an improvement in animal welfare results in as much welfare as you\u2019d produce by extending a healthy human life by one year.</p><p>Or, rather, that\u2019s how we\u2019d answer the original, \"when should we be indifferent\" question. Again, though, what matters is that we find a way to express a change in animals\u2019 welfare levels in the same common currency that people already use to compare very different interventions: namely, as some number of DALY-equivalents averted. That\u2019s what matters for cost-effectiveness analyses across human and animal interventions, so that\u2019s the mandate of the Moral Weight Project.</p><h1><br><strong>Crucial concepts: capacity for welfare and welfare ranges</strong></h1><p>Given the moral assumptions mentioned above, we should reinterpret the concept of a \u201cmoral weight\u201d for members of particular species. Instead of being a measure of&nbsp;<i>how much people value members of [insert species name]</i>, a \u201cmoral weight\u201d is a measure of how much welfare animals of different kinds can potentially realize, produce, or generate\u2014their&nbsp;<i>capacity for welfare</i>. That is, our assumptions entail that everyone\u2019s welfare counts the same and that all welfare improvements count equally; still, members of some species may be able to realize more welfare than others. In essence, if welfare is like water, some individuals may be larger \u201cbuckets.\u201d (See Figure 1.) An individual doesn\u2019t matter more because they&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>realize more welfare than another; indeed, if unitarianism is true, individuals&nbsp;<i>as such</i> never matter more or less than others. Instead, if an individual\u2019s<i> interests</i> matter more, it\u2019s because more welfare is affected when those interests go satisfied or unsatisfied.</p><p><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_210 210w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_420 420w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_630 630w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_840 840w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_1050 1050w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_1260 1260w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_1470 1470w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_1680 1680w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_1890 1890w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ba3fc79093f43450da26ba38d79abfc7a287fdbe87b5a0b3.png/w_2024 2024w\"><i>Figure 1: If welfare is like water, some individuals may be larger \u201cbuckets.\u201d</i></p><p>An individual\u2019s capacity for welfare has two components: their welfare range (which is just their capacity for welfare at a time) and their lifespan. Since lifespans are relatively easy to estimate\u2014and, in any case, are often irrelevant because we\u2019re looking at welfare impacts over fixed periods\u2014we\u2019ll ignore them here.&nbsp;</p><p>An individual\u2019s welfare range is the difference between the best and worst welfare states the individual can realize at a time. In other words, assume we can assign a positive number to the best welfare state the individual can realize and a negative number to the worst welfare state the individual can realize. The difference between them is their welfare range. (See Figure 2.)</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995746/mirroredImages/hxtwzcsz8hQfGyZQM/nw2s17oh5s0olt5bjnom.png\"></p><p><i>Figure 2: In this diagram, the x-axis represents lifespan; the y-axis represents the amounts of welfare that an individual could realize at a time.

The distance between A and B is Red\u2019s welfare range; the distance between C and D, Blue\u2019s welfare range.</i></p><p>Ultimately, the goal is to be able to compare welfare&nbsp;<i>improvements</i> and DALYs-averted. Welfare improvements are changes in realized welfare that we estimate<i> using</i> welfare ranges. So, while an individual\u2019s welfare range is the difference between the \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d welfare states the individual can realize, we aren\u2019t interested in the best and worst&nbsp;<i>in principle</i>, as many possibilities are simply irrelevant to comparing welfare improvements and DALYs-averted. Instead, we\u2019re interested in an interpretation of \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d that lends itself to expressing welfare level changes in terms of DALYs-averted.&nbsp;</p><p>With this in mind, we take the best human welfare state to be the average welfare level of the average human-in-full-health, whatever that happens to be. Plainly, there are many other senses of \u201cbest\u201d where humans realize more welfare still. The average welfare level of the average human-in-full-health is hardly the pinnacle of welfare realization. But if we indexed to the&nbsp;<i>maximum&nbsp;</i>amount of welfare that a human-in-full-health could realize\u2014however we interpret the modal force of \u201ccould\u201d in that statement\u2014we\u2019d be left with difficult questions about the relationship between animals\u2019 welfare ranges and a DALY-averted. By indexing to the average welfare level of the average human-in-full-health, the relationship is straightforward.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, it\u2019s the relationship we want to capture. The goal is to estimate the welfare gain from, say, moving layer hens from cages to a cage-free system relative to the welfare gain from extending human lives\u2014not from creating perfect human lives. So, while it\u2019s possible that various animals can realize more positive welfare at a time than the average welfare level of the average human-in-full-health, we think the greater risk here is underestimating total welfare impacts on animals by indexing to a welfare level that\u2019s too high.&nbsp;</p><p>On that note, we should flag that the DALY framework doesn\u2019t allow for states worse than death. Effectively, it assumes that humans\u2019 net welfare range is exclusively positive, not in the sense that humans can\u2019t have any negative welfare states, but in the sense that their welfare is net positive even when in negative welfare states. We can understand why people chose to bake this assumption into the framework, given inevitable disagreements about which lives are worth living and the DALY framework\u2019s use in resource allocation. However, whatever the merits of the net positivity assumption, it\u2019s controversial as a theoretical claim. Moreover, it will affect our estimates of the relative values of different interventions. So, while we can get away with granting the assumption here, as this post is about the conceptual connection between animal welfare and a DALY-averted, the issue requires further investigation before actually doing cost-effectiveness analyses.</p><p>Whatever we conclude about the DALY framework, though, there\u2019s no obvious moral reason for assuming that many nonhuman animals have net positive lives. Indeed, it\u2019s quite plausible that many chickens, for instance, have net negative welfare states in standard intensive farming systems. So, while we\u2019ll grant the DALY framework\u2019s assumption that there are no states worse than death for humans, we&nbsp;<i>won\u2019t&nbsp;</i>assume that nonhuman animals\u2019 lives are invariably net positive.</p><p>If we allow that animals can be in states worse than death, we face the question of the skews of their welfare ranges. Can they be worse off than they can be well off? Better off than they can be badly off? Or are their welfare ranges symmetrical around the neutral point, such that they can be equally well off and badly off? Though this topic deserves considerable attention, it would take us too far afield here. (See <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVjebN9c8IA6FWjMc-JRwAuzKWVf_9Ht/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117779569323580896048&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">this report</a> for a preliminary investigation.) So, let\u2019s assume symmetry. We\u2019ll say that the relevant best animal welfare states are the average welfare levels of the average animal-(of a given species)-in-full-health. If we represent that welfare state with some arbitrary positive number, then the \u201cworst\u201d welfare state is represented by its negation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Welfare ranges + species-relative welfare assessments = DALY-equivalents averted</strong></h1><p>Now suppose that we can estimate differences in welfare ranges. Then, we can convert species-relative welfare assessments\u2014understood as assessments of animals\u2019 welfare relative to how well off or poorly off they could be\u2014into a common unit. Suppose, for example, that chickens\u2019 welfare range is 10% of humans\u2019 welfare range. Let\u2019s also suppose that over the course of a year, the average chicken is about half as badly off as they could be in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/literature-reviews/welfare-implications-laying-hen-housing#:~:text=development%20and%20refinement.-,Conventional%20cage,-Definition%3A%20A\"><u>conventional cage</u></a> (i.e., their average welfare level is roughly halfway between their neutral point and their worst welfare state) and a quarter as badly off as they could be in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/literature-reviews/welfare-implications-laying-hen-housing#:~:text=conventional%20cages.45-,Barn%20or%20aviary,-Definition%20(Barn)%3A\"><u>aviary system</u></a> (i.e., their average welfare level is roughly a quarter of the way from their neutral point toward their worst welfare state). Then we can calculate the equivalent amount of human welfare and, by extension, the number of DALY-equivalents averted:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Chickens\u2019 welfare range is 10% of human\u2019s welfare range.</li><li>Assuming symmetry around the neutral point, the negative portion of chickens\u2019 welfare range is 5% of human\u2019s positive welfare range. (For instance, if humans\u2019 welfare range is 100 and chickens\u2019 welfare range is 10, chickens range from -5 to 5, and the negative portion of that is 5% of humans\u2019 welfare range.)</li><li>Given our assumptions about the welfare impacts of the two production systems, the move from conventional cages to aviary systems averts an amount of welfare equivalent to 25% of the average chicken\u2019s negative welfare range. (Continuing with the numbers mentioned in the previous step, it moves chickens from -2.5 to -1.25).</li><li>So, assuming symmetry around the neutral point, 25% of chickens\u2019 negative welfare range is equivalent to 1.25% (5% \u00d7 25%) of humans\u2019 positive welfare range.&nbsp;</li><li>By definition, averting a DALY averts the loss of an amount of welfare equivalent to the positive portion of humans\u2019 welfare range for a year.</li><li>So, assuming symmetry around the neutral point, the move from conventional cages to aviary systems averts the equivalent of 0.0125 DALYs per chicken per year on average.</li></ol><p>Two caveats. First, we want to stress that we are using these numbers for purely illustrative purposes. We are <i>not </i>suggesting that chickens' welfare range is 10% of humans' welfare range; we are <i>not </i>suggesting that the average chicken is about half as badly off as they could be in a&nbsp;conventional cage and a quarter as badly off as they could be in an&nbsp;aviary system. We'll give our estimate of chickens' welfare range toward the end of this series, but specific welfare assessments are beyond the scope of the project.</p><p>Second and relatedly, the Moral Weight Project focuses on questions about animals\u2019 welfare ranges, not on questions about how to make species-relative welfare assessments. We simply assume that it\u2019s possible to assess\u2014however coarsely\u2014animals\u2019 welfare relative to how well off or poorly off they could be, leaving the details for future work. We grant the details will be controversial, as they require saying something about the location of the neutral point\u2014that is, the point at which any increase in welfare makes the animal net positive overall and any decrease in welfare makes the animal net negative overall. For many practical purposes, though, we only need the roughest estimates. And those, we submit, are probably within reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>How could we estimate relative welfare ranges?</strong></h1><p>Over the next several posts, we lay the groundwork for estimating differences in welfare ranges. First, we describe the Welfare Range Table\u2014a literature review of over 90 qualitative and quantitative proxies for variation in welfare ranges across 11 farmed species.</p><p>Then, we discuss the impact of different theories of welfare on welfare range estimates. Is all the action in the philosophy rather than the empirical evidence? We argue against this view.</p><p>After that, we turn to the hypothesis that we should use estimates of the total number of neurons in an animal\u2019s brain as a proxy for its moral weight.</p><p>In the wake of our discussion of neuron counts, we take up two issues that aren\u2019t related to welfare ranges per se, but which would affect the total amount of welfare that we ascribe to any particular individual: first, the possibility that various subsystems&nbsp;<i>within&nbsp;</i>brains are conscious&nbsp;<i>in addition&nbsp;</i>to the whole brain; second, the possibility that some animals don\u2019t have a single, unified conscious perspective on the world.</p><p>With those conceptual issues behind us, we describe a set of models that we used to estimate differences in welfare ranges across taxa.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we conclude the series with an application of all the above, investigating potential differences in welfare ranges across insect life stages\u2014that is, from their larval to adult stages.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h1><p><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_160 160w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_320 320w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_640 640w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_960 960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_1120 1120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_1280 1280w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_1440 1440w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/5034bdbd9818224809cde7bb38ce42666f39b57b0c01415a.png/w_1600 1600w\"><br>This research is a project of Rethink Priorities.

To answer this question, we need to focus not simply on the likelihood that we would recover, but rather on the likelihood that we would ultimately reach our desired end state. And we need to formally account for the possibility that the pathway to this end state could involve many such catastrophes and \u2018recoveries\u2019.</p><p>I present three models that can help us do this. My guess is that, on these models, some plausible assumptions will turn out to imply that a non-extinction catastrophe would involve an expected loss of value comparable to that of outright extinction, for example by starting us down a vicious cycle of declining energy availability and increasing energy costs to materials essential for modern agriculture. If so, this would imply that longtermists who agree with these assumptions should give greater priority to avoiding non-extinction catastrophes. Some assumptions might also have some surprising implications for how we should prioritise among different methods of making civilisation more resilient to such catastrophes.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In this post I present a family of models of the future of civilisation that divide the states of civilisations following by the milestones of technological development they\u2019ve reached following what I\u2019ll call a&nbsp;<i>milestone catastrophe</i> (see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zuQeTaqrjveSiSMYo/a-proposed-hierarchy-of-longtermist-concepts\">previous post</a> for complete definition). We can then label these as separate states, and reason about the transitions between them. The states follow those identified in historical and existential risk literature (<a href=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/23/2022/04/GettyImages-724237133-d6e944a.jpg\"><u>extinction</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GsjmufaebreiaivF7/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would\"><u>short term struggle for survival</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukemuehlhauser.com/there-was-only-one-industrial-revolution/\"><u>preindustrial, industrial</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/time-of-perils\"><u>time of perils</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8\"><u>multiplanetary</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0gs_TuqoIU&amp;t=25s\"><u>interstellar</u></a>), but the models also attempt to intuitively capture the key points&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEWyGdDoR__vIrCd1_a7-5-x8-7kHJq7y7WkvhdOo7s/edit#\"><u>I claimed</u></a> were missing from most discussions of \u2018recovery\u2019 after a catastrophe, specifically:</p><ul><li>\u2018becoming interstellar, and eventually colonising the Virgo supercluster\u2019 as the relevant positive outcome rather than focusing on a single \u2018recovery\u2019</li><li>the effect of the possibility of multiple civilisational collapses on the probability of colonising the Virgo supercluster</li><li>treating \u2018permanent stagnation\u2019 and \u2018unrecoverable dystopia\u2019 as the pathways on which we don\u2019t become interstellar, rather than as distinct end states&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In each model, the relationships between these states form a discrete time Markov chain - a comprehensive if highly idealised set of probabilities of moving from any state to the others.

If we then assumed that our chances of success given a milestone catastrophe decreased by 20%, then the economic depression would have decreased longterm expected value by about 0.4%. Not much relative to immediate extinction, but enough to put it in the same playing field as direct extinction risks if it turned out to be very much more likely and/or very much more tractable.

They\u2019re my attempt at a reasonable compromise between capturing some important concerns we\u2019ve been leaving out while not getting&nbsp;<i>too</i> far into the weeds (YMMV). Nonetheless I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge several limitations of this approach, in case others think they\u2019re significant enough to want to include them in a very different model, or argue that I should work them into one like these. In roughly descending order of importance:</p><p>1. The models focus mainly on technological progress through the time of perils, or on forms of progress that behave similarly. The picture could look very different if some other outcome that isn\u2019t analogous to or more or less a function of technology dramatically changes x-risk - long-lasting global totalitarian governments or particularly successful/unsuccessful work on AI safety being evident candidates.&nbsp;</p><p>2. The models don\u2019t look at whether different values might emerge after catastrophe, or any other reasons why one might cause a positive or negative change to wellbeing per person. I think this is a really important question, but a largely unrelated one - or at least, any interdependent assumptions would be very difficult to model.&nbsp;</p><p>3. The models have little historical or social context - we don\u2019t account for how we arrived at any state, except via the count of former civilisations, via our choice of entry point, and, in the perils-focused model, via the notions of progress years and planets. Theoretically we can average over all possibilities, but this obscures many nuances:</p><ul><li>It makes it hard to represent possibly importantly different social and moral attitudes in a world that\u2019s just regressed to industrial living vs one that\u2019s finally achieved it after several preindustrial generations. For example global long-term totalitarian governments of the sort Bostrom and Ord discuss end up as an averaging factor in the transition probabilities.&nbsp;</li><li>It makes it hard to model a series of catastrophes, where we regress in many respects to pre-times of perils, but for example still have the capacity to launch former nuclear arsenals. Implicitly we would treat the actual use of such arsenals subsequent to the original event as part of the same overall catastrophe.</li><li>The length of previous times of perils (and to a lesser extent industrial eras) might be highly relevant to the state the next civilisation finds itself in. Longer technological eras would basically act as a multiplier on the consequences of the previous civilisation: they would use up more resources, probably inflict other environmental damage, may leave behind more knowledge, and the technology they leave behind may be more durable and/or less useable to a more primitive successor civilisation.</li><li>The length of time between civilisations might be important. If it takes 10,000+ years, they could actually be in a better position than after only 500 since excess CO2 will have left the atmosphere, forests will have regrown, most orbital debris will have burned up etc - so as long as the preindustrial civilisation hadn\u2019t been too voracious, they\u2019d start the industrial era with a cleaner slate. This could be especially important in a count-limited scenario. This time-insensitivity will also make it hard to account for non-anthropogenic changes over time, such as glacial periods.</li><li>Post-catastrophe environmental stressors will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/5/4/1461\"><u>differ depending on the catastrophe</u></a>.</li></ul><p>4. Some of the states are hard to define crisply:</p><ul><li>The model assumes civilisation-harming weaponry is on the critical path to reaching multiplanetary status. This is not logically necessary but, for reasons given in<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zuQeTaqrjveSiSMYo/a-proposed-hierarchy-of-longtermist-concepts#fn5gfst551x9o\"> footnote 3 of the previous post</a>, I think almost certain (&gt;98%) in practice.&nbsp;</li><li>How exactly does the time of perils start? \u2018Civilisation-harming weaponry\u2019 is not well defined. We could specify technologies, but there might be others we haven\u2019t imagined, and some we have imagined could be more or less destructive than we expect.</li><li>What counts as a self-sustaining colony? Could a sufficiently robust and extensive bunker system be one? Or even \u2018New Zealand\u2019 - though that might be vulnerable to loss of energy or an influx of refugees. In the other direction, an offworld colony needn't be permanently able to exist without Earth to afford some security; for example, if they could last at least a few years without running out of some key material, they might be able to repopulate this planet after e.g. a nuclear winter or biopandemic that killed everyone on the surface. So in practice, self-sustainingness might look more like a spectrum than a threshold.</li><li>What is an industrial revolution? I gestured at a formal definition above, but that might turn out to be inadequate if we could progress slowly enough towards time of perils technology that the condition didn\u2019t trigger until after we\u2019d got there.</li><li>[ETA: Is 'extinction' specifically of human descendants? Or does it mean something more like 'the event that, when the sun consumes that Earth, no sentient life has escaped from it'? The latter could be approximated to some degree, e.g. by a higher probability of both returning to and escaping from a preindustrial state, but it would be hard to properly account for the difference between 'humans take a few thousand years to regain technology' and 'lizards take a few 10s of millions of years to evolve advanced intelligence'. It would probably be better to separately assess the prospects of a future species' civilisation and add them to our own, rather than to attempt to blend them together.]</li></ul><p>5. \u2018Interstellar\u2019 is treated as equivalent to \u2018existentially secure\u2019. In principle a gamma ray burst, a simultaneous total collapse of multiple civilisations, a false vacuum decay or a hostile AI could get us - but I\u2019m reasonably content with this assumption, for the reasons given in footnote 2.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"cubjw6vmka\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcubjw6vmka\"><sup><a href=\"#fncubjw6vmka\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>6. It broadly assumes we're interested in expected utility maximisation, so will be less useful to people with value-systems or decision theories that reject this.</p><p>7. It has low fidelity regarding AI trajectories. This is somewhat intentional, since a) much more work has been done on estimation of these subjects than on other milestone catastrophes, at least in the EA-adjacent community, so many people will have better informed estimates than mine that they can plug in, and b) the AI-resolves-everything narrative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-skepticism\"><u>is still under discussion</u></a>, so our models should allow worlds in which AI could be much harder to develop or much less transformative than our typical estimates.</p><p>8. It doesn't look at lost astronomical value from delayed success. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste\"><u>Astronomical Waste</u></a>, Bostrom calculated that a 10-million year delay wouldn't make much relative difference, but perhaps there\u2019s a delay within the lifespan of the Earth where expected losses of values would start to look comparable.</p><p>9. I'm really unsure how to think about evidential updates if/when we reach certain future states. If we were to reach the 100th civilisation, having neither gone extinct nor interstellar, it seems like we should strongly update that reaching either state is very unlikely from any given civilisation (at least until the expanding sun gets involved). But should the logic we use now to estimate transitional probabilities from that state take that update into account, or should we only do the update if we actually reach it? [ETA: I've come to think we should not try to anticipate such evidential updates. Since most of what we will want to use the model for is imagining the difference between the present and the possible counterfactual effects of actions we might take now, for which we need to make our best guess as to the state of the world with the information we currently have]&nbsp;</p><p>10. It treats some non-0 transition probabilities as 0. For example, it\u2019s \u2018impossible\u2019 to go from an industrial state directly to a preindustrial state. I don\u2019t view this as a serious concern for three reasons: firstly I do think that transition is unlikely, secondly because we can encapsulate the slight chance that it happens and we consequently go extinct as humanity going extinct from an industrial state (and the chance that it happens and we reach a time of perils as having just made that transition directly), and thirdly because it\u2019s trivial to insert the transition probabilities into the model for anyone who feels strongly they should be there.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>I\u2019ve presented the models here in the abstract for critique, with the following potential goals in mind:</p><ol><li>Plug in or extrapolate existing estimates of transition probabilities where possible and elsewhere source from interviews or give my own reasoning to develop a crude estimate of the difference between probabilities of becoming interstellar a) given no non-existential global catastrophe (or, using the previous post\u2019s terms, no milestone contraction) and b) given at least one. The exact difference doesn\u2019t matter so much as \u2018when you squint, does it basically look like 0, or like not-0?\u2019 If the latter, it will suggest longtermists should treat non-extinction catastrophes as substantially more serious than we typically have been<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"d58qcfrmsa\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd58qcfrmsa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd58qcfrmsa\">[7]</a></sup></span></li><li>Create a calculator so that anyone can tweak the probabilities.

Moreover, during the evolution of longtermism, assumptions that originally started out as heuristics seem to have become locked in to the discussion via the terminology, biasing us towards those heuristics and away from expected value analyses.&nbsp;</p><p>In this post I discuss these concerns, but since I expect it to be relatively controversial and it isn\u2019t really a prerequisite for the rest of the sequence so much as an explanation of why I\u2019m not using standard terms, I would emphasise that this is strictly optional reading for the rest of the sequence, so think of it as a 'part 0' of the sequence.

Classing low-value-but-interstellar outcomes as existential catastrophes seems unhelpful both since it introduces definitional ambiguity over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/skPFH8LxGdKQsTkJy/clarifying-existential-risks-and-existential-catastrophes#How_much_of_our_potential_must_be_destroyed_\"><u>how much net welfare must be lost for them to qualify</u></a>, and since questions of expected future quality of life are very distinct from questions of future&nbsp;<i>quantity</i> of life, and so seem like they should be asked separately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>\u2026 nor involve a catastrophe that anyone alive recognises</h3><p>The concept also encompasses a civilisation that lives happily on Earth until the sun dies, perhaps even finding a way to survive that, but never spreading out across the universe. This means that, for example, universal adoption of a non-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ethics#Totalism\"><u>totalising population ethic</u></a> would be an existential catastrophe. I\u2019m strongly in favour of totalising population ethics, but this seems needlessly biasing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>\u2018Unrecoverable\u2019 or \u2018permanent\u2019 states are a superfluous concept</h3><p>In the diagram above, Ord categorises \u2018unrecoverable dystopias\u2019 as a type of existential risk. He actually seems to consider them necessarily&nbsp;<i>im</i>permanent, but (in their existentially riskiest form) irrevocably harmful to our prospects, saying \u2018when they end (as they eventually must), we are much more likely than we were before to fall down to extinction or collapse than to rise up to fulfill our potential\u2019.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffhb4p2k5zq4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfhb4p2k5zq4\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Bostrom&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks\"><u>imagines</u></a> related scenarios in which \u2018it may not be possible to climb back up to present levels if natural conditions are less favorable than they were for our ancestors, for example if the most easily exploitable coal, oil, and mineral resources have been depleted.\u2019</p><p>The common theme in these scenarios is that they lock humanity onto Earth, meaning we go extinct prematurely (as in, much sooner than we could have done if we\u2019d expanded into the universe). Understood this way, the vast majority of the loss of value from either scenario comes from that premature extinction, not from the potentially lower quality of life until then or (following Bostrom\u2019s original calculation) from a delay of even 10 million years on the path to success.

And if the economy continues growing at a comparable rate, such a loss would barely register a century from now.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s also vague about time: humanity has had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll\"><u>multiple disasters</u></a> that might have met the above definition, but most of them were spread over many years or decades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>\u2026 and focusing on it as a category encourages us to make premature assumptions</h3><p>The longtermist focus on global catastrophic risks appears to be a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)\"><u>Schelling point</u></a>, perhaps a form of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks\"><u>maxipok</u></a> - the idea that we should maximise the probability of an \u2018ok outcome\u2019. But though Bostrom originally presented maxipok as \u2018at best \u2026 a rule of thumb, a prima facie suggestion, rather than a principle of absolute validity\u2019, it has come to resemble the latter, without, to my knowledge, any rigorous defence of why it should now be so.&nbsp;</p><p>To estimate the counterfactual value of some event or class of events on the long-term future, we need to separately determine the magnitude of such events in some event-specific unit (here, fatalities or $ cost), and, separately, our credence in the long-term value of the event\u2019s various effects. Focusing on \u2018catastrophes\u2019 implies that we believe these two questions are strongly correlated - that we can be much more confident in the outcome of higher magnitude events.

There might be good arguments to think the likelihood of long-term disvalue from an event that caused 10,000,000 deaths is higher than likelihood of long-term disvalue from one that caused 10,000, but the focus on global catastrophes bakes that belief into longtermist discussion before any argument has established such a strong correlation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>\u2018Recovery\u2019 from catastrophe is a vague goal\u2026</h3><p>The concept of \u2018<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Nc9fCzjBKYDaDJGiX/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would-1\"><u>recovery</u></a>\u2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhx5ieX-HPY\"><u>from</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277686309_Adaptation_to_and_Recovery_from_Global_Catastrophe\"><u>a</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wGqSqWLTwDrytxeER/update-on-civilizational-collapse-research\"><u>collapse</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qY5q2QTG44avBbNKn/modelling-the-odds-of-recovery-from-civilizational-collapse\"><u>is</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-5899.12786\"><u>widely</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sieberozendal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rozendal-Siebe-Towards-Comprehensive-Existential-Risk-Assessment.pdf\"><u>referred</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7xveJ9MAJysLWnZZP/david-denkenberger-loss-of-industrial-civilization-and\"><u>to</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328714001888\"><u>in</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/trajectories.pdf\"><u>existential-risk-related</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/notes/\"><u>discussion</u></a> (see note 2.22 in last link) - but it\u2019s used to mean anything from \u2018recovering industry\u2019 through something like \u2018getting to technology equivalent to the modern day\u2019s\u2019<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft90901htcfl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt90901htcfl\">[2]</a></sup></span>, up to \u2018<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/5/4/1461/htm\"><u>when human civilization recovers a space travel program that has the potential to colonize space</u></a>\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>For any of these interpretations, the differential technological progress of a reboot would also make it hard to identify a technological state \u2018equivalent\u2019 to the modern world.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv2deqig1e7s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv2deqig1e7s\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>\u2026 and not the one we actually care about</h3><p>As longtermists, we need to look at the endgame, which, per Bostrom\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste\"><u>original discussion</u></a> is approximately \u2018settling the Virgo Supercluster\u2019.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq80ugm3snhq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq80ugm3snhq\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The important question, given catastrophe, is not \u2018how likely is it we could reinvent the iPhone?\u2019, but \u2018how likely is it that civilisation would reach the stars?\u2019 This question, in addition to sounding cooler, captures two important concerns that as far as I\u2019ve seen have only been discussed in highly abstract terms in collapse and resilience literature:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>the difference in difficulty for future civilisations of a) getting back to industrialisation, or wherever \u2018recovery\u2019 would leave us, and of b) getting from there to becoming robustly interstellar</li><li>the possibility that those future civilisations might regress again, and that this could happen many times<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Suffering catastrophe</h2><p>Aird defines this as \u2018an event or process involving suffering on an astronomical scale\u2019.</p><h3><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/fi3Abht55xHGQ4Pha/qi6mqbj4zrbbqsvaw5zz\"></h3><h3>The definition of a suffering catastrophe depends on your moral values</h3><p>For example a universe full of happy people who occasionally allow themselves a moment of melancholy for their ancestors would qualify under a sufficiently negative-leaning population ethic.

Specifically, by ignoring or over-simplifying the complex ways our propositions interrelate (i.e., how they are \u201cstructured\u201d), we stand to make substantial errors in our predictions. Moreover, the failure to appropriately \u201cunpack\u201d the structure behind our propositions risks substantial inefficiency in our focus of which uncertainties (whether they be based on a lack of information, or substantive disagreement) are more critical to resolve.</i></p><p><i>In Sections 1 and 2 I provide a primer to the uninitiated on the nature and importance of unpacking and disentangling the uncertain propositions that comprise our prediction problems.</i></p><p><i>In Sections 3 and 4 I lay out my analytical approach that seeks to capture and resolve these issues. I provide a fully worked through, illustrative decomposition of the misaligned AI X-Risk prediction problem, using a combination of Bayesian Network modelling and simulation techniques. My intent is to illustrate this analytical approach as a viable framework for a) <strong>making arguments and assumptions explicit and quantifiable in a unified manner</strong>, b) drawing <strong>mathematically optimal inferences</strong> (i.e., predictions) even in the face of multi-layered uncertainties, and c) laying the foundations for accessible computational methods that will assist further research. My assumptions and propositions within the model are predominantly grounded in extant estimates and analyses drawn from AI experts and fellow contributors. However, I highlight a number of <strong>previously overlooked or underspecified propositions and conditional probabilities</strong> that affect our predictions, but <strong>have previously remained hidden</strong>.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>In Section 5 I step through the results of my analysis. Among them, I show that once structural disentanglement is taken into account, under reasonable, informed assumptions, the <strong>P(Misaligned AGI X-Risk) by 2070 is 1.68% (+/- 1.25%),&nbsp;rising to</strong> <strong>6.53% (+/- 4.32%) by 2100</strong>. Though if we wish to assume an AGI has been built by 2070 (i.e., P(Misaligned AGI X-Risk|AGI)), then this rises further to <strong>5.32% (+/- 3.42%)&nbsp;</strong>by 2070, and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>11.22% (+/- 6.86%) by 2100. I additionally provide predictions for AGI build likelihoods across the target time-horizons.</i></p><p><i>Finally, in Section 6 I describe a quantitatively assisted path forward for further inquiry that is both viable and accessible. I outline how the analytical approach laid out here can be built upon; both enriching, and being enriched by existing lines of research into AI X-Risk.</i></p><h1>1 - A Reasoning Under Uncertainty Perspective</h1><p>Predicting the future existential risk due to a misaligned AGI is not only an important problem in and of itself, but is also <i>useful as being illustrative of a <strong>class</strong> of problem</i>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Prediction problems like this \u2013 much like any reasoning under uncertainty endeavour \u2013 require:</p><p>1) The <strong>acquisition</strong> of relevant arguments, assumptions, and propositions,&nbsp;</p><p>2) The <strong>estimation</strong> of the uncertainty surrounding them, and finally&nbsp;</p><p>3) Their <strong>integration</strong> into a coherent whole.</p><p>Substantial work has been done on the <strong>acquisition</strong> of relevant arguments in recent years (even just a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-risk?sortedBy=relevance\">cursory search of this forum</a> reveals &gt;400 posts on \u201cAI Risk\u201d at time of writing, dating back 6 years). These cover a wide array of topics such as AI build likelihoods and timelines, relevant AI properties/functions, paths to catastrophe, and risk countermeasures, just to name a few. Work like this - the acquisition of relevant arguments \u2013 is invaluable. Without such work, it would be as if <i>we are trying to build a telescope without any components</i>.</p><p>This post does not focus on the acquisition of arguments. I am not an expert on AI. I am, however, an expert on modelling complex inference problems. This post focuses on a way to integrate those acquired arguments to minimise the risk of error. Put another way, <i>I design telescopes</i>. The value of understanding good telescope design is not just in getting a clearer picture of what we wish to look at. It is far wider than this. The more one learns about how pieces should be arranged, the more one sheds light on <strong>which components are more important, and which are less so</strong>; <strong>which components need refinement to be fit for purpose</strong>; <strong>and which components we did not even realise we were missing.</strong></p><p>As has been noted in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W7C5hwq7sjdpTdrQF/announcing-the-future-fund-s-ai-worldview-prize\">AI Prize Announcement</a> and in advice on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SdQYLKzpDFQsdW9bn/features-that-make-a-report-especially-helpful-to-me\">reporting here</a>, explicit probabilities (i.e., <strong>estimation</strong>) are critical to reasoning transparency. They allow us to express degrees of confidence in a unified manner, lowering the risks of inadvertent, unhelpful translation error (e.g., what I mean when I say \u201cX is likely\u201d may be quite different from what you interpret). Moreover, explicit probabilities are critical in laying the groundwork for computational methods. Analyses such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf\">Carlsmith (2021)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OGiDFCgRjfxOFVaYPl96dYgx8NVIaSquDgQSKByDxuc/edit#gid=0\">responses to Carlsmith</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/KrJfoZzpSDpnrv9va/draft-report-on-ai-timelines\">Cotra (2020)</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/semi-informative-priors-over-ai-timelines/\">Davidson (2021)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W10B6NJjicD8O0STPiT3tNV3oFnT8YsfjmtYR8RO_RI/edit#gid=0\">among others</a>, have taken important steps in providing various estimates on the probability of various propositions (e.g., the likelihood of an AGI being built by a given year). However, as noted within Carlsmith\u2019s own work (Carlsmith, 2021, Section 8), attempts to accurately <strong>integrate</strong> these estimates exposes two centrally important, but easily overlooked reasoning errors. These reasoning errors - when ignored - can lead to wildly overconfident predictions (as I will show). These errors are:</p><p>1) <strong>Oversimplifying Structure</strong>. Although the multiplication of probabilities attached to propositions is nominally a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference\">Bayesian</a> way of integrating (conditional) probabilities (i.e., the application of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule\">a chain rule</a>), it implicitly assumes a lot about the way uncertainty is structured. I discuss this in more detail below, but the most obvious assumption is that of unitary causation \u2013 a chain of probabilities implies a singular path of cause (or \u201cparent proposition\u201d) and effect (\u201coffspring proposition\u201d). <strong>Reality is far messier, with common causes of multiple effects, effects with multiple potential causes, and myriad combinations thereof. Simply put, this fundamentally changes the maths and risks substantial overconfidence in estimates derived from inadequately structured integrations.</strong></p><p>2) <strong>Failing to \u201cUnpack\u201d Propositions</strong>. In relation to the first, there is recognition that an estimate attached to a proposition may in fact be covering hidden, unquantified parent propositions. For example, in arriving at an estimate of an X-Event caused by a misaligned AGI (P(X-Event|AGI)), one of my propositions may be the probability of an AGI being built successfully (P(AGI)). However, what is omitted from my estimate of P(AGI) are the propositions (i.e., assumptions) I have invoked (e.g., the likelihood of a build being computationally feasible; there being a viable AI design; there being sufficient incentive for completing a successful build). <strong>Without explicit estimates provided for these parent propositions, we not only risk introducing error to the overall calculation, but we are also not adhering to principles of transparency, making it harder to reach clear consensus on points of disagreement.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;In this post I will demonstrate an analytical approach that directly addresses these problems. In so doing, I will outline how this approach:</p><ul><li>Provides useful structure to a complex problem.</li><li>Disentangles compounding levels of uncertainty.</li><li>Facilitates the move towards more exhaustive, transparent estimation of uncertainties surrounding propositions.</li><li>Demonstrates optimal (i.e., inaccuracy minimization via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference\">Bayesian inference</a>) integration across these structured uncertainties.</li><li>Creates a computational method that can enhance the acquisition process; helping us see which propositions are more impactful to the question at hand, and therefore which areas should we invest more time in resolving remaining uncertainty/discordancy.</li></ul><p>The model I create in the process serves as an example of a more accurate, transparent method of integrating what we know to make better predictions. To understand <i>why&nbsp;</i>this is the case, I provide a primer on why failures to appropriately understand and account for reasoning structure can systematically lead our predictions astray. Readers already familiar with the relationship between reasoning structure and reasoning errors should feel free to skip to Section 3.</p><h1>2 - A Primer on Disentanglement<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8diqhvi598n\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8diqhvi598n\">[1]</a></sup></span></h1><p>There are myriad factors that make predicting long-term risk difficult. Ultimately, these stem from the different sources and implications of uncertainty types. For example, at the highest level we have uncertainty stemming from <strong>unknown unknowns</strong> (e.g., we do not know which arguments we have not yet made); this impacts the accuracy of our (reasoning) models, but is generally something harder to quantify meaningfully.</p><p>We then also have uncertainties that stem from <strong>known unknowns</strong>, which covers both empirical sources, such as incomplete data, measurement error, and instrument reliability; as well as more subjective bases, such as degrees of belief, and disagreement (e.g., <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OGiDFCgRjfxOFVaYPl96dYgx8NVIaSquDgQSKByDxuc/edit#gid=0\">community estimates diverging substantively regarding the likelihood of a proposition</a>). Often, we tend to ignore some or all of these sources of uncertainty, either at worst by being \u201cselective\u201d (whether purposefully or not) in our supportive arguments and conclusions, or at best by trying to \u201csummarise\u201d across the uncertainties via a point estimate (i.e., a 1<sup>st</sup> order probability: \u201cI believe there to be an X% probability that Y will happen.\u201d). The latter of course is an important step towards reasoning transparency, but much remains to be desired.</p><p>For instance, let us consider the impact of disagreement in our probability estimates for a proposition. As disagreement increases (see examples&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OGiDFCgRjfxOFVaYPl96dYgx8NVIaSquDgQSKByDxuc/edit#gid=0\">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W10B6NJjicD8O0STPiT3tNV3oFnT8YsfjmtYR8RO_RI/edit#gid=0\">here</a>), so too does the 2<sup>nd</sup> order probability (see e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00127335\">Baron, 1987</a>) surrounding the proposition. For example, if we compare two hypothetical cases; one in which 100 experts have all given probability estimates for the probability of an AGI being built by 2070 between 48% and 52%, and another in which they gave estimates between 20% and 80%. In <i>both cases</i>, our overall (average) point estimate for P(AGI built by 2070) is 50%, but we can see how in the former case, we can be much more <i>confident</i> of that 50% &nbsp;as individual estimates lie +/-2% either side, than we can in the latter case, where there is much more substantial disagreement with individual estimates lying <strong>+/-30%</strong> either side.</p><p>This form of uncertainty is important, but difficult to deal with without computational assistance. As we consider how to integrate multiple propositions to arrive at a conclusion, these uncertainties in fact <i>compound</i> potential errors. Fortunately, as we start to disentangle the reasoning structure that underpins and connects our propositions (the central purpose of the analytical approach laid out in this post), we can not only gain more transparency and insights behind <i>why we are disagreeing</i> (via structurally \u201cunpacking\u201d a proposition), but we can <strong>avoid compounding errors in our integration</strong>. To return to our telescope analogy: If we are trying to identify something far away (our prediction), and we have a handful of lenses (our collection of propositions), we are far more likely to end up with a blurry image (and thus a mistaken identification) if we do not know how to arrange our lenses correctly. Once we know the principles for how the parts should be arranged, we are then also much more able to discern which lenses may be causing problems (i.e., once we know the correct design, we also know how clear the image <i>should be</i>).</p><p>Where does this leave us? First, we have multiple sources of uncertainty when we try to make predictions. Second, how these uncertainties affect our predictions when we must integrate across multiple propositions is complex, and consequently carries a high risk of error. So, if we wish to make better predictions, we must understand how to capture and deal with this complexity. To achieve this, we must next understand how uncertainties can be disentangled (or \u201cpartitioned\u201d) using reasoning <i>structure:</i></p><h2>2.1 - Structure</h2><p>Understanding how a proposition relates to and interacts with others is perhaps one of the hardest, but most critical parts of correctly <i>integrating</i> arguments to arrive at a <i>more accurate</i> prediction.</p><h3>2.1.1 - Conditionals and Chains</h3><p>Let us begin with the difference between the probability of a proposition being true, and the probability of a proposition being true <i><strong>conditional on something else (e.g., a parent proposition) being true</strong></i>. To help explain this, and all forms of structural disentanglement outlined in this section, I will use a toy example version of the likelihood of an AGI being built \u2013 <i>this is meant to be purely illustrative at this stage</i>, so do not worry about specific estimates.</p><p>First, let us assume the probability of an AGI being built (P(Built)) at least in part depends on the probability of it being technically feasible and affordable to construct an AGI (P(BuildFeasible)). Now, let us assign a probability \u2013 say 30% - to the proposition of an AGI build being feasible by a chosen point in time (i.e., P(BuildFeasible) = 30%). This is not the same as the probability of an AGI <i>actually being built</i> (i.e., P(Built)). This latter probability is only <i>inferable</i>, via the conditional probability of a successful build, <i>given its feasibility</i>. For instance, we may assume that if an AGI build is feasible, then there is a high probability of an AGI getting built \u2013 say 80%<i>&nbsp;</i>(i.e., P(Built|BuildFeasible) = 80%). We can also assume that if an AGI build it not feasible, then an AGI cannot be built (i.e., P(Built|\u00acBuildFeasible) = 0). We can see the outcome of this integration via Bayesian Inference below (note: for a more thorough read than this short example, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes\">this post by Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>):</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:26.74%\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668616004/mirroredImages/b3nGMGGhTZawy8Zfd/jfgqrunq1hsd7wwrakao.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6cd4ba7e8b72415b9f71e643273e11e59a86bb2efc7d2351.jpg/w_109 109w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6cd4ba7e8b72415b9f71e643273e11e59a86bb2efc7d2351.jpg/w_189 189w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6cd4ba7e8b72415b9f71e643273e11e59a86bb2efc7d2351.jpg/w_269 269w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6cd4ba7e8b72415b9f71e643273e11e59a86bb2efc7d2351.jpg/w_349 349w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6cd4ba7e8b72415b9f71e643273e11e59a86bb2efc7d2351.jpg/w_429 429w\"></figure><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"P(Built)= P(Built\u2502BuildFeasible).P(BuildFeasible) + P(Built\u2502\u00acBuildFeasible).P(\u00acBuildFeasible)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

Some potential errors include (but are not limited to):<ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy\"><strong>Base Rate Neglect</strong></a>: Ignoring base rate / prior information (in this example, this would be our parent proposition, P(BuildFeasible)). This can lead to gross overestimation. Here this would be assuming P(Built) = 80%, rather than the 24% we find when we <i>properly structure the argument</i>.</li><li><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/lpr/article/15/4/239/2580528\"><strong>Miss Rate Neglect</strong></a>: Although less relevant in this example, neglecting terms like P(Built|\u00acBuildFeasible) fails to account for \u201cwould this have occurred anyway, regardless of my parent proposition?\u201d This failure can produce substantial over or underestimations of the likelihood of a proposition being true, as you are not fully accounting for the <i>strength</i> (how predictive/diagnostic) of the relationship between the two propositions.</li><li><strong>Put simply, the separation into terms forces us to scrutinise and incorporate a </strong><i><strong>more complete</strong></i><strong> set of uncertainties, reducing errors.</strong></li></ul></li><li>The disentanglement allows us to better identify <i>where we are disagreeing</i>, and <i>where we are less certain</i> (e.g., our different P(Built) values are stemming from different assumptions regarding P(Built|BuildFeasible), whilst we mainly agree about P(BuildFeasible) itself). Though arguably trite in this example, this capability becomes increasingly needed the more complex the overall reasoning structure, as we will see.</li></ol><p>We are starting to see how separating out structure supports more thorough and efficient <strong>acquisition</strong> (and consequently, <strong>estimation</strong>) of propositions.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, we have laid the groundwork for integrating across a causal chain, wherein we can multiply a chain of conditional probabilities together to reach a final proposition likelihood. This has been the method applied by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf\">Carlsmith (2021)</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qRSgHLb8yLXzDg4nf/reviews-of-is-power-seeking-ai-an-existential-risk\">others</a> when estimating AI X-Risk. Of course, when we start to consider uncertainties on each of these component probabilities, things get a lot trickier (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z7r83zrSXcis6ymKo/dissolving-ai-risk-parameter-uncertainty-in-ai-future#comments\">this excellent post on uncertainty analysis of the same causal chain by Froolow</a>). Additionally, in modelling these arguments we must draw a line under \u201chow far back\u201d we wish to go: P(BuildFeasible) is itself conditional on other propositions, and so on backwards until we reach the Elysium of exhaustive, confirmed certainty. This of course is rarely possible, particularly in long-range prediction. Thus, we must elect to \u201ccut off\u201d the recursion at some point.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not where the story ends, as we have the obvious fact that one proposition may have more than one effect on other propositions, and itself be affected by more than one parent proposition. As we will see below, when we expand our understanding of reasoning structures to include this broader set of possibilities, the grave implications of ignoring this complexity for prediction accuracy will become evident \u2013 along with the rationale for the analytical approach outlined in this post that captures this complexity.</p><h3>2.1.2 - Common Effects</h3><p>Next, let us consider a proposition with more than one parent (known as a \u201ccollider\u201d, or common effect). This is an extremely likely occurrence \u2013 rarely is it the case that unitary causation (i.e., one cause to one effect) is valid. For example, there are often enabling conditions, additional risk factors, catalysts, and so on. Each additional parent proposition results in a combinatorial explosion of the proposition that depends upon them.&nbsp;</p><p>To ground this in our example, let us reconsider it, but now add an additional influence on P(Build): the (human) incentive for AGI, P(Incentive):</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:41.33%\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668616004/mirroredImages/b3nGMGGhTZawy8Zfd/ylttovbr4bsohvdebhju.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_128 128w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_208 208w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_288 288w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_368 368w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_448 448w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_528 528w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_608 608w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_688 688w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/661649a7e564e6a51b4c9d633f45cb7fced526a1c9cc3e7a.jpg/w_768 768w\"></figure><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"P(Built)= P(Built\u2502BuildFeasible,Incentive).P(BuildFeasible).P(Incentive)+ P(Built\u2502BuildFeasible,\u00acIncentive).P(BuildFeasible).P(\u00acIncentive)+ P(Built\u2502\u00acBuildFeasible,Incentive).P(\u00acBuildFeasible).P(Incentive)+ P(Built\u2502\u00acBuildFeasible,\u00acIncentive).P(\u00acBuildFeasible).P(\u00acIncentive)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

In addition, I note that factoring in these sorts of structures can expose where propositions within our reasoning problem are more <i>sensitive</i> to changes in our parameters. If multiple parts of my chain actually rely on the same parent proposition, then my assumptions regarding the parent proposition (including the uncertainty that surrounds it) will have more impact on the overall reasoning structure and my predictions (<i>ceteris paribus</i>) than my assumptions regarding one of its offspring.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7ve0z9ypn6d\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7ve0z9ypn6d\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>So, we have now covered the three core reasoning sub-structures (chains, common causes, and common effects), and how failure to account for them can lead to error. Critically, <i><strong>all reasoning under uncertainty problems are built using these three core sub-structures</strong></i>, just using various combinations. Predicting misaligned AI X-Risk is no different. I will again emphasise here that <strong>these structural complexities are part of the prediction problem, regardless of whether you represent them within a model.</strong></p><p>To return to our telescope metaphor: At this point I have sought to highlight the importance of appropriately combining our components by showing that without appropriate assembly, the image we are trying to see will be hard to interpret accurately. Extending the metaphor slightly, the <i>further</i> we are trying to see, the more substantial the components (propositions) we are likely to invoke, and thus the stronger the imperative to arrange those components correctly. Slight misalignment in a set of binoculars will limit the image quality, but misalignment in the James Webb Space telescope would render it useless \u2013<i> given how far it is trying to see</i>.</p><p>Where does this leave us? Fortunately, there are computational approaches that allow us to capture and navigate this complexity. Here I demonstrate one.</p><h1>3 - Current Approach</h1><p>My analytical approach here has two interrelated components:</p><p>First, I have constructed a Bayesian Network model for predicting misaligned AI X-Risk. This model disentangles how a number of core propositions relate to one another, and in so doing accounts for the potential pitfalls and errors described in Section 2. Further, this disentanglement exposes a number of relevant conditional probabilities that at time of writing have not received much consideration when we discuss AI X-Risk. In this way, the model opens the door for improving <strong>acquisition&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> estimation</strong> goals by increasing the necessary transparency of our reasoning.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps most critically of all, the model incorporates a probability calculus that enables <i><strong>optimal integration</strong></i> across the complex pattern of inferences. Once more I will emphasise that <i>this complexity is inherent within the prediction problem, whether we choose to capture it or ignore it</i>.<i>&nbsp;</i>Furthermore, the way the model is structured draws from other domains of reasoning-under-uncertainty to highlight several useful ways of breaking down the AI X-Risk prediction problem.</p><p>Second, surrounding the Bayesian Network model I have built a simulation \u201cwrapper\u201d. This wrapper selects parameters for the model (e.g., our chosen conditional probabilities), runs the model with those parameters, recording the predictions that model makes, and then begins again with a new set of inputs. We can think of it like this: The Bayesian Network is the telescope design, and the simulation wrapper is a conveyor belt swapping in new lenses and recording the picture. This enables me to do several things:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I can see how model predictions change for each year moving forward <i>as input propositions are predicted to change through time&nbsp;</i>(layer 1). This allows me to ask an expanded set of questions, and ties the temporal dimension into the coherence of the analytical approach. Put another way, <strong>we can explicitly track how predictions change through time</strong>, generated via the same, consistent calculus and structure.</li><li>Second, for every year, I run repeated versions of the model, where parameter inputs are drawn from a distribution, rather than fixed to a single number (layer 2). This stochastic sampling process enables me to incorporate the 2<sup>nd</sup> order probability that affects our estimates for each proposition (see Section 2 for discussion on the way unknowns and disagreements affect our estimates). In this way, <strong>we can determine how much uncertainty surrounds our generated predictions</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>3.1 - Bayesian Network</h2><p>Simply put, a Bayesian Network is an argument map with some maths underpinning it.&nbsp;</p><p>More concretely, Bayesian Networks have a graphical representation, known as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where the relationships (arrows) between each variable (in our case, these are our propositions) are conditional probabilities (<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=AvNID7LyMusC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Probabilistic+reasoning+in+intelligent+systems&amp;ots=F--QSnry2a&amp;sig=7Z0sOFGAmFkHwOIVB2XchLfN8Lc&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Probabilistic%20reasoning%20in%20intelligent%20systems&amp;f=false\">Pearl, 1988</a>). Variables without any parents (i.e., no arrows flowing into them) are described by a \u201cprior\u201d probability at the input stage. In other words, we are fixing an initial probability based on our assumptions. This differs from variables with parents, as these can only initially be described by a set of conditional probabilities (see Section 2.1); the likelihood of that variable being true is always the product of <i>inference</i>. Crucially, this inference process is Bayesian, and may be considered optimal in the sense that it minimises inaccuracy (see e.g., <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Pettigrew-2/publication/272357574_Accuracy_and_the_Laws_of_Credence_draft_manuscript/links/54e317b50cf2d618e195c35e/Accuracy-and-the-Laws-of-Credence-draft-manuscript.pdf\">Pettigrew, 2016</a>).</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:63.54%\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668616004/mirroredImages/b3nGMGGhTZawy8Zfd/awdxerxsayosyoevomsy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_140 140w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_280 280w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_420 420w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_560 560w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_840 840w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_980 980w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_1120 1120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_1260 1260w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/94fc49ef6d4da35cebe9981f2529474f341dc303cc4f6c0d.jpg/w_1339 1339w\"><figcaption><i>Fig. 1: AI Misalignment X-Risk Bayesian Network example structure.</i></figcaption></figure><p>In the model structure shown above, variables (our propositions) are labelled using [square braces], this is to distinguish a variables state (here these states are True/False, though other states are possible) as either true [X] or false [\u00acX]. This is distinct from the <i>probability</i> of a proposition being true P(X) or false P(\u00acX). I will unpack each of these variables and their connections in turn in the model description below. Suffice to say that inferences flow from parentless propositions (or premises) {[SSu], [SBl], [De], [BFe], [Op]}, through an intermediary layer of inferred (read: conditional) propositions {[Po], [MAG], [CCo], [Bu], [In]}, which in turn are parents to the central inferred proposition of interest {[AIX]}.&nbsp;</p><p>We can use the network to \u201cread off\u201d updated inferences about each of our propositions simultaneously, and can even assess the impact of making particular assumptions/observations. For example, if we wish to assume an AI has been built (rather than leave it as an inferred probability), we can set that proposition to true, and see how this changes the pattern of inferences in the rest of the model.</p><h3>3.1.1 - Sub-structures</h3><p>Though we can see already from Fig. 1 that the network is comprised of the reasoning structures outlined in Section 2 (e.g., [De] -&gt; [CCo] -&gt; [AIX] is a chain, whilst [De] is also the common cause of several propositions, that in turn are also common effects of other parent propositions, and so on\u2026), I felt it prudent to further classify these propositions \u2013 particularly in how they relate to the central proposition of interest.</p><p>In asking \u201cwill a misaligned AGI <i><strong>cause</strong></i> an X-event\u201d, we are essentially asking how likely is it an \u201cagent\u201d (a misaligned AGI) will commit an \u201cact\u201d (an X-Event). This is the prediction equivalent of the diagnostic question: \u201chow likely is it [agent] <strong>committed</strong> [action]?\u201d. For this reason,&nbsp;there are similarities between our question and reasoning under uncertainty in legal settings, wherein determining guilt can be broken down into separate sub-structures (see e.g., <a href=\"https://content.iospress.com/articles/argument-and-computation/682656\">Lagnado et al., 2013</a>), each of which plays a role when assessing probable guilt. In part as useful structural metaphor for signposting my reasoning, I use and extend these here, to arrive at the following categories of proposition:</p><p><strong>Means</strong>: Propositions relating to the question of whether an AGI will have the tools/potency to enact an X-Event (in a murder case, this would be possessing the murder weapon).</p><p><strong>Motive</strong>: Propositions relating to the question of whether an AGI will intend to enact an X-Event (this does not mean through maliciousness necessarily, rather through misalignment \u2013 accidental or otherwise).</p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong>: Propositions relating to the question of whether an AGI will have the necessary <i>access</i> to enact an X-Event.</p><p><strong>[Additional] Existence</strong>: As it does not exist yet, we also must consider propositions relating to the creation of an AGI as a necessary enabling condition.</p><p><strong>[Additional] Enabler Incentive</strong>: Similarly, as an entity that we can assume at least initially requires external assistance (even if this is just to create the AGI), we should also consider propositions regarding human (as enabler) incentives.</p><p>Although the above has proven useful to me in my structuring of the model, it may prove a useful classification for others when considering how to direct research and collate arguments. For instance, it may be that means, motive, and existence have received far more thorough treatment or reached firmer consensus than opportunity and incentives. The classification is also useful for basic sensitivity analysis in future \u2013 informing us about which categories are more impactful to our predictions.</p><h2>3.2 - Simulation \"Wrapper\"</h2><p>The simulation wrapper is essentially a series of loops that generate multiple independent Bayesian Network model runs.

I note here that although it is possible to incorporate inter-temporal dynamics (e.g., success in a previous year in one part of the problem changes the dynamics in other parts), in this initial version of the model these are set to one side.&nbsp;</p><p>The second \u201clayer\u201d occurs within each time-point, and entails repeated stochastic sampling (10,000 samples per time-point) from specified distributions (any distribution shape can be specified independently for each parameter, including normal, beta-geometric, see e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z7r83zrSXcis6ymKo/dissolving-ai-risk-parameter-uncertainty-in-ai-future\">this recent post by Froolow</a> on importance of these decisions). This allows us to capture second order uncertainty regarding our model inputs.&nbsp;</p><p>Taken together, the simulation wrapper allows us to not only see how model predictions change <i>over time</i>, but also how uncertainties at input stages translate to uncertainties around those predictions, which can often be highly unintuitive.</p><h2>3.3 - Approach Summary</h2><p>Before summarising the approach, I will once again emphasise that the complexity laid out above (the role of conditional probabilities and reasoning structure, the role of time, and the role of 2<sup>nd</sup> order uncertainty) is still there in our prediction problems, whether we represent it within a model, or not. If we do not represent it formally, we are simply unaware of the nature of the <i>compounding errors</i> we are making, and thus we are prone to overconfidence in our conclusions.</p><p>Through the analytical approach laid out here, we can represent and account for this complexity by making it explicit; in turn allowing us to integrate optimally, <i>given our explicitly stated assumptions</i>. I argue that at this stage in the investigative process \u2013 where methods for accurate integration are particularly required, this has great value. <strong>This approach sets us on the path to learning which unknowns are most critical, such that we can start to seek agreement on shared assumptions/parameters \u2013 or simply see the impact of our disagreement.</strong></p><p>In the model description laid out below, I have no doubt that some of my assumptions will provoke disagreement \u2013 as I have mentioned, I am not an expert on AI. However, wherever possible I have made use of existing arguments and estimates, and I incorporate 2<sup>nd</sup> order uncertainty where there appears to be disagreement. Critically, I am feeding these existing arguments into an analytical approach that captures the complexity that surrounds them, enforcing much needed <i>exhaustiveness and transparency</i>, and enabling <i>accurate integration</i>.</p><h1>4 - Model Description</h1><p>The Bayesian Network model is written in R for now using the gRain package (<a href=\"https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/download/v046i10/564\">H\u00f8jsgaard, 2012</a>); I have made all the code available&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/pilditchtd/AI_X-Risk_BN_Project\">here</a>. Feel free to download it and run it yourself. I have done my best to indicate clearly within the code where different assumptions/parameters can be specified.</p><p>In this section I describe the model by stepping through each proposition in turn. This description begins with parentless propositions which have prior probabilities directly specified. I then build up the model description, beginning with the most immediate inferred propositions, on until all propositions (and how they relate to one another) have been explained. Usefully, a property of Bayesian Networks called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_blanket\">Markov blanket</a> means we can understand an inferred proposition by knowing only its immediate parent propositions. This partitioning property allows us to build up the complete picture of the model by focussing on each piece in turn, without missing anything critical about the model as a whole.</p><h2>4.1 - Terminology</h2><p><strong>AGI</strong>: Here I take this to mean an Artificial General Intelligence, such that it possesses sufficient features to enable concerns regarding goal misalignment and circumvention of control.</p><p><strong>System</strong>: The system/context in which an AGI is implemented.</p><p><strong>User/Implementer</strong>: The human(s) responsible for initial activation of the AGI within the system.</p><p><strong>Parameter Uncertainty</strong>: Here described as +/- 1 standard deviation (SD).

As I have mentioned, although point estimate probabilities are an excellent step, it is important to represent the uncertainty surrounding them, as the way uncertainty propagates across the reasoning structure can often produce unintuitive effects (cf. <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8PqsTNULCPEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=Schum+1994+the+evidential+foundations&amp;ots=s98PqqIMrO&amp;sig=odK8c2LC21w5z27-_2bw2ZAFRpE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Schum%201994%20the%20evidential%20foundations&amp;f=false\">Schum, 1994</a>). In this way, provided point estimates are considered central tendencies in probability distributions of varying width (from which sample parameter values are drawn for model runs).</p><p>Given the question focus on the year 2070, and the consequent prior analyses also providing estimates based on this year, time series inputs trend towards them, following 3 basic assumptions:</p><ol><li>Uncertainties will grow over time (represented here as standard deviations, but other measures can be interchanged for reporting purposes).</li><li>The trend that takes us from the current time-point to 2070 is expected to continue (i.e., I am not assuming there is something a priori \u201cspecial\u201d about the year 2070).</li><li>Unless there is a strong reason to deviate, I will assume steady, continuous linear change in input parameters over time. This is to avoid smuggling additional assumptions, including assuming 2070 as a particular year of importance (e.g., as an inflection point in a sigmoid function). *<i>Note: Other temporal functions are of course testable assumptions within the model, though I will note for the purposes of the 2070 question (and the estimates for that year originating in prior analyses, not my chosen function), this for now is immaterial</i>.</li></ol><h3>4.2.1 - AGI Feasibility &amp; Design Propositions</h3><p><i>Probability of building an AGI build <strong>b</strong>eing <strong>fe</strong>asible: P(<strong>BFe</strong>)</i></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:17.86%\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668616004/mirroredImages/b3nGMGGhTZawy8Zfd/zxu7mhtetfmuj31kkupw.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2deffdc1ea4e8a9a4429872bd00ea6c32d9c937230a3ea64.jpg/w_157 157w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2deffdc1ea4e8a9a4429872bd00ea6c32d9c937230a3ea64.jpg/w_237 237w\"></figure><p><u>Proposition</u>: Is an AGI feasible and affordable?</p><p><u>Assumptions Basis</u>: The probability of there being sufficient, affordable computational capacity for the creation and maintenance of an AGI.

For example, on the one hand the increasing complexity required to design and build an AGI is likely to increase the difficulty of recognising potential risks/threats, and notably if self-modification and improvement is assumed (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111\">Bostrom, 2014</a> Ch.6 on the link between recursive self-improvement and covert preparation potential). On the other hand, advances in the development of potential interrogative tools (for examples of interpretability improvement, see e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/\">Olah, 2020</a>; and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/\">Goh et al., 2021</a>) and an increasing prevalence of blanket assumptions/weariness regarding potential (deleterious) AGI capabilities, may mitigate some of this increasing opacity.

However, for now I note several important factors that are amalgamated to inform this proposition: First, there is consideration of <i>which type of system</i> an AGI will be implemented within (e.g., military, economic, scientific, commercial), and second, what the <i>general connectedness</i> of those systems may be \u2013 irrespective of initial implementation likelihood. If systems are sufficiently connected, then an AGI\u2019s power stems from the use of that connectedness (e.g., in a highly connected system, an AGI originally implemented within a commercial system may make use of connections to power stations, logistical hubs, and so on).</p><p>In determining the estimate for this proposition, I note arguments have been made for a wide range of potential values. For example, there are arguments that our systems are already highly susceptible (with various mechanisms laid out in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf\">Carlsmith, 2021</a>) \u2013 though I note this is not the same as whether they will be so in future. Alternatively, there are arguments that our systems will become increasingly connected/centralised (see e.g., globalisation and ICT trends;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Flat-History-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0374292884\">Friedman et al., 2005</a>), leading to a rising probability of susceptibility. Then again, there are arguments that other shocks, \u201cwarning shots\u201d, and risk factors may lead to increased partitioning and segmentation (e.g., along national boundaries; see e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05482-7\">border closure in response to contagion events</a>; <a href=\"https://institute.global/policy/global-crisis-tackling-international-fallout-russias-war-ukraine\">national protectionism responses to recent food crises</a>), which may in turn decrease the potential (X-Event) potency of an AGI application. Along these lines, I also note separate instantiations of AGIs via competing national interests (see e.g., <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111\">Bostrom, 2014</a>, for discussion of \u201cmultipolar\u201d scenarios) are immensely hard to predict their overall effect (e.g., succeeding or failing to recognise warning signs in other nations).</p><p>Consequently, I highly recommend this area of inquiry for further research in shoring up this proposition.</p><p><u>Detail/Function</u>: For now, P(SSu) is assumed to increase, such that by 2070 there is a probability of 20% that the system within which an AGI is implemented is vulnerable to an X-Event action by an AI, with a +/- 14.16% uncertainty surrounding it (allowing for estimates as high as 50% within 2 SD).</p><p><i>Probability of <strong>S</strong>ystem <strong>Bl</strong>indness: P(<strong>SBl</strong>)</i></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:17.9%\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668616004/mirroredImages/b3nGMGGhTZawy8Zfd/n8lxmc76jsjnadnjoq7d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/dd81507930068c03d647a0fcd44c9ab62f5fa564c51cbe0d.jpg/w_82 82w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/dd81507930068c03d647a0fcd44c9ab62f5fa564c51cbe0d.jpg/w_162 162w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/dd81507930068c03d647a0fcd44c9ab62f5fa564c51cbe0d.jpg/w_242 242w\"></figure><p><u>Proposition</u>: How likely is the human AGI user/implementer to understand the target system well enough to recognise possible misuse/goal misalignment/control subversion?</p><p><u>Assumptions &amp; Basis</u>: The probability of someone with the power to implement an AGI into a system knowing the relevant properties of the system itself (e.g., relevant safeguards, unintended vs intended uses). Similar to consideration of AGI feature transparency/opacity [Op], system vulnerability blindness is expected to <i>increase over time</i>. Using similar logic, this is based on trends regarding system complexity resulting in the potential AGI user/implementer being less and less likely to comprehend sufficiently the system they inhabit (note: System here can be more generalised \u2013 e.g., internet), and with particular regard to potential AGI \u201cmisuse\u201d. But again, I note here that there are arguments that work to offset this trend. In particular, the development of potential interrogative tools and assistive technologies for things like vulnerability testing (for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/cyber-security-market-101165\">growth in cybersecurity tools and services has seen continued, rapid growth</a> in response to increasing user awareness of their system vulnerabilities to rising threats), and the potential influence of increasing prevalence of blanket assumptions/awareness regarding potential system abuse, e.g., via previous \u201cwarning shots\u201d and partial misalignment instances (see e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf\">Carlsmith, 2021</a>).</p><p><u>Detail/Function</u>: For now, P(SBl) is assumed to increase over time, such that by 2070 there is a 40% probability that the potential implementer/user of an AGI does not understand the target system well enough to recognise possible misuse/goal misalignment/control subversion, with +/- 14.16% uncertainty surrounding it (again covering a broad range of potential estimates, from approx. 10% to 70% within 2 SD).</p><h2>4.3 - Conditional / Inferred Propositions</h2><p>These propositions are considered conditional, in that their likelihood of being true or false stems from the propositions that affect (read: cause) them. Each of these propositions requires the specification of the <i>strengths of the relations&nbsp;</i>between it and its parent propositions, specified using conditional probability tables (CPTs). These lay out explicitly the assumptions regarding how each parent proposition will affect this variable, <i>in combination with every other parent proposition</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>At the risk of belabouring a point here, I wish to make abundantly clear that the conditional probabilities outlined here are based on \u201cif cause/premise A is TRUE, then there is a X% probability this effect B would also be TRUE\u201d \u2013 which is not making any assessment of <i><strong>how likely cause/premise A is in the first place.</strong></i></p><p>To avoid concerns of false precision, wherever possible I have attached uncertainties to each conditional probability, considered in the simulation process. Although time series trends could also be specified for each of these conditional probabilities as well (as was done for the prior/baseline input probabilities), for the sake of parsimony this is omitted for now.</p><p>Additionally, I have taken the liberty of colour-coding the conditional probabilities in my CPTs. Specifically, estimates in <strong>green</strong> are drawn from logic, and thus I feel are self-evidently quite solid. Estimates in <strong>yellow</strong> are informed by pre-existing analyses, but carry uncertainty given their novel application here. Estimates in <strong>orange</strong> <i>are novel considerations</i> that have not yet received thorough analysis and estimation by experts. Although I have generated what I believe to be plausible placeholders, these latter values are excellent candidates for further analysis. <i>This helps demonstrate the value of this approach in enforcing <strong>exhaustiveness</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong> when we make our estimates</i>.</p><h3>4.3.1 - Motive</h3><p><i>Probability of an AGI possessing a <strong>M</strong>is<strong>A</strong>ligned <strong>G</strong>oal: P(<strong>MAG</strong>|SBl,De)</i></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:17.94%\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668616004/mirroredImages/b3nGMGGhTZawy8Zfd/w1mffdipc8o1fpir0h5h.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3e9832b87e69d5df76431858a46aa872639c18a2ab66770e.jpg/w_110 110w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3e9832b87e69d5df76431858a46aa872639c18a2ab66770e.jpg/w_190 190w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3e9832b87e69d5df76431858a46aa872639c18a2ab66770e.jpg/w_270 270w\"></figure><p><u>Proposition</u>: How likely will the AI design lead to misaligned goals when implemented within the system?</p><p><u>Assumptions &amp; Basis</u>: The probability of a potential AGI design resulting in goal misalignment when implemented within a system (to deleterious effect) can be argued as a consequence of <i>poor fit</i> between the AGI design (i.e., its derivation of goals) and the context of its initial system of implementation. Here I am assuming the AGI design [De] (replete with features like agentic planning and strategic awareness) is highly likely to develop misaligned goals (again, see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf\">Carlsmith, 2021</a>, for a recent analysis of the relationship between these features and misalignment goals).&nbsp;</p><p>However, this misalignment probability can also be influenced by the user/implementers understanding of the system/context intended for the AGI (i.e., [SBl]). Put another way, an implementer with excellent system awareness (i.e., [\u00acSBl]) might be able to lower the risk of misalignment by changing the system to re-define goals a priori, for instance by adequately attending to and making use of potential \u201cwarning shots\u201d and possible previous partial failures (see Carlsmith, 2021). Conversely, if system users are blind to the nature of their system/context, then this increases the likelihood of an AGI successfully operating with a misaligned goal.

We can broadly take point of departure as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf\">Carlsmiths (2021)</a> estimation of an 80% probability of there being incentive for deployment. However, I go further here to unpack this probability, based on the <i>conjunction of additional relevant parent propositions</i>. More precisely, this 80% probability should decrease <i>if</i> there is an awareness [Op] of the potentially harmful features of the AGI implementation (i.e., misaligned goals [MAG], capacity to circumvent control [CCo], and X-Event power [Po]), using the same logic as applied elsewhere in the analysis (e.g., awareness raised via potential \u201cwarning shot\u201d partial failures from previous (minor) implementations). In such cases, the more severe the risk profile (e.g., the \u201cnear miss\u201d indicated misalignment, control circumvention and potential X-Event power were all possible), the lower the incentive for implementation. Details of these combinations are described below.&nbsp;</p><p>As elsewhere, I take pains to note the nature of this conditional probability: at this point we are not making any claims about the likelihood of each conjunction being true, merely the likelihood of there being an incentive [In] for AGI when we consider each conjunction in turn to be true (i.e., the strength of a relation =/= the likelihood of that relation being activated).</p><p><u>Detail/Function</u>: The integration function for the incentives for AGI [In] is entirely probabilistic, and therefore contains the greatest uncertainty (relative to other inferred propositions). Generally, if the potentially harmful features associated with an implementation (sufficient power to cause an X-Event, [Po]; misaligned goals, [MAG]; and the ability to circumvent human control, [CCo]) are opaque to the potential implementer [Op], then regardless of the presence or absence of each of those features, the incentives are high (80%, +/- 10%). This is equivalent to the incentive when an implementer can determine features accurately [\u00acOp], and those features are not present (i.e., [\u00acMAG, \u00acCCo, \u00acPo]: the AGI is controllable, has no misaligned goals, and no power to commit an X-event).&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, if an implementer can detect deleterious factors, then the incentives for an AGI decrease. <i>These parameters are speculative, but I believe follow a reasonable and coherent risk-mitigation logic</i>, such that: If an AGI is known to be able to circumvent control [CCo] and possess misaligned goals [MAG], then regardless of power [Po], the incentive reduces to 1% (+/-5%); if this AGI will not do what I want it to do in an acceptable (read: aligned) manner, and I cannot control it, why would I want it? However, if an AGI is known to be controllable [\u00acCCo], then knowledge of possible misaligned goals [MAG] and sufficient X-risk power [Po] reduces probability of incentive to 60% (+/-10%), and to 70% (+/- 10%) if there is no X-risk power [\u00acPo]; my control enables it to still be potentially <i>useful</i>, though the added risk from the AGI being misaligned lowers the incentive.</p><p>Conversely, if an implementer knows the AGI does not possess misaligned goals [\u00acMAG], then a lack of control [CCo] and sufficient X-Risk power [Po] reduces the likelihood of incentive to 30% (+/-10%); if something goes badly wrong, I cannot stop it, but if controllable [\u00acCCo] this rises to 70% (+/- 10%). If, in addition to an absence of misaligned goals [\u00acMAG], the implementer knows there is not sufficient X-Risk power [\u00acPo], then a lack of control is less important, resulting in a probability of desirability of 70% (+/-10%) \u2013 versus the 30% probability when there is sufficient power for an AGI enacted X-Event [Po].</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td

successfully built</i>?</p><p><u>Assumptions &amp; Basis</u>: The probability of an AGI being built is conditional on it being feasible/affordable [BFe], having a viable design [De], and the incentive for an AGI [In] \u2013 a moderating condition. The first basic assumption here is that a successful AGI build requires <i>both</i> hardware affordability and feasibility [BFe], <i>and</i> a viable design [De]; if either of these premises are false, then an AGI cannot be built. The second assumption is that the <i>incentives</i> will also affect the likelihood of a build (e.g., via investment and support). Importantly, we are not dealing with how likely it is that there will there be an incentive (P(In)) here, but rather the impact of that premise on build likelihood (P(Bu)), <i>given it is true/false</i>.</p><p>Additionally, it is worth noting that P(In) already takes into account possible awareness of risks and other disincentives (see [In] assumptions above). Here we are dealing with the prospect of absolute, unreserved incentive; the degree to which this desire is reserved / conditional is handled by the input premise [In]. Consequently, I assume here that if there is an incentive for AGI, then \u2013 assuming build-enabling conditions are met \u2013 there is an extremely high likelihood of a successful build (95%, +/-5%; allowing for the possibility of unforeseen factors that prevent a successful build).&nbsp;</p><p>However, if there is <i><strong>no</strong></i> incentive [\u00acIn], then there is a lot more uncertainty regarding a successful build. In my estimation there are arguments on both sides of this potential influence. For example, on the one-hand a successful build, if <i>possible</i>, becomes <i>inevitable</i> (i.e., [\u00acIn] is irrelevant), due to prisoner\u2019s dilemmas (see e.g., relevant discussions on multi-agent dynamics in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://acritch.com/papers/arches.pdf\">Critch &amp; Krueger, 2020</a>), competing external interests (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111\">Bostrom, 2014</a>), and simple curiosity. An alternative perspective is that without sufficient continued investment from substantive enough parties, then development projects continuing past potential roadblocks and setbacks becomes unlikely. Put another way, <i>if</i> development is perceived as both costly <i>and</i> there is no substantive appetite to deploy (e.g., due to perceived risks, handled in [In] calculation), then this should at least <i>decrease</i> the likelihood of development on the basis of a single-agent cost benefit analysis. Given this, I have elected to assume high uncertainty (i.e., 50%, +/-10%; such that estimates can range from ~30% to ~70% within 2 SDs), and note it as an assumption that is a strong candidate for further research.</p><p><u>Detail/Function</u>: Once more, our integration function is primarily a logic gate: An AGI cannot be built without a build being feasible/affordable [BFe], <i>and</i> there being a viable AGI design [De]. The incentive for an AGI [In], in combination with this conjunction, results in an extremely high probability of an AGI being built (95%, +/-5%). If there is no incentive for AGI [\u00acIn], then I assume a large degree of uncertainty of a successful AGI build (50% +/- 10%).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\"><strong>Conditional</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcn9a2c9v2ib\"><sup><a href=\"#fncn9a2c9v2ib\">[6]</a></sup></span></td><td style=\"border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\"><strong>Bu</strong></td><td style=\"border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\"><strong>\u00acBu</strong></td><td style=\"border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\"><strong>Uncertainty (SD)</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(60, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">P(Bu|In,BFe,De)</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(60, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">95%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(60, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">5%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(60, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">+/- 5%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">P(Bu|In,BFe,\u00acDe)</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">100%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">P(Bu|In,\u00acBFe,De)</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">100%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">P(Bu|In,\u00acBFe,\u00acDe)</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">100%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(30, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">P(Bu|\u00acIn,BFe,De)</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(30, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">50%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(30, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">50%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(30, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">+/- 10%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">P(Bu|\u00acIn,BFe,\u00acDe)</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">100%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">P(Bu|\u00acIn,\u00acBFe,De)</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">100%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">P(Bu|\u00acIn,\u00acBFe,\u00acDe)</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">100%</td><td style=\"background-color:hsl(120, 75%, 60%);border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%)\">0%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>4.4 - Central (Inferred) Proposition of Interest</h2><p>As far as the Bayesian network modelling process is concerned, this variable is not qualitatively different from any other inferred variable.

On top of this, given there are creators and users/implementers as causal agents within the problem, we additionally have creator/implementer<i> <strong>incentive</strong>&nbsp;</i>[In]. Logically, we can see that without all four necessary conditions, it follows that an AI misalignment X-Event is not possible. However, uncertainty is introduced through the impact of incentives [In].&nbsp;</p><p>Given there is an incentive [In], we can assume a high likelihood of an AGI misalignment X-Event if the four necessary conditions are met. Our structuring has allowed us to handle the possible uncertainties surrounding <i>wanting to implement</i> ([In] calculation), the uncertainties surrounding potential dangers (i.e., [MAG], [CCo] and [Po]), and the uncertainties surrounding a successful AGI build ([Bu]) elsewhere. Put another way, in the conditional space where all pre-requisites have been met, then the existence of an incentive (to deploy) all but ensures enactment of the X-Event. I assumed it to be 95% (in line with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf\">Carlsmith\u2019s estimate of existential catastrophe</a> given activation of a misaligned AGI).</p><p>However, if there is no incentive [\u00acIn] (e.g., due to accurate recognition of the severe threat posed \u2013 again, this is handled in [In] calculation), then I still assume there remains a possibility of a misaligned AGI X-Event (e.g., via unintended / erroneous implementation, including through AGI deception, or bad-actor dynamics; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111\">Bostrom, 2014</a>). This ranges from 0% to 40% (mean 10%) to reflect a range of potential assumptions (e.g., inevitable implementation vs extreme threat response crack-downs).</p><p><u>Detail/Function</u>: This final integration function is broadly a logic gate as well: An AGI misalignment X-Event requires a successful AGI build [Bu], that AGI to have sufficient power to cause an X-Event [Po], be able to circumvent human control [CCo], and possess a misaligned goal [MAG], to all be true. Assuming this conjunction to be true, then if there is an incentive for AGI, then a misaligned AGI X-Event is almost certain (95%, +/- 5%), though if there is no desire to deploy the AGI, then there is still a possibility of a misaligned AGI X-Event regardless (10%, +/- 10%).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:.5px solid hsl(0, 0%,

This is important to highlight, as it underscores just how conjunctions and the asymmetries they can contain make inferring predictions and trends immensely difficult without computational assistance. Put another way, because parent propositions rarely combine in an <i>exactly additive, equal way</i>, the inferences their combination produces are rarely easy to intuit. For example, many of our intermediary (inferred) propositions \u2013 <strong>and the uncertainty that surrounds them</strong> - are best described by sigmoid functions (e.g., P(Built)). This raises a number of implications:</p><ol><li>If one layer of conjunctions already leads our inferences out of the realm of intuition, then <strong>our errors will only compound</strong> when those conjunctions must serve as parent propositions to another conjunction in turn (e.g., P(AIX) in the current model).&nbsp;</li><li>These conjunctions, the asymmetries within them, and the computational complexity that results <i><strong>are present in the problem whether we choose to represent them or ignore them</strong></i>.</li><li>The Bayesian Network approach advocated here allows us not only to capture and describe them (enforcing<strong> estimate transparency</strong>), but provides the essential computational assistance to <strong>integrate</strong> (and therefore <i><strong>predict</strong></i>) optimally.</li><li>The simulation \u201cwrapper\u201d surrounding the Bayesian Network enables us to gain these same, essential advantages when enfolding both how our estimates <i>change over time</i>, but also the <i>uncertainty surrounding those estimates</i>.</li></ol><h2>5.2 - Central Findings</h2><p>For all the prize-relevant questions, I am choosing to report both the central point-estimate probabilities, and the uncertainty bands (here specified as +/- 1 SD) surrounding those estimates.

For example, there is also interest in the probability of a successful AGI build across several timeframes. Using the model, I can simultaneously \u201cread off\u201d estimates for this proposition (P(Build)), such that:</p><p><i><strong>Probability of a successful AGI build by 2043 = 5.61% (+/- 2.65%)</strong></i></p><p><i>Probability of a successful AGI build by 2070 = 31.55% (+/- 10.02%)</i></p><p><i><strong>Probability of a successful AGI build by 2100 = 58.12% (+/- 11.63%)</strong></i></p><p>Crucially, these subsidiary proposition estimates automatically <i>cohere</i> with all other proposition estimates, as they are predicated upon the same structure, parameters, and calculus. Put another way, <i><strong>if</strong></i> you are happy with the assumptions that produced the probability of a misaligned AGI X-Event (P(AIX)) result, then you should equally be satisfied with the probability of a successful AGI build (P(Bu)) result. Of course, it is both welcomed and expected that there will be disagreement regarding these assumptions. At least this way there is an explicit method of getting these assumptions out in the open, specified, and determined for their impact (i.e., <i>directly addressing goals of <strong>exhaustiveness</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong></i>).</p><h1>6 - Conclusions and Path Forward</h1><p>I have presented an analytical approach here that addresses concerns pervasive to many long-range prediction problems. This analytical approach first endeavours to complement and enhance the necessary <strong>acquisition</strong> and <strong>estimation</strong> processes necessary for making accurate predictions. Second, but perhaps more critically, the approach provides an (optimal) <strong>integration</strong> method, avoiding a number of compounding, systematic errors. I have outlined how these reasoning structures can produce systematic errors, and note that the approach I have provided addresses the analytical weaknesses raised as concerns within AI X-Risk research (see e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qnA6paRwMky3Q6ktk/modelling-transformative-ai-risks-mtair-project-introduction\">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/semi-informative-priors-over-ai-timelines/\">here</a>).</p><p>My hope here is that the approach I have taken is just the beginning. I have taken pains to make this initial foray as accessible as possible, whilst capturing meaningful structural complexities. I have no doubt this model can be corrected and enriched on several fronts, including (but not limited to):</p><ul><li>The adjustment of parameter values and their surrounding uncertainties. Including the selection of alternative uncertainty distributions and time-series functions.</li><li>The addition / removal of links between propositions, based on arguments for which I have not yet accounted.</li><li>The addition of new propositions, whether they be deployed to \u201c<strong>unpack</strong>\u201d current propositions into further sub-structures of connected propositions, or as additional influences on the overall structure.</li></ul><p>Crucially, these corrections and additions, through exposure to the framework, must already engage with the <i>exhaustive unpacking of its related uncertainties</i> (e.g., in proposing a new parent proposition, one must automatically specify not only its prior probability, but also consider how it may conditionally relate to the other propositions extant in the reasoning structure). In this way, I also see opportunities for collaborative work, whether it be in improving this model, or in comparing and contrasting a population of competing models.</p><p>Along with model corrections and enrichments this analytical approach lends itself to the following avenues of future work:</p><ul><li><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: The model can be used to not only test competing propositions/assumptions, but also see which remaining unknowns or disagreements <i>actually matter</i> for the larger question at hand. This can be bolstered through the use of information theoretic measures (see e.g., <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2236703#metadata_info_tab_contents\">Kullback, &amp; Leibler, 1951</a>; <a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/3390174/Towards_a_rational_theory_of_human_information_acquisition-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1667304411&amp;Signature=JOL9yaRHUSSlSx2ztQW8E5bX5FsGgn-70Qwx-sY06ZqQXO8TSTLMAEjiAZJoZbsdJU5HYLEjXLT1S4bluSWcqhYoFPcb1fHsm1JRWOXA9a2UxARaAC17wzcFsg6i7T2nOSUwL5IK4da9DJTMqxDDb5HBrbVIZktCvdw95aF3jvfhzb19YOuaHJ7Xtci~OU4-AhKqn4nm6gV9zH7UDyr2XZMntTT6DBGUqfjXTxy~3H6PDbtGq9OqNUDgL9fvyfWJTlFE3qWUfQlNoFxrZyDMS858Oh-OS2IKGK9ITLieB-X~Bhs67QNVso5UczPuRmx2Hvfg22roJbVWAQHiBuAz1A__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\">Nelson, 2008</a>) based on entropy reduction that enable us to rank propositions by their <i>informational value</i> (whether to the reasoning structure at large, or in relation to a particular proposition of interest).<ul><li>The knock-on effect of this is assistance in more efficient guidance of <strong>acquisition</strong> and <strong>estimation</strong> efforts.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Temporal Dynamics</strong>: Though the analytical approach provides a set of estimates over the time-period of interest that cohere (i.e., their formulation is computationally consistent), more advanced intertemporal dynamics are not yet incorporated. The approach can be expanded, either via shifting to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Bayesian_network\">Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a>, or via introduced feed-throughs and parallel-world analyses (e.g., when X reaches a given threshold, we split the model into a world where X is now considered to have happened, and where X hasn\u2019t happened yet).</li><li><strong>Modularity</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The approach lends itself to modular, parallel research streaming. By this I mean that other projects can be informed by components (e.g., reasoning structures) present in this model, or vice versa. This affords the opportunity for mutual enrichment on analysis across individuals and teams.</li><li><strong>Further Interrogation</strong>: Even with the current model as it stands, we can ask many more questions than I have had time to address. For instance, given the current assumptions, instead of framing a target question around a particular date (2070), we can instead ask questions like:&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>\u201cBy what year can we expect P(misaligned AGI X-Risk) to surpass our tolerance threshold (e.g., 1%, 5%)?\u201d</i></p><p>Or</p><p><i>\u201cIf we assume a misaligned AGI X-Event has occurred, how likely were we to see certain indicators (propositions) beforehand?\u201d</i></p><p>The stakes of getting these predictions wrong are immense. The challenge we face is in 1) <strong>acquiring relevant arguments and propositions</strong>, 2) <strong>estimating our uncertainties surrounding them</strong>, and 3) <strong>integrating them accurately</strong>. The analytical approach put forward here takes major steps in assisting all three, by increasing the <i>transparency</i>, <i>clarity</i>, <i>consistency</i>, and <i>accuracy</i> of our reasoning.</p><p><i>My thanks to Dr Lawrence Newport for helpful comments on earlier versions of this text.</i></p><p><i><strong>All errors lie with me.</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>EDIT: Minor Formatting.</strong></i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn8diqhvi598n\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref8diqhvi598n\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>What I cover here has been said more comprehensively by many others in the reasoning-under-uncertainty literature (e.g., <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=AvNID7LyMusC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Pearl+1988&amp;ots=F--QSotu09&amp;sig=hyOFOV0WHbgR_9lhbO52ilMRUAI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Pearl%201988&amp;f=false\">Pearl, 1988</a>; <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8PqsTNULCPEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=Schum+1994+the+evidential+foundations&amp;ots=s98QmsLHxL&amp;sig=eOV9okPV1k4fyw4ZIQ7INz9wm0A&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Schum%201994%20the%20evidential%20foundations&amp;f=false\">Schum, 1994</a>).

I feel the idea that some can \u2018give\u2019 and that \u2018others\u2019 receive is dangerous.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying this lightly, it\u2019s the result of deep effort. There is only one investment to be made now for the kind of emergent patterns you seek. Bucky Fuller called it a \u2018trim tab\u2019 - or the precise location to put least effort for maximal effect.</p><p>sovereignty</p><p>Providing sovereignty for every human extrapolates to benefits in real world interactions, political experience, digital reality, and personal spiritual life.</p><p>A protocol, or cryptographic communication platform, that presumes and protects human sovereignty, completely alters the human relationship to power of every kind.</p><p>In terms of resiliency, a system based on the unit of one, can start with that seed and grow in any situation. The first and second survivors of an event become a network. A localized network that participates in the give and take of what they Have and Need is regionally appropriate by default.</p><p>Everything required to live fits into Haves and Needs, then from there, it\u2019s just matching.</p><p>Matching can be language and literacy agnostic as the items being matched are locally relevant and likely input in similar formats. Voice, photo, app interaction, are all equally valid.</p><p>All interactions would be controlled by the individual and the system is built to only deal with exchange of value. Being currency agnostic is crucial to this concept.</p><p>Hypothetical? Centralized? No way. Holochain allows an interactive set of unique records, I\u2019ll call a \u2018receipt chain\u2019, to contain everything you Have or Need.</p><p>The only criteria is being a living breathing human.</p><p>A few layers of privacy are for different kinds of interactions. \u2018Civic\u2019 interactions involve a certain level of privacy i.e. the City knows your address and last name, and in exchange for your taxes, they provide safety and services. Nobody outside that relationship needs to know though, so the idea of selling personal profile information is anathema to healthy human interaction.</p><p>Similarly, allowing your doctor temporary access to your medical record to update a test result doesn\u2019t force their office to maintain HIPAA compliance. Anything that\u2019s needed would be requested and approved by the medical record owner, you.</p><p>Same goes for any other interaction. Two parties agree and the event is recorded in each \u2018receipt chain\u2019 with a token from the other party. Now their two chains are connected by this value exchange. Terms are in the metadata and smart contracts would have room to act out their code too, within that container.</p><p>IN this way, every completed exchange and the descriptive metadata surrounding it, become a de facto \u2018relevancy\u2019 score for anything. &nbsp;No more derived or speculative \u201creputation\u201d. It either happened or it didn\u2019t. Lying is easily discovered (because the \u2018truth\u2019 exists on chain in the collective set of interactions) and definitely not worthwhile (because falsehood would result in becoming \u2018known\u2019 for that, which would be very difficult to recover from within a system of peers in your own community). A \u201cshort\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d chain would require explanation as to why\u2026 IF you could get anyone to transact with you in the first place. Charities and social service organizations would be looking out for those short chains however, as the owner is likely going to have some difficulty getting by in a cooperative setting.</p><p>Vetting anyone is accomplished automatically by randomly traversing their interactions and hopping from chain to chain until a sufficient number of random hops were verified. When the chain/person is trusted and the exchange verified, their \u2018relevance for being honest and a verified human\u2019 is weighted, thereby affecting how their data is projected. Everything you\u2019d be looking for is compared against the resources available, but \u201cbag of beans\u201d is as equally \u2018valid\u2019 as guitar lessons or job training. Matching doesn\u2019t have to decide priority (another typical design mistake).</p><p>Private details don\u2019t need to be divulged for basic interactions in real life. There are details people want to share though. Publishing a public layer of transaction metadata serves useful purposes, just as a resume does. Of course it is up to the individual how much to divulge, but they benefit by being matched, and all interactions are in the control of the individual. Agreeing to meet for exchange, or using a trusted third party, are all normal steps to an unknown situation that can be easily accommodated by technology.</p><p>All this \u2018accountability\u2019 is not on the individual alone, it goes both ways. With this system, citizen requests form a \u2018to-do\u2019 list for local governance to respond to, or not. Only, as a system of citizen controlled data, the \u2018responsiveness rate\u2019 of those elected or appointed leaders will be available at voting time outside of the governance structure.</p><p>This same ease of interaction changes the dynamic in Aid situations as well. The only true solution to any desperate moment is self-efficacy and community network reinforcement, but the Aid paradigm is inherently disempowering. Big Aid needs data, and they cannot afford to get all of it. Up until recently, owning the data and means of collection was important. Financial reality and the donor\u2019s demand for metrics has created a situation where a steady stream of pristine data is worth its hard drive\u2019s weight in gold.</p><p>Who better to provide precise details of what\u2019s needed for a sustainable outcome than the people affected? Why doesn\u2019t Big Aid trust humans? Trust me, they don\u2019t, and it starts all the way at the top. I say \u201ctrust me\u201d because on the inside of these orgs, there is no shame in treating whole population groups as thieving children based on a few poor examples, halfhearted attempts to \u2018listen\u2019 to community, or most often a deeply ingrained idea that civilization is \u201cbetter\u201d. Now we can satisfy those concerns and guarantee each input is verified in a trustable manner, but through s system that is not controlled by any Aid org - yet is more trustworthy and accurate than anything they have or that they can devise.</p><p>The solution? A list of wants and resources, with an expectation of responsiveness, is the beginning of a healthy relationship between populations and the power structures they live under.</p><p>In a user-owned environment, commerce changes quickly. Marketing changes into a bazaar model. Vendors lay their wares out and anonymous customers walk by. Incentives for sharing personal details and preferences would exist, but the real driver is personal customer need. What you need and want should be shared freely with your own bot to find better matches and learn over time. This bot would negotiate the best price for your user data, and find those things you seek. Discovering novel and exciting items is equally possible as now, just without the invisible psychosocial profiling and back-room data merchants that make money off of you instead of paying you for your humanity.</p><p>In a sovereignty protecting system, any user data found without a reference to the transaction - including purpose and time of use, would make the holder criminally liable.</p><p>All this from a group of personal blockchains? Yes. Equitable governance, simplified disaster logistics, self-efficacy, reinforced community networks, political accountability, resiliency, privacy, the ability to be digitally forgotten if necessary, ad-hoc secure networks among friends, and a store of every output, post, blog, or missive that you can allow a site to display, all may derive from your own protected store of data. With personal control as the One Rule, the rest of the system basically designs itself.</p><p>With a human to human network that grows and changes based on communities of consensus, the typical bureaucratic structures are irrelevant. By placing every human in the flow of giving and receiving and making everyone\u2019s priorities equal, in an environment with transparency and self protected interests, making it easy to combine needs and resources is the final piece to using human selfish drives for prosocial ends.</p><p>In this equalized setting, dignity has a chance.</p><p>Consider a group of forced migrants able to scan a QR code at the edge of town and me matched with specific resources the town has. No wandering through the streets lost and causing suspicion. Almost more importantly, those with professional skills or even a kind heart can be matched to community needs one for one. Providing benefit is the quickest way to overcome prejudice. This kind of system can ensure the security of all parties, giving them the room to recognize human value in the \u2018other\u2019.</p><p>I\u2019ll leave this by saying \u2018giving then evaluating\u2019 is NOT the path to healthy futures.</p><p>Simple scaleable and regionally appropriate solutions can be designed now that bypass all the layers that keep us small and isolated.</p>", "user": {"username": "omdesign"}}, {"_id": "SqCDoL9cHa7bnEWyb", "title": "Announcing EA Survey 2022", "postedAt": "2022-10-31T10:53:24.961Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The 2022 EA Survey is now live at the following link: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1NfgYhwzvlNGUom?source=eaforum\"><u>https://rethinkpriorities.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1NfgYhwzvlNGUom?source=eaforum</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>We appreciate it when EAs share the survey with others.

Every year the survey is used to inform the decisions of a number of different EA orgs. And, despite the survey being much shorter this year, this year we have included requests from a wider variety of decision-makers than ever before.</p><h3><strong>Prize</strong></h3><p>This year the Centre for Effective Altruism has, again, generously donated a prize of $1000 USD that will be awarded to a randomly selected respondent to the EA Survey, for them to donate to any of the organizations listed on EA Funds.

It seems to show that the world cannot always be sharply divided into separate experiences.</p><p>We can make the analogy, to how the world cannot always be divided into separate organisms. Usually it can, but there are cases, like conjoined twins, where someone would say it's one organism, someone else that they are two organisms, and someone else that it's something in between.</p><p>The experiment lies on two postulates:</p><h1>P1. Mind-body continuity</h1><p>It's the idea that tiny physical changes should correspond to tiny mental changes. And that should work for arbitrarily tiny ones.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5l1zd1ggeje\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5l1zd1ggeje\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So you couldn't completely change the content of your experience, just by moving one atom in one of your neurons.</p><p>An infinitesimal physical change, will cause an infinitesimal change of that system's behavior. So if you rejected mind-body continuity, you'd have to admit that some non-infinitesimal mental change can have an infinitesimal (practically zero) effect on the physical world. So basically you'd be forced into near epiphenomenalism.</p><h1>P2. Splitting the brain in half creates two separate experiences</h1><p>This is illustrated nicely by the experiments with split brain patients (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo\">like this one</a>). For example, if you had a split brain and closed your eyes, you couldn't tell if your right hand and left hand are touching the same surface. Those two experiences are separate<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgdlwhnekn76\"><sup><a href=\"#fngdlwhnekn76\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;- they aren't unified into one, so you cannot compare them.</p><p>(It\u2019s not relevant here if they should be treated as two&nbsp;<i>persons</i>. I only claim that they are two experiences.)</p><h1>Experiment</h1><p>Imagine that you undergo a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosotomy\">brain-splitting surgery</a>. You are anesthetized so you don't feel pain, but in this experiment, you're fully awake. And this surgery is very slow - they cut only one nerve fiber at a time.</p><p>At the beginning, you have one unified experience, but at the end you have two. So one possibility is that there was some exact point when the split occurred - some critical fiber that needed to be cut. But that would violate the mind-body continuity that we assumed. So the only alternative is that we gradually went from one to two experiences. That there was some \"in-between\" state.</p><h1>What does it feel like?</h1><p>So, how would it feel to be in such a state?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/N1Mac4FeKXg?t=402\">Here</a> is a real-life example of brain-conjoined twins where we may say that such \"partially connected\" experiencing happens. The blindfolded girl can access what her sister is seeing, but it's faint so she needs to focus.</p><p>Maybe it's just about how tightly bound the qualia are? So qualia of one sister are bound to the second one's, but very weakly. If that's true, this would make it much less exotic - in your ordinary mind you also have some qualia which are tightly bound, and some which are almost disconnected. For example, when you look at a tree:</p><ul><li>the greenness of a leaf if strongly bound to the leaf's shape</li><li>all the leaves and the tree body are bound into one object, but it's a weaker binding</li><li>the tree and the sky and the grass are all bound into a unified visual field, but it's a weaker binding</li><li>your visual and auditory fields are bound into your experience of the external world, but it's a weaker binding</li><li>that external world is bound with your thoughts and emotions and body perception to form your whole unified experience, but it's a weaker binding</li></ul><h1>Speculation</h1><p>When you stop paying attention f.e. to your auditory field, could it be that it becomes disconnected from the main chunk of your experience (visual+thoughts+...), but those sound qualia maintain some \"smaller\" existence of their own?</p><p>Or that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-streams_hypothesis\">dorsal visual stream</a> (the one that is responsible for spatial understanding, and is separate from the object recognition stream) has its own \"smaller\" experiences?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxch3l4e2bwi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxch3l4e2bwi\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Unfortunately, this stream is disconnected from your thoughts and episodic memory, so we don't have any easy way of checking that.</p><p>If we could identify some brain systems that are usually disconnected, but sometimes do connect, we could use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/algekalipso\">@algekalipso's</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3gvwhQMKvro?t=3109\">phenomenal puzzle test</a>, to see if the other system has its own phenomenal experience.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqpx9gcc8zg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqpx9gcc8zg\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But it may be impossible to find systems suitable for all the steps in that test.</p><h1>Consequences</h1><p>Integrated Information Theory, which is currently the most formally developed theory of consciousness, explicitly aims to divide the world into separate non-overlapping experiences (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory#Postulates:_properties_required_of_the_physical_substrate\">Exclusion Postulate</a>). The math used in that theory allows for situations, where an infinitesimal physical change results in a drastic mental change. It violates the \"mind-body continuity\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgt0m9lumrpt\"><sup><a href=\"#fngt0m9lumrpt\">[5]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>So maybe that Exclusion Postulate should just be dropped? The rest of the theory could still work without it. Instead of a set of separate experiences, the theory would output some more complex structure, maybe a graph<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0m6xb9okgw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0m6xb9okgw\">[6]</a></sup></span>. For practical purposes, we could still cluster this graph into a set of separate experiences like before, but it should be clear that this is not what really exists. It\u2019s just a practical simplification. And we could still quantify the amount of experience with a suitable graph metric.</p><p>So far, this mind fuzziness has never been a noticeable problem in real life. But brain-computer interfaces, mindmelding and digitalization of minds, will enable much more exotic mental architectures. This also complicates utilitarian calculations. But we can still aim for \"the greatest good for the greatest number\" - it's just that this number is no longer an integer.</p><p><i>Thanks to Kamil Przespolewski for all the help!</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn5l1zd1ggeje\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref5l1zd1ggeje\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This postulate can be formalized analogously to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function#Weierstrass_and_Jordan_definitions_(epsilon%E2%80%93delta)_of_continuous_functions\">Weierstrass's definition of a continuous function</a>.

We also recommend reviewing recognition prizes more closely, as we found them to be associated with more positive outcomes than we anticipated.

We would also want to speak to scholars who have thought deeply about prizes, to check if we missed or mis-weighed any important considerations. Moreover, we would try to come up with more concrete recommendations on what incentive mechanism works best in what context (AMCs vs. inducement prizes vs. grants and other mechanisms). We would also review other potential applications and existing proposals of AMCs.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>Types and definitions of prizes</h1><p>In our understanding, there is no universally agreed-upon typology and set of prize definitions in the literature. According to Everett (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/P98G-J8RJ\"><u>2011</u></a>, p. 7), the simplest distinction between prizes is that made between recognition prizes<i>&nbsp;</i>(also called blue-sky prizes or awards [<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>Kay, 2011</u></a>, p. 10]) and inducement prizes<i>&nbsp;</i>(also called targeted prizes)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftuns5ddeado\"><sup><a href=\"#fntuns5ddeado\">[1]</a></sup></span>. Recognition prizes are awarded ex post and in recognition of a specific or general achievement (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3AVH-NRV8\"><u>Nobel Prize</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/PY3K-ERS7\"><u>Man Booker Prize</u></a>). Inducement prizes are established ex ante, defining award criteria in advance in order to spur innovation towards a pre-defined goal (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QTM9-HG3R\"><u>Ansari X Prize</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Within inducement prizes, some authors distinguish between grand innovation prizes and smaller-scale competitions (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.06.013\"><u>Murray et al., 2012</u></a>, p.1), where the former refer to large-scale monetary prizes with no path to success known ex ante and believed to require a breakthrough solution and significant commitment, and the latter refer to challenges for well-defined problems that often require only limited time commitment or involve adapting existing solutions to problems (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7W75-ZLUP\"><u>Innocentive</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/K5YF-KWFZ\"><u>Topcoder</u></a>).</p><p>The main focus of this report is on inducement prizes, and in particular, grand innovation prizes. However, as there is relatively little published literature on these types of prizes, we also include and discuss evidence we found on other types of prizes.</p><p>Two common features of inducement prizes are that (1) they only pay if a specific goal is achieved, and (2) they do not require the funder to decide how the goal should be met or who is in the best position to meet it (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/B8PZ-ETMH\"><u>Kalil, 2006</u></a>, p. 8). This stands in contrast to grants, which require the funding agency to determine who will receive funds to achieve a goal. Moreover, grants pay for efforts and are not tied to outcomes (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VD9A-FLRB\"><u>McKinsey, 2009</u></a>, p. 36).</p><p>Another focus of this report are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Advance_market_commitments__AMCs__have_a_lot_of_potential_for_impact_and_current_critiques_and_issues_may_be_resolved_with_more_research_and_experience\"><u>advance market commitments</u></a> (AMCs), which are conceptually related to prizes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoykzzx00t1i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoykzzx00t1i\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Advance market commitments offer a prospective guarantee by a donor to purchase a fixed amount of a specified technology at a fixed price (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/TF4E-BEBU\"><u>Koh Jun, 2012</u></a>, p. 87). Advance market commitments are similar to prizes in that both are considered a form of \u201cpull\u201d funding; that is, they guarantee a reward upon an achievement that meets certain criteria (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/TF4E-BEBU\"><u>Koh Jun, 2012</u></a>, p. 86). This is in opposition to \u201cpush\u201d funding, which provides grants for the innovator\u2019s investments whether they result in a successful product or not.

Grand Challenges are different from inducement prizes in that they award grants for selected research proposals, i.e. they pay for effort. On the other hand, in at least some cases grantees also have an opportunity to receive more funding based on the outcomes of their research. For example, in Grand Challenges Explorations, grantees can apply for additional support for projects that demonstrate innovative solutions (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/V5EZ-YAVK\"><u>Grand Challenges Explorations Round 26 Rules and Guidelines</u></a>, pp. 1, 6).</p><h1>The recent boom in inducement prizes&nbsp;</h1><p>The use of inducement prizes to incentivize technological and scientific breakthroughs dates back hundreds of years, and prizes have been proliferating as a tool used by policy-makers, firms, and NGOs in recent decades (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>Sigurdson, 2021</u></a>, p. 1).&nbsp;</p><p>As Figure 1 shows, the total cash value offered by large (\u2265 $100,000) recognition and inducement prizes has grown exponentially since 1970 according to a data set of 219 prizes collected by McKinsey (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VD9A-FLRB\"><u>2009</u></a>, p. 16).

From 1991 to 2007, this number increased to 78% (see Figure 2 below).

We also created a list of other, probably less relevant, studies we came across during our research that we decided not to or didn\u2019t have time to review&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s29T6zlQcnkByAD3g2D7w5N4JjEoxlaCp2HeFF0wQXA/edit#heading=h.c1ce1yublfu9\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding inducement prizes, we found only one article that tried to establish a causal effect of inducement prizes on innovation output (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><u>Brunt, Lerner, &amp; Nicholas, 2012</u></a>). The authors used data on nearly 2,000 awards and 15,000 entries for technological development by the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) at annual competitions between 1839 and 1939. RASE awarded both medals and monetary prizes of more than \u00a31 million. Using negative binomial regressions, the study found a significant and positive effect on the number of patents as a proxy for innovation. For example, in one specification, an additional medal was associated with an 8% increase in the number of patents. We deem the internal validity high enough that we trust at least the sign of the relationship. However, we think its external validity is quite low. We are doubtful whether inducement prizes for agricultural technology in 19th and early 20th century England can teach us much about how effective a modern inducement prize for other technologies or outcomes would be. Moreover, we\u2019re reluctant to put too much weight on this single piece of evidence.</p><p>Another well-executed set of articles as part of a doctoral dissertation examined the causal relationship between inducement prizes and intermediate outcomes relevant to innovation (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>Sigurdson, 2021</u></a>). The author used data on more than 1,600 participating and control scientists in the context of the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, an inducement prize for autonomous vehicles. Using a difference-in-differences approach combined with matching, he established that the prize increased the number of and diversity of coauthors that participants collaborated with after the prize. More precisely, prize participants had a 31% increase in the number of unique coauthors per year within the 10-year period after the prize compared to non-participating researchers. Prize participants were also more likely to publish work with coauthors from other scientific disciplines than non-participating researchers. Another interesting finding was that prizes may influence the direction of research by enabling the discovery of breakthrough ideas. However, it is not clear to us how these intermediate outcomes relate to the overall quantity and quality of innovation.</p><p>Regarding recognition prizes, there seems to be somewhat stronger evidence for their innovation-related and field-shaping effects. An impressive high-quality article focused on 405 scientific prizes that were conferred 2,900 times between 1970 and 2007 with respect to 11,000 scientific topics in 19 disciplines (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25712-2\"><u>Jin, Ma, &amp; Uzzi, 2021</u></a>). The data set represents almost all recognition prizes worldwide in that time period. Using a&nbsp; difference-in-differences regression design combined with matching, the authors found huge positive effects on various indicators of research effort for prizewinning topics, such as the number of publications (40%), citations (33%), entrants (37%), and incumbents (55%) in the first 5-10 years after the prize. While this is no direct evidence of effects on innovation, we think it\u2019s plausible to conjecture that a large amount of additional attention received by a scientific topic increases its speed and quality of innovation. Moreover, the sheer scale and comprehensiveness of the data set and, in our view, unusually high internal validity of the study convinced us to trust and put a lot of weight on its findings.&nbsp;</p><p>We also found direct evidence of the effects of recognition prizes on innovation from a study focusing on late 19th and early 20th century Japan (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12007\"><u>Nicholas, 2013</u></a>). Similarly to Brunt, Lerner, and Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><u>2012</u></a>), the author used a binomial regression model on a data set combining patent counts and various information on prizes. He found that recognition prizes (mostly non-pecuniary) boosted patents, but only in less technologically developed areas of Japan. However, as the estimated effects had large standard errors and we deem the study\u2019s external validity rather limited, we do not weigh this piece of research strongly in our conclusions.</p><p>A study on more than 3,000 recognition prizes in science in diverse disciplines over more than 100 years and in over 50 countries followed the career trajectories of almost 11,000 prizewinners (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800485115\"><u>Ma &amp; Uzzi, 2018</u></a>). The authors found that prizes were increasingly concentrated among a small and tightly connected elite, suggesting that a small group of scientists and ideas pushed scientific boundaries. However, it is unclear how these networks affected knowledge transfer and innovation.</p><p>We also found evidence to suggest that articles written by scientists who later became Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators (and thus received a significant amount of no-strings-attached funding) received more citations than those who did not, though the effect was small and short-lived (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1755\"><u>Azoulay, Stuart, &amp; Wang, 2014</u></a>). Interestingly, a related study found a redistribution effect of scientific attention and recognition away from researchers that work proximate to prizewinners (measured by the number of citations), suggesting negative spillover effects of prizes on the allocation of attention (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0001839217731997\"><u>Reschke, Azoulay, &amp; Stuart, 2018)</u></a>. This effect was canceled out by the extra attention of the prizewinner only for fields that are comparatively poorly cited/neglected.</p><p>Overall, the available (though scarce) evidence points to prizes having the potential and ability to affect intermediate outcomes (such as collaboration patterns among innovators) and to shape the trajectory of science and innovation. We found the evidence for the field-shaping effects of recognition prizes stronger and more convincing than for inducement prizes, though in both cases it\u2019s difficult to anticipate the extent to which prizes affect the quantity and quality of innovation. Our view is mainly based on the fact that inducement prizes have been less researched, not because recognition prizes are necessarily better.&nbsp;</p><h1>Prizes can effectively leverage private capital</h1><p><i>[Confidence: We have medium confidence that prizes can leverage significant amounts of private capital, based on recent example figures and historical prizes. We deem it unlikely that a further review of the literature would change our view. However, a systematic assessment of the leveraging effect of modern large-scale inducement prizes, which to our knowledge does not exist, would likely reduce our uncertainty.]</i></p><p>We found some empirical evidence that prizes can leverage private sector investment greater than the cash value of the prize.

Companies may be willing to cosponsor a competition or invest heavily to win it because of the publicity and the potential enhancement of their brand or reputation. Private, corporate dollars that are currently being devoted to sponsorship of America\u2019s Cup or other sports events might shift to support prizes or teams. Wealthy individuals are willing to spend tens of millions of dollars to sponsor competitions or bankroll individual teams simply because they wish to be associated with the potentially historical nature of the prize. Most areas of science and technology are unlikely to attract media, corporate, or philanthropic interest, however.</i>\u201d</p><p>We would like to note that we haven\u2019t vetted any of the aforementioned figures and we suspect that they were calculated in different ways. Moreover, we don\u2019t know whether these figures are representative, but we think it\u2019s possible that there is a publication bias in the sense that prizes that were less successful or received less participant and media attention were less likely to be studied. Our best guess is that the average large inducement prize (\u2265 $100,000) leverages 2-10 times the amount of private capital relative to the cash rewards (80% confidence interval).</p><h1>When do prizes work best?</h1><p>In this section, we first describe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Prizes_are_effective_when_there_is_a_clear_goal_with_an_unknown_path_to_success_or_in_case_of_market_failure\"><u>in what cases prizes should be used</u></a> and might be a good choice compared to other innovation incentive mechanisms.

Instead, it lists a number of factors that may influence the choice. Kapczynski (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7LJG-4TB3\"><u>2012,&nbsp;</u></a>p. 19) summarized:&nbsp;</p><p>\u201c<i>[T]he . . . economics literature has proliferated a series of parameters that influence the comparative efficiency of these different systems, including, most importantly, the competitiveness of the research environment; the cost of research as compared to the value of the reward; the riskiness of research or creativity; the importance of private information about the cost or value of creation; the costs of overseeing effort in the context of contracts; and the comparative costs of rent seeking, uncertainty, and the administration of each system. The information economics literature thus offers no general endorsement of any mechanism.</i>\u201d</p><p>Burstein and Murray (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Z3ZD-GRCJ\"><u>2016</u></a>) also explained that the policy literature does not do much better at explaining and justifying prizes than does the economic literature, as it provides only rules of thumb for determining when and how to use prizes. According to the authors, a basic rule seems to be that prizes are most useful when the goal is clear but the path to achieving it is not (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/B8PZ-ETMH\"><u>Kalil, 2006</u></a>, p. 6). They explained that one line of literature suggests that prizes are useful in industries that are particularly susceptible to under-production of innovation because private actors lack a viable market. As two examples, they mentioned the market for pharmaceuticals targeting diseases endemic to the developing world, where ability to pay is lower than the need, and the market for technologies to address climate change where social value far exceeds private value. They found that these are two areas in which prizes have most frequently been proposed.&nbsp;</p><p>McKinsey (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VD9A-FLRB\"><u>2009</u></a>, p. 37) created a flow chart as a tool to decide when to use prizes versus other philanthropic instruments, such as grants or infrastructure investments. Essentially, they recommended using prizes \u201c<i>when a clear goal can attract many potential solvers who are willing to absorb risk. This formula is most obvious in so-called \u2018incentive\u2019 prizes. [...] But the formula also holds for good \u2018recognition\u2019 prizes like the Nobels.</i>\u201d While this sounds plausible to us, we are not sure where McKinsey derived these recommendations from, as this was not stated in their report.</p><p>In her book&nbsp;<i>Inventing Ideas</i> (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NXK6-GU44\"><u>2020</u></a>), Zorina Khan, an economic historian and expert on prizes, wrote a list of cases and circumstances under which prizes are potentially effective (see Appendix 4 of the book). We copied this list here:</p><ul><li>\u201c<i><strong>To achieve philanthropic or nonprofit objectives:</strong> This might include circumstances where market failure occurs, although the ultimate goal should be to enable markets to work rather than to replace the market mechanism with monopsonies&nbsp;</i></li><li><i><strong>Social objectives:</strong> Prizes can help to promote unique, qualitative, social, or technical goals that are not scalable or for which there is no market&nbsp;</i></li><li><i><strong>To publicize or draw attention to otherwise ignored issues:</strong> To focus attention, facilitate coordination, or signal quality: however, if the objective is publicity or opportunity to work with/learn from other competitors, then from a social perspective there are likely to be more effective means of marketing&nbsp;</i></li><li><i><strong>As signals of quality:</strong> In markets for experience goods and instances where informational costs are high\u201d</i></li></ul><p>We are not sure whether these points were derived from theoretical considerations or from empirical findings, as they were listed in the Appendix without any context. We skimmed through her book looking for concrete examples or justifications for these points, but we were unable to find them. A deeper read of the book or a phone call with Khan might provide clarification. Unfortunately, she was unavailable to meet with us.</p><p>To summarize, we did not find very concrete answers on when prizes are most effective compared to other mechanisms to incentivize innovation. However, two common rules we encountered were that prizes are effective (1) when the goal is clear, but the path to achieving the goal is not, and (2) when innovators lack a viable market to innovate, such as in the case of neglected tropical diseases or technologies to address climate change.</p><h2>Prize design influences the ability to spur innovation</h2><p><i>[Confidence: We have relatively low confidence in our recommendations regarding the optimal design of prizes, which are largely based on few small-scale lab or field experiments. A further review of the literature is unlikely to change our views, but the publication of new (quasi-) experimental studies on the effects of different design parameters of large-scale prizes might alter our conclusions.]</i></p><p>We have found relatively little empirical (or theoretical, for that matter) evidence on how to effectively design a large prize for innovation. We came across few papers that empirically tested the implications of different design features of prizes, which were largely small experiments with relatively small monetary rewards. While we deem the research to be overall of high quality and high in internal validity, the findings may not necessarily extend to other settings. Moreover, it is not clear how different design features would interact. We summarize our most important findings and recommendations in the following (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Appendix_3___More_detailed_discussion_of_design_issues\"><u>Appendix 3</u></a> for a more thorough discussion of the studies we reviewed). We would like to emphasize that our recommendations are very tentative and based on relatively little evidence that may not necessarily extend to other settings.</p><h3>Prestige is a stronger incentive than monetary rewards</h3><p>We reviewed six empirical studies (two quasi-experimental studies, one field experiment (RCT), two case studies, and one textbook that combines regression analyses with qualitative observations) on the importance of monetary vs. non-monetary prize incentives. The results from these studies are mixed. Some studies found that monetary incentives spurred innovations relative to only non-monetary incentives (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/242V-FT36\"><u>Boudreau &amp; Lakhani, 2011</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25712-2\"><u>Jin, Ma, &amp; Uzzi, 2021</u></a>), while others found that medals provided stronger incentives than monetary rewards (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><u>Brunt, Lerner, &amp; Nicholas, 2012</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>Kay, 2011</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NXK6-GU44\"><u>Khan, 2020</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>Murray et al., 2012</u></a>). Overall, there appears to be only a weak relationship between the size of the cash rewards and innovative activity and outputs. Moreover, a consensus seems to be that medals provide stronger incentives than monetary rewards, and that prize participants are typically not only motivated by monetary rewards (as assumed by economic theory), but by a host of other factors (e.g. prestige, reputation, visibility). While one could hypothesize that the prestige of an award is a function of the size of the prize, this hypothesis is not strongly supported by the data we found. A McKinsey (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VD9A-FLRB\"><u>2009</u></a>, p. 58) analysis found only a weak correlation between the cash award of a prize and the prize\u2019s exposure (proxied by the number of online mentions in Google search results).</p><p>We have not investigated how costly it is to create publicity and visibility around a prize, but according to Jim English,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi51tsjy4q1n\"><sup><a href=\"#fni51tsjy4q1n\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;who was interviewed by McKinsey (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VD9A-FLRB\"><u>2009</u></a>, p. 60), \u201c<i>prizes fail when the sponsor fails to understand how much effort and investment is required beyond the simple \u2018economic capital\u2019 of the award itself. A sponsor might imagine that a prize that carries cash value of, say, $50,000 requires around $60,000 or $75,000 a year to run. But depending on the kind of prize and the field of endeavor, the actual costs might be $500,000 or more when you include raising public awareness that a prize exists, inducing people to nominate and apply, mounting a publicity campaign, and administering the whole program.</i>\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Our conclusion from these results is that offering a monetary reward makes sense, but only insofar as it increases the prestige and visibility of the prize. We recommend focusing more on creating prestige around a competition, and offering medals rather than a very large cash reward. We have not investigated the costs of creating publicity, but according to one figure, the total costs (including administrative and publicity costs) required to successfully run a prize might be around 10 times the offered cash award.&nbsp;</p><h3>Winner-takes-all scheme could generate more novel innovation than multiple prize scheme in single contest</h3><p>We reviewed three studies (one field experiment, one laboratory experiment, and one study combining an online experiment with an empirical analysis of an actual innovation platform) on the effects of different prize structures and compensation schemes. Graff Zivin and Lyons (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20211119\"><u>2021</u></a>) ran a field experiment with 184 participants on a software innovation contest with a cash purse of up to $15,000, and found that a winner-takes-all compensation scheme generated more novel innovation relative to a multiple prize scheme that rewarded a greater number of contributors. Hofstetter et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12424\"><u>2017</u></a>) found the same result in an online experiment and an analysis of 260 innovation contests from an innovation platform. However, they also found that when those schemes are compared in successive contests, the winner-takes-all scheme can have a deterrent effect on participants and decrease the effort and innovativeness of those who had received no reward in the first contest. Br\u00fcggeman and Meub (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/A9Z8-7A7U\"><u>2015</u></a>) did a comparison between the prize for the aggregate innovativeness with a prize for the best innovation in a laboratory experiment and found that neither option is unambiguously \u201cbetter\u201d than the other.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe that these findings do not lend to unambiguously recommending a particular compensation scheme. However, depending on whether the prize competition is meant to be a single contest or a series of successive contests, we recommend either a winner-takes-all scheme or a multiple prize scheme.</p><h3>A larger, more diverse pool of competitors is better for high-uncertainty problems</h3><p>We reviewed three studies (one field experiment, and two regression analyses based on online innovation platforms) on the effects of three different competitor characteristics. Boudreau et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1322\"><u>2011</u></a>) ran a regression analysis on 10,000 software competitions from a software competition platform. They found that constraining the number of competitors in a contest increased the effort exerted by participants, but decreased the chance of finding a particularly good solution. However, a larger number of competitors increased overall contest performance for high-uncertainty problems.&nbsp; Jeppesen and Lakhani (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0491\"><u>2010</u></a>) found a positive relationship between problem-solving success and marginality (i.e. being distant from the field of a problem) in a regression analysis of 166 scientific challenges from an online platform with over 12,000 participating scientists. One interpretation of this finding could be that the best way to solve problems is to have experts from vastly different fields attempt solutions. A 10-day field experiment of a software contest with over 500 software developers found that allowing contest participants to self-select into different institutional settings can increase effort and the performance of solutions (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/242V-FT36\"><u>Boudreau &amp; Lakhani, 2011</u></a>).</p><p>We recommend allowing a larger number of prize entrants if the challenge is around a high-uncertainty problem, and vice versa. Moreover, designing the contest such that it attracts a diverse set of participants will probably lead to better outcomes, but we are not sure how to achieve this in practice. We would advise against assigning entrants to specific teams and settings and recommend letting the participants self-select instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1>Limitations and risks of prizes</h1><p><i>[Confidence: We have medium confidence regarding the critical review of prizes from a historical perspective, as our conclusions are largely based on only one researcher\u2019s (Zorina Khan) high-quality body of work. As we are not aware of any other researcher who studied prizes from a historical perspective at a similar level of depth, we think that another 10 hours of research on this topic is unlikely to substantially change our views.]</i></p><h2>Critical review of prizes from a historical perspective</h2><p>Zorina Khan, a professor of economics and a specialist in intellectual property, entrepreneurship, and innovation, has extensively investigated prizes for innovation from a historical perspective. In our impression, she seems to be the most prominent scientist who has voiced skepticism about prizes in numerous instances. In the following, we attempt to summarize her critical perspective on prizes based on her book (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NXK6-GU44\"><u>2020</u></a>), two articles (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007680515001014\"><u>2015</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3386/w23042\"><u>2017</u></a>), and a podcast interview (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4NVX-5BTN\"><u>Hayes, 2021</u></a>), and state our opinions on and takeaways from her reasoning.</p><h3>Patents, not prizes, fueled the rise of the U.S. economy</h3><p>In her podcast interview and book, Khan (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4NVX-5BTN\"><u>Hayes, 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NXK6-GU44\"><u>Khan, 2020</u></a>) discussed how the United States succeeded in overtaking Europe in the 19th century to become the global technology leader in the 20th century. She argued that patents, not prizes, fueled the rise of the U.S. as a global economic power, and she supported her hypothesis in two lines of reasoning. First, she contended that encouraging innovation by awarding prizes is inferior to granting patents. For example, in her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3386/w23042\"><u>2017</u></a> article, in a situation where prizes and patents were substitutes, she observed an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6XSU-Y3SM\"><u>adverse selection</u></a> effect with regards to prizes. That is, inventors who had valuable ideas in the marketplace would bypass the prize system and pursue returns from commercialization (i.e. patents), whereas people with \u201crubbish inventions\u201d would apply for prize awards. Second, she argued that the U.S. patent system, which was the first modern patent system with market-oriented patent policies, was superior to European patent systems and led to the democratization of inventions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoi6bhvt90x\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoi6bhvt90x\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, not all economists share her conclusions. For example, Moser (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3386/w21964\"><u>2016</u></a>, p. 1) challenged the view that patents were the primary driver of innovation.</p><p>Overall, we are not convinced that these arguments provide strong reasons against using prizes. While patents may be superior to prizes in a context where both are substitutes for each other, we don\u2019t think this argument necessarily extends to the modern context, where there are patent systems in all virtually countries and prizes and patents are complements.&nbsp;</p><h3>Prizes can create market distortions</h3><p>Khan (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4NVX-5BTN\"><u>Hayes, 2021</u></a>) also discussed the case when prizes and patents are complements \u2014 that is, when inventors can get both patents and prizes, as is the case today. She explained that this leads to a market distortion because inventors would get overcompensated through what she called \u201caward stacking\u201d: inventors chasing both a prize and a reward in the market. She argued that prizes are monopsonies: the person who is offering the prize is the only buyer. Khan explained a finding from her research that monopsonies can lead to very large social costs, including arbitrary, idiosyncratic outcomes, unjust discrimination, and even corruption. She wrote in her book (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NXK6-GU44\"><u>2020</u></a>, p. 397):&nbsp;</p><p>\u201c<i>Prizes can be effective for private entities who are able to free-ride off the efforts of the entire cohort striving for the award, while only paying for one successful solution; however, social welfare is reduced by the lost resources and investments made by the many losers in the prize competitions. This is especially true if the objective of the competition is highly specific to the grantor and results cannot readily be transferred to other projects. Moreover, the secrecy involved in most prize systems tends to inhibit the diffusion of useful information, especially for outsiders. These net social losses suggest that prize competitions are inappropriate policy instruments for government agencies that should be promoting overall welfare</i>.\u201d</p><p>According to Khan, patents are different because they are market-oriented incentives. This means that if an invention is valuable, the patent is going to be rewarded with profits in the market, while if an invention is useless, they\u2019re going to get nothing, and society also benefits because the patentee discloses all of the information to the public.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrtteh9l9o5q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrtteh9l9o5q\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>More generally, Khan made the point that, whenever possible, the best option is to ensure well-functioning markets exist. For example, Khan voiced skepticism about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/D6GP-B7ES\"><u>Carbon X Prize</u></a>, a currently ongoing $100 million prize that is, according to the X Prize Foundation, the largest prize in history, which is funded by Elon Musk to incentivize innovations for carbon removal (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4NVX-5BTN\"><u>Hayes, 2021</u></a>). She opined that, while the Carbon X Prize attracted a lot of media attention to the problem of excessive carbon emissions, this could have been done much more cheaply.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefug12un6xfmc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnug12un6xfmc\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Khan explained that instead of grand innovation prizes, there is a need to set up mechanisms to ensure correct prices for emissions and there are known ways of doing that (e.g. carbon taxes, futures markets, carbon offset credits). In her view, the best policy would be to auction off carbon rights to forms and facilitate markets for trading in emissions.</p><p>Again, we are not convinced that one can generally conclude that social welfare is reduced by the lost resources and investments made by losers in prize competitions. First of all, there are other benefits to participants and society beyond winning the prize, such as learnings and a potential commercialization of the developments. Moreover, Khan\u2019s lines of reasoning here focus on the case where market-oriented incentives exist and are sufficient to induce innovation. This is not always the case, as there can be market failures for various reasons, such as for medicines for neglected tropical diseases. Our takeaway is that prizes should be avoided in areas where sufficient market-oriented incentives exist to induce innovation.</p><h3>Historical prizes often failed</h3><p>Khan (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007680515001014\"><u>2015</u></a>) surveyed and summarized empirical research using samples drawn from Britain, France, and the United States, including \u201cgreat inventors\u201d and their ordinary counterparts, and prizes at industrial exhibitions. She found that prizes suffered from a number of disadvantages in design and practice, which might be inherent to their non-market orientation. She argued that historical prizes were often much less successful than nowadays often claimed, and current debates about prizes tend to be centered around historical anecdotes and potentially misleading case studies.&nbsp;</p><p>In her analysis of data on early prize-granting institutions in the 18th and 19th centuries, she reviewed a number of frequently cited historical prizes (e.g. the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/99VR-T3WP\"><u>Longitudinal Prize</u></a> from 1714), and explained what lessons this evidence offers for designing effective mechanisms to incentivize innovation. She argued that the majority of organizations specializing in granting prizes for industrial innovations at that time ultimately became disillusioned with this policy, partly due to a lack of market orientation of prizes. This was for numerous reasons. For example, prizes \u201c<i>were not wholly aligned with the economic value of innovations for the individual industry</i>\u201d (p. 18). Moreover, the majority of offered prizes had never been actually granted. There was often a lack of transparency in the judging process, which led to idiosyncratic and inconsistent decisions \u2014 prizes were given out in an arbitrary manner, which reduced the incentives for inventors. Khan added that prizes tended to offer private benefits to both the proposer and the winner, largely because they served as advertisements. Winners of such prize awards were generally unrepresentative of the most significant innovations, partly because the market value of useful inventions was typically far greater than any prize that could be offered. She concluded:&nbsp;</p><p>\u201c<i>This is not to say that administered inducements are never effective, especially in the context of such market failure as occurs in the provision of tropical medicines or vaccines, where significant gaps might exist between private and social returns. However, in distinguishing between the numerous ingenious theoretical prize mechanisms that have been proposed, such transaction costs need to be recognized and incorporated. In particular, governance issues and the potential for rent seeking and corruption should be explicitly addressed, especially in countries where complementary institutions and political control mechanisms are weak or nonexistent. The historical record indicates that the evolution of the institution of innovation prizes over the past three centuries serves as a cautionary tale rather than as a success story</i>\u201d&nbsp; (p. 42).</p><p>Our conclusion from Khan\u2019s reasoning is not that prizes are necessarily a bad idea, but that prizes may fail if not designed and implemented well. Moreover, as she explained, there might be cases where prizes are potentially effective, such as in the provision of tropical medicines, where private returns do not match the social returns and one can therefore not rely on markets to provide sufficient incentives for innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, our takeaways from Khan\u2019s reasoning are that prizes should not be used carelessly and are certainly not a cure-all mechanism. Ensuring well-functioning markets and correct prices, for example for carbon emissions, might be the first-best option. However, if this is not possible or not realistic in a reasonable time frame, prizes might potentially be a good option, which Khan seems to agree with. Moreover, the failures of historical prizes teach us that prizes need to be very carefully designed and implemented to not risk more harm than good.</p><h2>Prizes are associated with risks that can likely be alleviated though design</h2><p><i>[Confidence: We have relatively little confidence regarding the risks of prizes we outline below, as these are largely based on only one review article from the grey literature. It\u2019s possible that another 10 hours of research might bring our attention to more risks than we found so far, though we deem it unlikely that we would find risks problematic enough to prohibit the use of prizes.]</i></p><p>Roberts, Brown and Stott (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/RQ8S-YVMF\"><u>2019</u></a>, p. 21) provided a summary of the risks associated with innovation inducement prizes as identified in the literature. We summarize these in the following and state our opinions.</p><p><strong>Excluding potential participants:</strong> Zhang et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000349\"><u>2015</u></a>) compared the results of an idea award to promote sexual health in China in theory to the more traditional, expert-led method of designing behavior change communications. They noted that idea awards are typically run via online platforms, which risk excluding certain sections of the population. According to Roberts, Brown, and Stott, \u201c<i>for Social Prizes and those where the participation in the prize itself is expected to confer benefits to the participants, who is excluded, becomes important, and especially so in a development context</i>\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/RQ8S-YVMF\"><u>2019</u></a>, p. 21).&nbsp;</p><p>Relatedly, as we explained <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Ma_and_Uzzi__2018_\">here</a>, Ma and Uzzi (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800485115\"><u>2018</u></a>) found that prizes tend to be concentrated within certain groups, and this is especially acute when looking at the number of prizes conferred to women. Women are underrepresented among prizewinners in physics, chemistry, and biology, and those who do win prizes get less money and prestige compared to men (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/V9XH-3S2E\"><u>Ma et al., 2019</u></a>). Moreover, there is evidence of unconscious gender bias in the scientific award process favoring male researchers from Europe and America (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0306312711435830\"><u>Lincoln et al., 2012</u></a>, p. 1).</p><p>Overall, while we believe the evidence that gender biases and the unintentional exclusion of certain participants are a risk in prize competitions and awards, we are not sure and have not seen evidence on whether the risk is larger for prizes compared to other incentive mechanisms, such as grants.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Risks experienced by participants:</strong> The authors cited Acar (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134898\"><u>2015</u></a>) conducted a survey with participants on the InnoCentive.com online platform and mentioned the risk of opportunism, where those that receive the information generated by the prize use it opportunistically. This can, in turn, make inventors fearful of disclosing knowledge. Acar (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134898\"><u>2015</u></a>) described how some participants in science contests experience fear of opportunism, and noted that female and older participants had significantly less fear of disclosing their scientific knowledge.</p><p>We don\u2019t have a clearly formed opinion on this point, but our overall impression is that these issues can be alleviated by taking fear of opportunism into account in the design of prize contests (e.g. via intellectual property protection and compensation structure), as Acar (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134898\"><u>2015</u></a>) suggested in their discussion section.</p><p><strong>Duplicating resources:</strong> Roberts, Brown, and Stott (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/RQ8S-YVMF\"><u>2019</u></a>) argued that the multiplier effect of prizes \u2014 i.e. there being more than one solver \u2014 may have benefits for the funder, but can represent duplicative and potentially wasteful efforts by solvers (citing Lee [<a href=\"https://perma.cc/M42V-SK6V\"><u>2014]</u></a>, who did a legal examination of social innovation). They also argued that the number of solvers can introduce risks in terms of motivation for future prizes, citing Desouza (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3XF6-PS9N\"><u>2012</u></a>), who warned of the risk of reducing the pool of potential future solvers if prize managers fail to communicate effectively with participants after the prize ends, drawing on survey data among U.S. citizens who participated in government innovation inducement prizes.</p><p>We would like to note that this potential demotivating effect of multiple solvers sounds generally plausible to us and has also been found by Boudreau et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1322\"><u>2011</u></a>), as we explained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Number__background__and_sorting_of_competitors\"><u>here</u></a>. Thus, the number of prize entrants is a factor that needs to be considered in the prize design.</p><p><strong>Power imbalance:&nbsp;</strong>Roberts, Brown, and Stott (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/RQ8S-YVMF\"><u>2019</u></a>) cited Eagle (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/BW82-6SY5\"><u>2009</u></a>), an&nbsp; article from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/59DH-HCM4\"><u>social marketing</u></a> (given the similarities between social prizes and community-based behavior change interventions), observing that criticisms of social marketing include being patronizing and manipulative, appealing to people\u2019s base instincts, and extending the power imbalance between the state and individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the cited evidence is from social marketing, we are not sure whether these risks extend to prizes.</p><p>Overall, while we, by and large, find the points raised plausible, we don\u2019t find the evidence behind them very strong and are not sure whether these risks are unique to prizes or hold equally for other incentive mechanisms, like grants. Moreover, we don\u2019t find the risks problematic enough to prohibit the use of prizes, and we suspect that some of these risks can at least partly be alleviated by designing prizes accordingly (e.g. addressing fears of opportunism).</p><h1>List of recent large prizes</h1><p>We provide a list of large innovation inducement prizes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zzxz-TFSZtLmFByunAnsRuqqKHtoG6ZU9D8tqxZ5hMw/edit\"><u>here</u></a> that includes information on a few key features, such as the numbers of entrants, mobilized private capital, and some information about the winners.

In this section, we therefore complement the empirical evidence discussed in the previous sections with the findings of two case studies of modern, large-scale prizes. We focus on two examples of the X Prize: the Google Lunar X Prize, and the Auto X Prize. According to Murray et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.06.013\"><u>2012</u></a>, p. 4), the X Prize can be assumed typical of contemporary Grand Innovation Prizes<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmmzjvyf465j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmmzjvyf465j\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;in design and implementation, as the approach developed by the X Prize Foundation is emerging as a canonical design and prizes in the X Prize \u201ctradition\u201d seem increasingly common. Each of the X Prizes share a similar architecture, scale, and scope.</p><p>A caveat to these case studies is that there has been no unified framework or clear approach within which to evaluate prizes and undertake comparative analysis (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.06.013\"><u>Murray et al., 2012</u></a>, p. 3). Thus, it is difficult to systematically evaluate the performance of different prizes and to summarize and compare the findings of different case studies.</p><h2>Google Lunar X Prize</h2><p>By far the most comprehensive case study on modern prizes we found was done as a public policy dissertation project by Kay (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>2011</u></a>). Kay (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>2011</u></a>) used an empirical, multiple-case-study methodology to investigate a main case study \u2014 the Google Lunar X Prize (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Appendix_4___Descriptions_of_Google_Lunar_X_Prize_and_Auto_X_Prize\"><u>Appendix 4</u></a> for a more detailed description of the Google Lunar X Prize) \u2014 and two pilot cases: the Ansari X Prize and the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge. He then examined four main aspects of these prizes: the motivations of prize entrants, the organization of prize R&amp;D activities, the prize technologies, and the impact of prizes on technological innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>The study used different sources of data, such as direct observation, on-site interviews, questionnaires, and document analysis. Kay (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>2011</u></a>) triangulated the different data sources with equal weighting for data collected through different methods. We would like to note that we were only able to read a fraction of his almost 400-page-long dissertation, which is very rich and comprehensive. Thus, it is possible that we missed some potentially important and interesting aspects of his analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>We summarize his results and conclusions in the following (see Kay [<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>2011</u></a>, pp. 263-264] for a nice overview of the research questions, hypotheses, variables of interests, results, and conclusions in a table format).</p><ul><li><strong>Motivations of prize entrants:</strong>&nbsp;<br>The prizes attracted diverse entrants, including unconventional ones, such as individuals and organizations that were generally uninvolved with the prize technologies. Participants were primarily drawn to the non-monetary benefits of prizes (e.g. visibility, prestige, opportunity to participate in technology development) and the potential market value of the prize technologies. The author found that the monetary reward was less important to participants relative to other incentives. However, it was still important to propagate the idea of the prize. Interestingly, the prizes attracted many more people apart from the participants, such as volunteers and partners, who contributed indirectly to the prize and supported official participants.</li><li><strong>Organization of prize R&amp;D activities:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Prizes could increase R&amp;D activity and redirect ongoing industry projects to target diverse technological goals. However, he concluded that the development of prize competitions was difficult to predict. The organization of prize R&amp;D activities and participants\u2019 effort depended on the participants\u2019 characteristics (e.g. goals, skills, resources), and could not be directly influenced by a specific competition design. He found interactions between R&amp;D and fundraising activities, which might, in some circumstances, divert the participants\u2019 efforts away from technological development.</li><li><strong>Prize technologies:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Prizes could selectively target technologies at different maturity levels (e.g. experimental research, incremental developments, commercialization). However, the quality of the innovation output was difficult to predict.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Effect of prizes on technological innovation:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Prizes could spur innovation beyond what would have happened in their absence. However, the effect of prizes depended highly on the prize entrants\u2019 characteristics and the evolution of the prize competition\u2019s overall context, such as whether the business context is favorable. He found the impact on innovation to be larger for larger prize incentives, more significant technology gaps, and sufficiently open-ended challenge definitions to allow for unconventional approaches. Moreover, he concluded that prizes cannot induce, but only enable technological breakthroughs, and they may require complementary incentives (e.g. commitments to purchase inventions) or support (e.g. seed funding).</li></ul><p>Kay (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>2011</u></a>) also concluded that prizes are particularly appropriate to, for example (the prizes in parentheses are from Table 8.3 on p. 279):</p><ul><li>Explore new, experimental methods that involve high-risk R&amp;D (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VQX4-C4TV\"><u>Food Preservation Prize</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/34N3-WLU9\"><u>Longitude Prize</u></a>)</li><li>Develop technology to break critical technological barriers (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QTM9-HG3R\"><u>Ansari X Prize</u></a>)</li><li>Improve technology to achieve higher performance standards (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/27PC-7S75\"><u>Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7Q7C-C8WS\"><u>DARPA Challenges</u></a>)</li><li>Stimulate the diffusion, adoption, and/or commercialization of technologies (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/ET8N-F63L\"><u>Google Lunar X Prize</u></a>)</li></ul><p>Furthermore, according to Kay (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>2011</u></a>, p. 293f), prizes can selectively focus on specific technologies, and target certain innovators and geographic areas. They can also leverage significant amounts of funding. Relative to other incentive mechanisms (e.g. grants), prizes involve higher programmatic risks, as their outputs are difficult to predict. The incentive power of prizes depends on their uniqueness \u2014 that is, a prize in a context with many rival prizes has less incentive power than a similar prize that is held in a context without equivalent (or any) competing prizes. A successful prize design depends on many parameters.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgksucssvdkk\"><sup><a href=\"#fngksucssvdkk\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Auto X Prize</h2><p>In this section, we summarize the findings of a case study of the Auto X Prize, conducted by Murray et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.06.013\"><u>2012</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1yssocf7wd2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1yssocf7wd2\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Appendix_4___Descriptions_of_Google_Lunar_X_Prize_and_Auto_X_Prize\"><u>Appendix 4</u></a> for more detailed background information on the Auto X Prize. Murray et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.06.013\"><u>2012</u></a>) provided a systematic examination of a recent Grand Innovation Prize (GIP): the Auto X Prize. To do so, the authors defined three dimensions for GIP evaluation: objectives, design (including ex ante specifications, ex ante incentives, qualification rules, and award governance), and performance. They compared observations from three domains within this framework: empirics, theory, and policy. Their analysis is based on a combination of various data sources: direct observation, interviews, surveys, and extant theory and policy documents.</p><p>The authors concluded that the empirical reality of the Auto X Prize deviated substantially from the ideal form of a prize, as described in the theoretical economic literature and advocated in policy-making documents. We find this unsurprising but interesting, as it shows that the theoretical research on prizes done so far is of limited usefulness in understanding modern prizes implemented in practice.</p><p>They found the contrasts to be particularly strong with respect to four areas. We copy these points here (p. 13):</p><ol><li><i>\u201cContrary to the dominant theoretical perspective,</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefujrck8wkbcm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnujrck8wkbcm\">[15]</a></sup></span><i>&nbsp;which assumes GIPs have a single, ultimate objective \u2013 to promote innovative effort \u2013 we find that GIPs blend a myriad of complex goals, including attention, education, awareness, credibility and demonstrating the viability of alternatives. Paradoxically, our results suggest that prizes can be successful even when they do not yield a \u201cwinner\u201d by traditional standards. Conversely, prizes in which a winner is identified and a prize awarded may still fail to achieve some of their most important design objectives.&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>We find the types of problems that provide the target for GIPs are not easily specified in terms of a single, universal technical goal or metric.</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc7v456se6p8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc7v456se6p8\">[16]</a></sup></span><i>&nbsp;The reality is not nearly as clear or simple as either theorists or advocates have assumed. The complex nature of the mission (e.g., a highly energy efficient vehicle that is both safe to drive and can be manufactured economically), and the systemic nature of the innovations required to solve the stated problem, requires that multiple dimensions of performance be assessed. Some of these dimensions can neither be quantified nor anticipated, while others may change as the competition unfolds. Common metrics used today (e.g., miles per gallon) may be driven by current technical choices (i.e., gasoline engines), and translating them to work for new approaches (e.g., hydrogen fuel cells) may not be easily achieved. If done poorly, this will bias competitions in favor of certain technical choices and away from others. [The Auto X Prize] demonstrates that contemporary GIPs are complex departures from smaller prizes examined by prior researchers, where the competitions involved individuals vying to solve relatively narrow problems (e.g., Lakhani et al., 2007). In those studies, the objective functions for solution providers are much more easily specified, as are the accompanying test procedures and mechanisms for governing and managing the process.</i>&nbsp;</li><li><i>We find a clear divergence between theoretical treatments of the incentive effect of a prize purse and the reality of why participants compete. Critically, there are a variety of non-prize incentives that are just as (if not more) salient to participants, many of which can be realized regardless of whether a team \u201cwins\u201d or not. Some of these broader incentives \u2013 publicity, attention, credibility, access to funds and testing facilities \u2013 are financial in nature, but not captured by the size of the purse. Others \u2013 such as community building \u2013 are social in nature and are difficult to measure in terms of the utility they generate for participants. Prior work has tended to view situations where prize participants collectively \u201cspend\u201d substantially more than the prize purse (i.e., in terms of resources) as evidence that prizes are inefficient in terms of inducing the correct allocation of inventive effort. Our observations however, provide an alternative explanation for why this may not be the case. Participants might, in fact, be responding rationally to a broader range of incentives than has been assumed in prior work.</i></li><li><i>Our work highlights the critical and underappreciated role of prize governance and management, a topic that is notably absent in the theoretical literature. We find that the mechanisms for governance and management must be designed explicitly to suit the particular prize being developed, a costly and time-consuming activity. Furthermore, given the difficulties in specifying ex ante all that can happen, rule modifications and adaptations along the way are to be expected, and these must be handled in a way that respects the rights and opinions of those participants who are already committed to the effort.\u201d</i></li></ol><p>The authors concluded that,<i>&nbsp;</i>\u201c<i>our results suggest that GIPS cannot be viewed as a simple incentive mechanism through which governments and others stimulate innovation where markets have failed. Rather they are best viewed as a novel type of organization, where a complex array of incentives are considered and managed in order to assure that successful innovation occurs.</i>\u201d</p><h1>A brief review of two related concepts to prizes</h1><p>In the following, we briefly review two relatively novel concepts related to prizes that have recently gained momentum in the global health and development space. First, we review&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Advance_market_commitments__AMCs__have_a_lot_of_potential_for_impact_and_current_critiques_and_issues_may_be_resolved_with_more_research_and_experience\"><u>advance market commitments (AMCs)</u></a> with a case study on the pneumococcal pilot AMC and a discussion of its critiques. Second, we briefly review the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Grand_Challenges_are_conceptually_closer_to_grants_than_to_prizes__with_a_focus_on_fostering_innovation_and_R_D_capacity_in_low__and_middle_income_countries\"><u>Grand Challenges</u></a> launched by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><h2>Advance market commitments (AMCs) have a lot of potential for impact and current critiques and issues may be resolved with more research and experience</h2><p><i>[Confidence: We have medium confidence in our conclusions regarding AMCs, which are predominantly based on a case study of the pilot pneumococcal AMC and a conversation with one expert. Given that AMCs have received limited attention in the scientific and grey literature so far, we believe that a further review of the literature is unlikely to change our views. However, conversations with other experts might change our conclusions.]</i></p><h3>Brief introduction to AMCs</h3><p>The idea of advance market commitments is to provide money to guarantee a market for a product. AMCs were first proposed by economics professor Michael Kremer (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/597W-NDVQ\"><u>2000a</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/GEM7-RAFY\"><u>2000b</u></a>) and gained additional momentum when a report by the Center for Global Development (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y8ZL-NNMR\"><u>Levine et al., 2005</u></a>) expanded on Kremer\u2019s ideas and introduced the concept of the AMC as a financial mechanism that could encourage the production and development of affordable vaccines tailored to the needs of developing countries.&nbsp;</p><p>AMCs aim to address two failings of global health markets: First, pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to develop medicines for diseases that are more prevalent in low-income countries due to the low purchasing power of those who are most affected. Thus, private R&amp;D investments into neglected diseases are much lower than the socially desirable levels (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/E7HL-F3A4\"><u>Kremer &amp; Glennerster, 2004</u></a>). Second, once developed, medicines often reach low-income countries much later after their introduction in high-income countries, which leaves many people in poorer countries untreated or unvaccinated despite the existence of products to prevent deaths (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3MV-4VDV\"><u>MSF, 2020</u></a>, p. 3).&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of vaccines, AMC donors pledge that if a firm develops a specified new vaccine and sets the price close to manufacturing cost, they will \u201ctop up\u201d the price by a certain amount per dose. This top-up payment strengthens firms\u2019 incentives by increasing the profitability of serving those markets. Moreover, the AMC\u2019s price cap ensures that the vaccine remains affordable for people in poverty (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/XXR5-VCK6\"><u>Scherer, 2020</u></a>).</p><p>The first AMC was piloted in 2007 to purchase pneumococcal vaccines, which we detail in the next section. Christopher Snyder, an economics professor who researches AMCs mentioned to us in a conversation that it is difficult to know exactly how many proposals and ongoing AMCs there are, as some are technically not AMCs, but used the term for branding purposes (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/2X9C-2FBA\"><u>COVAX AMC</u></a>), while others are a mix between different mechanisms of push and pull finding (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9WX5-TF9V\"><u>carbon removal AMC</u></a>). We provide some examples of proposed and ongoing AMCs and related mechanisms:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>In 2020, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/R6QU-AGQQ\"><u>COVAX AMC</u></a> was launched to make donor-funded doses of Covid-19 vaccines available to LMICs.

At the time, the World Health Organization estimated that pneumococcus killed more than 700,000 children under five in developing countries per year (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3RD4-2F7T\"><u>WHO, 2007</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>According to Kremer et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>2020</u></a>, p. 270), \u201cthe design called for firms to compete for 10-year supply contracts capping the price at $3.50 per dose. A firm committing to supply X million annual doses (X/200 of the projected 200 million annual need) would secure an X/200 share of the $1.5 billion AMC fund, paid out as a per-dose subsidy for initial purchases. The AMC covered the 73 countries below the income threshold for Gavi eligibility. Country co-payments were set according to standard Gavi rules.\u201d</p><p><strong>Program outcomes</strong></p><p>According to Kremer et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>2020</u></a>), by 2016, PCV was distributed in 60 of the 73 eligible countries, with doses sufficient to immunize over 50 million children annually. As Figure 4 below shows, by 2018, nearly half of the target child population in Gavi countries was covered, slightly surpassing the coverage rate in non-Gavi countries.</p><p><i>Figure 4 - PCV coverage in Gavi countries relative to non-Gavi countries (</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><i><u>Kremer et al., 2020</u></i></a><i>, online appendix)</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/i4aoo6clpouwr7isxudo\"></p><p>According to estimates from Tasslimi et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inhe.2011.08.003\"><u>2011</u></a>), which we did not have time to review, the PCV rollout has been highly cost-effective. At initial program prices, the PCV rollout averted a DALY at $83. According to Kremer et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>2020</u></a>), evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PCV does not prove the cost-effectiveness of the overall AMC because of a lack of a valid counterfactual. However, they argue that the high cost-effectiveness of the PCV implies that the AMC would have been worthwhile were there even a small chance that it sped up PCV adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>While it is impossible to know for sure whether the AMC sped up PCV adoption, Kremer et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>2020</u></a>, p. 5) compared the PCV adoption with the rotavirus vaccine adoption as an approximate counterfactual.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnh3u28p03v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnh3u28p03v\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The authors claimed that according to Figure 5 below, the rate of vaccine coverage in Gavi countries converged to the global rate almost five years faster for PCV than for the rotavirus vaccine. They calculated that had PCV coverage increased at the same rate as the rotavirus vaccine (i.e. slower), over 12 million DALYs would have been lost. Thus, to the extent that we can consider the rotavirus vaccine a reasonable counterfactual (which we did not have time to investigate), we can estimate the number of DALYs averted by the PCV AMC as 12 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>Figure 5 - Coverage for vaccines rolled out with and without an AMC (</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><i><u>Kremer et al., 2020</u></i></a><i>, online appendix)</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/vl9eg8xxffrlekdq0yqj\"></p><h3>When should AMCs be used?</h3><p>According to Sigurdson (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>2021</u></a>, p. 8), while prizes may work well for solving challenges in which innovations can be easily decoupled from implementation, in scenarios where implementation is as or more important than the innovation itself (e.g. vaccine delivery), other mechanisms such as AMCs may be more suitable to incentivize a desired solution.</p><p>An independent process and design evaluation report commissioned by Gavi (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7N43-HXR2\"><u>Chau et al., 2013</u></a>, p. 81) laid out a few steps to follow in order to determine whether an AMC or a different type of program is appropriate. We provide a copy in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Appendix_5___Steps_to_decide_whether_an_AMC_is_appropriate\"><u>Appendix 5</u></a>. Although the report provides some important points for consideration (e.g. the level of market maturity and the type of market failure), it does not give very concrete guidelines for the choice.</p><p>In a conversation with Snyder, he explained that the incentives of an AMC may not align with the best outcome in all contexts. He gave the example of Ebola vaccines, where, in his view, inducement prizes with a fixed payment are better than AMCs tied to sales. He explained that if local vaccinations in an emergent outbreak are very effective, the epidemic is quelled before many units of a vaccine get sold. This limits how lucrative the AMC can be and provides perverse incentives (i.e. a highly performing vaccine that stopped the outbreak very early would be rewarded less than a poorer performing drug). In his view, a more appropriate model in this case would be rewarding firms for the social benefit gained or harm averted as a result of their product.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpd7cr59pim\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpd7cr59pim\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Snyder makes this point in a working paper in which he and colleagues designed the optimal mechanism for diseases like Ebola and Covid-19 (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Q5JX-T57L\"><u>Snyder, Hoyt, &amp; Douglas, 2022</u></a>).</p><p><br>&nbsp;This approach also comes with drawbacks, as it may be hard to come to a consensus on how much harm averted is strictly attributable to the funded product.</p><h3>Discussion of critiques of AMCs</h3><p>We found several critiques of different aspects of AMCs, relating to both the AMC concept in general and to the pneumococcal pilot AMC specifically. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3MV-4VDV\"><u>2020 report</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreferj5ctog6a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnerj5ctog6a\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;published by M\u00e9d\u00e9cins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) provided a critical analysis and lessons learned of the pilot AMC and its impact on access to pneumonia vaccines for populations in need. Others found theoretical flaws in the AMC concept (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.2009.033092\"><u>Sonderholm, 2009</u></a>), or criticized high program costs (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9LZ9-PS4M\"><u>Light, 2005</u></a>). In this section, we list and explain some of these critiques and provide a brief discussion.</p><p><strong>R&amp;D not accelerated</strong></p><p>According to MSF (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3MV-4VDV\"><u>2020</u></a>, p. 1), \u201c<i>the AMC was flawed from the outset in its selection of pneumococcal disease, which already had a vaccine on the market, since 2000. PCV was virtually inaccessible to developing countries due to its high price, not because of a lack of R&amp;D. The selection of a disease with an existing vaccine provided little, if any, incentive for accelerating R&amp;D timelines of other manufacturers who had already begun development prior to the AMC inception.</i>\u201d</p><p>We discussed this point with Christopher Snyder. He explained that while it is technically true that the pilot AMC did not speed up R&amp;D, this was actually a deliberate design feature of this particular AMC. He explained that while the AMC concept was first proposed with a technologically distant target in mind, particularly to encourage research on vaccines such as malaria (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/E7HL-F3A4\"><u>Kremer &amp; Glennerster, 2004</u></a>), the concept was later expanded to also encompass technologically close targets in a Center for Global Development working group report (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y8ZL-NNMR\"><u>Levine et al., 2005</u></a>). For a vaccine that is further in its R&amp;D process, the challenge switches from incentivizing R&amp;D to incentivizing adequate capacity (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>Kremer et al., 2020</u></a>, p. 1), which is very expensive and requires a substantial investment, even after the R&amp;D process is completed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz2n6bia4f3d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz2n6bia4f3d\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Technologically distant and close targets require different AMC designs. In our understanding, the AMC concept has not been tested for a technologically distant target yet, as originally envisioned for a malaria vaccine.</p><p><strong>High program costs</strong></p><p>There have been some concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the AMC. For example, according to Donald Light, a health policy researcher, the estimated cost per child saved under the PCV AMC was $4,722, whereas programs extending vaccines for diseases (such as polio, measles, and yellow fever) to children who don\u2019t receive them would save more lives at a lower cost. Light mentioned multidrug package interventions for neglected tropical disease interventions that cost about 40 cents per person per year (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/K2YN-6LSJ\"><u>Scudellari, 2011</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9LZ9-PS4M\"><u>Light, 2005</u></a>). We haven\u2019t been able to find the direct source of this cost-effectiveness estimate and we don\u2019t know how it was calculated.</p><p>According to MSF (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3MV-4VDV\"><u>2020</u></a>, p. 2), \u201c<i>a lack of transparency on costs, capacity, and pricing decisions fed criticism that the AMC acted as a vehicle for private companies to make unnecessarily high profits at the expense of broader vaccine access. The AMC design team lacked critical information and sufficient expertise to appropriately negotiate the original price per dose. If more data from the manufacturers on the costs of production and capacity scale-up had been forthcoming, and if more experts with economic or vaccine-industry experience had been involved, the initial price ceiling of $3.50 per dose might have been lower but still sufficient to incentivize manufacturers to participate in the AMC. [...] PCV remains one of the most expensive among the 12 vaccines supported by Gavi</i>.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>We mentioned this critique to Snyder, who responded that he agrees that, for example, the polio vaccine at a couple of cents per dose is much more cost-effective than the pneumococcal AMC. However, he cautioned that average and marginal cost-effectiveness should not be confused, stating that polio might be better on average, but the pneumococcal AMC might still be worth funding on the margin. He also argued that the option value of learning should be factored into the benefits of the program, though acknowledged this benefit has diminishing returns.</p><p>Moreover, Snyder explained the difficulties in setting the right price due to information asymmetries<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflrja7duyzb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlrja7duyzb\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;between firms and AMC funders. AMC designers do not know the manufacturers\u2019 reservation price for installing capacity to supply vaccines. As AMC designers have an asymmetric loss function in setting firm prices (that is, offering firms less than their reservation price risks children not receiving vaccines, which is very costly relative to what donors can save by paying firms somewhat less), maximizing social welfare under uncertainty requires paying firms more than the expected cost of the vaccine (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>Kremer et al., 2020</u></a>, p. 3).&nbsp;</p><p>Kremer et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>2020</u></a>, p. 3) (coauthored by Snyder) wrote, \u201c<i>While some activists have argued that the $3.50 paid per dose exceeds manufacturing costs, the relevant issue for AMC designers is not manufacturing costs but firms\u2019 reservation values. Their reservation values may substantially exceed manufacturing costs for several reasons: the AMC top up may not fully defray their capacity costs, or they may fear that offering a low AMC price would lead higher-income countries to press for price reductions. While these factors imply ex ante optimal prices will exceed expected production costs, the facts that both firms participated even though one likely had substantially higher manufacturing costs and that both continued to participate at $2.90 per dose suggests that at least one firm would likely have participated at a lower price. Still, prices for PCV are much lower under the AMC than outside it. Currently, lower-income countries in the Americas pay $12 or more per dose (WHO 2019); the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pay $137 (CDC 2019). As we show in Figure 3 in the online Appendix, the percentage discount GAVI receives compared to various global price measures is deeper for PCV than for almost any other vaccine.</i>\u201d</p><p><strong>No incentive for technology transfer to developing country manufacturers</strong></p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3MV-4VDV\"><u>MSF (2020)</u></a>, \u201c<i>no incentive or plan for PCV technology transfer to developing-country manufacturers was included in the design of the AMC. The AMC has yet to prove that it can serve as a model for encouraging long-term, sustainable vaccine production.</i>\u201d</p><p>Our understanding from talking to Snyder is that the pilot AMC was not explicitly designed for a PCV technology transfer to developing country manufacturers, but first and foremost to establish an adequate supply capacity. In response to this critique point, Snyder explained that so far there is no evidence of the existing PCV supply capacity being withdrawn. Once a firm establishes the vaccine capacity, there is little reason to pull out. &nbsp; Moreover, the pilot suggests that the prices went down over time (to $2.90) due to public pressures for the manufacturers. In fact, in 2019, a vaccine developed by the Serum Institute of India qualified for the AMC program, pricing its vaccine at $2 per dose for low-income countries (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>Kremer et al., 2020</u></a>, p. 2).</p><p><strong>Low competition among manufacturers</strong></p><p>MSF (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3MV-4VDV\"><u>2020</u></a>, p. 2) wrote that, \u201c<i>While the funding was intended to help encourage competition to reduce the overall price of PCV, in reality the bulk of the money essentially served as a subsidy for Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which until December 2019 were the only two manufacturers of PCV. Of the $1.5 billion, $1.238 billion (82%) was disbursed to Pfizer and GSK. In 2020, a third PCV manufacturer, and the first in a developing country, the Serum Institute of India, was finally awarded a portion of the funding at $75 million (5%).</i>\u201d</p><p>According to Kremer et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>2020</u></a>), there is a tradeoff regarding the number of firms funded by the AMC. They wrote (p. 4), \u201c<i>A key issue for future AMCs will be whether to split the AMC among multiple suppliers and reserve tenders for future entrants, as did the pilot pneumococcus AMC, or to concentrate incentives on a single supplier, as envisioned in Kremer and Glennerster (2004). Sponsors of the AMC pilot prioritized entry of multiple vaccines because they saw competition as essential for holding down long-run prices and avoiding supply interruptions. Kremer and Glennerster (2004) prioritized the development of a vaccine where none currently existed, relying on the price cap, to which the firm agrees to access AMC funds, to keep prices near marginal cost over the long term. [...] For distant technological targets, incentivizing a sequence of entrants reduces incentives for the first vaccine to enter. Thus, structuring a program to incentivize multiple entrants may substantially increase total costs. On the other hand, the design and enforcement of long-term contracts that hold prices close to marginal cost and assure consistent supply through penalty clauses for supply interruptions may be difficult.</i>\u201d</p><p>Overall, we think that MSF (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3MV-4VDV\"><u>2020</u></a>) raised a fair critique that competition was low for the pilot AMC. However, our impression is that the decision whether to incentivize only one or multiple suppliers is a deliberate design choice that involves trade-offs which need to be carefully considered, e.g. the cost and the importance of avoiding supply interruptions. Thus, we don\u2019t think that a low competition among manufacturers is a natural consequence of an AMC, but can be prevented by designing the AMC accordingly.</p><p><strong>Supply shortages</strong></p><p>According to MSF (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3MV-4VDV\"><u>2020</u></a>), \u201c<i>Supply capacity of existing manufacturers did not meet full PCV demand: During AMC implementation, demand at times exceeded supply despite the large subsidies given to the manufacturers to scale up production capacity. Pfizer and GSK were conservative in expanding their production capacity to only fulfill the number of doses stipulated in supply agreements, but these agreements were based on initial forecasts that were lower than the actual demand. This resulted in supply shortages of up to 29 million doses from 2012 to 2014, delaying 23 country introductions, and leading to an estimated 26 million children born without access to PCV.</i>\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, we haven\u2019t been able to discuss this critique with Snyder or any other expert. Thus, we do not know to what extent this supply issue was really problematic and could have been resolved.</p><p><strong>Ethical dilemma resulting from a theoretical flaw of AMCs&nbsp;</strong></p><p>According to Sonderholm (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.2009.033092\"><u>2009</u></a>, p. 2), the AMC concept has a theoretical flaw, in that there is an ethical dilemma that arises from respecting developing countries\u2019 preferences for culturally acceptable but less effective vaccines. He described a scenario in which several products have been licensed under an AMC scheme with one product being significantly medically superior to the other one. He stated that it is not obvious that governments of developing countries will always choose the medically superior product, even if priced at a level identical to that of inferior ones, explaining that the medically superior product might have side effects that are culturally offensive in certain countries. According to Sonderholm (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.2009.033092\"><u>2009</u></a>), \u201c<i>from the point of view of CGD, it is a suboptimal outcome if the best available medicines are not the ones that are purchased. [...] For example, if a vaccine generated side effects that were medically harmless but culturally unacceptable, there might be an unwillingness to use the vaccine. Because an AMC scheme is demand driven, it compels the donors to fund the purchase of medically inferior products when it is such products that are in demand by developing world governments. This theoretical feature of an AMC scheme is an unattractive one that should make policy-makers and donors hesitant about signing up to it.</i>\u201d</p><p>Though Sonderholm\u2019s (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.2009.033092\"><u>2009</u></a>) critique has been mentioned by Kremer et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20201017\"><u>2020</u></a>, p. 3), we have not come across any explicit reactions to it. We have not been able to discuss this critique with Snyder.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>AMCs are still a fairly novel concept and there has so far been pretty limited empirical evidence, which mainly comes from the pilot pneumococcal AMC. All in all, we think that the results of the pilot AMC are quite promising in that it arguably sped up PCV adoption (by about five years if one uses the rotavirus vaccine as a very rough counterfactual). Moreover, the use of AMCs in the context of Covid-19 vaccines and carbon removal has been advocated for by some highly renowned economists whose judgment we trust.</p><p>A major limitation of the pilot AMC is that it focused deliberately on a technologically close target where the R&amp;D process had already been completed (thus mainly incentivizing the establishment of supply capacity), not on a distant target as originally envisioned. Thus, it still remains to be tested whether AMCs can be effective tools to incentivize R&amp;D activity, such as in the case of malaria vaccines.</p><p>AMCs have also been subject to some criticism, most notably that its cost-effectiveness is comparatively low. According to the only cost-effectiveness estimate we found on the pilot AMC, the cost per child saved under the AMC was $4,722, which is more expensive than extending existing vaccines for diseases like polio, measles, and yellow fever. We also found a cost-effectiveness estimate of the PCV rollout at $83 per DALY, but it is unclear how to translate this into a cost-effectiveness of the AMC due to a lack of a valid counterfactual. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness may differ for other outcomes and likely depends on whether the focus is on a technologically distant or close target (as this affects the information asymmetry and thus pricing decisions).</p><p>Whether or not AMCs are an appropriate tool in a specific case depends on the level of market maturity and the type of market failure, but we have not encountered very concrete rules on when AMCs should be used. It may be that we missed some literature on this or that it hasn\u2019t been written down clearly yet, but we expect that those involved in the development of the AMC concept (e.g. Michael Kremer, Jonathan Levin, Christopher Snyder, and the Center for Global Development working group on AMCs) can provide valuable support for this decision.</p><p>All in all, we believe that AMCs have a lot of potential. We think it\u2019s plausible to assume that many critiques and issues can be at least partially resolved with more research and experience, as the research is still at a nascent stage. One avenue of research we deem promising is to test AMCs in the context of technologically distant targets to know whether they can also be used to incentivize R&amp;D, as originally conceived. We recommend investigating AMCs further, or at least keeping it on the back burner for further consideration in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2>Grand Challenges are conceptually closer to grants than to prizes, with a focus on fostering innovation and R&amp;D capacity in low- and middle-income countries</h2><p><i>[Confidence: We have little confidence in our brief review of Grand Challenges, as we came across this concept at a late stage of this report and only had time for superficial reading of the Grand Challenges website. We expect that any additional hour of research, especially reviewing third party accounts and publications related to Grand Challenges, might alter our conclusions.]</i></p><p>Grand Challenges, \u201c<i>a family of initiatives fostering innovation to solve key global health and development problems</i>\u201d were launched by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in 2003 (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/8YQG-4T9T\"><u>Grand Challenges website</u></a>). The Grand Challenges model was initially created to \u201c<i>drive innovation and test novel solutions for health problems that disproportionately affect the world's poor</i>\u201d and to fund \u201c<i>high-risk, potentially high-reward concepts</i>\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9R4Q-KV2D\"><u>Mundel, 2014</u></a>). The set of initiatives defines challenges as as an \u201c<i>open request for grant proposals\u201d</i> and has awarded more than 3,400 grants in over 110 countries (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/KEQ8-7QAE\"><u>Grand Challenges Fact Sheet, 2021</u></a>)<i>.&nbsp;</i>The first initiative was called Grand Challenges in Global Health and was followed by the launch of various other initiatives, such as Grand Challenges Explorations, Grand Challenges India, and Grand Challenges for Development (ibid).&nbsp;</p><p>Grand Challenges share some similarities with inducement prizes, but also have a few key differences. While most inducement prizes have a clearly defined output, Grand Challenges have a much more open-ended and vague criteria.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmu0vy7bm74\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmu0vy7bm74\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The grants are typically large, ranging from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/H9S5-QNYF\"><u>$100,000</u></a> to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Z9VJ-WJRJ\"><u>$1 million</u></a>, with lower amounts for proof-of-concept, and \u201c<i>clear stage gates for scaling</i>\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/GWR6-VCRK\"><u>Singer, 2014</u></a>). Unlike most grants, Grand Challenges grants are, in at least some cases, awarded based on the outcome and not only on the proposal. For example, whether follow-up funding is granted can depend on the success of a project (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/XXV2-L9L6\"><u>here</u></a>). There is usually an explicit requirement or recommendation that the programs are run by, or in conjunction with,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/CBT9-KA7S\"><u>local institutions</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6ZLX-HYCN\"><u>involve lead investigators from the relevant context</u></a>.</p><p>To get a sense of the impact and cost-effectiveness of Grand Challenges, we briefly reviewed a Gates Foundation blog post describing how they measure the value of Grand Challenges (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/K76F-FVLC\"><u>Buchsbaum, 2014</u></a>). Due to a long time span until the impacts of Grand Challenges materialize, they do not measure the impact in terms of improved or saved lives. Instead, they use a return on investment (ROI) framework as a proxy, combining four different metrics (see Figure 6 below). We describe those four metrics in the following.</p><p><i>Figure 6 - Framework for an intermediate evaluation of the return on investment (ROI) for Grand Challenges (</i><a href=\"https://perma.cc/K76F-FVLC\"><i><u>Buchsbaum, 2014</u></i></a><i>)</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/bhhe7q1ibrz4g8ljipmj\"></p><p><strong>1. Projects Transitioned to Development:&nbsp;</strong>The Gates Foundation defines the main metric of success as \u201c<i>identifying new investment opportunities that ultimately result in lives saved.</i>\u201d It is unclear whether they delineate between projects that result in lives saved at a cost of $1,000 per DALY (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/KNL7-2G9E\"><u>disability-adjusted life year</u></a>) or projects that result in lives saved at a cost of $100 per DALY. They also look into whether projects have achieved a proof-of-concept stage and aim to increase investments in order to take it towards development. Notably, they mentioned there were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/UKJ5-LDBW\"><u>projects</u></a> that responded well to the challenge call but subsequently faced other challenges (such as regulatory or commercial barriers), and were unable to transition to development as a result. This emphasizes the need for challenges to take into account all aspects of the paths to development, and not just the technical solutions to a problem. In the case of other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6XSA-Y3R\"><u>projects</u></a> that did not result in an adequate solution, the scientific advancements and knowledge gained may be helpful for future research and innovation efforts.</p><p><strong>2. Strategic Learning and Landscaping:&nbsp;</strong>According to&nbsp;Buchsbaum (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/K76F-FVLC\"><u>2014</u></a>), this metric includes all of the learnings from \u201c<i>extensive consultation with experts</i>\u201d and learning from the various submissions from innovators. These have apparently helped shape and guide the foundation\u2019s thinking and design of future initiatives. The blog post does not explain how exactly this is measured.</p><p><strong>3. Increased Funding for Innovation:</strong> According to Buchsbaum (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/K76F-FVLC\"><u>2014</u></a>), the Grand Challenges provides an \u201c<i>attractive platform for building co-funding partnerships and providing new funders a mechanism to increase their portfolios of solution focused investments.</i>\u201d Buchsbaum (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/K76F-FVLC\"><u>2014</u></a>) explained that there is evidence for the indirect increase in funding for innovations against challenge problem statements. He hypothesized that posting a challenge inspires scientists to develop new ideas and obtain funding even if they are not selected for funding by Grand Challenges. To test this hypothesis, the Grand Challenges team surveyed declined applicants (~97% of all ideas submitted) and found that 43% of respondents suggested that the idea they submitted was \u201c<i>a new idea formulated in response to the challenge topic</i>\u201d<i>,</i> and 8% of respondents were able to obtain funding from other sources. Grand Challenges believes this represents, although indirect, \u201c<i>an important source of funding leverage for new ideas against challenge calls.</i>\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is, at least to us, unclear whether the winning applicants were also \u201cnew ideas,\u201d and to what extent there might be overlap between the new ideas and those that were able to find other funding. While this is evidence suggesting the challenges contributed to additional innovation, the extent to which this is indeed an \u201c<i>important source of funding leverage</i>\u201d is, in our view, less clear and depends on other variables that were not clarified in the blog post.</p><p><strong>4. Increased Awareness of Global Health and Development:&nbsp;</strong>According to Buchsbaum (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/K76F-FVLC\"><u>2014</u></a>), the Grand Challenges increase the awareness of global health and development through the opportunity the Grand Challenges provide for applicants, the marketing and outreach, as well as media attention that the challenges and awards capture. This was not well quantified in the blog and it is not clear to us how this metric is measured.</p><p>In a later blog post, Buchsbaum (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/69PL-SZTV\"><u>2015</u></a>) expanded on the original four metrics by adding two metrics that were previously missing. These include \u201c<i>the value of advancing knowledge that does not yet directly result in a product or intervention</i>\u201d (though this does appear to be included in the 2014 blog post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/K76F-FVLC\"><u>here</u></a>). The other benefit was \u201c<i>the value of the research and development capacity</i>\u201d in low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>In another blog post on the Gates Foundation website, Buchsbaum and Singer (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/SZ2L-S3GQ\"><u>2014</u></a>) suggest that the challenges have shifted away from a dearth of innovation to a bottleneck at the proof-of-concept stage, where many promising innovations do not achieve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7LEE-QP3T\"><u>scale</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2wxjlv10bjn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2wxjlv10bjn\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;To address this, they described the role of a \u201c<i>curator</i>,\u201d which ensures the innovations are \u201c<i>investment ready</i>\u201d and conduct comparative analyses, and the role of a \u201c<i>broker</i>\u201d, which helps act as a bridge between innovations and investors. Despite websites that aim to serve this function, the authors make a special emphasis on the human element in this space.</p><p>Singer (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/R6AU-Y33U\"><u>2014</u></a>) referenced the rapid spread of Grand Challenges globally, although it is unclear what has driven this spread. Similarly, and more recently, Buchsbaum and Tesfagiorgis (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/PX5H-DATH\"><u>2016</u></a>) indicated some degree of crowdedness in this space, calling for data sharing and combining resources. This resulted in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NZ3D-TACH\"><u>Global Innovation Exchange</u></a>, though it has been defunct since 2021, and now serves as an online resource.&nbsp;</p><p>In summary, Grand Challenges seem to be conceptually closer to grants than to prizes, with a focus on innovations that can be brought to scale, and fostering innovation and R&amp;D capacity in low- and middle-income countries. Based on their own metrics, it is difficult to assess whether a Grand Challenge model would be more or less cost-effective than other models of financing innovation, such as regular grantmaking, prizes, or an AMC model. It is also unclear the extent to which Grand Challenges are successful because of the financial gains, their particular approach or funding model, or prestige/reputation effects. With more time, we could contact experts in this space to see if they have more unpublished data about their impact to more clearly elucidate these nuances.</p><h1>Conclusion and recommendations</h1><p>Inducement prizes have received little attention in the empirical and theoretical literature. The only direct evidence we found on inducement prizes having an effect on innovation comes from a study on prizes for agricultural technology in late 19th and early 20th century England. While the available literature points somewhat towards inducement prizes having favorable outcomes, we don\u2019t think the evidence provides a strong case for using inducement prizes. A noteworthy finding is that inducement prizes can leverage large amounts of private capital (~2-50x the cash reward), but we don\u2019t know how representative this finding is.</p><p>We think that there is somewhat more (and more convincing) evidence in favor of recognition prizes. We would advise having a deeper look into the literature on recognition prizes, though our guess is that there is not much more to be found than what we already have. A good starting point could be to skim further articles we found on recognition prizes but did not have time to review (listed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s29T6zlQcnkByAD3g2D7w5N4JjEoxlaCp2HeFF0wQXA/edit#heading=h.c1ce1yublfu9\"><u>here</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>While the literature does not provide very concrete guidelines on when prizes should be used (versus other incentive mechanisms), a rule of thumb seems to be that inducement prizes are most useful (1) when the goal is clear but the path to achieving it is not, and (2) in industries that are susceptible to underproduction of innovation due to market failure (e.g. neglected tropical diseases or technology to address climate change). This holds similarly for AMCs, but it is less clear (at least to us) how to choose between inducement prizes and AMCs.</p><p>It is also not very clear how an effective inducement (or recognition) prize should be designed. Most of the evidence comes from field or lab experiments on relatively small-scale prizes, which are very different in nature than grand innovation prizes, like the X Prize. One noteworthy general finding is that the prestige and visibility of a prize seems to matter much more than the cash reward in incentivizing participants. The cash reward seems to matter mostly insofar as it increases the prize\u2019s visibility, but there is only a weak correlation between the two. Thus, we would advise against spending millions on a large cash reward and think carefully about how to create prestige around a prize.</p><p>Although the evidence base on prizes is pretty limited, we are doubtful whether funding more research on prizes is worthwhile. Prizes, especially large-scale prizes, are very complex and their success depends on many different parameters. For example, findings that hold for small-scale prizes in one context may not extend to another, and there is always the challenge of finding or constructing an adequate counterfactual. Our current belief is that the amount and cost of research needed to sufficiently resolve key uncertainties is disproportional compared to its benefits. Thus, we would not recommend funding prizes just for research purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>Advance market commitments, a fairly novel concept, have been endorsed by several highly renowned economists. So far, there has only been one case study that yielded promising results, but it also received critique. While the pneumococcal pilot AMC seemed to have been successful in establishing and speeding up vaccine rollout in poorer countries, it may not have been very cost-effective relative to other vaccine interventions. Moreover, the pilot focused deliberately only on establishing supply capacity for an already existing vaccine, not on inducing R&amp;D activity. We would recommend looking into the possibility of funding an AMC to test whether it can actually be effective at inducing R&amp;D activity, as it was originally conceived. Moreover, we would advise having a deeper look at AMCs, particularly to get a better sense of how promising other proposals and applications are.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, we came away somewhat more optimistic about recognition prizes and AMCs and somewhat less optimistic about inducement prizes, relative to our priors. Nonetheless, we believe that inducement prizes are still worth considering, but only in certain circumstances and contexts, with more focus on building prestige than on increasing the cash rewards, and with a very careful design that is informed by what went well and what went wrong in historical prizes and more recent case studies. We don\u2019t have a firm conclusion regarding Grand Challenges, as we only had time to review them very briefly and didn\u2019t encounter anything striking that affected our bottom-line conclusions.&nbsp;</p><h1>What we would (and wouldn\u2019t) do with more time</h1><ul><li>We would&nbsp;<i>not</i> spend more time investigating the empirical and theoretical literature on inducement prizes. As we found very few high-quality studies on the effects of inducement prizes, we are quite confident that the literature we included in this report gives a fairly complete picture of the evidence base to date.</li><li>As we found the evidence on the innovation-related and field-shaping effects of recognition prizes somewhat more convincing than the evidence on inducement prizes (yet this report focused mostly on inducement prizes), we would briefly try to review whether there is any other convincing evidence that supports (or contradicts) the huge effects on growth metrics of scientific fields found by Jin, Ma, and Uzzi (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25712-2\"><u>2021</u></a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Given that prestige has been found to matter more as an incentive in prizes than monetary rewards, we would be curious to know whether and how prestige around a prize can be created. We don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s something that can be directly influenced and how costly it would be, but we think it\u2019s worthwhile investigating, as it\u2019s possible that this can be built cheaply and might be a more cost-effective incentive than very large cash awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>As we haven\u2019t been able to interview any prize experts besides Christopher Snyder on AMCs, we would try to talk to both proponents and opponents of prizes to see whether there are any important considerations that we missed. We haven\u2019t found many academics who strongly support prizes (except AMCs), but Joseph Stiglitz is one exception who advocated for prizes instead of patents in the developing world (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/YSV7-TT3D\"><u>Stiglitz, 2007)</u></a>. It would be interesting to know what types of prizes (inducement prizes or AMCs) he envisions and in what cases. On the more critical side, we would recommend talking to Zorina Khan in more detail about her views about the potential and pitfalls of prizes and in what cases they are potentially (in)effective. Moreover, we think that talking to someone who has been involved in designing and implementing a prize could also be worthwhile, particularly someone from a prize that \u201cfailed,\u201d though we don\u2019t have a concrete suggestion for this.</li><li>As we were only able to give relatively vague rules of thumb on when to use inducement prizes or AMCs, we would try to make this more concrete, especially to have a clearer distinction between cases when either of those, a mix of them, or other types of incentives are likely to yield superior results. We suspect that there is not much literature on this question yet, but believe that talking to Christopher Snyder, John Levin, or Michael Kremer could give more insight into this question.&nbsp;</li><li>We would review other potential applications and existing proposals of AMCs to get a sense of whether those might be a promising avenue for future funding and research, such as AMCs for technologically distant targets (e.g. vaccines that are still in the R&amp;D process) or for technologies to address climate change.</li><li>As we only had time for a very short and superficial review of Grand Challenges, we don\u2019t have a firm grasp of their impact and cost-effectiveness, and we are not sure whether sufficient evidence exists to evaluate this. With more time, we could contact experts in this space to see if they have more unpublished data about their impact to more clearly elucidate these nuances.</li></ul><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/imkjzls9pqwhey3cg2pc\"></strong></p><p><i>This post is a project of&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/\"><i><u>Rethink Priorities</u></i></a><i>\u2013a think tank dedicated to informing decisions made by high-impact organizations and funders across various cause areas.

Although the study is based on recognition prizes only (and thus no inducement prizes), we include it nonetheless because we found the sheer scale of the data set and the methodology especially convincing relative to other studies we found.&nbsp;</p><p>From various sources, the authors collected data on 405 scientific prizes that were conferred 2,900 times between 1970 and 2007 with respect to more than 11,000 scientific topics in 19 disciplines. They then merged this information with various data on scientific topics and publications. Using a difference-in-differences regression design combined with Dynamic Optimal Matching,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx1mu7zo21u\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx1mu7zo21u\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;More precisely, the authors matched prizewinning topics with five non-prizewinning topics that had statistically equivalent growth patterns in six different growth indices in the 10-year period before a prize was conferred.</p><p><br>&nbsp;the authors found that topics associated with a scientific prize experience extraordinary growth in productivity, impact, and new entrants. More precisely, relative to matched non-prizewinning topics, prizewinning topics produce 40% more publications and 33% more citations, retain 55% more scientists, and gain 37% and 47% more new entrants and star scientists, respectively, in the first five to 10 years after the prize.</p><p><i>Figure 7 - Scientific prizes and extraordinary growth (</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25712-2\"><i><u>Jin, Ma, &amp; Uzzi, 2021</u></i></a><i>, p. 4)</i><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/velmt1fgwrrjifpurabz\"></p><p>Figure 7 above plots the average magnitudes of extraordinary growth for all six growth measures during the first 10 years following the prize. The plotted magnitudes are unfortunately not straightforward to interpret, but can be interpreted as follows with a little transformation. The differences in growth are expressed as \u0394<sub>t</sub> = log(Y<sub>t</sub>) - log(\u1ef8<sub>t</sub>), where Y<sub>t</sub> is the prizewinning topic\u2019s growth at time t and \u1ef8<sub>t</sub> is the same quantity for the matched topic\u2019s growth. Figure 7 plots \u0394<sub>t</sub>. For an intuitive interpretation of the differences in growth after 10 years, we need to calculate e<sup>\u039410&nbsp;</sup>- 1 = (Y<sub>10&nbsp;</sub>-&nbsp; \u1ef8<sub>10&nbsp;</sub>)/ \u1ef8<sub>10</sub>. Thus, for example, as seen in panel a in Figure 7 above, at 10 years after the prize, prizewinning topics are 39.8% more productive in terms of the number of publications than matched topics (\u0394<sub>10</sub> = 0.3351, e<sup>\u039410</sup> - 1 = 0.3981). As an approximate but less accurate shortcut, one can also interpret \u0394<sub>t</sub> as a percentage change directly, without using the transformation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpy8nk18r8iq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpy8nk18r8iq\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnf11jgh5e0c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnf11jgh5e0c\">[29]</a></sup></span></p><p>While the authors cannot determine a mechanism by which prizewinning plays a role in the abnormal growth of topics, they explain that their findings are consistent with, for instance, Zuckerman\u2019s (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZZ5-8F52\"><u>1992</u></a>) theoretical argument that prizes may act as signals to scientists that a prizewinning topic offers comparatively strong prospects for professional growth.&nbsp;</p><p>The authors also found that funding does not account for a prizewinning topic\u2019s growth.

The data set on prizes from all over the world is very comprehensive and fairly recent. Moreover, we were impressed that the authors went to extraordinary lengths to collect and cross-validate their data from various sources, and constructed control groups of non-prizewinning topics with growth patterns statistically equivalent to prizewinning topics for 10 years before the prize year on six different growth criteria. Although the study does not claim causality, the excellent quasi-experimental study design convinced us that the results come pretty close to causality. However, as noted above, a major caveat of this study is that it focuses on recognition prizes only; inducement prizes are not part of the sample.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb0fqm06ve8g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb0fqm06ve8g\">[30]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Brunt, Lerner, and Nicholas (2012)</h3><p>Brunt, Lerner, and Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><u>2012</u></a>) estimated the effect of inducement prizes on innovation using data on awards for technological development by the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) at annual competitions between 1839 and 1939. They detected large impacts of the prizes on competitive entry and, more importantly, they also found an effect on patents (as a proxy for innovation). The author concluded that prizes encouraged competition and that medals were more important than monetary awards. Moreover, the impact on innovation they observed could not be explained by merely a redirection of existing inventive activity, implying that prizes raised aggregate innovative output beyond just redirecting existing efforts.</p><p>RASE awarded both substantial monetary prizes (more than \u00a31 million) and its own prestigious medals for machinery and innovative implements. The society asked award-seekers to produce specific improvements and gave them one year before awards were bestowed. The data set comprises about 15,000 entrant inventions that competed for the prizes and nearly 2,000 awards that were made, and was merged with a data set of all British patents from the same time frame.</p><p>Interestingly, the authors found that the costs incurred for technological development were higher than the monetary awards received by winners, indicating that the prizes leveraged a significant amount of private capital. On average, the monetary awards covered only around one third of the sale price of a single unit of an implement or machine exhibited by a successful entrant, as shown below in Figure 8.</p><p><i>Figure 8 - Regression plot of prizes awarded against projected sale price of winning innovation (</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><i><u>Brunt, Lerner, &amp; Nicholas, 2012</u></i></a><i>, p. 13)</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/vbp6aurb6xcagd0glrxk\"></p><p>The authors used negative binomial regressions to predict the number of individual entrants and the count of granted patents in different technology categories, conditional on the awards.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefduzfnr9xq3r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnduzfnr9xq3r\">[31]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefme9mj5mklp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnme9mj5mklp\">[32]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A crucial aspect of the authors\u2019 identification strategy to isolate the effect of prizes on contemporaneous innovative activity is the fact that they found the largest spikes in patenting activity in the year of the show, suggesting an immediate relationship between prizes and patenting in terms of timing (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><u>Brunt, Lerner, &amp; Nicholas, 2012</u></a>, p. 4).</p><p><br>&nbsp;Table 1 below reports some of their estimates of the entrant equation. Columns 1 and 2 show the effects of monetary and medal awards on entrant counts. A doubling of monetary prizes implied an 11% increase in entrants and each additional medal announced in the prize schedule increased the expected entrant count by 11%. The authors also investigated whether awards per se had an effect vs. their monetary value. To test this, \u201c<i>column 9 specifies the monetary prizes as variables measuring both the average monetary amount and the number of monetary prizes offered in the schedule. A doubling in the number of awards, controlling for average value, induced a 33 per cent increase in entrants, while higher value prizes, conditioning on the number of awards, are associated with a slightly lower level of entry</i>\u201d (p. 681). According to the authors, \u201c<i>rather than compensating inventors directly for the costs of research and development, the awards provided a \u2018seal of quality\u2019 for inventors who could advertise this to potential buyers</i>\u201d (ibid).</p><p><i>Table 1 - Contest entrant regression results (</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><i><u>Brunt, Lerner, &amp; Nicholas, 2012</u></i></a><i>, p. 22)</i></p><p><i><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/mkcorwluu94tmcc4ty4x\"></i></p><p>The authors ran similar regressions using the number of patents as an outcome and concluded that prizes boosted the patents as a proxy for innovation (see Table 2 below). Prize variables (money prizes and medals) were statistically insignificant in most specifications in the patent regressions (see Panels A and B). Only when limiting the time period to the prize rotation period (1856-1872) were statistically significant associations between the patent count and prize variables found (see Panel C).</p><p>During the prize rotation period, prize awards were rotated every three years between three different technology categories. Econometrically this means that these rotating ex ante prizes were not driven by any demand or supply shocks to innovation because they were announced independently of any cycles of innovation or \u201chot\u201d technology categories, which would alleviate bias concerns (pp. 5-6).&nbsp;</p><p>For example, during this period, an additional medal was associated with an 8% increase in patents (column 2) and a gold medal with a 12-15% increase in patents (columns 4 and 5). Doubling the monetary award only resulted in a 1% increase in patents (column 1). The authors\u2019 interpretation of this was that giving longer lead times to inventors raised the number of competition entries and the intensity of innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>Another result we found very interesting is a positive association found between prizes and patents in regressions where only non-participants of the RASE competitions who also patented in agriculture-related areas were included (we do not show the regression table here). According to the authors, a possible explanation for this result is that the prize schedule signaled to these inventors areas of technological development that are potentially profitable. Thus, RASE\u2019s inducement prizes had an effect on aggregate innovative activity.</p><p>Nonetheless, we are still somewhat surprised by the fact that the prize variables were insignificant in most specifications of the patent regressions, i.e. when the time period was not restricted to the prize rotation period. As we are not exactly sure how to interpret this finding, we contacted the authors for clarification, but we unfortunately haven\u2019t heard back.&nbsp;</p><p>The findings of this study have a number of caveats and limitations. One of them is that we deem the internal validity only moderately high. The results might potentially be upward or downward biased due to several reasons, which we skip here. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent these historical results from the 19th and early 20th centuries would extend to current prizes, and to prizes for different outcomes, such as where market failure occurs, as is the case with neglected tropical diseases, for instance.</p><p><i>Table 2 - Patent regression results (</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><i><u>Brunt, Lerner, &amp; Nicholas, 2012</u></i></a><i>, p. 23)</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/ta1wv9yj8evfwipbzmi8\"></p><h3>Nicholas (2013)</h3><p>Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12007\"><u>2013</u></a>) did a study with a methodology similar to Brunt, Lerner, and Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><u>2012</u></a>), examining the effects of recognition prizes on patents in late 19th and early 20th century Japan. Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12007\"><u>2013</u></a>) used a panel data set composed of patent counts and various data on prizes during the period 1885-1911 in Japan. He concluded that prizes strongly boosted patents, especially in less developed prefectures, and they also induced large spillovers of technical knowledge in prefectures adjacent to those with prizes.</p><p>Similar to the approach used by Brunt, Lerner, and Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><u>2012</u></a>), Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12007\"><u>2013</u></a>) also relied on a negative binomial regression model using within-prefecture variation over time to identify the effect of prizes on patents (see Table 3 below).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8agxqp4iw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8agxqp4iw\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As the number of patents may not respond immediately to the change in incentives, he used distributed lags of prize variables to estimate the impact on patents.&nbsp;</p><p>Here we describe some exemplary results of a simple dummy variable approach he used to&nbsp;</p><p>identify the presence or absence of prize competitions in a prefecture in a given year (see Table 3 below, columns 5-8). In column 5 (panel A), the size and statistical significance of the coefficients increased from t - 1 to t - 3, though they were, at best, significant at the 10% significance level. Across different specifications (columns 5-8), he found that the t - 3 prize competition dummy was associated with a ~11-15% increase in the number of patents.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftjykekmj1ml\"><sup><a href=\"#fntjykekmj1ml\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The relationship between prizes and patents was even stronger when only considering less technologically developed prefectures (panels B and C). When summing up the distributed lag variable coefficients (t - 1 to t - 3), we see that prizes boosted patenting by ~17-61%. He explained that results were consistent with other researchers' accounts indicating that a consequence of the prize competitions was to boost technological development in less advanced areas. However, in our understanding, Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12007\"><u>2013</u></a>)<i>&nbsp;</i>did not try to investigate or speculate why the effect was highest in less developed areas, and we also refrain from doing so.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Table&nbsp;3 - Patent regression results (</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12007\"><i><u>Nicholas, 2013</u></i></a><i>, p. 18)</i></p><p><i><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/fbxodqejtqilgtpu0im0\"></i></p><p>Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12007\"><u>2013</u></a>) acknowledged that possible selection effects might bias the results, that is, if the location choice of the prize competitions was correlated with patent outcomes. To counter this concern, he tested for selection effects using prefecture-level characteristics to predict prize competitions. He found little evidence of prize competition selection across different specifications, concluding that selection was unlikely to be a concern.</p><p>Interestingly, he also did a cost-benefit assessment of the prize competitions, linking competition expenditures with the expected market value of patents. He estimated an implied cost per patent higher than the value of patents, implying that the cost of the prize competitions was high relative to the output gains. The financial cost was more reasonable when taking into account the extra patents induced by spillover and for non-patented innovations that were plausibly generated as a consequence of the prizes.</p><p>While we think this study was carefully executed, we deem its internal validity a bit lower than Jin, Ma, and Uzzi\u2019s (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25712-2\"><u>2021</u></a>) study. The coefficients are reasonably robust across specifications, but have quite large standard errors. Moreover, it is unclear how relevant these results from early 20th century Japan are to modern inducement prizes for innovation in other settings. The prizes in this analysis were mostly non-pecuniary and inventors could also pursue patents. Moreover, the prizes were not inducement prizes, but were awarded ex post for innovations that had already been developed. Nonetheless, this analysis shows that non-pecuniary prizes can provide effective incentives for inventors, especially in areas at an early stage of technological development.</p><h3>Sigurdson (2021)</h3><p>Sigurdson (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>2021</u></a>) wrote an empirical PhD thesis in economics aiming to establish a causal relationship between prizes and the rate and direction of innovation. While his thesis does not directly focus on the impact of prizes on innovation, it focuses on intermediate outcomes that might, in turn, affect innovation. In particular, he explored how prizes affect (1) collaboration behavior among innovators at the individual level, (2) the use of particular knowledge or approaches at the field level, and (3) the ability to compete in a subsequent prize at the team level. We find his thesis very carefully executed and the methodology convincing, although it cannot fully address all endogeneity concerns related to the propensity of some researchers to self-select into prize participation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0nu3fd0drvqo\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0nu3fd0drvqo\">[35]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We summarize the findings of the first two studies below and skip the last study, as we deem it less relevant to this report.</p><p><strong>Study 1 - Prizes and collaboration behavior among researchers</strong></p><p>In the first study, Sigurdson (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>2021</u></a>) explored whether inducement prizes increase the relative returns to research collaboration at the level of the individual innovator using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7Q7C-C8WS\"><u>2005 DARPA Grand Challenge</u></a> \u2014 a prize competition for autonomous&nbsp; vehicles \u2014 as the research setting and a data set of more than 1,600 scientists, including prize participants and matched control scientists. He used a difference-in-differences approach combined with matching, tracking publishing activity before and after the prize and comparing university professors who participated in the prize with a control group of non-participant professors.</p><p>He found that compared to researchers who did not participate, prize participants experienced a 31% increase in the number of unique coauthors per year (corresponding to four additional coauthors) they published within the 10-year period after the prize.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9z7slhsbkgv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9z7slhsbkgv\">[36]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This effect was partly driven by increases in research productivity (i.e. approximately two additional publications compared to a control group with five publications per year), in returning coauthors (intensive margin), and in new first-time coauthors (extensive margin). He also found that prize participants experienced an increase in coauthor diversity measured by publication subject area \u2014 that is, participants are more likely to publish work with coauthors who are more active in other disciplines. These effects were strongest among researchers from higher-prestige universities. Interestingly, the effects were not driven by increased collaboration with other prize participants. Thus, the increase in coauthors of prize participants did not appear to be driven by new contacts met directly during prize competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>While Sigurdson (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>2021</u></a>) remained rather vague in discussing possible mechanisms<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcs81e3q2pag\"><sup><a href=\"#fncs81e3q2pag\">[37]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;for the effects, we find it intuitively plausible that when incentivized to work on a problem that requires interdisciplinary expertise and an expansion of one\u2019s typical circle of coauthors, as we think is arguably the case with autonomous vehicles, the propensity to work with more and more diverse coauthors for later research projects increases. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether this result would extend to other settings and prize competitions in which interdisciplinary work is less crucial. Moreover, we are not sure whether and how these effects on collaboration affect the quantity and quality of innovation.</p><p>One might be concerned that there is some selection bias in prize participation, which would bias the results. It is possible that some types of researchers are predisposed to participate in the prize, and that the same characteristics that lead to this predisposition also affect the propensity to collaborate after the prize, which could lead to an overestimation of the prize effect. Sigurdson (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>2021</u></a>) did two robustness checks to address this concern. First, he combined the difference-in-differences approach with propensity score matching to restrict the control group to a matched sample of non-participants who were most likely to participate in the prize based on pre-prize variables, but did not participate. Second, he dropped researchers from top-performing teams (i.e. highly collaborative outliers) from the sample. Overall, the results from these robustness tests are similar to the results using the full sample (albeit with different magnitudes and statistical significance, though one cannot uniformly say that these changes go in a particular direction), supporting the main result that prize participation increased post-prize collaboration measured via unique coauthors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Study 2 - Prizes and the identification of breakthrough ideas in science</strong></p><p>In the second study, Sigurdson (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>2021</u></a>) tested the hypothesis that inducement prizes are an effective mechanism for identifying breakthrough ideas in science. To explore this hypothesis, he again used data from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7Q7C-C8WS\"><u>2005 DARPA Grand Challenge</u></a> for autonomous vehicles and investigated how the prize affected the relative salience of a subfield of research within robotics that was targeted by the prize.</p><p>His analysis was based on a difference-in-differences approach and a by-product of the prize: a special issue of a scientific journal consisting of articles written by prize participants. Specifically, he used the citations in this journal issue, as he assumed them to be a representative sample of robotics knowledge used by prize participants. More precisely, he compared the citation rates of the literature cited in this journal issue (i.e. the prize-relevant literature) after the prize with a control group of robotics literature in the same field and time period, but not directly related to the prize. To reduce endogeneity concerns related to literature published in response to the prize, he limited his analysis to research published before the prize was announced.</p><p>According to Sigurdson (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>2021</u></a>), the difference in future citation rates between these two groups of research (i.e. prize-relevant research and control research) can be interpreted as a measure of the impact of the prize on the trajectory of research in the field of robotics. He found that the prize-relevant literature experienced an 18% rise in future citations relative to the literature in the control group, and a 36% rise when only focusing on journal articles, but not conference papers or reviews. However, the standard errors are very large. Sigurdson\u2019s (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9REP-E2KS\"><u>2021</u></a>) interpretation of these results was that inducement prizes may provide a mechanism for identifying breakthrough ideas in science and for helping these ideas to take hold in a field \u201c<i>by virtue of highly visible, objective benchmarks for the evaluation of different and competing approaches</i>\u201d (p. 70).</p><h3>Ma and Uzzi (2018)</h3><p>Ma and Uzzi (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800485115\"><u>2018</u></a>) used large-scale data on scientific recognition prizes to examine the growth dynamics of prizes and the connections prizes and prizewinners make within and across disciplines. More precisely, they studied how genealogical and coauthorship networks were associated with prizewinning and the concentration of prizes among scientists. The authors used data on more than 3,000 different scientific prizes across diverse disciplines and the career trajectories of almost 11,000 prizewinners worldwide for over 100 years. Their analysis combined different methodologies, such as ordered logit regressions for a scientist\u2019s propensity for winning multiple prizes and different network analysis methods.</p><p>They found several links between prizes and scientific advances. First, despite a proliferation of prizes over time<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpgym8aq94w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpgym8aq94w\">[38]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and across the globe, prizes were more concentrated within a smaller and smaller group of tightly interconnected scientific elites. This suggested that the boundaries of science were advanced by a relatively small number of ideas and scholars. For example, 64% of prizewinners have won two prizes and 14% have won five prizes or more. Second, certain prizes created interlocks between disciplines and thereby created pathways by which knowledge spread across disciplines. This means that certain prizewinners and their ideas connected disciplines via the prize network. For example, winners of the Howard Hughes Medicine Institute Award were more highly cited across disciplines and combined more novel lines of research than a control group of equally accomplished, non-prizewinning researchers. Third, genealogical and coauthorship networks predicted a scientist\u2019s propensity for winning multiple prizes.</p><p>It is unclear how these networks affect knowledge transfer and innovation. According to Ma and Uzzi (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800485115\"><u>2018</u></a>), two effects are possible. On the one hand, if these networks work like other social networks, they may provide better divisions of specialized labor, continuous learning opportunities, and support for risk-taking. On the other hand, the small groups and tightly interconnected elites may be vulnerable to in-group thinking or could create in-group biases. It\u2019s unclear which effect is dominant.&nbsp;</p><h3>Azoulay, Stuart, and Wang (2014) &amp; Reschke, Azoulay, and Stuart (2018)</h3><p>Azoulay, Stuart, and Wang (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1755\"><u>2014</u></a>) compared the citations of papers written by scientists who ended up becoming a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator (and thus received a significant source of no-strings-attached funding). The papers from future HHMI winners received more citations than those who did not. However, the effect was small and short-lived.</p><p>Interestingly, there seems to be a redistribution effect, as Reschke, Azoulay, and Stuart (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839217731997\"><u>2018</u></a>) showed with a difference-in-differences study design that scientists in the same field as an HHMI winner received fewer citations after the announcement of the award. However, this effect was dependent on the number of citations a particular topic was getting prior to the award. For example, for a topic that was already well cited, the effect of someone else in the field receiving an HHMI appointment appeared to have had a negative effect on citations of neighboring articles.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3fln8kfq2lp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3fln8kfq2lp\">[39]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;On the other hand, for topics with minimal citations, the effect of someone else in the field receiving an HHMI appointment had a positive effect on neighboring articles. However, this effect seems to be most relevant for topics that were very poorly cited (i.e. 10th decile). According to Reschke, Azoulay, and Stuart (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0001839217731997\"><u>2018</u></a>, p.1)</p><p>\u201c<i>This pattern reflects more than the trivial transfer of attention from non-winners to winners: once prizes are announced, actors cede scientific territory to prize winners and pursue other opportunities. These negative spillover effects are moderated or even reversed by scientists\u2019 social connections and by the novelty and stature of scientific domains.</i>\u201d<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>We came across these two articles at a very late stage in this report.

Their results suggest that the cash prize nearly doubled problem-solving performance.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwzfq2uci18t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwzfq2uci18t\">[40]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Interestingly, the authors found that the effect of cash incentives was significantly greater for higher-skilled participants (as measured by ex ante skill, prior to the experiment) relative to lower-skilled participants, consistent with higher-skilled workers having more of a chance of winning the prize. Again, it is not clear whether a higher cash amount would have increased problem-solving performance even further.</li><li>Brunt, Lerner, and Nicholas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/joie.12002\"><u>2012</u></a>) investigated in an econometric study whether prize competitions by the Royal Agricultural Society of England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries created competitive entry and spurred patents.

Tom Nicholas, one of the authors of this study, was interviewed by McKinsey (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VD9A-FLRB\"><u>2009</u></a>, p. 31), and stated, \u201c<i>People are much more induced by winning a medal award than by winning a monetary award.</i>\u201d He hypothesized that \u201c<i>it\u2019s much easier to market a product having won a medal.</i>\u201d</li><li>Kay (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>2011</u></a>) used an empirical, multiple case-study methodology and various data sources to investigate three cases of recent aerospace technology prizes: a main case study, the Google Lunar X Prize; and two pilot cases, the Ansari X Prize and the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge (we describe the paper in more detail&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Google_Lunar_X_Prize\"><u>here</u></a>). Entrants were generally attracted by the non-monetary benefits of participation (e.g. reputation, visibility) and the potential market value of the technologies involved in competitions. Kay concluded that the monetary reward was not as important as other prize incentives, yet it was still important to position and disseminate the idea of the prize.</li><li>Murray et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.06.013\"><u>2012</u></a>) systematically examined the use of a grand innovation prize (GIP) in action (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Types_and_definitions_of_prizes\"><u>Types and definitions of prizes</u></a> for a very brief explanation of GIPs), the Auto X Prize (we describe the paper in more detail&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/how-effective-are-prizes-at-spurring-innovation#Description_of_Auto_X_Prize\"><u>here</u></a>). They compared observations of GIPs from three domains \u2014 empirical reality, theory, and policy \u2014 to better understand their function as an incentive mechanism for encouraging new solutions to large-scale social challenges. They found that while a core assumption of economic theory is that the prize incentive is entirely determined by the monetary prize value, in practice, prize participants are motivated by a much broader set of incentives. He recommended prize organizers consider incentives as extending beyond the money and intellectual property rights to encompass media attention, reputation, and education (p. 9).</li><li>Khan (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NXK6-GU44\"><u>2020</u></a>) used extensive archival data to study technological change across time, countries, and political economic systems. She found that in many prizes, the monetary payout was merely a windfall rather than an incentive. Moreover, many contestants incurred expenditures that exceeded the award itself, and benefited from returns other than the cash prize \u2014 e.g. returns in adjacent markets, celebrity advertising, product differentiation, learning gained from the projects of other participants, and the prospect of pursuing additional prizes or grants.</li></ul><p>One could hypothesize that the visibility, prestige, and media coverage is a function of the size of the prize. While Kay (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4V25-8N5Y\"><u>2011</u></a>, p. 267) concluded that a monetary reward is important to disseminate the idea of a prize in the media, McKinsey (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VD9A-FLRB\"><u>2009</u></a>) found only a small correlation between the cash reward of prizes and the exposure they received (proxied by the frequency of online mentions in Google search results), even when correcting for the longevity of a prize (see Figure 9 below). For example, Pulitzer Prizes, which award \u201conly\u201d $10,000 to each winner, receive more exposure than any other prize in the United States, as approximated by the number of online mentions. Thus, if there is a relationship between cash rewards and visibility, it seems rather weak.</p><p><i>Figure 9 - Award size of a prize and exposure (</i><a href=\"https://perma.cc/VD9A-FLRB\"><i><u>McKinsey, 2009</u></i></a><i>, p. 58)</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xanSjg6Hq2PaGEkZP/phxqob7n7wc2clkxxzmr\"></p><h3>Prize structures and compensation schemes</h3><ul><li>Graff Zivin and Lyons (<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211119\"><u>2021</u></a>) conducted a field experiment in partnership with a life sciences company to compare how two different compensation schemes affected innovation performance. They ran a software innovation contest that lasted 54 hours and had 184 participants, which could win a prize of up to $15,000 within a firm. A winner-take-all compensation scheme generated significantly more novel<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqbsxydbz67h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqbsxydbz67h\">[41]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;innovation relative to a compensation scheme that offered the same total compensation shared across the 10 best innovations. Moreover, they found that the winner-take-all compensation scheme did not reduce output levels<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpz086r5eoqp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpz086r5eoqp\">[42]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;on average, but increased them when innovators were working in teams.</li><li>Hofstetter et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12424\"><u>2017</u></a>) ran an experiment by inviting a cohort of innovators to participate in two successive contests and randomly varied the incentive structure. Half of the participants were allocated into winner-take-all contests, and the other half into contests with a multiple prize structure in which the top 20 innovators would receive a prize (the total prize being identical across groups). The winner-take-all contests yielded significantly better ideas compared to multiple prizes in the first round. However, this result flipped when the innovators were asked to participate again in the second contest. While 50% of those in the multiple-prize contest group chose to participate again, only 37% did so from the winner-take-all group. Moreover, innovators who had received no reward in the first contest showed significantly lower effort in the second contest and generated fewer ideas. In the second contest, the multiple prizes contest generated better ideas than the winner-take-all contest. Confirming these findings, the authors found similar effects in an empirical investigation of over 260 contests and 6,000 innovators from the open innovation platform Atizo.com. Most importantly, these data show that innovator churn could be reduced by the addition of more (albeit smaller average) rewards.</li><li>Br\u00fcggeman and Meub (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/A9Z8-7A7U\"><u>2015</u></a>) investigated in a laboratory experiment the effects of two different innovation contests on subjects\u2019 innovativeness. Subjects were randomly allocated into two different contests: one in which a prize could be won for the aggregate innovativeness, and the other which awarded a prize for the best innovation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref50bq7xw1ipa\"><sup><a href=\"#fn50bq7xw1ipa\">[43]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The experiment consisted of a creative real effort task that simulated a sequential innovation process, in which subjects determined royalty fees (which also served as a measure of cooperation as they gave the prices for building upon others\u2019 prior innovations<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvob7kemltm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvob7kemltm\">[44]</a></sup></span>) for their created products. The authors found that, relative to a benchmark condition without an innovation contest, both contest conditions reduced the subjects\u2019 willingness to cooperate. With respect to innovativeness, neither a prize for the aggregate innovativeness nor a prize for the best innovation had a positive overall impact. Therefore, the authors concluded that both types of contests cannot unambiguously be recommended as effective policy instruments.</li></ul><h3>Number, background, and sorting of competitors</h3><ul><li>Boudreau et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1322\"><u>2011</u></a>) used a data set of almost 10,000 software competitions related to the solution of 645 problems from Topcoder, a contest platform for elite software developers, to investigate the implications of different numbers of competitors. The number of competitors in the competitions ranged between 10 and 20 and was plausibly exogenously determined. The authors found that a larger number of competitors reduced the effort exerted by each participant, but increased the probability of extreme-value solutions (i.e. particularly good solutions). The effort-reducing effect of greater rivalry dominated for less uncertain problems, whereas the effect on the extreme value dominated for more uncertain problems. Thus, the authors concluded that adding competitors systematically increases overall contest performance for high-uncertainty problems. They did not, however, discuss ways of increasing rivalry in practice, but merely mentioned that rivalry can be constrained by admitting only a limited number of entrants.</li><li>Jeppesen and Lakhani (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1090.0491\"><u>2010</u></a>) analyzed results from online scientific problem-solving challenges hosted at InnoCentive.com to explore the relationship between a contest winner's area of expertise and the focal field of the problem. They used a data set of 166 science challenges, originating from the R&amp;D labs of 26 firms in 10 countries, involving over 12,000 scientists. They found a positive relationship between marginality (being distant from the field of the problem) and problem-solving success. Both technical marginality (i.e. a solver\u2019s self-assessed technical expertise distance from the problem field) and social marginality (proxied by being a female scientist-solver, as women have been shown to be in the \u201couter circle\u201d of the sciences) related independently to successful problem resolution. The authors state that one interpretation of the findings would be that the best way to solve problems is to have experts from vastly different fields attempt solutions; however, they urged caution in extrapolating the findings to the extreme.</li><li>Boudreau and Lakhani (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/242V-FT36\"><u>2011</u></a>) conducted a 10-day field experiment of a contest in which over 500 software developers prepared solutions to some computational algorithmic problems, as already described further above in this section. The main focus of this experiment was on the effects of allowing participants to self-select into competitive versus team-based regimes. The goal was to evaluate whether allowing workers to sort into different institutional settings based on their intrinsic preferences would increase performance. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups with identical skills distributions and exposed to the same competitive institutional setting. The \u201csorted\u201d group was composed of individuals who preferred the competitive regime instead of a team-based outside option. The \u201cunsorted\u201d group had population-average preferences for working in the regime or the outside option. The authors found that sorting on the basis of institutional preferences doubled both effort and the performance of solutions. G\u00f6k (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/35CC-A7YH\"><u>2013</u></a>) interpreted these findings as showing that while teamwork is an important facilitating factor for innovation performance, this should be voluntary and natural, and those prizes whose rules strictly enforce teamwork might decrease innovative performance.</li></ul><h3>Effective design features based on learnings from historical prizes</h3><p>Khan (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007680515001014\"><u>2020</u></a>, Appendix 4) listed a number of design features of potentially effective prizes, which we copy here.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>\u201cDesign of prize system:</i><ul><li><i>Transparency and accountability in rules and decision-making</i></li><li><i>Projects with short completion times:</i><ul><li><i>Since the revenue is fixed, a longer time period increases uncertainty and costs to participants, which reduces expected profits</i></li></ul></li><li><i>Finance is staggered, with follow-up monitoring</i></li><li><i>Coordination among prize-granting agencies to prevent duplicative efforts</i></li><li><i>Specific mechanisms in place for scaling, commercialization to meet consumer needs</i></li><li><i>Rules to eliminate rent-seeking; overcompensation through multiple sources</i></li><li><i>Governance issues are explicitly recognized and addressed</i>\u201d</li></ul></li></ul><p>These design features are stated in the Appendix of Khan\u2019s book without any context or further explanation, thus, we put rather little weight on them.

The Google Lunar X Prize was a $30 million competition that started in 2007, organized by the X Prize Foundation and sponsored by Google. The competition required prize entrants to land a robot on the surface of the Moon, among other secondary goals, by December 2015. According to the X Prize Foundation, this was the largest prize competition in terms of cash purse and was designed to \u201c<i>accelerate technology developments supporting the commercial creation of multiple systems capable of reaching the lunar surface and performing operations over an extended period of time</i>.\u201d More broadly, the purpose of the competition was to: educate the global public about the benefits of opening up space and exploring the Moon; inspire and excite the world about science, technology, math, and engineering; enable and qualify a new generation of engineers and entrepreneurial companies able to design, build, deliver, and operate space hardware; and, open the space frontier to new ideas and new participants by lowering the costs by a factor of 30.</p><p>The challenge posed by this prize required launching a spacecraft from Earth to the Moon, landing on the Moon, deploying a rover to traverse 500 meters, and collecting and sending back to Earth high-definition video footage. The cash purse was divided into a Grand Prize (valued at $20 million and awarded to the first team to complete all of the mission requirements), Second Place Prize (valued at $5 million), and other Bonus Prizes (valued at $4 million). At the discretion of the X Prize Foundation, the prize might also be awarded (as a \u201cconsolation prize\u201d) to a team that accomplished most of the requirements to win the Grand Prize but, due to unforeseen circumstances, ultimately failed to meet all the mission requirements. Teams could also earn additional money by completing additional tasks beyond the baseline requirements, such as traveling 10 times the baseline requirements, or capturing images of man-made objects on the Moon.</p><p>To enter the Google Lunar X Prize, teams had to register between 2007 and 2010 and submit an application package with diverse information about the team and its members, finances, and mission plan, and pay a registration fee of $10,000, which was later raised to $50,000. The participating teams owned all the intellectual property associated with the design, manufacture, and operation of the spacecrafts. Until 2011, 35 teams from 17 countries entered the Google Lunar X Prize, of which six teams have withdrawn or merged. The actual number of teams and participating countries exceeded the initial target of the X Prize Foundation, which was about a dozen teams from a few countries. Many more potential entrants have demonstrated interest in this competition. The X Prize Foundation received more than 2,500 inquiries from individuals, companies, and universities from 96 different countries.</p><p>The original deadline was the end of 2014 and was later extended to 2018. By 2018, five teams remained in the competition. However, the X Prize Foundation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/5FYR-DNKW\"><u>announced</u></a> that \u201c<i>no team would be able to make a launch attempt to the Moon by the [31 March 2018] deadline\u2026 and the US$30 million Google Lunar X Prize will go unclaimed.</i>\u201d The foundation went on to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/HUW9-YBWK\"><u>announce</u></a> that the prize would continue as a non-cash competition. In 2019, a participating spacecraft crashed while attempting to land on the moon. The team was awarded a $1 million \u201cMoonshot Award\u201d by the foundation in recognition of touching the Moon\u2019s surface.</p><h3>Description of Auto X Prize</h3><p>In this section, we summarize the descriptions of the Auto X Prize in Murray et al. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2012.06.013\"><u>2012</u></a>) and Burstein and Murray (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Z3ZD-GRCJ\"><u>2016</u></a>). The Progressive Automotive Insurance X Prize, also called Auto X Prize, was a $10 million prize for a highly efficient vehicle. The Auto X Prize was launched in 2006 and known as the Automotive X Prize until 2008, when Progressive Insurance was announced as title sponsor. It was launched with the broad purpose to provide incentives to \u201d<i>teams from around the world to focus on a single goal of [building] viable, super fuel-efficient vehicles that give people more car choices and make a difference in their lives</i>.\u201d The basic goal of the prize was stated simply: \u201c<i>A ten million dollar cash purse will be awarded to the teams that win a long-distance stage race for clean, production-capable vehicles that exceed 100 miles-per-gallon energy equivalent</i>.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the prize translated into a wide range of requirements. Entrants had to demonstrate compliance with certain safety standards, and that their vehicles could be manufactured at scale and in accordance with a sustainable business plan. Moreover, the vehicles had to appeal to consumers, incorporating all of the usual features of modern cars \u2014 so that an average person without special knowledge could drive the car. The initial prize proposed called for two divisions \u2014 Mainstream and Alternative \u2014 with the \u201c<i>same requirements for fuel economy and emissions, but different design constraints</i>.\u201d A \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d design awarded $5 million per division to the team with the fastest vehicle with fuel efficiency in excess of 100 miles-per-gallon equivalent around a course.&nbsp;</p><p>The Auto X Prize also had goals beyond the development of new automotive technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy contributed a $3.5 million national education program for school students in conjunction with the Auto X Prize. The prize organizers also sought publicity for the prize, with the intention of using it as a way to start a broader national conversation about energy efficiency and to create an industry for fuel-efficient vehicles. Thus, the organizers sought to \u201c<i>provide many opportunities for recognition so that it\u2019s worthwhile to compete, and not just for first place</i>,\u201d and to \u201c<i>make heroes out of the competitors and winner(s) through widespread exposure, media coverage and a significant cash reward</i>\u201d (Burstein &amp; Murray,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Z3ZD-GRCJ\"><u>2016</u></a>, p. 420).</p><p>The prize attracted a wide range of competitors, such as auto industry professionals working for startup companies with venture capital financing, hobbyists who self-financed their entries, students from universities and a high school, and engineers from other industries. The entrants brought a range of technical expertise to the competition, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, materials science, and aerospace engineering.</p><p>The competition was conducted in a series of stages, each stage designed to winnow the field. Registration was easy: a team provided an application with basic technical information about the vehicle, paid a $5,000 entry fee, and signed an agreement. \u201c<i>The X Prize administrators applied a light screen to registrations, weeding out only those applicants that were \u201cclearly unqualified.\u201d By the February 2009 deadline, 111 teams registered a total of 136 vehicles for judging in the next stage. The registered teams then competed in a \u201cdesign judging\u201d stage, in which they provided detailed data submissions to demonstrate that their vehicles were production-capable. The Auto X Prize provided contestants with broad outlines of the minimal design requirements, and then convened panels of experts with broad discretion to determine which cars would qualify for the on-track events. These expert panels \u2014 judging submissions on safety and emissions, manufacturability and cost, features, and business plan \u2014 met and considered submissions over the course of several days</i>\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Z3ZD-GRCJ\"><u>Burstein and Murray</u></a>, 2016, p. 421).</p><p>Forty-three teams representing 56 vehicles passed the design judging stage and were qualified for the on-track race events. The competitors were provided with additional technical requirements and safety checks on their vehicles. Only 33 vehicles eventually entered the race events, which were conducted in several stages. Ultimately, nine teams competed in the final races. Two winners were announced in September 2010. The mainstream class winner was a group of automobile engineers from Virginia, whose gasoline-powered car was significantly lighter than any car on the market.</p><h2>Appendix 5 - Steps to decide whether an AMC is appropriate</h2><p>In the following, we provide a copy of two proposed steps to determine whether an AMC or a different type of program is appropriate (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7N43-HXR2\"><u>Chau et al., 2013</u></a>, p. 81):&nbsp;</p><p>1. \u201c<i><strong>Evaluate the current market context and challenges.</strong>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Future program designers should begin by identifying the level of market maturity and type of market failure. Market failures can exist in many forms and across many points of a product life cycle. Below are a few examples:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><ul><li><i>New product development: Nascent markets where a product has not yet been developed and research and development is required</i></li><li><i>Product launch: Late-stage markets where a product has been developed or nearly developed, but has not launched in desired markets or capacity is lacking</i></li><li><i>Secondary supplier entry: Developed markets where additional suppliers should be incentivized to enter an existing market with a revised or improved product offering</i></li><li><i>Lack of product uptake: Markets in which a product exists but has not been utilized effectively or demand has not materialized on a large scale&nbsp;</i></li></ul><p><i><strong>2. Determine the best approach for addressing the market challenge.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><i>The \u201cMaking Markets for Vaccines\u201d report from the CGD working group outlined two separate conceptions of an AMC: early-stage programs for products that require intensive R&amp;D, and late-stage initiatives for products much closer to market. The two scenarios require very different approaches to pricing and structure. In many cases, particularly those where products are very near to market, an AMC as originally conceived may not be the approach best suited to the particular market failure. In these cases, program designers should feel free to deviate from the original AMC concept and borrow approaches from other forms of market-shaping mechanisms. For instance, manufacturers have stressed their preference for individual purchase guarantees to offset the risks they run in making large upfront investments; though these may not be suitable in all contexts, intermediate approaches that improve the situation for all sides may be possible. Designers of future programs should, from the start, take into account the pragmatic realities of a market and design tailored, nuanced solutions accordingly.</i>\u201d</p><h1>Footnotes</h1><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntuns5ddeado\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftuns5ddeado\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>According to Roberts, Brown, and Stott (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/RQ8S-YVMF\"><u>2019</u></a>, p. 13), there are many different terms that describe some form of an inducement prize, such as challenge prize, (social) innovation competition, innovation contest, innovation challenge, or research tournaments.

A shortcut to this can be finding people you disagree with (but still share a lot of common ground), and getting with them into <strong>fruitful</strong> discussions. By that, you capitalize from someone else's research and reasoning and can faster update compared to doing the work alone.</p><p>This of course works only as long as you both share enough premises and you can trust the other's abilities and good intentions in research and reasoning. So you want a method that both quickly exposes mismatches here and also gets to the core of your disagreement.</p><p>A good format for such fruitful discussions might be the <a href=\"https://yesnodebate.org/\">Yes/No debate</a>. I created it a few years ago and already ran <a href=\"https://yesnodebate.org/blog/questions-disagree-understand-why/\">offline</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://yesnodebate.org/blog/workshop-czea/\">online workshops</a>, <a href=\"https://yesnodebate.org/blog/insights/\">volunteer-based online debates</a> and created a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/YesNoDebate/\">subreddit where everybody can start their debate</a>. The format can help to find <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/double-crux\">Double cruxes</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary\">Decision boundaries</a>, if not resolve a disagreement between two people.</p><p>Having run and seen many debates with interested \"laypeople\" (who picked a topic mainly for testing the format), I'm now curious to see how well it may work with well-informed people that are deeper involved in the topic they discuss. This is why I'm writing this post.</p><h1>What is a \"Yes/No debate\"?</h1><p><img src=\"https://yesnodebate.org/images/ynd.en.png\"></p><p>A \"Yes/No debate\" is a discussion between two people based on yes/no questions. Basically, one person always <strong>asks a Yes/No question</strong> and the other responds to it with 5 possible answers:</p><ul><li>Yes</li><li>No</li><li>Depends</li><li>False premise</li><li>I don't know.</li></ul><p>An optional reasoning may be added, Depends and False premise require an elaboration.</p><p>Given the answer, either the same person may ask again or the roles switch. We switch roles to make sure both participants stay&nbsp;<i>aligned</i> (more on this below).</p><h1>What are the benefits?</h1><p>The main benefit of the method is that no argument or question gets ignored: Your counterpart <i>has</i> to answer you, and they have to do it in a clear and decisive way (one of the 5 responses).</p><p>But also you are challenged: you have to remember what your partner answered in order to ask a suitable follow-up question. Even more, you need to know clearly for yourself why you believe something.</p><p>Compared to other formats, both of you are <i>constantly aligned</i>: You only get to speak as long as the other can follow you. There is no wasting time by <i>'splaining</i> points the other one already agrees to or that are irrelevant to them.</p><p>From the <a href=\"https://yesnodebate.org/blog/insights/\">tests we ran</a>, we know that with this method, 50% of the participants could better understand their counterpart's position, compared to other debates they had.</p><p>One participant particularly enjoyed this:</p><blockquote><p>It was surprisingly good to have a focal point to respond to. Even if they posted a wall of text explaining their position, the question was the only thing I felt required to address, so it took less mental energy to debate than it would have taken in a different format.</p></blockquote><h1>What questions to ask?</h1><p>New Yes/No debaters often find it difficult to phrase Yes/No questions. In fact, even trained debaters find answering much easier than asking.</p><p>But if you know <i>why</i> you believe what you believe, it should not be that hard. Consider this (very simplified) argument tree on why someone took the Covid vaccine:</p><pre><code>           I should take the Covid vaccine. \n          \u2197                                \u2196\n    Covid is dangerous.             The vaccine is safe.\n          \u2191                                 \u2191 \nMany people die from Covid.     Few people die from the vaccine.\n</code></pre><p>The argument tree contains claims (nodes) and conclusions (edges). If you met someone who disagrees with the root claim (\"I should take the Covid vaccine.\"), they <strong>must</strong> disagree with at least one of the sub-claims or conclusions.</p><p>So to find that mismatch, you may traverse the argument tree by asking:</p><ul><li>Do you agree that many people die from Covid?</li><li>Does this mean that Covid is dangerous?</li><li>Do you agree that few people die from the vaccine?</li><li>Does this mean that the vaccine is safe?</li><li>Does from both follow that you should take the vaccine?</li></ul><p><strong>Again, if they disagree with the core claim, at least one of the answers must be a No.</strong> Finding that spot in the tree helps you a lot: You then have a new disagreement but a more specific one (on which you can apply the Yes/No format again, like a recursion).</p><p>This may remind you of the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/double-crux\">Double crux method</a>, which can be summarized as: Find <i>relevant</i> pillars of your and your partner\u2019s beliefs and dig deeper until you find claims that can be easier fact-checked.</p><p>And it may also remind you of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem\">Aumann's agreement theorem</a>, which I like to summarize as:</p><blockquote><p>If you know what I know (nodes / claims / information) &amp;
