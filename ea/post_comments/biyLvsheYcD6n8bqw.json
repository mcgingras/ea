The discussion of AI potentially driving explosive innovations seemed much more relevant than the replacement of the jobs you spent most time discussing, and at the same time unfortunately much more rushed.</p><blockquote><p>But it\u2019s a kind of thing where, you know, I can keep coming up with new bottlenecks [for explosive innovations leading to economic growth], and [Tom Davidson] can keep dismissing them, and we can keep going on forever.</p></blockquote><p>Relatedly, I'd've been interested how Michael relates to the Age of Em scenario, in which IIRC explosive innovation and economic happens mostly in a parallel digital economy of digital minds. For the next two decades I kinda expect some mild version of such a parallel digital economy, where growth in AI mostly affects stuff like software development, biotech, R&amp;D generally, content creation, finance, personal productivity services. Would be interesting to dig into the bottlenecks that Michael foresees in this case, spontaneously I'm not convinced that there is not room for explosive growth in the digital sphere.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MaxRa"}}, {"_id": "bAEMhFoAHWhfnaG3E", "postedAt": "2023-08-26T09:11:26.495Z", "postId": "biyLvsheYcD6n8bqw", "htmlBody": "<p>On the discussion that AI will have deficits in expressing care and eliciting trust, I feel like he\u2019s neglecting that AI systems can easily get a digital face and a warm voice for this purpose?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MaxRa"}}]
