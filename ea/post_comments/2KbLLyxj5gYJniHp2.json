I disagree for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>This feels more like a problem at the point between \u201calternative proteins have scaled up and we\u2019ve replaced a bunch of meat\u201d and \u201cthis results in a meat ban.\u201d It seems possible to me that moral advocacy efforts can happen after alternative proteins have scaled up, but before there are laws to stop factory farming for food entirely. I don\u2019t think alternative proteins replacing, say, 80% of meat will result in people thinking non-meat uses of animals is morally okay in a lock-in kind of way.&nbsp;</li><li>I think a lot of people\u2019s moral reasoning about animals is posthoc/based on cognitive dissonance. That is, people like eating meat, or it\u2019s a valuable part of their culture, and their moral intuitions around animal exploitation are built around that. So it seems plausible to me that moral advocacy efforts become substantially more effective if we\u2019re able to quickly replace one of the biggest uses of animals.&nbsp;</li><li>I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m compelled by the mechanism for lock-in. One mechanism appears to be overconfidence/complacency as a society, which reduces the drive toward moral progress. This seems somewhat plausible, but it feels like this is possible to solve (for instance, animal advocacy organizations pivot toward other uses of animals, and are more able to dedicate resources focused on animal advocacy). Another mechanism seems to be that \u201cletting automobiles replace horses as practical transport instead of listening to the horse advocates and becoming better humans, humanity has lost a great opportunity to do something for the animals for moral reasons, and do so by accepting an economic loss.\u201d But I guess I\u2019m not sure why \u2013 in either the horse case or the factory farming case \u2013 this is a unique opportunity. I don\u2019t think the existence of factory farming necessarily strengthens the argument, to an average person, about the urgency of animal advocacy, because if people don\u2019t buy the moral reasoning for caring about animals, I\u2019m not sure the scale of suffering that exists currently affects whether they buy the moral reasoning. So in the case of horses, for example, I don\u2019t think it was easier to convince people that horses matter before they were replaced as practical transport.&nbsp;</li><li>I feel like this is just intractable. Meat has the advantage of being embedded in culture and identity for generations. Without proposing <i>any </i>alternative, and going entirely through the moral route, means going up against this generational idea that eating meat is okay. Success seems hard. I\u2019m wary of taking such a risk, when there\u2019s also the possibility of factory farming for food persisting into the future (and I\u2019d guess, in business-as-usual scenarios, it remains a bigger problem than other kinds of factory farming). I will also say I\u2019m not convinced that expanding our moral circle to animals helps expand our moral circle to things like digital minds in the far future, though that\u2019s a conversation for another day.&nbsp;</li><li>I\u2019m uncomfortable about this argument for nonconsequentialist reasons. If factory farming is a grave injustice that ought be abolished (even if you\u2019re a consequentialist who buys moral uncertainty), it seems like letting it stay for much longer and taking a huge risk that it stays forever because you want to do it for the right reasons could be a massive negligent injustice in itself. It feels like, in a moral way, saying \u201cit\u2019s bad to hire more beat cops to deter crime, because deterring crime through fear doesn\u2019t convince anyone that their crime is wrong.\u201d One reason a lot of people would find that intuitively bad is because it feels like it\u2019s instrumentalizing the victims of crime for a dubious future consequence.&nbsp;</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Tejas Subramaniam"}}, {"_id": "DyShJrTYjzRPmaHGd", "postedAt": "2022-09-10T22:34:34.041Z", "postId": "2KbLLyxj5gYJniHp2", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Fai, I agree with whoever encouraged you to post more. &nbsp;I always enjoy and appreciate your stuff even when we don't 100% agree.&nbsp;</p><p>The below sentence is difficult to parse, what do you actually mean? &nbsp;That it <i>was</i> economic reasons, or that it <i>was not</i> economic reasons, or something else entirely?</p><p>&gt;Well, I personally did not have much hope in humanity's moral progress, until I recently got moderately convinced that it\u2019s less likely than not that we abolished slavery mainly for economic reasons.

This post contains many good thoughts; for example, I was intrigued by the thought that how we treat animals today might matter to how AI treats us in the future.</p>\n<p>This post reminded me strongly of <a href=\"https://veganstrategist.org/veganworld/\">\"How to create a vegan world\"</a> by Tobias Leenaert. In that book, Tobias argues that all progress toward veganism matters, be it people who reduce their meat consumption, the availability of good meat alternatives, moral progress, etc. Tobias compares the road to a vegan world with a long, stony, uphill path to a mountaintop. He says that it's hard to get to the top directly or using just one motivation (e.g., an exclusively moral motivation). Instead, we need every small step on the way and all sources of support that we can get.</p>\n<p>One reason that Tobias provides is that motivation often follows action<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-hH3KqXLkanvEjkCjh-1\" id=\"fnref-hH3KqXLkanvEjkCjh-1\">[1]</a></sup>. It's a lot easier to think kindly of animals <em>after</em> you treat them kindly. I believe that this has been true for me personally -- I feel more morally responsible toward animals (and more critical of the other forms of exploitation that you mention in the post) after having changed my diet, even though that change was partially motivated by ecological reasons.</p>\n<p>\"How to create a vegan world\" changed my thinking toward a more consequentialist approach. I'm putting more emphasis on the direct consequences that an action has on animals, and less on the motivation behind this action. In fact, the book made me a bit wary of people who think that moral reasons are the <em>only valid way</em> of helping animals.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think that the intuitions expressed in this post, if true, should cause us to rethink our approach to meat alternatives.
