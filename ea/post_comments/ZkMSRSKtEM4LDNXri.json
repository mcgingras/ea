I agree <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting\">reference class forecasting</a> is super important.

Nothing is 100% \u201cunique.\u201d Language purists be damned: uniqueness is a matter of degree. So Superforecasters conduct creative searches for comparison classes even for seemingly unique events, such as the outcome of a hunt for a high-profile terrorist (Joseph Kony) or the standoff between a new socialist government in Athens and Greece\u2019s creditors.
