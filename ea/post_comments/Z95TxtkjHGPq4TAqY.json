From #3 we might instead conclude that we need to hurry to produce new English materials, since DGB is still influencing English-speakers, and then ensure these new materials are translated for foreign readers, lest they too be corrupted by the impression given by DGB.

The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) has worked with university institutes at Cambridge and Oxford to produce policy reports of global catastrophic risks for European governments. The Effective Altruism Foundation (EAF) has in Germany and Switzerland done policy advocacy, initiated by philosophy post-docs and the like. Before involvement in EA, they weren't particularly experienced in philosophy, but their efforts haven't backfired in any sense.

I notice the examples I gave were about causes like animal advocacy and global catastrophic risks, compared to your example of international development. My examples are of sectors which aren't already as common in academia and policy. So the EA community has been able to effectively break a lot of new ground in policy research and advocacy regarding these causes.

I know a number of small group leaders who want materials in their native language to share with their (small) groups, rather than to broadcast a translation on a mass scale. </p>\n<p>I suspect that if the alternative is groups struggling through English-language materials or not using written EA materials in their groups at all (and just going it alone), then it's probably better that they have some basic translated materials (one can always advise them not to try to broadcast them widely).

I agree that in the English speaking world memes like 'EA = effective charity' and 'EA careers = ETG' are prevalent and perhaps impossible to reverse en mass. But how 'locked in' are individual EAs and small EA groups who have, for example, read Doing Good Better? i.e. how intractable is changing their view from the Doing Good Better view to the updated view (and how far would it have been better to delay publication of Doing Good Better a few years until the ideas were more developed)? If we're dealing with translations for small groups, the situation looks more similar to small groups of EAs who have read Doing Good Better, than to mass-media broadcasting of EAish memes to the general populace. Since it's not clear how far small groups of English speaking EAs are locked in or that it would have been better to delay EA messaging in English speaking areas a few years, it's not clear to me that we should be trying to avoid/delay 'lock in' wherever else we can e.g. in the non-English speaking world. </p>\n<p>I think this is especially so if we think less in terms of the possibility of avoiding irreversible lock-in and more in terms of a trade-off between incrementally improving EA messaging and delaying EA messaging several years (assuming that we don't think that the next iteration of EA ideas will be final, but will themselves need to be updated a handful of years later).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "WFpvY3fACc25fDeh7", "user": {"username": "David_Moss"}}, {"_id": "rkYdjHsYTEwWPBxma", "postedAt": "2018-03-08T19:33:42.115Z", "postId": "Z95TxtkjHGPq4TAqY", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the citation!</p>\n<p>We agree this doesn't look good for (non-Anglo-American) groups running large events as outreach, in that it looks like it doesn't bear fruit in terms of increasing members or other outputs.

So, for example, if someone attends a large event in London they can easily immediately check out lots of EA websites and materials, find places to follow-up and so on; if someone attends a large event in a different country without these touch-points and critical mass, then not so much. Of course, it may also just be that these areas were less fertile ground for receiving EA message in some other way.</p>\n<p>It's also important to note that it's not clear from the data we provided above that non-Anglo-American groups distinctively receive low payoffs from large events.

It also remains very difficult to counter the impression that EA is mainly the practical implementation of Singer's views; e.g. Singer's views on infanticide get quoted in many media articles about EA.</p>\n<p>Some of the challenges that might have led to this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DGB and Singer's EA book were translated to German, but much of the more advanced content is only available in English.</li>\n<li>Quickly translating English content is easy. However, it takes much more time to ensure high quality both in terms of language and framings/nuance, and it's even more challenging to keep these translations up to date. See the &quot;fidelity model&quot; blog post referenced above for more discussion of this.</li>\n<li>The media frequently interview members of the community. Community members are more or less up to date with recent EA publications and would explain EA well, but the media very proactively ask about charitable donations and related issues. It takes a lot of active effort and experience with media interviews to counter this pigeonholing, which is hard to do without much practice. I personally find it pretty hard to give good guidance on this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So as a conclusion, I think the expansion to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria could have gone much better still, and while I agree it could be the deemed most successful case of translation of EA content, I think it was worse than what we should be aiming for.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "E4nRKhx4iRoAmQCuW", "user": {"username": "Jonas Vollmer"}}, {"_id": "RP9iHyM3hsWTpxEK7", "postedAt": "2018-03-10T18:28:07.078Z", "postId": "Z95TxtkjHGPq4TAqY", "htmlBody": "<p>I found this article useful and convincing.

A set of core materials can still be useful, if it is carefully curated by professional translators (not merely bilingual volunteers like me). Without written material, it can be difficult to make ideas stick, even among a small group of personal contacts. A counter argument to this, however, is that the initial promising groups are very likely elite college students and urban professionals who would have no problem reading English materials. I don't have a strong opinion on this.</p>\n<p>Another potential problem I can foresee regarding 'personal contact' approach is that to my knowledge, the Chinese government keeps close tabs on any recruitment activities by foreign social movements. Anecdotes from missionary friends 10 years ago suggest that their religious activities, especially when involving locals,  were closely monitored by the police, kept under 20 people, and sometimes harassed. I cannot speak with any confidence that this is still the case, or if it will be applied to EAs equally.

Here is my guess at some problems people from different countries ol cultures may run into when trying to make connections, e.g. by applying for internships, help, conferences, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>1) People unconsciously take language sophistication as a proxy for inteligence. By not being proficient in English you loose points.</p>\n<p>2) People are evaluated on proxies like &quot;attending prestigeous university&quot;.

(Prestige and other incentives also point that way)</p>\n<p>one risk I see in your article is it may influence the people who would be best at mitigating risks of &quot;wrong local EA movements&quot; being founded to not work on it at all.  </p>\n<p>I dont think &quot;the barriers&quot; should be zero, as such barriers in a way help the selection of motivated people. Just in my impression they may be higher than they appear from inside. Asking people to first build conections, while building such connections is not systematically supported, may make the barriers higher than optimal.</p>\n<p>Btw yes the core of the group can read English materials. Also it could do research in machine learning, found a startup, work in quantitive finance, in part get elected to the parliament, move out of the country, and more. What I want to point at, if you imagine  members of a group of people working on &quot;translation&quot; of EA into new culture you would like, they are likely paying huge opportunity costs in doing so.  It may be hard to keep them at some state of waiting and building connections.</p>\n<p>In our case, counterfactually it seems plausible &quot;waiting even more&quot; could have also led to the group not working, or worse organization beeing created, as the core people would loose motivation / pursue other opportunities. </p>\n<p>2) In counting long-term impact and the lock-in effect you should consider the chance movements in new languages and cultures develop in some respects better versions of effective altruism, and beneficial mutations can than spread, even back to the core. More countries may mean more experiments running and faster evolution of better versions of EA. It's unclear to me how these terms  (lock in, more optimization power) add up but both should be counted. One possible resolution may be to prioritize founding movements in smaller countries where you create experience, but the damage is limited. </p>\n<p>To your questions </p>\n<p>i] with one exception, reasonably well taken from the viewpoint of strategic communication (communicating easily communicable concepts, eg impact and effectivity). I don't think the damage is great, and part of misconceptions is unavoidable givent the name &quot;effective altruism&quot;.</p>\n<p>ii] it has a distribution... IMO the understanding at the moment is highly correlated with the enagagement in the group.  Which may be more important than criteria like &quot;average understanding&quot; or &quot;public understanding&quot;</p>\n<p>iii] yes, it's complicated, depends on some misalignments, and I dont want to disscuss it publicly. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "pkfwKn69LiBdLHAjy", "user": {"username": "Jan_Kulveit"}}, {"_id": "p6oJnCW6jsXLWZHJ9", "postedAt": "2018-03-17T23:11:54.677Z", "postId": "Z95TxtkjHGPq4TAqY", "htmlBody": "<p>Quick addition that I realise the lack of support for local groups is not ideal, but this capacity constraint is another reason to go slow.

It isn't the language, she said, but it's the story arc.  In the US and western culture at large (if we can clump so many peoples together) the prototypical story is a battle between good a evil, followed by epiphany/battle (read &quot;Hero With a Thousand Faces&quot;).  The Chinese story frame, she explained, was a progression between balance, imbalance, followed by rebalance.  As culture is so much more than \n language and music (etc), but a system of practices, beliefs, narratives, and social structures.
