That said (intuitively, I don't have data to back this up, this is my guess) I suspect two main things, pre-FTX.<br><br>Firstly, longtermism is very criticisable. It's much more abstract, focuses less on doing good in the moment, and can step on causes like malaria prevention that people can more easily emotionally get behind. There is a general implication of longtermism that if you accept its principles, other causes are essentially irrelevant.<br><br>Secondly, everything I just said about longtermism -&gt; neartermism applies to EA -&gt; regular charity - just replace \"Doing good in the moment\" with \"Doing good close to home\". When I first signed up for an EA virtual program, my immediate takeaway was that most of the things I had previously cared about didn't matter. Nobody said this out loud, they were scrupulously polite about it, they were 100% correct, and it was a message that needed to be shared to get people like me on board. This is a feature, not a bug, of EA messaging. But this is not a message that people enjoy hearing. The things people care about are generally optimised for having people care about them - as examples, see everything trending on Twitter. As a result, people don't react well to being told, whether explicitly or implicitly, that they should stop caring about (My personal example here) the amount of money Australian welfare recipients get, and care about malaria prevention halfway across the world instead.<br><br>One difference between EA and longtermism is that people rarely criticise neartermism to the same level, because then you can just point out the hundreds of thousands of lives that neartermism has already saved, and they look like an asshole. Longtermism has no such defense, and a lot of people equate that with the EA movement - sometimes out of intellectual dishonesty, and sometimes because longtermism &nbsp;genuinely is a large and growing part of EA.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jay Bailey"}}, {"_id": "FPkPsw5CRv7HwGJoR", "postedAt": "2022-12-29T22:21:36.488Z", "postId": "RahNn8Lk7rzN7S4Gc", "htmlBody": "<p>As with any social movement, people disagree about the best ways to take action.

Some people find the culture unwelcoming (eg. too elitist/not enough diversity), some people take issue with longtermism (eg. too much uncertainty), others disagree with consequentialism/utilitarianism, and still others are generally on board but find more specific issues in the way that EA approaches things.&nbsp;</p><p>Post-SBF it's difficult to say what the full effects will be, but I think it's fair to say that SBF represents what many people fear/dislike about EA (eg. elitism, inexperience, ends-justifies-the-means reasoning, tech-bro vibes, etc). I'm not saying these things are necessarily true, but most people won't spend hundreds of hours engaging with EA to find out for themselves. Instead, they'll read an article on the New York Times about how SBF committed fraud and is heavily linked to EA and walk away with a somewhat negative impression. That isn't always fair, but it also happens to other social movements like feminism, Black Lives Matter, veganism, environmentalism, etc. EA is no exception, and FTX/SBF was a big enough deal that a lot of people will choose not to engage with EA going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Should you care? I think to an extent, yes - you should engage with criticisms, think through your own perspective, decide where you agree/disagree, and work on improving things where you think they should be improved going forward. We should all do this. Ignoring criticisms is akin to putting your fingers in your ears and refusing to listen, which isn't a particularly rational approach. Many critics of EA will have meaningful things to say about it and if we truly want to figure out the best ways to improve the world, we need to be willing to change (see: scout mindset). That being said, not all criticisms will be useful or meaningful, and we shouldn't get so caught up in the criticism that we stop standing for something.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "S.E.

This probably was a more larger reputational hit to longtermism than animal welfare or GHW (though not necessarily a larger harm : benefit ratio). But even before this, a lot of left leaning folks view EA's ties to crypto with skepticism (often this is usually around views of whether crypto is net positive for humanity, not on the extent to which crypto is a sound investment).&nbsp;</p><p>EA generally is subject to critiques around <strong>measuring impact through a utilitarian lens </strong>by those who deem the value of lives \"above\" measurement, as well as by those who think EA <strong>undervalues non-utilitarian moral views or person-affecting views</strong>. There are also general criticisms of it being an insufficiently diverse place (usually something like: too white / too western / too male / too elitist) for a movement that cares about doing the most good it can.</p><p>EA global health + wellbeing / development is <strong>subject to critiques around top-down Western aid</strong> (e.g., Easterly, Deaton), and <strong>general critiques around the merits of randomista development</strong>. Some conclusions are seen as unintuitive e.g. by those who think donating to local causes or your local community is preferable because of some moral obligation to those closer to them or those responsible for their success in some way.</p><p>Within the animal welfare space, there's discussion around whether continued involvement with EA and its principles is a good thing or not for similar reasons <strong>(lacking diversity, too top-down, too utilitarian)</strong> - these voices largely come from the more left leaning / social justice inclined (e.g. placing value on intersectionality). Accordingly, some within the farmed animal advocacy space also think<strong> involvement with EA is contributing to a splintering within the FAAM movement</strong>. I'm not sure why this seems more relevant in FAAM than GHW, but some possibilities might be if EA funders are a more important player in the animal space than the GHD space, and if FAAM members are generally more left-leaning and see a larger divide between social justice approaches and EA's utilitarian EV-maximising approaches. Some conclusions are seen as unintuitive e.g. shrimp welfare (\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mealreplacer/status/1607065578103279616\">wait you guys actually care about shrimp?</a>\"), or wild animal suffering.</p><p>Longtermism is subject to critiques from those uncomfortable with <strong>valuing the future at the cost of people today</strong>, valuing artificial sentience more than humans, a <strong>perceived reliance on EV-maximising views</strong>, \"tech bros\" <strong>valuing science fiction ideas over real suffering </strong>and justifying such spending as \"saving the world\", and the extent to which the future they are wanting to preserve actually involves <strong>all of humanity, or just a version of humanity that a limited subculture cares about</strong>. Unintuitive conclusions may involve anything ranging from thinking about the future more than 1000 years from now, outside of the solar system, or artificial sentience. The general critiques around diversity and a lean towards tech fixes instead of systematic approaches are perhaps most pronounced in longtermism, perhaps in part due to AI safety being a large focus of longtermism, and in part due to associations with the Bay Area. The general critiques around utilitarianism are perhaps also most pronounced in longtermism, and the media attention around WWOTF probably made more people engage with longtermism and its critiques. On recent EA involvement in politics as a pushback RE: favouring tech fixes &gt; systemic approaches, the Flynn campaign was seen as a negative update for some left-leaning outsiders in terms of EA's ability to engage in this space.</p><p>Outside of cause area considerations, some people get the impression that EA <strong>leans young, unprofessional, too skeptical to defer to existing expertise</strong> / too eager to defer to a smart generalist to first-principles their way through a complicated problem, that EA is a community that is too closely knit and subject to nepotism, that EA <strong>unfairly favours \"EA insiders\" or \"EA alignment\"</strong>. Other people think EA is <strong>too fervent with outreach</strong>, and consider university and high school messaging or even 80,000 hours akin to cult recruitment. On a similar vein, some think that the EA movement is<strong> too morally demanding</strong>, and this may lead to burnout, or insufficiently values individuals' flourishing. Some others think that EA lacks direction, isn't well steered, or has an <strong>inconsistent theory of change.</strong></p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "bruce"}}, {"_id": "qgJPXCh3FrsrJwMH2", "postedAt": "2022-12-29T23:07:10.083Z", "postId": "RahNn8Lk7rzN7S4Gc", "htmlBody": "<p>I think it\u2019s badly named!</p>\n<p>The name \u201ceffective altruism\u201d has a holier than thou, \u201cwe\u2019ve solved ethics and are perfectly ethical\u201d vibe, which means that\u2019s people are extra critical of EA when they disagree with the EA community or feel that the EA community isn\u2019t doing the <em>most good</em></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "HH4XBYusDLxanJzsp", "postedAt": "2022-12-29T23:35:28.499Z", "postId": "RahNn8Lk7rzN7S4Gc", "htmlBody": "<p>I'll list some criticisms of EA that I heard, prior to FTX, from friends/acquaintances who I respect (which doesn't mean that I think all of these critiques are good). I am paraphrasing a lot so might be misrepresenting some of them.<br><br>Some folks in EA are a bit too pushy to get new people to engage more. This was from a person who thought of doing good primarily in terms of their contracts with other people, supporting people in their local community, and increasing cooperation and coordination in their social groups. They also cared about helping people globally (donated some of their income to global health charities + were vegetarian) but felt like it wasn't the only thing they cared about. They felt like often in their interactions with EAs, the other person would try to bring up the same thought experiments they had already heard in order to get rid of their \"bias towards helping people close to them in space-time\". This was annoying for them. They also came from a background in law and found the emphasis on AI safety offputting because they didn't have the technical knowledge to form an opinion on it and the arguments were often presented to them by EA students who failed to convince them, and who they thought also didn't have good reason to believe in them.&nbsp;<br><br>Another person mentioned that it looked weird to them that EA spent a lot of resources on helping itself. Without looking too closely at it, it looked like the ratio of resources spent on meta EA stuff to directly impactful stuff seemed suspiciously high. Their general thoughts on communities with access to billionaire money, influence, and young people wanting to find a purpose made them assume negative things about EA community as well. This made it harder for them to take some of the EA ideas seriously. I feel sympathetic to this and feel like if I wasn't already part of the effective altruism community and understood the value in a lot of the EA meta stuff, I would feel similarly suspicious perhaps.<br><br>Someone else mentioned that lots of EA people they met came across as young, not very wise, and quite arrogant for their level of experience and knowledge. This put them off. As one example, they had negative experiences with EAs who didn't have any experience with ML trying to persuade others that AI x-risk was the biggest problem. &nbsp;<br><br>Then there was suspicion that EAs, because of their emphasis on utilitarianism, might be willing to do things like lie, break rules, push the big guy in front of the trolley, etc if it were for the \"greater good\". &nbsp;This made them hard to trust.&nbsp;<br><br>Some people I have briefly talked to mainly thought EA was about earning to give by working for Wall Street, and they thought it was harmful because of that.<br><br>I didn't hear the \"EA is too elitist\" or \"EA isn't diverse enough\" criticisms much (i can't think of a specific time someone brought that up as a reason they chose not to engage more with EA).&nbsp;<br><br>I have talked to some non-EA friends about EA stuff after the FTX crisis (including one who himself lost a lot of money that was on the platform), mostly because they sent me memes about SBF's effective altruism. My impression was that their opinion (generally mildly positive though not personally enthusiastic) on EA did not change much as a result of FTX. This is unfortunately probably not the case for people who heard about EA for the first time because of FTX - they are more likely to assume bad things about EAs if they don't know any in real life (and I think this is to some extent, a justified response).</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Quadratic Reciprocity"}}, {"_id": "hR3ZXHWqAa4XqoZ9J", "postedAt": "2022-12-30T00:07:39.541Z", "postId": "RahNn8Lk7rzN7S4Gc", "htmlBody": "<p>Why would it be harmful to work for Wall Street earning to give?

EAs argue that we should do good better and donate to effective charities instead of other things because they are more effective. The systemic change critique argues that they are not more effective and donating to them isn't doing good better because those resources would be doing more good if spent on other interventions, like advocating for systemic change or legal reforms or democratization or whatever intervention they think will do more good. This isn't all that different than what EAs do: when you donate to AMF or deworming initiatives to save a life, you do that at the expense of donating to another intervention that would save a life elsewhere, like drug addiction treatment or children's hospitals. In both cases, the decision is based on where the allocation of resources will do the most good, it's only the reasoning behind it that is different.</p>\n<p>One reason, in my opinion, that EA attracts more criticism on this is that it makes a claim that the interventions it backs are the best thing you can be spending your resources on with given information.
