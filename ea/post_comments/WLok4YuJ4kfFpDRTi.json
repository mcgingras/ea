However, I'm wondering if from a R&amp;D and implementation perspective a more fitting analogy would be clean cooking fuel, heating or solar power (which you do mention). Clean water systems need large investment in infrastructure and government implementation upfront, as much as they need more technological advancement, since Clean Water is a public good. Indoor Clean Air, or at least the solutions you described above, don't <strong>need </strong>large infrastructure or government investment.

I think there is a better setting for making people realize this than hospitals, offices and even schools: Pre-school.

Also, it would be super easy to just oneself set up a pre-school with best-in-class air quality in a neighborhood with resourceful parents.

I'm a water resources engineer by day, so this post caught my eye. There are tons of parallels to be drawn here between water treatment and air treatment, and I think you've done a great job outlining the scale of potential benefits available to us. However, some key differences arise in how we interact with air and with water in our daily lives. The water supply chain is cordoned off from other environments and the larger global supply of water, meaning we can take small volumes relative to the total supply and apply targeted treatment techniques to improve the quality of the consumed volume. With regards to air quality, much of our consumption is still directly from the global supply (the atmosphere). While we do have systems in place to filter and treat this air indoors, outdoor air quality is a much larger beast to tackle, and it may be more efficient to opt for intervention at point of consumption, in the form of masks/aerators, than to attempt to treat the global air volume. Turning to pathogenic risk, I think you've correctly identified an area of great potential improvement, since most airborne pathogenic transmission happens indoors, where we could conceivably intervene via existing AC / air supply systems.&nbsp;<br><br>Both of these measures (Clean indoor air / clean drinking water) are really just proxies for how clean our bodies are, (both in terms of pathogen exposure but also of pollutants). I wonder what other tools you could include in a \"clean body\" framework? My first thought was about the potential for blood-donation to filter out bio-accumulated microplastics from the body (reducing the concentration as newly made blood does not contain any), but I'm sure there are other examples.<br><br>Great post, looking forward to more!&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Connor Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "LqmvTjFmyKiBQWXdi", "postedAt": "2023-05-18T18:51:18.763Z", "postId": "WLok4YuJ4kfFpDRTi", "htmlBody": "<p>Has anyone thought about the effects of air pollution on animal welfare?</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Michael_Wiebe"}}, {"_id": "RNENQLJegmfCbvtgt", "postedAt": "2023-06-01T13:00:35.673Z", "postId": "WLok4YuJ4kfFpDRTi", "htmlBody": "<p>Love this idea!

I've only just got round to reading it but have a few questions.</p>\n<p>First, by clean air, do you mean low CO2 or no pathogens? These seem to have quite different solutions and benefits but the article doesn't cleanly distinguish. Most of the solutions (excepting ventilation) do not reduce CO2 levels, and hence would not give the benefits to cognition etc that ventilation do. Furthermore, monitoring CO2 levels won't tell you much because, once you implement these solutions, the link between CO2 levels and pathogen levels is broken.</p>\n<p>Second, I'm not convinced the evidence supports the size of benefit you suggest here: near-elimination of respiratory illness through clean air alone. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SsZ4AqmBdgrfN6hfz/air-safety-to-combat-global-catastrophic-biorisks-revised#Top_line_summary\">The updated 1DaySooner report</a> (which I appreciate wasn't published when you wrote this piece) estimates reducing transmission by 30--75%. While the mid-to-top-end of that range might remove flu epidemics (R0 up to around 2) as a threat, this seems less likely for all respiratory illnesses such as endemic coronaviruses (R0 around 10) or even original, Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 (R0 at least 3, likely 4 or higher). It certainly wouldn't be enough for measles (R0 15--20). Indoor air cleaning still seems valuable but I wouldn't want to oversell it as a silver bullet, rather than one line in multi-factorial pathogen defence.</p>\n<p>Finally, I was wondering if there was a reason you didn't mention <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ventilation-approved-document-f\">the update to UK building regulations to include indoor air quality (published 2021)</a>.
