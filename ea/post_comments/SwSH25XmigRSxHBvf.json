People with first world problems, and in my experience, especially Americans who didn't have luck in their parent's school choice, have an incredibly distorted sense of what day to day life is in the world. I'm not particularly talking about the suffering from which you are trying to get people to dissociate, but particularly about the scarcity of money. In NY, SF, Sweden etc... I've seen people considering the prices of some things &quot;reasonable&quot; that are unfathomable in a small city in the Brazilian jungle, the Syrian desert or the Bolivian mountains.
