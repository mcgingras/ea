I'd like to weigh in on this but that thread is already pretty crowded and unstructured.</p>\n<p>The proposition here is &quot;People with average or below average income should save money rather than donate to effective charities&quot;</p>\n<p>One thing that it looks like almost nobody mentioned is the opportunity cost of worrying about other people over yourself and how this corresponds to effective altruistic output. It seemed from facebook that most EA's were against the proposition, claiming that most people in the developed world are still far better off than X% of the global population and therefore they should still be donating some percentage of their wealth. I believe there is a strong case to be made that focusing on optimizing one's own career capital, not just making smart personal finance decisions, will enable one to earn substantially higher income in the future and thus be a more &quot;E&quot; EA. Any intellectual power devoted to understanding the EA argument (doing the relevant research, picking an EA organization or EA-organization-recommended charity to donate to, and &quot;stretching your EA muscles&quot; by donating a small amount over a regular period of time) is a small investment in terms of money but a large investment in terms of intellectual capital that I think dedicated EA's tend to discount because they have already invested this capital. This is a CFAR-esque argument that advocates focusing on personal development and improvement until one is at a level to reasonably maximize one's own output both in terms of income and effectiveness of donations.</p>\n<p>I am still uncertain about my position in this debate, but it seemed that most EA's (at least on facebook) were strongly against the proposition so I would like to see more discussion taking the above points into consideration.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "AlexCuevas"}}, {"_id": "WPQHLHJnzSQNFyFq9", "postedAt": "2014-10-06T20:16:53.017Z", "postId": "7xFQAQrWuH4ye73QS", "htmlBody": "<p>Context <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/655328167856877/\">here</a> (fixed)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "zf8bzk4GsedcWjuRf", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "Zmu9xQJSgj82Y7Wkr", "postedAt": "2014-10-06T20:40:13.942Z", "postId": "7xFQAQrWuH4ye73QS", "htmlBody": "<p>I think that if the Standard EA Recommendation for middle- to low-income people is &quot;come back when you make more money&quot;, no middle- to low-income people (to a first approximation) will ever become interested in EA.</p>\n<p>I think if I made 30k a year and asked someone what EA-related things I could do and they told me &quot;you don't make enough to worry about donating, try to optimize your income some more and then we'll talk,&quot; my reaction would be &quot;Ack!

A lot of people already want to make more money, and they feel a conflict between trying their best to become successful VS using the resources / leverage they already have to help others.

It's actually pretty hard to estimate the size of reputational effect, but we should try. For example thinking about what the effect might be if the whole movement were doing it might be a reasonable first approximation. In some cases that probably underestimates the costs -- if your behaviour is extreme even within the movement, it's more likely to be picked up on and have a high reputational cost. In some cases that may overestimate the costs -- e.g. if the whole movement were vegetarian that might appear weird and discourage growth, but having half the movement be vegetarian probably doesn't.</p>\n<p>It sounds to me that living in a van is likely to be erring too far on the side of ignoring reputation.</p>\n<p>In your case, it might be that the best thing to do is to quietly continue not to take overseas holidays, but not talk about it much.

You could think that it's not important for more good-quality-of-life people to be born and very important for fewer poor-quality-of-life people to be born, or the reverse, or something in between.

Even if you don't care about the global population <em>per se</em>, the population size of individual countries is still important!

Not, like, even relatively normal, or sort of normal, but not <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/59/altruism_isnt_about_sacrifice/\">requiring <em>you</em>, yes <em>you</em>, to sacrifice anything major you wanted out of life</a>[1].</p>\n<p>The Life You Can Save, Giving What We Can, and 80,000 Hours exist to do this. The Centre of Effective Altruism incubated all these organizations, and now they're starting a special project to build the effective altruism movement, and steer its public image, called Effective Altruism Outreach. It's currently being led by <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/user/NielBowerman2\">Niel Bowerman</a>. Your comment is one great concern that Effective Altruism Outreach was specifically started to handle. </p>\n<p>Of course, as effective altruism grows, nobody wants it to become so diluted as a set of ideas that anyone can as validly call themselves an effective altruist as anyone else, without actually doing anything. So, the community itself must reach consensus on some standard, and each individual is responsible for holding themselves to it to maintain the integrity of effective altruism. Rob Wiblin covered this in his keynote address at the 2014 Effective Altruism Summit. As a shorthand, 'anyone giving $10 to Oxfam' was the hypothetical example of what an overly diluted effective altruism might look like. </p>\n<p>The standard thus far seems to be 10% of lifetime income donated to the most effective charity (one can find). Now, this isn't sufficient, so some caveats and distinctions have to be included, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>does this include income before or after taxes?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally, I would qualify this commitment with what each individual effective altruist honestly tries as hard as they can to figure out what the best charity is <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/72/estimation_is_the_best_we_have/\">given their best estimates</a> and <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/8a/cooperation_in_a_movement_supporting_diverse/\">their personal values, even as they differ from those of others</a>. In practice, such research is difficult, so I would recommend looking to evaluations independent of one another, organizationally, and across disciplines, converging upon the same solutions. This is what effective altruism calls <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">cluster thinking</a>, and it's an epistemology <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/87/an_epistemology_for_effective_altruism/\">the effective altruist movement is turning toward</a>. </p>\n<p>Of course, the 10% commitment was chosen as a round number favored historically by the donation standard prescribed by various world religions. How arbitrary it really is, and if effective altruism should rethink it, may be a challenged posed by the possible future success of The Life You Can Save. If the The Life You Can Save, which only encourages people to pledge at least only 1% of their income, ever hits some critical mass in how much awareness it raises, and the amount of money from as many people as possible, that no other effective altruist organization had yet achieved, it may force effective altruism to rethink how it presents itself.</p>\n<p>In a way, the already thousands of effective altruists, hopefully of whom as many as possible will continue to be effective altruists, will demonstrate a cluster-thinking approach to lifestyle design for effective altruists. Effective altruism is a voluntary movement in which, aside from the narrow standard, not yet well-defined, above, one can choose to live how they wish. The commonalities of what makes life more functional for effective altruists will come to light as time passes, so what's 'normal' for effective altruism, while still being 'normal' for the rest of the world at large, will become apparent.</p>\n<p> I wish more effective altruists would share their personal stories, and how they differ not only in their donations, but lifestyle choices, from others. Luckily, effective altruists don't even need their own blogs to do so, as they can post them to this forum. I will indeed make a new thread next time encouraging others to do this.</p>\n<p>[1] The lifestyle written about in that post was written by Jeff Kaufman about the effective altruist lives his wife and himself are leading. They're earning to give, in addition to raising awareness of effective altruism by updating how they build their life with effective altruism in mind, without sacrifice. Since that article was written, Kaufman and Wise have increased how much of their joint income they give from <em>30%</em> to <em>50%</em>, while raising their <em>first child</em>. They may be the best existing example of how <em>normal</em> effective altruism can be for any middle class person.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "xYnfaDhriDqJdkyBS", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "6K4CPYXW8SWiR5ayt", "postedAt": "2014-10-16T08:30:26.923Z", "postId": "7xFQAQrWuH4ye73QS", "htmlBody": "<p>This doesn't surprise me.

The best assessment of that for real will come out with the results of the 2014 effective altruism survey, which are being processed now.

It's easier to schedule those events around a shift at your part-time job, or a single class you have that day, than a business meeting, crucial to your career, the sort of which will become more common in your thirties. There's also a lower cost to social status if young people do things that look weird, and deviate from societal norms, which tend to be set by an older, possibly less active, generation. At a younger age, what individuals lack is soft power, and influence. After all, if they could change things without protest action, surely they would try do so more readily.</p>\n<p>Of course, the older generation, between the ages of 30 and 50, is hardly inactive, really. They just focus on different things, because they have different motivations. This is a time when, keeping up appearances to stay ahead in the rat race, one cannot take as many personal risks without risking career capital. People of this demographic are also more likely to have a large(r) family of dependents, such as young children, and elderly parents. In addition to the high constraints all this may place on time and money, the fact that this is family may cause people to focus less upon distant others. This is understandable. People of this cohort are still altruistic, though. However, upon focusing on their career development, family, and community, they're more likely to support causes that have been brought to their attention by their default circle of influence. They may fund donation drives at their children's school, or at the workplace, they may volunteer locally, and they may count the community involvement they do for fun altruistic in its own right as well. Also, because they have so much to care for, people of prime working age may be minimizing extra costs, such as donated time or money, to hedge against unknown risks such as family emergencies, etc.</p>\n<p>As people age, their children, and other family, are no longer dependent upon them. After retirement, people have more time. Even in the later parts of one's career, before retirement, one may own a business, or be in a position for which one doesn't need to put in extra effort beyond the requirements to stay afloat, or get ahead. Elders have more money to donate to political causes, but they also leave legacy gifts, endowments, and the like. This happens at a time when they're more respected in society as elders, and may have more soft power anyway. Additionally, they either have more money than they'll ever need, or they at least have greater confidence in how secure the money they have saved will support them for the remainder of their lives. Finally, they may think about supporting grander causes in a broader way than what they did with altruism earlier in their life, as they think about how they'll want to be known, and remembered.</p>\n<p>This model above is a hypothesis for a trend. Of course, there will be outliers. Mark Zuckerburg is influencing the world in ways many in their twenties couldn't have dreamed of, while they're still trying to get on the career track. On the converse, it would be crass of us to just assume the typical senior has money they're sitting on that they could give away, when many pensioners themselves are in need. Indeed, I believe that increasing the healthspan of seniors could be considered one of the most effective altruism opportunities available, given the right research, and application of it. Anyway, this model seems simple enough to verify, or falsify, by checking the right sort of data.</p>\n<p>What I'm trying to show is that it seems intuitively plausible that everyone has ideals, and everyone cares, but society drives people to care about different things in different ways over the course of their lives. To a parent, 'ensuring my child grows up happy, healthy, and safe' may be an ideal felt as strongly by a young activist yet without children pushing for some greater equity, or equality, in society. Cynicism of any particular generation doesn't need to be rejected on the basis that it's unattractive; rather, the cynical approach of older generations don't care, or young people are too naive, may not explain as much as simply as this other model.</p>\n<p>Ryan, if you think this hypothesis may hold weight, where could someone access the data to check? If not you, would someone at 80,000 Hours know? I feel as if that if we could figure this out, it could be not only an optimistic but also truer message that, e.g., Will MacAskill could put into his book. For people of any age, effective altruism will be non-conformist. If we can paint a positive picture that everyone cares, and wants to care, about the world, but just socially pushed in different directions, people new to effective altruism might realize that they can get off the hedonic treadmill anytime they like, rethink where they focus their resources for doing good, and find support in others.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "HPy6gv4zqmrwLSfSJ", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "JJHqLLobRvX5uDQzX", "postedAt": "2014-10-17T08:19:34.995Z", "postId": "7xFQAQrWuH4ye73QS", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>I'm sure 80,000 hours does something like this, so it's not new ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are you <em>sure</em> you're sure?
