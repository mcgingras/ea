One facet of the LessWrong feature is that as users pass a certain amount of karma they gain privileges. I believe that high karma users such as Eliezer (on LW) or Peter Hurford (here) can moderate their own posts, even on the frontpage. I think very low karma users may not be able to moderate posts that remain on their personal blog. Given the EA Forum&#x27;s differences in how we treat the personal blog / frontpage distinction, we may want to diverge from LW&#x27;s feature-set here. I haven&#x27;t touched it since I was initially setting up the Forum, and I&#x27;m not sure how I left it. I&#x27;m not sure all of the features are there. Certainly we&#x27;d want to write up a user&#x27;s guide for the feature. I appreciate the comment.
