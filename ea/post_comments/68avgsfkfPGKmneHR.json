From memory, I might explain it this way: We had someone who worked in the AI safety field working with us on content, who I (half-way through) asked to specialize on AI content in particular, meaning that while my attention (as content lead and team lead) was split among causes and also among non-content tasks, his attention was not, resulting in us overall having more attention on AI. We then (over-?)compensated for a dearth of content not-that-long before the conference by sending out a large number of invites based on the lists we'd compiled, which were AI-heavy by that point. That means that we made a choice, under quite severe time/capacity constraints, to compromise on cause diversity for the sake of having abundant content.</p>", "parentCommentId": "gZdfXfwxuizid42Ny", "user": {"username": "David Mears"}}, {"_id": "CWCYPn3tqWZr4pxgK", "postedAt": "2023-07-18T12:31:37.499Z", "postId": "68avgsfkfPGKmneHR", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks so much for the comprehensive and honest reply.
