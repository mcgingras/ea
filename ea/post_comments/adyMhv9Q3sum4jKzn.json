I\u2019m writing quickly on my phone.\nI strong downvoted this post after reading the first 25% of it. Here are some reasons:</p>\n<p>\u201cBayesianism purports that if we find enough confirming evidence we can at some point believe to have found \u201ctruth\u201d.\u201d\nSeems like a mischaracterization, given that sufficient new evidence should be able to change a Bayesian\u2019s mind (tho I don\u2019t know much about the topic).</p>\n<p>\u201cWe cannot guess what knowledge people will create into the future\u201d\nThis is literally false, we can guess at this and we can have a significant degree of accuracy. E.g. I predict that there will be a winner in the 2020 US presidential election, even though I don\u2019t know who it will be. I can guess that there will be computer chips which utilize energy more efficiently than the current state of the art, even though I do not know what such chips will look like (heck I don\u2019t understand current chips).</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t predict the knowledge we will have in the future.  If we could, we would implement that knowledge today\u201d\nStill obviously false. Engineers often know approximately what the final product will look like without figuring out all the details along the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo achieve AGI we will need to program the following:</p>\n<p>knowledge creating processes\nemotions\ncreativity\nfree will\nconsciousness\u201d\nThis is a strong claim which is not obviously true and which you do not defend. I think it is false, as do many readers. I don\u2019t know how to define free will, but it doesn\u2019t seem necessary as you can get the important behavior from just following complex decision processes. Consciousness, likewise, seems hard to define but not necessary for any particular behavior (besides maybe complex introspection which you could define as part of consciousness).</p>\n<p>\u201cReality has no boundary, it is infinite. Remembering this, people and AGI have the potential to solve an infinite number of problems\u201d\nThis doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. There is no rule that says people can solve an infinite number of problems. Again, the claim is not obviously true but is undefended.</p>\n<p>Maybe you won\u2019t care about my disagreements given that I didn\u2019t finish reading. I had a hard time parsing the arguments (I\u2019m confused about the distinction between Bayesian reasoning and fallibilism, and it doesn\u2019t line up with my prior understanding of Bayesianism), and many of the claims I could understand seem false or at least debatable and you assume their true.</p>\n<p>This post is quite long and doesn\u2019t feature a summary, making it difficult to critique without significant time investment.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Aaron_Scher"}}, {"_id": "q9zykYaPP2KdmLo35", "postedAt": "2022-12-18T19:20:48.496Z", "postId": "adyMhv9Q3sum4jKzn", "htmlBody": "<p>I hope I'm wrong, but I suspect people are downvoting this post for not being highly familiar with insider EA jargon and arguments around AI, and pattern matching to 101 level objections like \"machines can't have souls\".&nbsp;</p><p>I do disagree with a lot of the arguments made in the post.

I\u2019m writing quickly on my phone. I strong downvoted this post after reading the first 25% of it. Here are some reasons:</p><p>\u201cBayesianism purports that if we find enough confirming evidence we can at some point believe to have found \u201ctruth\u201d.\u201d Seems like a mischaracterization, given that sufficient new evidence should be able to change a Bayesian\u2019s mind (tho I don\u2019t know much about the topic).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yes, that is how Baysianism works. A Bayesian will change their mind based on either the confirming or disconfirming evidence.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cWe cannot guess what knowledge people will create into the future\u201d This is literally false, we can guess at this and we can have a significant degree of accuracy. E.g. I predict that there will be a winner in the 2020 US presidential election, even though I don\u2019t know who it will be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I agree with you, but you can\u2019t predict this for things that will happen 100 years from now. We may find better ways to govern by then.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I can guess that there will be computer chips which utilize energy more efficiently than the current state of the art, even though I do not know what such chips will look like (heck I don\u2019t understand current chips).<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yes, this is the case if progress continues. But it isn\u2019t inevitable. There are groups attempting to create a society that inhibit progress. If our growth culture changes, our \u201cchip\u201d producing progress could stop. Then any prediction about more efficient chips would be an error.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t predict the knowledge we will have in the future. If we could, we would implement that knowledge today\u201d Still obviously false. Engineers often know approximately what the final product will look like without figuring out all the details along the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yes, that works incrementally. But what the engineers can\u2019t predict is what their next, next renditions of their product will be. And those subsequent steps is what I\u2019m referring to in my essay.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cTo achieve AGI we will need to program the following:</p><p>knowledge creating processes emotions creativity free will consciousness\u201d This is a strong claim which is not obviously true and which you do not defend. I think it is false, as do many readers. I don\u2019t know how to define free will, but it doesn\u2019t seem necessary as you can get the important behavior from just following complex decision processes. Consciousness, likewise, seems hard to define but not necessary for any particular behavior (besides maybe complex introspection which you could define as part of consciousness).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is a large topic and requires much explanation. But in short, what makes a person are those things listed. And AGI will by definitions will be a person.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cReality has no boundary, it is infinite. Remembering this, people and AGI have the potential to solve an infinite number of problems\u201d This doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. There is no rule that says people can solve an infinite number of problems. Again, the claim is not obviously true but is undefended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I agree, the claims in my essay depend on progress and the universe being infinite.</strong></p><p><strong>If you are truly interested in going deep on infinity, have a look at the book \u201cThe Beginning of Infinity\u201d.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you won\u2019t care about my disagreements given that I didn\u2019t finish reading. I had a hard time parsing the arguments (I\u2019m confused about the distinction between Bayesian reasoning and fallibilism, and it doesn\u2019t line up with my prior understanding of Bayesianism), and many of the claims I could understand seem false or at least debatable and you assume their true.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yes, each of my claims are debatable and contain errors. They are fallible as are all our ideas. And I appreciate you stress testing them, you brought up many important points.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This post is quite long and doesn\u2019t feature a summary, making it difficult to critique without significant time investment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is a challenge, most of these theories need much more detailed explanation, Not less.
