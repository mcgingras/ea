I appreciate you sharing your thoughts and using this forum to engage with the EA community.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll use my own number system separate from yours so it doesn't get too confusing if you want to respond.</p><p>1. To summarize my personal thoughts, it's plausible that people <i>should</i> return unspent money (I'm mostly unsure but lean towards disagree). But if what you're saying is that people should return FTX Future Fund money that they've spent (and therefore go into personal debt), I disagree.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Regarding your #5, could you give examples of people giving \"zero empathy for the individuals who put money/crypto on the FTX exchange and then were criminally defrauded by FTX\"? And could you give examples of \"Those people do not seem to count to the EA community\"? I feel like most posts I've read about this have mentioned people feeling terrible about the effects on innocent people who lost money to FTX. I agree that the harm suffered by them is far greater than any harm to the EA community.</p><p>&nbsp;For some examples off the top of my head, there's the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1\">Future Fund team's post</a> (\"Our hearts go out to the thousands of FTX customers whose finances may have been jeopardized or destroyed.\"), &nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WAA9jborjiXqczsTk/thoughts-on-ftx-and-returning-to-our-ideals\"> Michel's post</a> &nbsp;(\"people's lives got ruined...\"), <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT/a-personal-statement-on-ftx\">Will's post</a> (\"... that may cost many thousands of people their savings...\"), <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHrHsrQGyr4NnqCA7/we-must-be-very-clear-fraud-in-the-service-of-effective\">evhub's post</a> (\"People's life savings and careers...\"), <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/txGgPvKgZFpphdkHe/my-reaction-to-ftx-appalled\">Rob Wiblin's post</a> (\"Most importantly FTX's depositors... may lose savings they and their families were relying on...\"), and <a href=\"https://many customers are unable to retrieve funds held by FTX\">Rethink Priorities' Leadership Statement</a> (\"many customers are unable to retrieve funds held by FTX\").&nbsp;</p><p>3. It would help if you could spell out your exact logic here. The next few questions are sub-questions/specifics I fail to understand. Feel free to answer them specifically or just spell out your logic cohesively if you think that would answer all my questions.</p><p>3a. I (and every EA I'm aware of) agree that depositors in FTX who've lost their money are victims here. If FTX Future Fund recipients paid back all their money (including spent money), most would be in financial problems and be victims as well. What good would that do? And why should the recipients pay back the money and not the organizations that they paid their money to?&nbsp;</p><p>3a. How does this apply to money that had been spent before the FTX news came out? Many individuals or organizations would need to pay back thousands (or tens of thousands) of dollars that they don't have. FTX grantees who would face financial ruin as a result would also be victims here.&nbsp;</p><p>3c. Would you then agree that all organizations and celebrities that were paid by FTX should pay back whatever money they got? Including sponsorships like the Miami Heat, &nbsp;TSM (the e-sports team), and Stephen Curry? And the electrical company and janitors in the Bahamas paid by FTX? And other employees of FTX (uninvolved and unaware of the scandal) who received a salary?</p><p>3d. If your answer to 3c is that some parties shouldn't have to pay back money, then why? &nbsp;I really encourage you to think about why this should apply to the people and organizations who used or are using the money they received to fund charitable causes. Why is the financial burden on them?</p><p>3e. Is your logic affected by how the amount of money FTX grantees received compares to the amount of money owed to depositors? By my best findings, it seems like over $8 billion is owed back (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/business/ftx-bankruptcy.html\">New York Times</a>, \"The run on FTX...\"), and the FTX Foundation gave away $140 million (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/business/ftx-effective-altruism.html\">New York Times</a>, \"as recently as last month...\"). $140 mil divided by $8 bil is just under 2%. If all that $140 million is given back, then 98% of money owed will be remaining. The vast majority of depositors will still be financial affected, and now suddenly hundreds (if not more) of recipients &nbsp;of FTX Foundation grants will be financially affected.</p><p>Thank you!</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "oPQwfYgzBEpBjYejJ", "postedAt": "2022-11-28T10:33:36.284Z", "postId": "WAdeKMDs4m3koPGYK", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi NunoSempre, grants given before <i>when</i> are the result of fraud?

FTX grantees aren't a monolith, the feasibility of returning the money will vary significantly, and while most of the retail investors were not at fault, nor were most of the FTX grantees. I think I'd consider a claim like \"All FTX grantees should return money regardless of their personal situation\" to be supererogatory, and not a moral requirement (you may have scenarios where a grantee is just taking the place of another victim, through no fault of their own, and it's unclear how this is actually net positive or fair, because neither victim is more 'blameworthy'). I'd be interested if you think otherwise.

If your argument is about legal proceedings, then I'm hopeful that EAs will follow the law here, and I would condemn EAs who tried to keep the money if it was against the law to. If your argument is about something like - \"doing right by retail investors\", then I think you still have to make a case that the retail investors are now the strongest focus of moral obligation for all grantees for that pool of money (though I think that could easily be true for some or even most grantees).&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also not casting around for rationalizations to keep the grant money because I've never received an FTX grant.<br><br>3.<br>I didn't claim that grant recipients are equal victims to FTX's depositors, I said there could be scenarios where a grantee takes the place of another victim, through no fault of their own.

A better analogy might be: you apply to a scholarship to college. you successfully get this scholarship, and then 2 weeks into college, you find out that Gaddafi funded your scholarship. Should you now decline your scholarship? Now you find out that half of all the college entrance scholarships in your country was funded by Gaddafi, but you're not actually required to pay it back legally - but a third party is starting a process that allows you to pay it back, should you choose to. Should all those people be morally obliged to return their scholarships, regardless of the situation? What if you can't go to college if you didn't have this scholarship? What if 75% of the money wasn't going to go back to the people harmed by Gaddafi if you declined the scholarship, but kept by the third party? What if you thought you could do better than 75% if you didn't voluntarily return the money? I mean this is also not a great analogy but I'm mainly trying to illustrate why you could have recipients of grants also be a victim, as well as why modelling grants as wallets that a stranger throws you while running away isn't great.<br><br>FWIW, I think if you're not going to face major financial issues, then I do think it's likely morally preferable to return the money than not, all else equal. And I think if you would be in a financially stable situation if you return the money and choose not to, then you should be very careful about the reasoning for your justification, because it would be very easy for there to be some degree of motivated reasoning.

It matters not that they did not know at the time they received it that it was stolen.  They know now and yet are retaining the money rather than returning the money to its rightful owners.</p>\n<p>In many jurisdictions retaining know stolen property is a crime (not talking about <em>receiving</em> stolen property - there you do have to know at the time you received it that it was stolen; talking about <em>retaining</em> known stolen property once you know it is stolen - that is an independent crime).  Look for example at Model Penal Code 223.6(1) \u201cA person is guilty of theft if he purposely \u2026 retains or disposes of \u2026 property of another knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it probably has been stolen, unless the property is \u2026 retained, or disposed with purpose to restore it to the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Imagine you are a grant recipient, and in two years are in court trying to explain why you kept the grant money and then spent it, after you were on notice that it was likely stolen funds.</p>\n<p>Right now there is a window where people can freely choose to do the right thing, or not.

But I think there are others that look more like this:</p><p>Thief steals $3000. Thief gets in a car crash. Thief takes car to Innocent Mechanic, who spends significant time and resources repairing the car pursuant to a contract with Thief (without knowledge the money was stolen). Thief pays Innocent Mechanic with the $3000 and picks up the car. Thief is caught, has a heart attack (crashing the car which is now worthless), and dies without a penny to his name. Innocent Victim comes in and demands the $3000 back. Innocent Mechanic asserts the right to be compensated for the work he has performed in good faith and without knowledge his fee was stolen.</p><p>Either Innocent Mechanic or Innocent Victim is going to get unfairly screwed here. Assuming he is actually innocent, I think it is OK for Innocent Mechanic to keep the money. Although I feel bad for Innocent Victim, it's necessary for the smooth functioning of society that workers are confident they will be able to keep fair wages for the work they performed. That's why mechanics' liens exist, for instance, and why unpaid wages get priority treatment in bankruptcy. So if you (1) told me this story, (2) told me there was a 1/10 chance I was Innocent Mechnic, a 1/10 chance I was Innocent Victim, and a 8/10 chance I was random member of society, and (3) made me decide who should suffer the loss -- I would have said Innocent Victim. That has nothing to do with what I think of the merits of the grants at issue here.</p><p>Just saw your clarification -- I don't think it matters that there was no economic benefit to the grantor; the detriment to the grantee is sufficient to establish the grantee's legitimate interest in retaining the money (to the extent of that detriment). Charities serve important social functions. While I do not generally think charities should get <i>privileged </i>status compared to other transferees, I generally don't think they should get inferior status either. Hence my inclination to treat them like other vendors here.</p>", "parentCommentId": "3kWKLey3k2BdJzxFc", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "giyDfGTrXpFLdLwnw", "postedAt": "2022-11-29T09:14:57.561Z", "postId": "WAdeKMDs4m3koPGYK", "htmlBody": "<p>Oof, yes</p>", "parentCommentId": "ik797tSTEeQvYwprL", "user": {"username": "NunoSempere"}}, {"_id": "K7iFHpxbweTRMK3mK", "postedAt": "2022-11-29T09:17:00.454Z", "postId": "WAdeKMDs4m3koPGYK", "htmlBody": "<p>Sorry, had a typo, grants given before mid-year probably are NOT the result of fraud.
