I did not pay much attention to this lawsuit since I classified it in my head as a climate change thing, and climate change is much more crowded than other high-impact future causes. Based on what I know of the U.S. legal system, though, having a lawsuit recognize future generations' claims would be a pretty big deal and probably very good for far future causes in general. I'm glad you thought of this.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "zdgroff"}}, {"_id": "7dexGYrQsPirCt9G6", "postedAt": "2018-01-25T03:21:02.971Z", "postId": "CQqxXFrY2dqbkCWKR", "htmlBody": "<p>I haven't read about this case, but some context: This has been an issue in environmental cases for a while.
