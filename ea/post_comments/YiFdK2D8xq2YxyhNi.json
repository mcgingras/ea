Even if everyone promises to send receipts afterwards, you still have Byzantine generals' problems.  One idea is that we find someone at CEA who, at the least, can be listed as an email contact to which two donors can send their agreement before they execute, just so there's a records and so the CEA person can point out any obvious confusion.
