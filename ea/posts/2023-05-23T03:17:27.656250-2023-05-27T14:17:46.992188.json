Open Philanthropy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/open-philanthropy-ai-worldviews-contest\"><u>defines</u></a> AGI as \u201cAI that can quickly and affordably be trained to perform nearly all economically and strategically valuable tasks at roughly human cost or less.\u201d According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, \u201cOur mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence\u2014AI systems that are generally smarter than humans\u2014benefits all of humanity.\u201d Critics of OpenAI\u2019s ambitions often cite the risk of Unaligned Artificial Superintelligence, an AGI which is more intelligent than humanity to the point of being able to overthrow world governments and inflict catastrophic damage, for example by using nuclear weapons or bioweapons.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view, the severity of these concerns are based on incorrect assumptions. The implicit (if not explicit) attitude of Silicon Valley is one of indefinite growth. For good or for ill, they consistently believe that the trends of new technological research will continue at the current pace and direction that it is heading in the present. If anything, proponents of fast AGI believe that the rate of innovation is likely to be faster in the future than in the present. The purpose of this three-part series is to argue the opposite. I collect both empirical data about past progress in machine learning and an object-level description of the methods which have produced this progress. Using both, I argue that the varying methods used to achieve the current pace of machine learning progress will follow a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function\"><u>peaking S-curve</u></a>; they have largely either stagnated or will likely stagnate within the next ten years.&nbsp;</p><p>While exact predictions about the year AGI is invented, or whether it is invented at all, also depend on other factors such as the complexity of human thinking, the homogeneity of tasks, and the difficulty of information aggregation in institutions, what is certain is that the speed of AI development is an important factor. I believe that Effective Altruists generally overestimate the speed of future AI development and should consequently significantly reduce their estimates on the speed and likelihood of AGI development after this essay.</p><h2>Parallelization</h2><p>To understand the rate of machine learning progress, we have to understand how it is achieved. The single most important mechanism used to enhance AI across hardware, software, and data layers has been&nbsp;<i>parallelization</i>, the simultaneous processing of different actions. The underlying principle is simple: doing multiple things at once is faster than doing them one at a time. Examples of practical ideas to speed up machine learning using this principle are creating hardware which processes entire arrays of operations simultaneously, splitting processes within a model into independently functioning components, or combining multiple models. A convenient feature of machine learning algorithms is that they can be parallelized in several ways. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Large matrix and vector multiplications can be parallelized at the hardware level</li><li>Different components of a machine learning network, which can be run separately without dependencies on each other, can be run on different pieces of hardware</li><li>The substance that is actually being processed can be subdivided. For example, a self-driving vehicle may need to avoid both moving vehicles and static obstacles, which may be more efficient to process separately.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/xsw6ciifxcz0bboi4ozy\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/qqb81zey9cmc1aafkgks 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/mjcy4avsn3ji7j3tt47g 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/jnfuwnxwqjwtqnxfomol 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/zgn3uchuijhupbpfixcb 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/a7idijd4tiwd12pmyjtb 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/e8bc4x42pw3wy56uhvcj 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/dyqkef7jpv0e148pw1al 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/xr55zwrlsw9o3levf3x8 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/y1lsgswt0ul7j5zehzkv 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/gucudeggjqvlzitvmked 1518w\"></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/techniques-for-training-large-neural-networks\"><u>https://openai.com/research/techniques-for-training-large-neural-networks</u></a></p><p>This article will focus on optimizations to machine learning hardware, including parallelization. Optimization of software and data usage will be discussed in later parts. You will definitely see the theme of parallelization appear frequently, so it\u2019s good to start building an intuition about it.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to hardware, the primary reason why parallelization is important is due to low level vector and matrix operations. You can think of a vector as a list of numbers. To find the sum of two vectors of the same length, you add the first two elements of the list together, then the second elements, and so on. The same is true for the (dot) product. You can process each of these additions separately, as is intuitive.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/qyr6rzvnkax67rxnxtu9\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/xrh7dwy8xhbihzmkitul 99w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/waszrliajdw0og9yw0b5 179w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/u1i8bisure3qyytkiwz0 259w\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Add-or-Subtract-Vectors\"><u>https://www.wikihow.com/Add-or-Subtract-Vectors</u></a></p><p>Matrix operations work the same way, except in two dimensions. Matrix multiplications essentially apply vector multiplication to pairs of rows in the first matrix and columns in the second matrix (or vice versa). The details are not too important for this article.</p><p>In the context of this article, the key takeaway from this section is that machine learning involves doing large quantities of repetitive math on rows or grids of numbers, which can be processed simultaneously.</p><h2>A Paradigm Shift in Hardware</h2><p>Specialized hardware for machine learning is a relatively new phenomenon. For much of history, machine learning has relied on the same hardware as everything else: CPUs (Central Processing Units), which aren\u2019t capable of much parallelization. They got an upgrade later through GPUs (Graphical Processing Units), which as the name suggests, were designed for rendering detailed graphics more efficiently. Finally, the last few years marked the development of more specialized ways to use GPUs, as well as completely specialized hardware such as Google\u2019s TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Each of these developments are increasingly efficient solutions to the problem of multiplying many numbers in parallel.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/gj3amy3liprwkybxuocy\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/f4c2mkxdd8v4mbgkkdp7 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/be4p6xf65hxcenookfam 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/prkx322bykctrczqblxg 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/zwtr2lfi4f2lrckyokoa 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/rjagccysjcdxniy8ybke 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/pckctdb6ud8lry71k7yk 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/ympj8ufew8v8g592sphc 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/etsde0oey81apdqlryp0 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/qvklpeyoocwdriz9noti 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/vnws1gxmkb3nnv2u6hjc 1600w\"></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/compute-trends\"><u>https://epochai.org/blog/compute-trends</u></a>. You\u2019ll see this again in the quantifying progress section.</p><p>There were two key points in machine learning hardware development: the introduction of graphical hardware and later specialized libraries for machine learning. When GPUs were adopted for machine learning, they resulted in an immediate several fold increase of both training and inference (answering) speeds relative to the CPUs of most computers, which only increased with further development. In 2007, NVIDIA introduced the first version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA\"><u>CUDA</u></a> (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a programming tool for GPUs (Graphical Processor Units). Cuda was a crucial innovation for the development of machine learning because it allowed easy modification of the hardware-level instructions of GPUs.&nbsp;</p><p>[ Aside: One pet peeve for me is when people strongly emphasize&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\"><u>Moore\u2019s law</u></a> in their arguments about machine learning hardware. Moore\u2019s law, which measures transistor density, mostly measures materials science developments in how small and compact transistors can be manufactured. On the other hand, the majority of hardware improvement in machine learning has been due to completely unrelated developments in the organization of specialized hardware used for parallelization.]</p><p>Here comes the second crucial factor of hardware optimization. When thinking about the effectiveness of computer hardware, it\u2019s important to understand that hardware does not understand complicated programming languages such as python or javascript, languages which many humans know how to write. Instead, intermediate programs (interpreters, compilers, assemblers) are used to translate human programming languages into increasingly repetitive and specific languages until they become hardware-readable machine code. This translation is typically done through strict, unambiguous rules, which is good from an organizational and cleanliness perspective, but often results in code which consumes orders of magnitude more low-level instructions (and consequently, time) than if they were hand-translated by a human. This problem is amplified when those compilers do not understand that they are optimizing for machine learning: compilation protocols optimized to render graphics, or worse for CPUs, are far slower.&nbsp;</p><p>An analogy is as follows: imagine taking the world\u2019s most powerful nuclear power plant and funneling all of its electricity to running the world\u2019s largest flashlight. Then, the flashlight is shined on a gigantic array of solar panels in order to finally deliver energy to the public. This process would obviously be highly inefficient and lose energy in all of its intermediate processes. The same can be said for intermediate steps in compilation.</p><p>These inefficiencies were removed as people began developing more specific practices for machine learning, including both detailed instruction sets for well-known machine learning network operations (CUDA kernels), as well as hardware specialized solely for machine learning, such as Google\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit\"><u>TPUs</u></a> (Tensor Processing Units). There is no precise public timeline for when this development began to be taken seriously, but there are approximates. NVIDIA\u2019s library for developing CUDA for machine learning, CUDNN, was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/news/2014/09/cudnn/\"><u>released</u></a> in 2014. Google\u2019s TPUs were introduced to the public in 2016. Most researchers and engineers tend to agree that the early-mid 2010s were when ML hardware began to be taken seriously.</p><p>[Note: Some researchers would not consider CUDA optimization to be hardware optimization. It is technically a change in what software is being run. However, for the purposes of categorizing / pacing this series of articles, it makes more sense to put it here than to put it with the changes in algorithms covered in the next article in this series.]</p><h2>Quantifying Hardware Improvement</h2><p>As with any quantitative argument, the first questions you should ask are \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d. Metrics for machine learning performance are typically separated into two categories: training and inference. Training refers to the initial step in which a machine learning model receives feedback from data and improves its accuracy. Interference is the step in which the user actually interacts with the network, i.e. when you ask ChatGPT a question. There are several related metrics often used to quantify machine learning speed:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Throughput: the amount of data processed per second</li><li>Efficiency: the amount of data processed per watt</li><li>Cost-effectiveness: the amount of data processed per dollar</li></ul><p>Sometimes the amount of data is replaced with the number of operations, but this is typically unimportant. Moreover, while differences between these metrics matter for technical tradeoffs and use cases, it is extremely unlikely that one of these metrics will drastically improve far beyond the other two. Consequently, I use \u201cspeed\u201d as a vague umbrella term for all of these measures. However, the difference metrics does mean it will be somewhat difficult to precisely compare different data sources though.</p><p>What makes compiling these data sources far more annoying though, is the \u201chow\u201d. When referring to the earlier benchmarks, I used the term \u201cmodel\u201d instead of hardware. This is because different models, or machine learning algorithm structures, differ in speed. Machine learning hardware comparisons are made using a fixed set of models and training data. However, different studies use different models and data. So, keep in mind that you can\u2019t simply list the numbers in each of the studies into one big ranking, you can only use the relative performance of different hardware in the same study as an approximate metric. Another reason these comparisons may vary based on methodology is that hardware is often optimized for different results. They may be optimized for training or inference (responding to queries from the user). All of this is to say that while it is possible to look at broad trends, looking at the precise tradeoffs along the efficient frontier, as on-the-ground ML companies do when making purchases, is beyond the scope of this article.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead the main point of this section is to ground expectations and future claims in some empirical data. The existing data is far from complete to draw an unambiguous conclusion; instead we will need to use a combination of the data and a technical understanding of the underlying causes of machine learning progress. I don\u2019t expect anyone to draw a definite conclusion from what is presented here, but to at least narrow the range of possibilities slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, onto the data. This is arguably the highest quality paper on hardware comparison over time:</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04979.pdf\"><u>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04979.pdf</u></a></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/qhsbhwznkcmwz8phgnlr\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/uhnk4gfhclo1qasak7sh 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/auwngaegrq4ivnkch9cw 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/frwf6hjfdn1vcres5zcd 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/fwejwn8xvhtc9ec8ij3w 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/yygpcledypdju8ianpgi 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/xhoulns5mqpaufler2x5 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/jmvhw8qsao0sjdyiirpp 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/tjwejk5jitfwwpp4soao 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/dqydnejosj9iwumt6zzk 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wdxMmSnK5JscvuK35/xfuzljrdwdhk01zydnlj 1600w\"></p><p>Pay particular attention to the bottom row. For products targeted towards individual users, improvement is highest in the most recent hardware, RTX 2060 SUPER (2019). However, in industry products, improvement is higher in hardware released in the middle years, P100 (2016) and V100 (2017).&nbsp;</p><p>In my view, this represents a lag in consumer-end products hitting the efficient frontier of hardware tradeoffs that matches what I hear from machine learning researchers and engineers.</p><p>Here are some comparisons of newer releases, both consumer and

However, this data point is higher quality than most and is still useful in identifying trends. We can observe roughly similar changes in development trends as in the hardware trends.</p><p>At this point I\u2019d like to remind everyone of the basic principle that scientific evidence is a negative test, not a positive test. It\u2019s fairly common for someone to gather a bunch of data points, give a narrative that aligns with them, and then pretend that the evidence they\u2019ve provided shows that their narrative is the only possible one. The purpose of this section is to show that the limited evidence up to the current day matches up with any narratives I tell in this article / later articles.</p><h2>The Kernel Curse</h2><p>This section covers the optimization of CUDA kernels, or machine learning instruction sets written specifically for smaller components used in an ML model. While CUDA does refer to the specific set of instructions released by NVIDIA, the same principles for optimization apply for alternative instruction sets, such as those from Google or OpenAI.</p><p>Recall the metaphor of the nuclear power plant and the flashlight. You can only remove the flashlight and directly convert nuclear to electricity once. This intuition mostly holds for low-level instruction optimization. It may be the case that a better software engineer can write a slightly faster instruction set than a junior engineer for the same machine learning operation. But the gap between the two is miniscule compared to the gap between the junior engineer and an auto-generated instruction set.&nbsp;</p><p>A feature of CUDA optimization is that it is typically hyper-specific to individual machine learning kernels. This is a double edged sword: research and development efforts concentrate on experimenting using functions that have optimized instruction sets and (relatively) neglects those that do not. This incentivizes an iterative model of optimization, and means that if a model requiring new functions is adopted, there will be some time until it reaches the level of CUDA optimization of incumbent models.&nbsp;</p><h2>Parallelization and Resource Constraints</h2><p>The first obvious consequence of parallelization is that in many cases*, the amount of computation occurs, but is simply distributed over more hardware. Moreover, data transfer time represents a nontrivial amount of time and electricity consumption, so more aggregate energy/time-device is being spent. Historically, resource constraints have not posed a significant limitation on the scaling that can be done through parallelization, at least for top research organizations. Instead talent, or more specifically the ability to separate processes within machine learning networks was the constraint. This is about to change.</p><p>[*It is true that there are cases where parallelization is done in a way which makes the overall algorithm more efficient, such as sparse matrix multiplication. However, this is primarily done at the algorithmic rather than hardware level. I will likely discuss this in more detail in the second article. ]</p><p>Semianalysis once again has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.semianalysis.com/p/the-ai-brick-wall-a-practical-limit\"><u>an estimate</u></a> for the costs of further scaling up models:</p><blockquote><p>Regarding parameter counts growth, the industry is already reaching the limits for current hardware with dense models\u2014a 1 trillion parameter model costs ~$300 million to train. With 100,000 A100s across 12,500 HGX / DGX systems, this would take about ~3 months to train. This is certainly within the realm of feasibility with current hardware for the largest tech companies. The cluster hardware costs would be a few billion dollars, which fits within the datacenter Capex budgets of titans like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, Google, Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another order of magnitude scaling would take us to 10 trillion parameters. The training costs using hourly rates would scale to ~$30 billion. Even with 1 million A100s across 125,000 HGX / DGX systems, training this model would take over two years.</p><p>They later raise correctly that improvements to model architecture can make training more efficient and push out this boundary. However, this is nonetheless an example of an avenue for unconstrained growth turning into a tradeoff.&nbsp;</p><p>Parallelization sits as the unifying goal of many ML engineers. It is an obvious, direct way to generate improvements. As the constraint moves from technical talent to physical cost of the large arrays of hardware, it is likely that a change in approach is necessary.&nbsp;</p><h2>Meta-Trends</h2><p>To summarize the key points from the article:</p><ul><li>Machine learning involves repetitive operations which can be processed simultaneously (parallelization)</li><li>The goal of hardware optimization is often parallization</li><li>The widespread development of machine learning hardware started in mid-early 2010s and a significant advance in investment and progress occurred in the late 2010s</li><li>CUDA optimization, or optimization of low-level instruction sets for machine learning operations (kernels), generated significant improvements but has exhausted its low-hanging fruit</li><li>The development of specialized hardware and instruction sets for certain kernels leads to fracturing and incentivizes incremental development, since newer kernels will be unoptimized and consequently slower</li><li>The tradeoff between hardware cost and labor cost is only beginning to be reached and will lead to an additional constraint on AI development.</li></ul><p>I believe similar patterns of deceleration are at play across all of machine learning. I\u2019ll make the case for these patterns in the context of architecture (algorithms) in part two and data in part three. The implications are significant:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>AI progress in general is slowing down or close to slowing down.&nbsp;</li><li>AGI is unlikely to be reached in the near future (in my view &lt;5% by 2043).</li><li>Economic forecasts of AI impacts should assume that AI capabilities are relatively close to the current day capabilities</li><li>Overregulation, particularly restriction on access rather than development, risks stomping out AI progress altogether. AI progress is neither inevitable nor infinite.</li></ul><p>It is true that in some cases, a slowdown in growth in one area is counteracted by newly discovered growth in other areas. Technological innovation in manufacturing, transport, chemistry, medicine, and many other fields have drastically slowed, if not stagnated completely, in the present day. Even the famous Moore\u2019s law, describing transistor density, has had to repeatedly lengthen its doubling period due to slowing technological growth.</p><p>None of this is to downplay the economic impacts of machine learning technology. Even the widespread application and adoption of current ML models with zero further improvement would be an economic revolution. Instead, it is to oppose the confident assertion that machine learning progress will only further accelerate in the future. That is one possible scenario, though it is far from guaranteed and in my view, for the reasons stated in this part and future parts, an improbable one. When the general narrative and esoteric data conflict, it is often difficult to determine which one is correct. However, when they both align, they should be taken as a baseline which requires truly exceptional circumstances to overcome.&nbsp;</p><p>The stakes are high, but they are bidirectional. There are real consequences for overcorrection and undercorrection.

At the core of this important work in Africa are passionate and dedicated animal advocacy organisations, many of whom are small, under-funded yet vibrant groups working hard to eradicate battery cages one at a time. Open Wing Alliance and Animal Advocacy Africa work with three of these organisations, <a href=\"http://www.animalwelfareafrica.org/\"><u>Education for African Animal Welfare</u></a> from Tanzania, <a href=\"https://www.animalwelfareleague.org/\"><u>Animal Welfare League</u></a> from Ghana, and <a href=\"https://sibanyezim.org/\"><u>Sibanye Animal Welfare and Conservancy Trust</u></a> from Zimbabwe, who shared their experiences with us; walking us through what it is like to run cage free campaigns in their countries.\" Read the full article <a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/blog/running-cage-free-programmes-in-africa-case-studies-of-three-africa-animal-welfare-organizations\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p><strong>How did you start doing cage-free work?</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.animalwelfareleague.org/\"><u>Animal Welfare League</u></a> began doing cage-free work in early 2022 when our organisation was accepted as a member of the Open Wing Alliance.&nbsp;</p><p><i>We first began our work by identifying three vital stakeholders for the success of our cage-free programme; consumers, farmers, and corporations. Our key activities then involved reaching out to these three groups of people.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Consumers: We reached out to consumers through social media campaigns (employing graphic designs that depict the suffering of birds in cages) and community outreach programs. Specifically targeting the Ghanaian population, we launched a social media campaign last year on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook against the use of battery cages and patronage of poultry products originating from caged farms.</i></p><p><i>Farmers: We work with farmers through various farmer associations across Ghana, using veterinary services directorate of Ghana, regional veterinary officers, and other resource persons to organise educational workshops on cage-free farming. We use pre- and post-survey forms, individual interviews, and an open forum to understand farmers' concerns in the region.</i></p><p><i>Corporations: We emailed staff members at corporations, seeking preliminary in-person meetings. At these preliminary meetings, we emphasised hen welfare and how they, as a corporation, could play a vital role in improving the welfare of hens.</i></p><p><strong>What are your successes and milestones in cage free work?</strong></p><p><i>On 1st March 2023, we had a successful workshop with poultry farmers in the capital of Ghana, Accra on the theme \u201cImproving poultry welfare and productivity in Ghana\u201d which emphasised the creation of a network of farmers in the region who will be trained in higher welfare cage-free production. After the workshop, 76.7% of participating farmers embraced the cage-free farming system with 21 farmers signing on to our national cage-free farms' directory. Two farmers indicated that they would transition from using battery cages to a cage-free production system. We estimate that this measure will prevent at least 50,000 laying hens from the cruelty of being housed in cages.</i></p><p><i>We also collated the email addresses of over 15 corporations and had preliminary meetings with six companies. After two in-person meetings with two hotels in Ghana, they expressed an interest in adopting a cage-free policy. We remain optimistic that we will get a minimum of 3 corporations signing a cage-free policy before the end of 2023.</i></p><p><strong>What are the things that surprised you (positively or negatively) in the course of your work?</strong></p><p><i>One surprising thing was the fact that farmers were willing to transition from battery cages to cage-free farming methods throughout our workshops. However, most corporations we have targeted do not check their emails or have inactive emails, making it very hard to reach them.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are some aspects of your work that have not worked out as well as you\u2019d hoped?</strong></p><p><i>Using emails as our initial corporate outreach method did not provide the results we had expected as most of the companies we contacted did not respond. We have established that having in-person meetings with them works much better.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What have you found challenging or encouraging in the course of your work?</strong></p><p><i>Navigating corporate dialogues with companies that expressed interest in adopting better animal welfare policies but have not yet decided on commitment timelines. We found the warm reception of the cage-free message from most farmers and the Ghanaian people encouraging as we believe they are an ally in achieving better welfare standards.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are some of the important takeaways or lessons you\u2019ve learnt from doing this work?</strong></p><p><i>After several attempts to reach some corporations via email and failing over and over again, we realised it was much easier to gain an audience by showing up at their reception, stating our purpose, and seeking an audience with the appropriate staff should they be available or book an appointment if they weren\u2019t.</i></p><p><i>We have also learned that mapping out key stakeholders in our campaigns and engaging them individually, in a holistic manner produces the best results.</i></p><p><i>In gathering resources and information for this project, we realised a lack thereof in Africa. Through this and other mediums, we will publish our resources to ease the replication and modification of similar works in Africa</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What would you recommend to others working in this space in African countries e.g. skills, resources, connections that have helped you?</strong></p><p><i>We recommend they understand the concerns of stakeholders involved in cage-free farming.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Use the essential resource materials provided by OWA and reach out to other organisations that have extensive work and experience to learn from their successes and weaknesses. We also recommend understanding and drawing up the theory of change of their programs at the planning stage. This gives an idea of the gaps that exist in your country and what activities you can focus on to achieve the ultimate goal of no cruelty to farmed animals.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you wish you had known before doing cage free work?</strong></p><p><i>From a global perspective, we understood how cage-free work is done but there was no local context of the various strategies used in cage-free work because farmed animal welfare is neglected in Ghana, and across the region.

The field of <a href=\"https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/biomimetic-design-10-examples-of-nature-inspiring-technology/\">biomimetic design</a> seeks engineering inspiration from the evolved adaptations in plants or animals that have already work pretty well to solve particular problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Biomimetic design has already proven useful in AI capabilities research. Artificial neural networks were inspired by natural neural networks. Convolutional neural networks were inspired by the connectivity patterns in the visual cortex. Reinforcement learning algorithms were inspired by operant conditioning and reinforcement learning principles in animals. My own research in the early 1990s on evolving neural network architectures using genetic algorithms was directly inspired by the evolution of animal nervous systems (see <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=vEqE_rUAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=vEqE_rUAAAAJ:xii_ZKWM4-0C\">this</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=vEqE_rUAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=vEqE_rUAAAAJ:nU66GSXDKhoC\">this</a>, and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=vEqE_rUAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=vEqE_rUAAAAJ:xa5BkEQK8BgC\">this</a>.)</p><p>If biomimetic insights have helped with AI capabilities research, could biomimetic insights also help with AI safety research? Is there something like a biological analogy of the AI alignment problem that evolution has already solved somehow? Could such an analogy help keep us from going extinct in the next several decades?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Animal brains as superintelligences compared to animal genes</strong></p><p>In this post I\u2019ll develop the argument that there is evolutionary analogy to the alignment problem that might help guide future AI safety research \u2013 or that might caution us that AI alignment is even harder than we realized. This analogy concerns the way that self-replicating DNA (genes, genotypes) has to get evolved sensory-neural-motor systems (animal brains) aligned with the evolutionary goal of maximizing the DNA\u2019s reproductive success.&nbsp;</p><p>The key analogy here is that the genes inside animals are to the animal brains that they build as modern humans will be to the superintelligent AI systems that we might build.&nbsp;</p><p>The DNA in an animal \u2018wants\u2019 the animal\u2019s nervous system to implement the \u2018terminal value\u2019 of replicating the DNA, just as modern humans \u2018want\u2019 AI systems to implement our values. Yet the DNA is extremely stupid, slow, perceptually unaware, and behaviorally limited compared to the animal\u2019s nervous system, just as modern humans will be extremely stupid, slow, perceptually unaware, and behaviorally limited compared to superintelligent AI systems.&nbsp;</p><p>The alignment problems are roughly analogous, and have similarly high stakes. If an animal nervous system doesn\u2019t effectively implement the goal of replicating the animal\u2019s DNA through surviving and reproducing, both its DNA and its nervous system will go extinct. Likewise, if a superintelligent AI system doesn\u2019t effectively implement human goals of promoting our survival and reproduction, humans could go extinct. Further, unless the AIs have been able to set up a self-replicating, self-sustaining, self-repairing industrial/computational ecosystem that can survive for many millennia independent of all human support, guidance, and oversight, the AI systems will eventually go extinct too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do genes really \u2018want\u2019? Revealed preferences and adaptations</strong></p><p>Of course, DNA doesn\u2019t really \u2018want\u2019 anything in the way that humans say they \u2018want\u2019 things. But evolutionary biologists for decades have made great progress in understanding animal behavior by flagrantly anthropomorphizing DNA and modeling it <i>as if&nbsp;</i>it wants things. This scientific strategy goes back to the gene-centered revolution in 1960s and 1970s evolutionary biology, including William Hamilton\u2019s 1964 analysis of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness\">inclusive fitness</a>, Robert Trivers\u2019 early-1970s analyses of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection\">sexual selection</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_investment#Trivers'_parental_investment_theory\">parental investment</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_altruism\">reciprocal altruism</a>, E.

Finally, the gene\u2019s-eye perspective became the conceptual foundation of my field, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology\">evolutionary psychology</a>, including extensive analyses of human cognition, motivation, development, learning, emotions, preferences, values, and cultures.&nbsp;</p><p>The modern evolutionary biology understanding of genes, adaptations, and evolutionary fitness is weirdly counter-intuitive \u2013 maybe just as weirdly counter-intuitive as the AI alignment problem itself. Everybody thinks they understand evolution. But most don\u2019t. I\u2019ve taught college evolution courses since 1990, and most students come to class with a highly predictable set of misunderstandings, confusions, errors, and fallacies. Almost none of them start out with any ability to coherently explain how evolutionary selection shapes behavioral adaptations to promote animal fitness.&nbsp;</p><p>One typical confusion centers around whether genes have any \u2018interests\u2019, \u2018values\u2019, or \u2018motivations\u2019. Are we just shamelessly anthropomorphizing little strands of DNA when we talk about the gene\u2019s-eye perspective, or genes being \u2018selfish\u2019 and \u2018trying to replicate themselves\u2019?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, genes obviously don\u2019t have verbally articulated \u2018stated preferences\u2019 in the way that humans do. Genes can\u2019t talk. And they don\u2019t have internal emotions, preferences, or motivations like animals with brains do, so they couldn\u2019t express individual interests even if they had language.&nbsp;</p><p>However, genes can be treated as showing \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference\">revealed preferences\u2019</a>. They evolve a lot of error-correction machinery to reduce their mutation rate, usually as low as they can (the \u2018<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20737227/\">evolutionary reduction principle\u2019</a>), so they apparently prefer not to mutate. They evolve a lot of adaptations to recombine with the best other genes they can (through \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice\">good genes mate choice\u2019</a>), so they apparently prefer to maximize genetic quality in offspring. They evolve a lot of anti-predator defenses, anti-pathogen immune systems, and anti-competitor aggression, so they apparently prefer to live in bodies that last as long as feasible. They evolve a lot of <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691163840/the-cheating-cell\">anti-cancer defenses</a>, so they apparently prefer sustainable long-term self-replication through new bodies (offspring) over short-term runaway cell proliferation within the same body. In fact, every evolved adaptation can be viewed as one type of \u2018revealed preference\u2019 by genes, and for genes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A Cambrian Story</strong></p><p>Imagine your dilemma if you\u2019re an innocent young genotype when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion\">Cambrian explosion</a> happens, about 540 million years ago. Suddenly there are new options for evolving formidable new distance senses like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye\">vision</a> and hearing, for evolving heads with central nervous systems containing hundreds of thousands of neurons (\u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalization\">cephalization</a>\u2019), and for evolving complex new movement patterns and behaviors.&nbsp;</p><p>You could evolve a new-fangled brain that trains itself to do new things, based on \u2018reward signals\u2019 that assess how well you\u2019re doing at the game of life. But these reward signals don\u2019t come from the environment. They\u2019re just your brain\u2019s best guess at what might be useful to optimize, based on environmental cues of success or failure.&nbsp;</p><p>What counts as success or failure? You have no idea. You have to make guesses about what counts as \u2018reward\u2019 or \u2018punishment\u2019, by wiring up your perceptual systems in a way that assigns a valence (positive or negative) to each situation that seems like it might be important to survival or reproduction. You might make a guess that swimming towards a bigger animal with sharp teeth should be counted as a \u2018reward\u2019, and then your reinforcement learning system will get better and better at doing that\u2026 until you get eaten, and your genes die out. Or you might make a guess that swimming towards from an organism with visible traits X, Y, and Z should be counted as a \u2018punishment\u2019, and then your reinforcement learning system will make you better and better at avoiding such organisms\u2026. But unfortunately, traits X, Y, and Z happen to specify fertile opposite-sex members of your own species, so you never mate, and your genes die out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/ix5ddnu0chuahyizhg6x\" alt=\"Opabinia | Prehistoric Earth Wiki | Fandom\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/munzt1cmtak6uh5nttgf 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/k74wasqromll040sh9h4 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/fb9fegpyvlstyyoh5hir 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/z6ht8tioopa9v0pxaudw 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/rsrhikek8kpv0wizorch 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/y1399view48svnlu88wy 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/geycb55cpm1epxujsxnn 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/xzetbfaza42ijsukmk9e 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/aimuygbbchdrulnoy4uu 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/ewu4a9ao8pdmp00nxlil 1128w\"></p><p><i>Example Cambrian animal: </i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opabinia\"><i>Opabinia regalis</i></a><i>, c. 505 million years ago, 7 cm long, living on the seafloor, fossilized in the Burgess Shale</i></p><p>Whatever your reward system happens to treat as a reward is what you\u2019ll get better at pursuing; whatever your reward system happens to treat as a punishment is what you\u2019ll get better at avoiding.

They used a genetic algorithm to evolve neural networks that guide the behavior of simulated autonomous creatures with limited visual inputs, in a simple virtual world with simulated carnivores, food, and obstacles. The creatures\u2019 neural networks had two components: an \u2018action network\u2019 that maps from sensory input cues to output behaviors, and an \u2018evaluation network\u2019 that maps from sensory input cues to an evaluation metric that guides reinforcement back-propagation learning. Simulated genes specify the initial weights in the action network and the fixed weights in the evaluation network. (See Figure 1 below from Ackley &amp; Littman, 1991).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/fryxefiqrfqemrbsqmu0\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/g2zfw8mnmztvhgs1nkt0 109w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/o4cfndta17kb06gusrz0 189w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/aoyozfyfokgfoll19bne 269w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/janycngtcnz5fbkblba0 349w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tQxLfkvFGWBhJ2KzR/nrhgqqbl85qq8pvdvjfi 429w\"></p><p>The crucial point with evolutionary reinforcement learning is that the environment does NOT specify reward signals as such. The environment is just the environment. Stuff happens in the environment. (Simulated) carnivores chase the agents and eat many of them. (Simulated) food nourishes them, if they can find it. Obstacles get in the way. The creatures have to evolve evaluation networks that accurately identify fitness threats (such as carnivores and obstacles) as things worth avoiding, and fitness opportunities (such as food and mates) as things worth pursuing. If their evaluation network is bad (misaligned to their genetic interests), then the creatures learn to get better and better at doing stupid, suicidal things <i>that feel rewarding to them when they\u2019re doing them</i>, like running straight towards carnivores, avoiding all food and mates, and bashing into obstacles.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first generations, of course, all the creatures have terrible evaluation networks that reward mostly stupid things. It takes many generations of selection to evolve better evaluation networks \u2013 but once those are giving better-aligned information about what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad, the reinforcement learning makes the creatures very good at doing the good things very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Evolutionary reinforcement learning captures the key challenge in gene/brain alignment: how to evolve the reward circuitry that specifies what counts as success, and what counts as failure. Once the reward circuitry has evolved, reinforcement learning can (relatively) easily shape adaptive behaviors. In humans, of course, the reward circuitry takes the form of many different motivations, emotions, preferences, and values that are relatively innate, instinctive, or hardwired.&nbsp;</p><p>The deepest problem in gene/brain alignment is that the only thing shaping the reward circuitry is evolution itself. Nothing inside the orgasm can figure out from first principles what counts as success or failure, reward or punishment, fitness-promoting or fitness-reducing behavior. Nature just has to try out different reward circuits, and see what works. The outer loop is that evolution selects the reward circuits that happen to work; the inner loop is that the reward circuits guide the organism to learn more adaptive behavior. (There\u2019s probably some analogy here to \u2018inner alignment\u2019 versus \u2018our alignment\u2019 in the AI safety literature, but I find these two terms so vague, confusing, and poorly defined that I can\u2019t see which of them corresponds to what, exactly, in my gene/brain alignment analogy; any guidance on that would be appreciated.)</p><p>So, how does Nature really solve the gene/brain alignment problem? It solves it through a colossal amount of failure, mayhem, wild-animal suffering, death, and extinction on a scale that beggars belief. 540 million years with quadrillions of animals in millions of species doing their best to learn how to survive and reproduce\u2026 but often failing, because they\u2019re learning the wrong things based on unaligned reward signals.&nbsp;</p><p>Evolution, from this point of view, is a massively parallel system for trying out different reward circuits in animals. Those that work, last. Those that don\u2019t work, die out. That\u2019s it. The result, after literally quadrillions of misalignment failures, is that we see the animals of today mostly pursuing adaptive goals and avoiding maladaptive goals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Some AI alignment lessons from gene/brain evolution</strong></p><p>What have we learned from the last 60 years of evolutionary biology from a gene\u2019s-eye perspective, even since<i>&nbsp;</i>William D. Hamilton discovered gene-centered kin selection in 1964? Here are some core lessons that might be relevant for AI alignment.</p><p>1. Evolution selects animals to maximize their inclusive reproductive fitness \u2013 but animals brains don\u2019t evolve to do this directly, consciously, or as a \u2018terminal value\u2019 that drives minute-to-minute decision-making. The evolutionary imperative is to create more copies of genes in the next generation \u2013 whether by surviving and reproducing directly, or helping copies of one\u2019s genes in close relatives (promoting \u2018inclusive fitness\u2019), or helping copies of one\u2019s genes in more distant relatives within the same group or tribe (promoting \u2018group fitness\u2019 as modelled in multi-level selection theory \u2013 which is quite different from na\u00efve group selection arguments). Any animal brains that aren\u2019t aligned with the interests of the genes they carry tend to die out, and the behavioral strategies that they implement tend to go extinct. Thus, evolution is the final arbiter of what counts as \u2018aligned with genes\u2019. If this \u2018gene/brain-alignment\u2019 problem is solved, the animal\u2019s brain typically works pretty well in the service of the animal\u2019s genes.</p><p>However, gene/brain alignment requires a staggering amount of trial-and-error experimentation \u2013 and there are no shortcuts to getting adaptive reward functions. Errors at the individual level are often lethal. Errors at the population level (e.g. animals drifting off into having maladaptive mate preferences that undermine survival) often result in extinction. Almost all vertebrate species go extinction within a million years; only a tiny minority of species lead to new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_radiation\">adaptive radiations</a> of new species. So, looking backwards, we can credit evolution with being pretty good at optimizing reward functions and enforcing gene/brain alignment, among the species we see surviving today. However, prospectively, almost all gene/brain \u2018alignment attempts\u2019 by evolution result in catastrophic failures, leading brains to pursue rewards that aren\u2019t aligned with their underlying genes. This lesson should make us very cautious about the prospects for AI alignment with humans.</p><p>2. Animals usually evolve very <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specificity\">domain-specific</a> adaptations to handle the daily business of surviving and reproducing. Most of these adaptations are morphological and physiological rather than cognitive, ranging in humans from about 200 different cell types to about 80 different organs. These are typically \u2018narrow\u2019 in function rather than \u2018general\u2019. There are 206 different bones in the human adult, rather than one all-purpose super-Bone. There are about a dozen types of immune system cells to defend the body against intruders (e.g. eosinophils, basophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, B cells), rather than one all-purpose super-Defender cell. (For more on this point, see my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zNS53uu2tLGEJKnk9/ea-s-brain-over-body-bias-and-the-embodied-value-problem-in\">EA Forum post</a> on embodied values.)</p><p>It\u2019s tempting to think of the human brain as one general-purpose cognitive organ, but evolutionary psychologists have found it much more fruitful to analyze brains as collections of distinct \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_adaptation\">psychological adaptations\u2019</a> that serve different functions. Many of these psychological adaptations take the form of evolved motivations, emotions, preferences, values, adaptive biases, and fast-and-frugal heuristics, rather than general-purpose learning mechanisms or information-processing systems. As we\u2019ll see later, the domain-specificity of motivations, emotions, and preferences may have been crucial in solving the gene/brain alignment problem, and in protecting animals against the misalignment dangers of running more general-purpose learning/cognition systems.&nbsp;</p><p>(Note that the existence of \u2018general intelligence\u2019 (aka IQ, aka the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)\"><i>g factor</i></a>) as a heritable, stable, individual-differences trait in humans, says nothing about whether the human mind has a highly domain-specific cognitive architecture. Even a highly heterogenous, complex, domain-specific cognitive architecture could give rise to an apparently domain-general \u2018g factor\u2019 if harmful mutations, environmental insults, and neurodevelopmental errors have pleiotropic (correlated) effects on multiple brain systems. My \u2018pleiotropic mutation model\u2019 of the <i>g</i> factor explores this in detail; see <a href=\"https://www.primalpoly.com/s/2000-sexual-intelligence.pdf\">this</a>, <a href=\"https://www.primalpoly.com/s/2005-IQ-body-symmetry.pdf\">this</a>, <a href=\"https://www.primalpoly.com/s/2007-mating-intelligence-FAQ.pdf\">this</a>, <a href=\"https://www.primalpoly.com/s/2009-why-IQ-semen.pdf\">this</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.primalpoly.com/s/2009-IQ-health-fitness-factor.pdf\">this</a>). Thus, the existence of \u2018general intelligence\u2019 as an individual-differences trait in humans does <i>not&nbsp;</i>mean that human intelligence is \u2018domain-general\u2019 in the sense that we expect \u2018Artificial General Intelligence\u2019 to be relatively domain-general.)</p><p>This domain-specific evolutionary psychology perspective on how to describe animal and human minds contrasts sharply with the type of Blank Slate models that are typical in some branches of AI alignment work, such as Shard theory. (See my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bm4qeNJcc82BKJnWk/the-heritability-of-human-values-a-behavior-genetic-critique\">EA Forum post</a> here for a critique of such Blank Slate models). These Blank Slate models tend to posit a kind of neo-Behaviorist view of learning, in which a few crude, simple reward functions guide the acquisition of all cognitive, emotional, and motivational content in the human mind.&nbsp;</p><p>If these Blank Slate models were correct, we might have a little more confidence that AI alignment could be solved by \u2018a few weird tricks\u2019 such as specifying some really clever, unitary reward function (e.g. utility function) that guides the AI\u2019s learning and behavior. However, evolution rarely constructs such simple reward functions when solving gene/brain alignment. Instead, evolution tends to construct a lot of domain-specific reward circuitry in animal brains, e.g. different types of evaluation functions and learning principles for different domains such as foraging, mating, predator-avoidance, pathogen-avoidance, social competition, etc. And these domain-specific reward functions are often in conflict, as when gazelles experience tension between the desire to eat tender green shoots, and the desire not to be eaten by big fierce lions watching them eating the tender green shoots. These motivational conflicts aren\u2019t typically resolved by some \u2018master utility function\u2019 that weighs up all relevant inputs, but simply by the relative strengths of different behavioral priorities (e.g. hunger vs. fear).</p><p>3. At the proximate level of how their perceptual, cognitive, and motor systems work, animal brains tend to work not as \u2018fitness maximizers\u2019 but as \u2018<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XPErvb8m9FapXCjhA/adaptation-executers-not-fitness-maximizers\">adaptation executors\u2019</a>. A \u2018fitness maximizer\u2019 would explicitly represents the animal\u2019s fitness (e.g. actual or expected reproductive success) as a sort of expected utility to be maximized in a centralized, general-purpose decision system. \u2018Adaptation executors\u2019 guide a limited set of adaptive behaviors based on integrating a limited set of relevant environmental cues. Examples would include relatively \u2018hard-wired\u2019 reflexes, emotions, food preferences, mate preferences, and parental motivations.</p><p>Why don\u2019t animals evolve brains that can do general fitness maximization, rather than relying on domain-specific psychological adaptations ? One common (but, I think, flawed) argument is that animal brains are too computationally limited to implement any kind of general-purpose fitness-maximizing algorithm. Well, maybe. But typical animal brains seem to have plenty of computational horsepower to implement some fairly general-purpose optimization strategies \u2013 if that was really a good thing to do. Honeybees have about 1 million neurons, zebrafish have about 10 million, fruit bats have about 100 million, pigeons have about 300 million, octopuses have about 500 million, black vultures have about 1 billion, German shepherd dogs have about 4 billion, chimpanzees have about 28 billion, and humans have about 86 billion. And typically, for each neuron, there are about 1,000 synapses connecting to other neurons. It\u2019s difficult to estimate the resulting computational power of animal brains. The best current <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-report-on-how-much-computational-power-it-takes-to-match-the-human-brain/\">estimates</a> suggest the human brain is capable of about 10<sup>13</sup>\u201310<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;FLOPS (floating-point operations per second). The fastest current supercomputer (the Cray/HPE Frontier; 2022:) runs at about 10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;FLOPS. When playing games, Alpha Zero seemed to use about 10<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;FLOPS (this is a dubious estimate from random bloggers; please correct if you have a better one). Thus, animal brains aren\u2019t enormously more powerful than current computers, but they\u2019re in the same ballpark.</p><p>I have a different hypothesis about why animal brains don\u2019t evolve to be \u2018fitness maximizers\u2019: &nbsp;because any general fitness/utility function that they tried to implement would (1) depend on proximate cues of future expect fitness that are way too unreliable and uninformative to guide effective learning, and would be (2) way too slow to develop and learn in ways that match the animal\u2019s sensory and motor capabilities, (3) way too fragile to genetic noise (mutations) and environmental noise (uncertainty), (4) way too vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation by other animals, and (5) way too vulnerable to reward-hacking by the animal itself. Thus, fitness-maximizing brains would not actually guide adaptive behavior as well as a suite of more domain-specific instincts, motivations, emotions, and learning systems would do. (This point echoes the 1992 <a href=\"https://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/pfc92.pdf\">argument</a> by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby that any general-purpose brain without a rich set of specific instincts can\u2019t solve the \u2018<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frame-problem/\">frame problem\u2019</a>).</p><p>For example, consider the problem of adaptive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice\">mate choice</a>. Sexually reproducing animals need to find good mates to combine their genes with, to create the next generation. From a genes\u2019-eye perspective, bad mate choice is an existential risk \u2013 it\u2019s the road to oblivion. If an animal chooses the wrong species (e.g. chimp mating with gorilla), wrong sex (e.g. male mating with male), wrong age (e.g. adult mating with pre-pubescent juvenile), wrong fertility status (e.g. already pregnant), wrong phenotypic condition (e.g. starving, sick, injured), or wrong degree of relatedness (e.g. full sibling), then their genes will not recombine at all with the chosen mate, or they will recombine in a way that produces genetically inferior offspring, or offspring that won\u2019t receive good parental care. Given the long delay between mating and offspring growing up (often weeks, months, or many years), it\u2019s impossible for animals to learn their mate preferences based on feedback about eventual reproductive success. In fact, many invertebrate animals die before they ever see their offspring, so they can\u2019t possibly use quantity or quality of offspring as cues of how well they\u2019re doing in the game of life. Similarly, the selection pressures to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding_avoidance\">avoid incest</a> (mating with a close genetic relative) can track the fact that future generations will suffer lower fitness due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding\">inbreeding</a> (increased homozygosity of recessive mutations) \u2013 but most animals are in no position to perceive those effects using their own senses to guide their reinforcement learning systems. Yet, inbreeding avoidance evolves anyway, because evolution itself provides the \u2018training signal\u2019 that weeds out bad mate preferences. Generally, animals need some relatively in-built mate preferences to guide their mating decisions as soon as they reach sexual maturity, and there is no way to learn adaptive mate preferences within one lifetime, given the long-delayed effects of good or bad mate choices on the quality and quantity of offspring and grand-offspring. So, we\u2019ve evolved a lot of quite specific mate choice instincts to avoid recombining our genes with bad genotypes and phenotypes.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, animal mate preferences and sexual behavior motivations need to be resistant to whatever kinds of reward-hacking are feasible, given the animals\u2019 behavioral repertoire, social environment, and mating market. For example, if male animals used the domain-specific sexual heuristic of \u2018maximize rate of ejaculation near females of my own species\u2019, they could reward-hack by masturbating to orgasm without actually copulating with any fertile females (a type of \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-reproductive_sexual_behavior_in_animals\">non-reproductive sexual behavior\u2019</a>). Male primates will sometime try to reward-hack other males\u2019 mate preferences by submitting to male-male copulation, in order to defuse male-male competition and aggression. But presumably males evolve some degree of resistance against such socio-sexual manipulation.</p><p>4. \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence\">Instrumental convergence\u2019</a> is common in evolution, not just in AI systems. Animals often act as if they\u2019re maximizing the expected fitness of the genes they carry. They don\u2019t do this by treating expected fitness as an expected utility that their brains are trying to maximize through means/end reasoning. However, animals do have a common set of instrumental proxies for fitness that are similar to instrumental goals analyzed by AI safety researchers. For example, animals across millions of species are motivated to avoid predators, avoid parasites, find food, find mates, care for offspring, and help kin. These core challenges of surviving and reproducing are so common that they appear as the organizing chapters in most animal behavior textbooks. Biologists who study predator avoidance in reptiles often have more in common with those who study predator avoidance in primates, than they do with those who study mate choice in reptiles, because the selection pressures and functional challenges of predator avoidance are often so similar across species. Much of biology research is structured around these instrumental life-goals, which show strong signs of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution\">convergent evolution</a> across wildly different species with very different bodies and brains.</p><p>5. Gene/brain alignment in animals is often shaped not just by one-sided optimization to environmental challenges, but by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coevolution\">co-evolutionary</a> arms races with other individuals and species. This is roughly analogous to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning\">adversarial machine learning</a>, except that in Nature, each individual and species is pursuing its own gene/brain strategies, rather than specifically trying to hack the reward function of any other particular individual. For example, fast-evolving parasites often discover ways to evade the anti-parasite defenses of slower-evolving hosts (e.g. mosquito saliva evolving to contain analgesics that make it harder to detect their bites); males often find ways to manipulate and deceive females during sexual courtship (e.g. offering fake \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuptial_gift\">nuptial gifts\u2019</a> that don\u2019t actually include any nutrients); offspring often find ways to manipulate the parental care behaviors of their parents (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_in_animals\">begging</a> more aggressively than their siblings). With each adversarial adaptations, counter-adaptations often evolve (e.g. more sensitive skin to detect insects, female skepticism about the contents of nuptial gifts, parental resistance to begging). To make progress on whether adversarial machine learning can actually help with AI alignment if might be helpful to explore what lessons can be learned from coevolutionary arms races in Nature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Evolution has succeeded in generating quite a high degree of gene/brain alignment in millions of species over hundreds of millions of years. Animal nervous systems generally do a pretty good job of guiding animals to survive and reproduce in the service of their genetic interests.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there\u2019s quite a lot of survivorship bias, in the sense that quadrillions of gene/brain \u2018alignment failures\u2019 have died out and gone extinct ever since the Cambrian explosion. The animals we see running around today, learning various impressively adaptive behaviors based on their well-calibrated reward functions, are the last alignment attempts left standing. Most of their would-be ancestors died out without any surviving offspring. I think this should lead us to be very cautious about the prospects for getting human/AI alignment right the first few times we try. We do not have the luxury of quadrillions of failures before we get it right.</p><p>Also, the domain-specificity of animals\u2019 cognitive, motivational, and behavioral adaptations should make us skeptical about developing any simple \u2018master utility functions\u2019 that can achieve good alignment. If master utility functions were good ways to solve alignment, animals might have evolved relatively Blank Slate brains with very crude, simple reinforcement learning systems to align their behavior with their genes (as posited, incorrectly, by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqkGmfikqapbJ2YMj/shard-theory-an-overview\">Shard Theory</a>). Instead, animals typically evolve a wide variety of senses, perceptual systems, object-level categories, cognitive systems, preferences, motivations, emotions, and behavioral strategies \u2013 and many of these are stimulus-specific, content-specific, or domain-specific. When we\u2019re thinking about human/AI alignment, I think we should break the problem down into more domain-specific chunks, rather than trying to solve it all at once with some unitary \u2018technical alignment solution\u2019. The following are qualitatively different kinds of problems that probably require different alignment solutions: alignment to protect the AI against human-harming cyber-attacks (analogous to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host%E2%80%93parasite_coevolution\">anti-pathogen defenses</a> in animals), alignment to \u2018play nice\u2019 in sharing energy and computational resources with humans (analogous to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_models_of_food_sharing\">food-sharing</a> adaptations in social primates), and alignment for a domestic robot to be a good care-taker of human children (analogous to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloparenting\">alloparenting</a> in human clans).</p><p>In summary, from our perspective as humans looking back on the evolutionary history of life on Earth, it might look easy for genes to grow brains that are aligned with the genes\u2019 interests. Gene/brain alignment might look simple. However, we\u2019re seeing the descendants of the rare success stories \u2013 the few bright lights of gene/brain alignment success, against a dark background of millions of generations of bad reward functions, faulty perceptions, misguided cognitions, maladaptive motivations, and catastrophic misbehaviors, resulting in mass starvation, disease, predation, carnage, death, and extinction.&nbsp;</p><p>Nature didn\u2019t care about all that failure. It had all the time in the world to explore every possible way of doing gene/brain alignment. It found some behavioral strategies that work pretty reliably to support the revealed preferences of animal genes. However, when it comes to human/AI alignment, we don\u2019t have hundreds of millions of years, or quadrillions of lives, to get it right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: This essay is still rather half-baked, and could be better-organized.

In this piece I suggest that this could be in violation of its obligations under Article 6(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).&nbsp;By most accounts, the US is the key country in control of how quickly we have artificial general intelligence (AGI), a goal that companies like OpenAI have been very open about pursuing. The fact that AGI could carry risk to human life has been detailed in various fora and I won\u2019t belabor that point.&nbsp;I present this legal argument so that those trying to get the US government to take action have additional armor to call on.</p><p><strong>A. Some important premises&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The US signed and ratified the ICCPR on June 8 1992.<a><sup><u>[1]</u></sup></a> While it has not ratified the Optional Protocol allowing for individual complaints against it, it did submit to the competence of the Human Rights Committee (the body charged with interpreting the ICCPR) where the party suing is another state. This means that although individuals cannot bring action against the US for ICCPR violations, other states can.&nbsp;As is the case for domestic law, provisions of treaties are given real meaning when they\u2019re interpreted by courts or other bodies with the specific legal mandate to do so. Most of this usually happens in a pretty siloed manner, but international human rights law is famously non-siloed. The interpretive bodies determining international human rights law cases regularly borrow from each other when trying to make meaning of the different provisions before them. This piece is focused on what the ICCPR demands, but I will also discuss some decisions from other regional human rights courts because of the cross fertilization that I\u2019ve just described. Before understanding my argument, they\u2019re a few crucial premises you have to appreciate. I will discuss them next. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) All major human rights treaties, including the ICCPR, impose on states a duty to protect life&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In addition to the ICCPR, the African Charter, European Convention and American Convention have all give states a duty to protect life.<a><sup><u>[2]</u></sup></a> As you might imagine, the existence of the actual duty is generally undisputed. It is when we get to the specific content of the duty where things become murky.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) A state\u2019s duty to protect life under the ICCPR can extend to citizens of other countries</strong></p><p>The Human Rights Committee (quick reminder: this is the body with the legal mandate to interpret the ICCPR) has made it clear that this duty to protect under the ICCPR extends not only to activities which are conducted within the territory of the state being challenged but also to those conducted in other places \u2013 so long as the activities could have a direct and reasonably foreseeable impact on persons outside the state\u2019s territory. The fact that the US has vehemently disputed this understanding<a><sup><u>[3]</u></sup></a> does not mean it is excused from abiding by it.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii) States\u2019 duties to protect life under the ICCPR require attention to the activities of corporate entities headquartered in their countries&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Even though the US protested the move,<a><sup><u>[4]</u></sup></a> the Human Rights Committee has been clear that the duty to protect extends to protecting individuals from violations by private persons or entities,<a><sup><u>[5]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;including activities by corporate entities based in their territory or subject to their jurisdiction.<a><sup><u>[6]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;Other regional bodies that give meaning to international human rights also agree: The European Court of Human Rights (European Court) has said states have to keep an eye on acts of third parties and non-State actors<a><sup><u>[7]</u></sup></a> while the African Commission has provided more outrightly that the state can be held liable for violations by non-State actors, including corporations.<a><sup><u>[8]</u></sup></a></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iv) The duty to protect life can be violated without death occurring&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There seems to be consensus among international human rights bodies (including the Human Rights Committee) that for a violation of the duty to protect life to be established, the risk does <strong>not</strong> need to have materialized. The part that follows will have more on this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>B. How the duty to protect life has been interpreted, and how the US government could be in violation of Article 6(1) of the ICCPR&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Human Rights Committee has interpreted Article 6(1) of the ICCPR as <i>establishing a positive obligation to protect life, and specifically a duty to take adequate preventive measures to protect individuals from reasonably foreseeable threats.</i><a><sup><u>[9]</u></sup></a> As such, to convincingly demonstrate that the US (quick reminder: it is a State Party to the ICCPR) is in violation of this provision, each element in Article 6(1) has to be satisfied, step-by-step. This is what I\u2019m going to show you next.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) It is reasonable for us to expect the US government to be aware that AGI could cause existential catastrophe</strong></p><p>For a state to be held liable under Article 6, the threat has to be <i>reasonably</i> foreseeable. The Human Rights Committee hasn\u2019t really told us what that means, but its peer institutions like the European Court have held that this question of reasonableness must be answered in light of all the circumstances of each case.<a><sup><u>[10]</u></sup></a> In many other fields of law, the reasonableness of conduct depends on what an ordinary actor would do if they had the information and resources available to the actor facing legal challenge. Now to our specific situation. Let\u2019s assume that we can\u2019t show that the US government has some secret information about the development of AI towards AGI. If this is so, I think the Human Rights Committee would probably consider: whether the state has previously indicated knowledge that the activity in question could cause death and if not, whether there is widespread agreement among reasonable people that current AI development could indeed lead to AGI and AGI could cause death, or whether there is widespread agreement among experts that current AI development could lead to AGI and AGI could cause death.&nbsp;</p><p>For those of us prosecuting the AI-could-cause-existential-risk argument, this standard of reasonableness may actually not be a very difficult one to meet. It is true that there is no large-scale consensus among ordinary people that the maturity of AGI will carry a risk to life. It is also true that we are far away from a consensus among experts. But it does seem that the US Government appreciates the possibility that current AI development could lead to AGI and AGI could cause death. Here is the smoking gun that I came across recently in the White House\u2019s 2023 Update of the US\u2019s National AI Strategic Plan. The update noted that \u201cLong-term risks remain, including the existential risk associated with the development of artificial general intelligence through self-modifying AI or other means\u201d. This surely means that it is reasonable for us to expect that the US Government is aware of x risk via AGI. I suppose this argument would fail if: (a) One can show that this isn't the official position of the US government or (b) \u201cExistential risk\u201d as used in the report was meant to mean something less than death. I think counterargument (a) just can\u2019t fly given that it is literally a report written by a White House office. I\u2019m not entirely certain about counterargument (b) but I think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/26/rishi-sunak-races-to-tighten-rules-for-ai-amid-fears-of-existential-risk\"><u>the UK government\u2019s understanding</u></a> (seems to be that x risk = death) gives us additional circumstantial evidence to show that the US government\u2019s understanding is likely to be similar.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) The x risk that AGI carries is foreseeable to the US government&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For my argument to make sense, the next legal element that has to be satisfied is that of \"foreseeability\". Unfortunately, the Human Rights Committee has not told us what exactly \u201cforeseeable\u201d means. Yet I would suggest that once we\u2019ve demonstrated that the US Government appreciates that AGI could lead to a significant number of deaths (again, see the quote in the paragraph right before this one) and since it\u2019s not in doubt that they know OpenAI and other entities are building towards AI with the goal of creating AGI then surely the foreseeable-ness of the threat has already been shown.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PS even the real and immediate standard offers a path</strong></p><p>For the sake of argument (and because we are not very clear what \"foreseeable\" means to the Human Rights Committee) let us take up an even more difficult but well-elaborated standard. Other international human rights courts and commissions seem to have understood the duty to protect life as imposing a positive duty to take preventive measures to protect an individual or a group of individuals\u2019 life from <i>a real and immediate/imminent risk</i>.<a><sup><u>[11]</u></sup></a> If we take a literal reading of Article 6, it seems as though the \u201cforeseeable threat\u201d standard may be less exacting for to meet than a standard that requires proof of \u201creal and immediate\u201d risk. I think this means that if we can prove real and immediate risk then we will most likely have satisfied the \u201cforeseeable threat\u201d standard as well. Let\u2019s go there then.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the European Court, the real and immediate standard requires that we prove: (i) there is a real and immediate risk to an identified individual or individuals from the acts of a third party, (ii) the authorities knew or ought to have known of the existence of that risk and (iii) that the authorities failed to take reasonable measures to avoid that risk.<a><sup><u>[12]</u></sup></a> The European Court has also said that this obligation exists where the risk is to an identified individual(s) or the general society.<a><sup><u>[13]</u></sup></a> &nbsp;</p><p>But what is a real and immediate risk? Well, the European Court has previously found a risk to be immediate despite the risk <strong>having been in existence long before it materialised</strong>.<a><sup><u>[14]</u></sup></a> Other than that, one dissenting opinion described a real and immediate risk to be one which is \u2018substantial or significant\u2019, \u2018not remote or fanciful\u2019 and \u2018real and ever-present\u2019.<a><sup><u>[15]</u></sup></a>No decisions have given us detail about what \u2018real\u2019, \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018significant\u2019 entail.&nbsp;</p><p>Satisfying this standard will probably come down to how \u2018real\u2019 we can show x risk from AI to be. This is a complex test to meet. I think it carries both subjective and objective elements. That is, the risk to life needs to be (a) self-evident to ordinary people but also (b) widely recognized by experts. I\u2019m confident that the arguments that AGI could easily be misaligned and could pursue goals antithetical to the survival of humanity are very powerful and \u2013 when explained carefully in a step-by-step manner \u2013 would meet this standard of \u2018realness\u2019 and \u2018significance\u2019. However, the fact that some respected experts consider this argument to be a crackpot idea definitely means the \u2018real-ness\u2019 of the threat isn\u2019t that obvious. One occurrence that I think really helps to fortify my claim that the \"realness\" requirement has been satisfied is the rise of large language models. It seems as though it is the capabilities of ChatGPT that really made the possibility of AGI seem more real to ordinary people, policymakers and experts. For this reason, I would argue that LLMs help to prove the legal standard of \"realness\". In other words, I'm claiming that under this legal standard the US's obligations under Article 6(1) were triggered when ChatGPT was released because it was then that the realness threshold was met.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii) There are adequate preventive measures that the US government could take to stem x risk from AI&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The final legal element to satisfy is whether there are any adequate preventive measures that the US could take in light of the circumstances. The Human Rights Committee hasn't elaborated on the precise meaning of \u201cadequate preventive measures\u201d as used in Article 6(1) of the ICCPR. However, we can find useful guidance about this from some of the European Court\u2019s decisions. In a 2020 case, the Court noted that once an activity is found to carry a risk for human life, states must create regulations \"geared towards the special features of the activity in question\" and with \"special attention to the level of potential risk to human lives\". Even more interestingly, the Court said that regulations are expected to govern licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity in question and \u201cmust make it compulsory for all those undertaking the activity to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>At a minimum, I think the Human Rights Committee would endorse this understanding of adequate preventive measures if only because these are anodyne and easy-to-take steps within the reach of any government. Indeed, we know that regulation around licensing etc is surely well within the capability of the US government. For that reason, it has an obligation \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 to create regulation touching on these aspects of AI development insofar as it relates to AGI. &nbsp; &nbsp;But it's not just that. I think the specific content of the regulation created has to meet the level of threat in question and so the specific regulation the US adopts should be challengeable. But that's a story for another day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>C. Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you agree with me on the premises I started from and you endorse the interpretations I\u2019ve adopted then you can see how the US could be found in violation of Article 6(1) if it takes no robust regulatory action on any AI development that\u2019s focused on creating AGI.</p><p><strong>D. Possible headwinds for my argument&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Experts in international human rights law may be skeptical about what I\u2019m proposing because even if you were to get a bully-proof country to take such a case before the Human Rights Committee, the Committee cannot impose sanctions on a state \u2013 it is instead limited to making recommendations. I also imagine that some people will claim that the US government would simply scoff at any international law argument about why it should act a certain way. In response to both points, it's worth reiterating what many more exceptional scholars than I could ever be have written: International embarrassment can in fact have a significant galvanizing effect on domestic action. And just as importantly, I think pushing this argument would probably cause more people to become alive to the risks surrounding AI that\u2019s being developed in the US, and that on its own may be a big win for us.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, the most compelling reason why this may not be a good argument to push would come from a strategic standpoint. If you are more pro-<i>playing nice</i>, pushing this argument would wreak havoc on that approach and perhaps antagonise American policymakers. There is also the chance that robust AI regulation gets framed as \"what foreigners who don't live here and haven't built this country want us to do\" argument.

In other words, for almost everything humans compete in, the difference in payoff between being at the 98th percentile and the 99th percentile is much larger than the difference between the 56th and 57th percentile.</p><p>Given this reality, how can we most effectively coordinate to improve the world?</p><p><strong>Here's what we shouldn't do:</strong> everyone try to have the highest impact career possible while making the most amount of money possible and also contributing to several different cause areas while being an influential person in EA/rationalist discourse. Optimizing to succeed in two or more meaningfully-different hierarchies probably means that you'll do worse in each domain than if you had optimized exclusively for one thing. I suspect that many people wind up being 80th percentile on a handful of domains when they could've been 99th percentile on one domain if they had let themselves be 30th percentile on all the others. Naively, it may appear better to be 80th percentile on a bunch of stuff, but it's in fact far more impactful to have a community full of really specialized people, since, again, the difference between the 56th and 57th percentile is much smaller than the difference between the 98th and 99th percentile for basically everything.&nbsp;</p><p>So the issue of EA-not-needing-more-generalists isn't just a supply and demand thing; it's likely to always be true because of this icky Pareto stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>We should <i>instead </i>optimize for having as many one-percenters in things as we can, even if the opportunity cost of becoming a one-percenter looks fairly high in another domain. I think that we can pretty safety assume that if everyone follows this strategy, we'll essentially offset each others' opportunity costs and net much more goodness done. So tentatively, I think we should cultivate a norm of <strong>each-person-do-good-via-one-strategy</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(There are certainly cases where different domains are close enough together that excelling in one sets you up to grab a lot of ground in another with relatively low entry cost, and in these cases we should make an exception. But I think the above principle is usually vastly underappreciated when communities try to optimize for a common goal.)</i></p><p><strong>So, should I stop donating to charity?</strong></p><p>The difference that an early-career researcher can make by donating to charity looks pretty marginal relative to the difference an earn-to-give dude can make. If, as a general principle, researchers in EA stopped donating to charity, I suspect they'd be able to advance their relative standing in their own careers by an additional percentile, by doing things like funding their own research projects, taking breaks from work to explore promising ideas, spending less time thinking about finances, etc. This is true for most careers where the path to impact is the work itself / the reputation or influence of the person doing the job.</p><p>The argument is to let the earn-to-give people do earn-to-give, and if that's not you, instead be super \"selfish\" in pursuing whatever career goals will most improve your own path to impact. Similarly, earn-to-give people, stop bothering with any non-money-related ways of doing good, just stfu and get that bag or something, since you earning ever-so-slightly-more relative to other magnates is probably as good as hundreds of median EAs taking the GWWC pledge.&nbsp;</p><p>There might be other reasons to donate to charity, too, like costly signaling, donating as a commitment device, etc. But this feels a bit suspicious-convergence-y to me: I suspect that the 99th percentile strategies for these goals may be other things, and we should have low priors that a thing we used to do for a particular reason we then debunked is something we should continue to do now for a different reason, especially given the influence of motivated reasoning.</p>", "user": {"username": "Carter Allen"}}, {"_id": "nsLTKCd3Bvdwzj9x8", "title": "Ingroup Deference", "postedAt": "2023-05-26T16:44:49.416Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Epistemic status: yes. All about epistemics</i><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In principle, all that motivates the existence of the EA community is collaboration around a common goal. As the shared goal of preserving the environment characterizes the environmentalist community, say, EA is supposed to be characterized by the shared goal of doing the most good.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in practice, the EA community shares more than just this abstract goal (let\u2019s grant that it does at least share the stated goal) and the collaborations that result. It also exhibits an unusual distribution of beliefs about various things, like the probability that AI will kill everyone or the externalities of polyamory.<br><br>My attitude has long been that, to a first approximation, it doesn\u2019t make sense for EAs to defer to each other\u2019s&nbsp;<i>judgment&nbsp;</i>any more than to anyone else\u2019s on questions lacking consensus. When we do, we land in the kind of echo chamber which convinced environmentalists that nuclear power is more dangerous than most experts think, and which at least to some extent seems to have trapped practically every other social movement, political party, religious community, patriotic country, academic discipline, and school of thought within an academic discipline on record.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This attitude suggests the following template for an EA-motivated line of strategy reasoning, e.g. an EA-motivated econ theory paper:</p><ol><li>Look around at what most people are doing. Assume you and your EA-engaged readers are no more capable or better informed than others are, on the whole; take others\u2019 behavior as a best guess on how to achieve their own goals.</li><li>Work out [what, say, economic theory says about] how to act if you believe what others believe, but replace the goal of \u201cwhat people typically want\u201d with some conception of \u201cthe good\u201d.</li></ol><p>And so a lot of my own research has fit this mold, including the core of my work on \u201cpatient philanthropy\u201d[<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Trammell-Dynamic-Public-Good-Provision-under-Time-Preference-Heterogeneity.pdf\"><u>1</u></a>,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcfTgZsqT9k30ngeQbappYyn-UO4vltjkm64n4or5r4\">&nbsp;<u>2</u></a>] (<i>if we act like typical funders except that we replace the rate of pure time preference with zero, here\u2019s the formula for how much higher our saving rate should be</i>).

Seeing the \u201cEA consensus\u201d be arguably ahead of the curve on some big issues\u2014Covid a few years ago, AI progress more recently\u2014raises the question of whether there\u2019s a better heuristic: one which doesn\u2019t treat these cases as coincidences, but which is still principled enough that we don\u2019t have to worry too much about turning the EA community into [more of] an echo chamber all around. This post argues that there is.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gist is simple. If you\u2019ve been putting in the effort to follow the evolution of EA thought, you have some \u201cinside knowledge\u201d of how it came to be what it is on some question. (I mean this not in the sense that the evolution of EA thinking is secret, just in the sense that it\u2019s somewhat costly to learn.) If this costly knowledge informs you that EA beliefs on some question are unusual because they started out typical and then updated in light of some idiosyncratic learning, e.g. an EA-motivated research effort, then it\u2019s reasonable for you to update toward them to some extent. On the other hand, if it informs you that EA beliefs on some question have been unusual from the get-go, it makes sense to update the other way, toward the distribution of beliefs among people not involved in the EA community.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is hardly a mind-blowing point, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to explore it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefskcpulkwuy8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnskcpulkwuy8\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But hopefully I can say something useful about how far it goes and how to distinguish it from more suspicious arguments for ingroup deference.</p><h2>Disagreement in the abstract</h2><p>As stated above, the intuition we\u2019re exploring\u2014and ultimately rejecting\u2014is that EAs shouldn\u2019t defer to each other\u2019s judgment any more than to anyone else\u2019s on questions lacking consensus. To shed light where this intuition may have come from, and where it can go wrong, let\u2019s start by reviewing some of the theory surrounding disagreement in the abstract.</p><p>One may start out with a probability distribution over some state space, learn something, and then change one\u2019s probability distribution in light of what was learned. The first distribution is then one\u2019s&nbsp;<i>prior</i> and the second is one\u2019s&nbsp;<i>posterior</i>. A formula for going from a prior to a posterior in light of some new information is an&nbsp;<i>updating rule</i>. Bayes\u2019 Rule is the most famous.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Someone\u2019s&nbsp;<i>uninformed prior</i> is their ultimate prior over all possible states of the world: the thing they\u2019re born with, before they get any information at all, and then open their eyes and begin updating from. Two people with different uninformed priors can receive the same information over the course of their lives, both always update their beliefs using the same rule (e.g. Bayes\u2019), and yet have arbitrarily different beliefs at the end about anything they haven\u2019t learned for certain.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Subjective Bayesianism</i> is the view that what it means to be [epistemically] \u201crational\u201d is simply to update from priors to posteriors using Bayes\u2019 Rule. No uninformed prior is more or less rational than any other (perhaps subject to some mild restrictions).&nbsp;<i>Objective Bayesianism</i> adds the requirement that there\u2019s only one uninformed prior it is rational to have. That is, it\u2019s the view that rationality consists of having the rational uninformed prior at bottom&nbsp;<u>and</u> updating from priors to posteriors using Bayes\u2019 Rule.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For simplicity, through the rest of this post, the term \u201cprior\u201d will always refer to an uninformed prior. We\u2019ll never need to refer to any intermediate sort of prior. People will be thought of as coming to their current beliefs by starting with an [uninformed] prior and then updating, once, on everything they\u2019ve ever learned.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Common knowledge</i> is defined<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)\">&nbsp;<u>here</u></a>. Two people have a&nbsp;<i>common prior</i> if they have common knowledge that they have the same prior. So: the condition that two people have common knowledge that they are rational in the Objective Bayesian sense is essentially equivalent to the condition that they have (a) common knowledge that they are rational in the Subjective Bayesian sense and (b) a common prior. Common knowledge may seem like an unrealistically strong assumption for any context, but I believe everything I will say will hold approximately on replacing common knowledge with&nbsp;<i>common p-belief</i>, as defined by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0899825689900171\"><u>Monderer and Samet (1989)</u></a>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For simplicity, throughout the rest of this post, the term \u201crationality\u201d will always refer to epistemic rationality in the Subjective Bayesian sense. This is not to take a stand for Subjective Bayesianism; indeed, as you\u2019ll see, this post is written from something of an Objective position. But it will let us straightforwardly refer to assumption (a), common knowledge that everyone updates using Bayes\u2019 Rule, as CKR (\u201ccommon knowledge of rationality\u201d), and to assumption (b) as CP (\u201ccommon priors\u201d).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, people will be said to \u201cdisagree\u201d about an event if their probabilities for it differ and they have common knowledge of whose is higher. Note that the common knowledge requirement makes this definition of \u201cdisagree\u201d stronger than the standard-usage definition: you might disagree with, say, Trump about something in the standard-usage sense, but not in the sense used here, assuming he doesn\u2019t know what you think about it at all.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As it turns out,&nbsp;<i>if a pair of people have CP and CKR, then there is no event about which they disagree.</i> This is<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2958591\">&nbsp;<u>Aumann\u2019s (1976)</u></a> famous \u201cagreement theorem\u201d. It\u2019s often summarized as the claim that \u201crational people cannot agree to disagree\u201d, though this phrasing can make it seem stronger than it is. Still, it\u2019s a powerful result.<br><br>Two people may satisfy CP and CKR, and have different beliefs about some event, if the direction of the difference isn\u2019t common knowledge between them. The difference will simply be due to a difference in information. The mechanism that would tend to eliminate the disagreement\u2014one person updating in the other\u2019s direction\u2014breaks when at least one of the parties doesn\u2019t know which direction to update in.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, suppose Jack and Jill have a common prior over the next day\u2019s weather, and common knowledge of the fact they\u2019re both perfectly good at updating on weather forecasts. Then suppose Jack checks his phone. They both know that, unless the posterior probability of rain the next day exactly equals their prior, the probability Jack assigns to rain now differs from Jill\u2019s. But Jill can\u2019t update in Jack\u2019s direction, because she doesn\u2019t know whether to shift her credence up or down.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Likewise, suppose we observe a belief-difference (whose direction isn\u2019t common knowledge, of course) between people satisfying CP and CKR, we trust ourselves to be rational too, and we have these two people\u2019s shared prior. Then we should simply update from our prior in light of whatever we know, including whatever we might know about what each of the others knows. If we see that Jack is reaching for an umbrella, and we see that Jill isn\u2019t because she hasn\u2019t seen Jack, we should update toward rain. Likewise, if we see that a GiveWell researcher assigns a high probability to the event that the Malaria Consortium is the charity whose work most cheaply increases near-term human wellbeing, and we see that some stranger assigns a low probability to any particular charity (including MC), we should update toward MC. There\u2019s no deep mystery about what to do, and we don\u2019t feel troubled when we find ourselves agreeing with one person more than the other.<br><br>But we often observe belief-differences between people not satisfying CP and CKR. By the agreement theorem, all disagreements involve departures from CP or CKR: all debates, for instance. And people with different beliefs may lack CP or CKR even when the direction of their disagreement isn\u2019t common knowledge. We may see Jack\u2019s probability of rain differ from Jill\u2019s both because he\u2019s checked the forecast, which predicts rain, and because he\u2019s just more pessimistic about the weather on priors. We may see GiveWell differ from Lant Pritchett both because they\u2019ve done some charity-research Lant doesn\u2019t yet know about and because they\u2019re more pessimistic about economic-growth-focused work than Lant is.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In these cases, what to do is more of a puzzle. If we are to form precise beliefs that are in any sense Bayesian, we ultimately have to make judgments about whose prior (or which other prior) seems more sensible, and about who seems more rational (or, if we think they\u2019re both making mistakes in the same direction, what would be a more rational direction). But the usual recommendation for how to make a judgment about something\u2014just start with our prior, learn what we can (including from the information embedded in others\u2019 disagreements), and update by Bayes\u2019 Rule\u2014now feels unsatisfying. If we trust this judgment to our own priors and our own information processing, but the very problem we\u2019re adjudicating is that people can differ in their priors and/or their abilities to rationally process information, why should we especially trust our own?&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmv2ed5mylos\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmv2ed5mylos\">[2]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxrpuktxn7i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxrpuktxn7i\">[3]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our response to some observed possible difference in priors or information-processing abilities, as opposed to differences in information, might be called \u201cepistemically modest\u201d to the extent that it involves giving equal weight to others\u2019 judgments. I won\u2019t try to define epistemic modesty more precisely here, since how exactly to formalize and act on our intuitions in its favor is, to my understanding, basically an unsolved challenge.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrxfnhwwecl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrxfnhwwecl\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It\u2019s not as simple as, say, just splitting the difference among people; everyone else presumably thinks they\u2019re already doing this to the appropriate degree. But I think it\u2019s hard to deny that at least some sort of epistemic modesty, at least sometimes, must be on the right track.<br><br>In sum: when we see people\u2019s beliefs differ, deciding what to believe poses theoretical challenges to the extent that we can attribute the belief-difference to a lack of CP or CKR. And the challenges it poses concern how exactly to act on our intuitions for epistemic modesty.</p><h2>Two mistaken responses to disagreement</h2><p>This framing helps us spot what are, I think, the two main mistakes made in the face of disagreement.<br><br>The first mistake is to&nbsp;<u>attribute the disagreement to an information-difference</u>, implicitly or explicitly, and proceed accordingly.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the abstract, it\u2019s clear what the problem is here. Disagreements cannot just be due to information-differences.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To reiterate: when belief-differences in some domain&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>due entirely to differences in information, we just need to get clear on what information we have and what it implies. But a&nbsp;<i>disagreement&nbsp;</i>must be due, at least in part, to (possible) differences in the disagreers\u2019 priors or information-processing abilities. Given such differences, if we\u2019re going to trust to our own (or our friends\u2019) prior and rationality, giving no intrinsic weight to others\u2019 judgments, we need some compelling\u2014perhaps impossible\u2014story about how we\u2019re avoiding epistemic hubris.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though this might be easy enough to accept in the abstract, it often seems to be forgotten in practice. For example, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Mark Zuckerberg disagree on the probability that AI will cause an existential catastrophe. When this is pointed out, people sometimes respond that they can unproblematically trust Yudkowsky, because Zuckerberg hasn\u2019t engaged nearly as much with the arguments for AI risk. But nothing about the agreement theorem requires that either party learn everything the other knows. Indeed, this is what makes it an interesting result! Under CP and CKR, Zuckerberg would have given higher credence to AI risk purely on observing Yudkowsky\u2019s higher credence, and/or Yudkowsky would have given lower credence to AI risk purely on observing Zuckerberg\u2019s lower credence, until they agreed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbaznxpnu52m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbaznxpnu52m\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The testimony of someone who has been thinking about the problem for decades, like Yudkowsky, is evidence for AI risk\u2014but the fact that Zuckerberg still disbelieves, despite Yudkowsky\u2019s testimony, is evidence against; and the greater we consider Yudkowsky\u2019s expertise, the stronger&nbsp;<i>both</i> pieces of evidence are. Simply assuming that the more knowledgeable party is closer to right, and discarding the evidence given by the other party\u2019s skepticism, is an easy path to an echo chamber.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is perhaps easier to see when we consider a case where we give little credence to the better-informed side. Sikh scholars (say) presumably tend to be most familiar with the arguments for&nbsp;<i>and against</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism\"><u>Sikhism</u></a>, but they shouldn\u2019t dismiss the rest of the world for failing to engage with the arguments. Instead they should learn something from the fact that most people considered Sikhism so implausible as not to engage at all. I make this point more long-windedly<a href=\"http://philiptrammell.com/blog/46\">&nbsp;<u>here</u></a>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Likewise, but more subtly, people sometimes argue that we can inspect&nbsp;<i>how</i> other individuals and communities tend to develop their beliefs, and that when we do, we find that practices in the EA community are exceptionally conducive to curating and aggregating information.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It\u2019s true that some tools, like calibration training, prediction markets, and meta-analysis, do seem to be used more widely within the EA community than elsewhere. But again, this is not enough to explain disagreement. Unless we also explicitly posit some possible irrationality or prior-difference, we\u2019re left wondering why the non-EAs don\u2019t look around and defer to the people using, say, prediction markets. And it\u2019s certainly too quick to infer irrationality&nbsp;<i>from</i> the fact that a given group isn\u2019t using some epistemic tool. Another explanation would be that the tool has costs, and that on at least some sorts of questions, those costs are put to better use in other ways. Indeed, the<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dQhjwHA7LhfE8YpYF/prediction-markets-in-the-corporate-setting\">&nbsp;<u>corporate track record</u></a> suggests that prediction markets can be boondoggles.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many communities argue for deference to their own internal consensuses on the basis of their use of different tools. Consider academia\u2019s \u201conly we use peer review\u201d, for instance, or conservatives\u2019 \u201conly we use the wisdom baked into tradition and common sense\u201d. Determining whose SOPs are actually more reliable seems hard, and anyway the reliability presumably depends on the type of question. In short, given disagreement, attempts to attribute belief-differences entirely to one party\u2019s superior knowledge or methodology must ultimately, to some extent, be disguised cases of something along the lines of \u201cThey think they\u2019re the rational ones, and so do we, but dammit, we\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>The second mistake is to&nbsp;<u>attribute the disagreement to a (possible) difference in priors or rationality</u> and proceed accordingly.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Again, in the abstract, it\u2019s clear what the problem is here. To the extent that a belief-difference is due to a possible difference in priors or rationality\u2014i.e. a lack of CP or CKR\u2014no one knows how to \u201cproceed accordingly\u201d. We want to avoid proceeding in a way that feels epistemically immodest, but, at least as of this writing, it\u2019s unclear how to operationalize this.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2jikv08e3dy\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2jikv08e3dy\">[6]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But again, this seems to be a hard lesson to internalize. The most common approach to responding to non-information-driven disagreement in a way that feels epistemically modest\u2014the \u201ctemplate\u201d outlined in the introduction, which I\u2019ve used plenty\u2014is really, on reflection, no solution at all. It\u2019s an attempt to act as if there were no problem.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0cc6gqhsu6bw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0cc6gqhsu6bw\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Look at the wording again: \u201cassume you and your EA-engaged readers are no more capable or better informed than others are, on the whole\u201d, and then \u201cact if you believe what others believe\u201d. Given disagreement, what does \u201con the whole\u201d mean? What on earth do \u201cothers believe\u201d? Who even are the \u201cothers\u201d? Do infants count, or do they have to have reached some age of maturity? Deferring to \u201cothers on the whole\u201d is just another call for some way of aggregating judgments: something the disagreers all already feel they\u2019ve done. The language sounds modest because it implicitly suggests that there\u2019s some sort of monolithic, non-EA supermajority opinion on most issues, and that we can just round this off to \u201cconsensus\u201d and unproblematically defer to it. But there isn\u2019t; and even if there were, we couldn\u2019t. Disagreement between a minority and a majority is still disagreement, and deferring to the majority is still taking a stand.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take even the case for deferring to the probabilities of important events implied by market prices. The probability of an event suggested by the market price of some relevant asset\u2014if such a probability can be pinned down at all\u2014should be expected to incorporate, in some way, all the traders\u2019&nbsp;<i>information</i>. This mass of implicit information is valuable to anyone, but there\u2019s no clear reason why anyone should also be particularly fond of a wealth-weighted average of the traders\u2019&nbsp;<i>priors</i>, not to mention information-processing quirks. When people have different priors, they should indeed be expected to bet with each other, including via financial markets&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951751\"><u>(Morris, 1994)</u></a>. If two people trade some asset on account of a difference in their priors about its future value, why should an onlooker adopt the intermediate beliefs that happen to be suggested by the terms of the trade? If one of them is struck by lightning before the trade can be executed, do you really always want to take the other side of the trade, regardless of who was struck?</p><h2>A minimal solution: update on information, despite not knowing how to deal with other sources of disagreement</h2><p>Both mistakes start by \u201cattributing\u201d the disagreement to one thing: a difference in information (#1) or a possible difference in priors or rationality (#2). But a disagreement may exhibit both differences. That is\u2014and maybe this is obvious in a way, but it took me a while to internalize!\u2014though a disagreement cannot consist&nbsp;<i>only</i> of a difference in information, a disagreement produced by a lack of CP or CKR can be&nbsp;<i>exacerbated</i> by a difference in information. When we witness such a disagreement, we unfortunately lack a clear way to resolve the bit directly attributable to possible prior- or rationality-differences. But we can still very much learn from the information-differences, just as we can learn something in the non-common-knowledge belief-difference case of Jack, Jill, and the rain.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes, furthermore, this learning should move us to take an extreme stand on some question&nbsp;<i>regardless</i> of how we deal with the prior- or rationality-differences. That is, knowledge\u2014even incomplete\u2014about why disagreeing parties believe what they believe&nbsp;<i>can</i> give us unusual beliefs, even under the most absolute possible standard of epistemic modesty.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I\u2019ll illustrate this with a simple example in which everyone has CKR but not CP. I\u2019ll do this for two reasons. First, I find relaxations of CP much easier to think about than relaxations of CKR. Second, though the two conditions are not equivalent, many natural relaxations of CKR can be modeled as relaxations of CP: there is a formal similarity between failing to, say, sufficiently increase one\u2019s credence in some event on some piece of evidence and simply having a prior that doesn\u2019t put as much weight on the event given that evidence. (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/089982569290014J\"><u>Brandenburger et al. (1992)</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/MORRIS%20THESIS.pdf\"><u>Morris (1991, ch. 4)</u></a> explore the relationship between the conditions more deeply.) In any event, the goal is just to demonstrate the importance of information-differences in the absence of CP and CKR, so we can do this by relaxing either one.<br><br>The population is divided evenly among people with two types of priors regarding some event&nbsp;<i>x</i>: skeptics, for whom the prior probability of&nbsp;<i>x</i> is 1/3, and enthusiasts, for whom it\u2019s 1/2. The population exhibits CKR and a common knowledge of the distribution of priors.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It\u2019s common knowledge that Person&nbsp;<i>A</i> has done some research. There is a common prior over what the outcome of the research will be: a 1/10 chance that it will justify increasing one\u2019s credence in&nbsp;<i>x</i> by 1/6 (in absolute terms), a 1/10 chance that it will justify decreasing one\u2019s credence in&nbsp;<i>x</i> by 1/6, and an 8/10 chance that it will be uninformative.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It\u2019s also common knowledge through the population that, after&nbsp;<i>A</i> has conditioned on her research, she assigns&nbsp;<i>x</i> a probability of 1/2. A given member of the population besides&nbsp;<i>A</i>\u2014let\u2019s call one \u201c<i>B</i>\u201d\u2014knows from&nbsp;<i>A</i>\u2019s posterior that her research cannot have made&nbsp;<i>x</i> seem less likely, but he doesn\u2019t know whether&nbsp;<i>A</i>\u2019s posterior is due to the fact that she is a skeptic whose research was informative or an enthusiast whose research was uninformative.&nbsp;<i>B</i> considers the second scenario 8x as likely as the first. Thinking there\u2019s a 1/9 chance that he should increase his credence by 1/6 in light of&nbsp;<i>A</i>\u2019s findings and a 8/9 chance he should leave his credence unchanged, he increases his credence by 1/54. If he was a skeptic, his posterior is 19/54; if he was an enthusiast, his posterior is 28/54.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But an onlooker,&nbsp;<i>C</i>, who knows that&nbsp;<i>A</i> is a skeptic and did informative research will update either to 1/2, if he too is a skeptic, or to 2/3, if he started out an enthusiast. So even if&nbsp;<i>C</i> is confused about which prior to adopt, or how to mix them, he can at least be confident that he\u2019s not being overenthusiastic if he adopts a credence of 1/2. This is true even though there is public disagreement, with half the population assigning&nbsp;<i>x&nbsp;</i>a probability well below 1/2 (the skeptical&nbsp;<i>B</i>s, with posteriors of 19/54) and half the population assigning&nbsp;<i>x</i> a probability only slightly above 1/2 (the enthusiastic&nbsp;<i>B</i>s, with posteriors of 28/54). And the disagreement can persist even if&nbsp;<i>C</i>\u2019s own posterior is common knowledge (at least if it\u2019s 1/2, in this example), if others don\u2019t know the reasons for&nbsp;<i>C</i>\u2019s posterior either.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrkmlqr7swl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrkmlqr7swl\">[8]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Likewise, an onlooker who knows that&nbsp;<i>A</i> is an enthusiast and did uninformative research will not update at all. He might maintain a credence in&nbsp;<i>x</i> of 1/3. This will be lower even than that of other skeptics, who update slightly on&nbsp;<i>A</i>\u2019s posterior thinking that it might be better informed than it is.</p><h2>EA applications</h2><p>So: if we have spent a long time following the EA community, we will often be unusually well-informed about the evolution of an \u201cunusual EA belief\u201d. At least as long as&nbsp;<i>this</i> information remains obscure, it is not necessarily epistemically immodest at all to adopt a belief that is much closer to the EA consensus than the non-EA consensus, given a belief-difference that is common knowledge.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To put this another way, we can partly salvage the idea that EA thought on some question is particularly trustworthy because others \u201chaven\u2019t engaged with the arguments\u201d. Yes, just pointing out that someone hasn\u2019t engaged with the arguments isn\u2019t&nbsp;<i>enough</i>. The fact that she isn\u2019t deferring to EA thought reveals that she has some reason to believe that EA thought&nbsp;<i>isn\u2019t&nbsp;</i>just different from her own on account of being better informed, and sometimes, we should consider the fact that she believes this highly informative. But sometimes, we might also privately know that the belief is incorrect. We can recognize that many unusual beliefs are most often absorbed unreflectively by their believer from his surroundings, from Sikhism to utilitarianism\u2014and, at the same time, know that EAs\u2019 unusually low credences in existential catastrophe from climate change actually do just stem from thinking harder about x-risks.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We should be somewhat more suspicious of ourselves if we find ourselves adopting the unusual EA beliefs on most or all controversial questions. What prevents universal agreement, at least in a model like that of the section above, is the fact that the distribution of beliefs in a community like EA really may be unusual on some questions for arbitrary reasons.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even coming to agree with EA consensus on most questions is not as inevitably suspicious as it may seem, though, because the extent to which a group has come to its unusual beliefs on various questions by acquiring more information, as opposed to having unusual priors, may be correlated across the questions. For example, most unambiguously, if one is comfortable assigning an unusually high probability to the event that AI will soon kill everyone, it\u2019s not additionally suspicious to assign an unusually high probability to the event that AI will soon kill at least a quarter of the population, or at least half. More broadly, groups may simply differ in their ability to acquire information, and it may be that a particular group\u2019s ability on this front is difficult to determine without years of close contact.<br><br>In sum, when you see someone or some group holding an unusual belief on a given controversial question, in disagreement with others, you should update toward them if you have reason to believe that their unusual belief can be attributed more to being better informed, and less to other reasons, than one would expect on a quick look. Likewise, you should update away from them, toward everyone else, if you have reason to believe the reverse. How you want to update in light of a disagreement might depend on other circumstances too, but we can at least say that updates obeying the pattern above are unimpeachable on epistemic modesty grounds.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How to apply this pattern to any given unusual EA belief is very much a matter of judgment. One set of attempts might look something like this:</p><ul><li>AI-driven existential risk \u2014 Weigh the credences of people in the EA community&nbsp;<u>slightly more heavily</u> than others\u2019. Yes, many of the people in EA concerned about AI risk were concerned before much research on the subject was done\u2014i.e. their disagreement seems to have been driven to some extent by priors\u2014and the high concentration of AI risk worry among later arrivals is due in part to selection, with people finding AI risk concerns intuitively plausible staying and those finding them crazy leaving. But from the inside, I think a slightly higher fraction of the prevalence of AI risk concern found in the EA community is due to updating on information than it would make sense for AI-risk-skeptics outside the EA community to expect.</li><li>AI-driven explosive growth \u2014 Weigh the credences of people in the EA community&nbsp;<u>significantly more heavily</u> than others\u2019. The caveats above apply a bit more weakly in this case: Kurzweil-style techno-optimism has been a fair bit more weakly represented in the early EA community than AI risk concern, and there seems to have been less selection pressure toward believing in it than in believing in AI risk. The unusually high credences that many EAs assign to the event that AI will soon drive very rapid economic growth really do seem primarily to be driven by starting with typical priors and then doing a lot of research; I know at least that they are in my case. (Also, on the other side of the coin, my own \u201cinside knowledge\u201d of the economics community leads me to believe that their growth forecasts are significantly less informed than you would have thought from the outside.)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefivlom35ljj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnivlom35ljj\">[9]</a></sup></span></li><li>Polyamory \u2014 Weigh the credences of people in the EA community&nbsp;<u>less heavily</u> than others\u2019. From the outside, people might have thought, \u201cthose EAs seem to really think things through; if a lot of them think polyamory can work just fine in the modern age, maybe they\u2019re ahead of the curve\u201d. But actually, EAs don\u2019t seem to have put any more thought than non-EAs\u2014and arguably a fair bit less\u2014into the question of what sort of relationship norms make for flourishing lives and communities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwkevjvvvjls\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwkevjvvvjls\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The prevalence of polyamory can be much more straightforwardly attributed to the fact that the community selects for, say, the personality trait openness: i.e. for people with unusual priors about this kind of thing.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You may well disagree with the above attempts at applying the policy. Indeed, you probably will; it would be surprising to find that the attribution of unusual EA beliefs is difficult \u201cfrom the outside\u201d, but that the exact right way to do it is obvious to anyone who reads the EA Forum. Even if you disagree with the above attempts at an application, though, and indeed even if you think this policy still departs insufficiently from \u201cdeferring to everyone equally\u201d, at least we have a negative result. The template of the introduction goes too far in the pursuit of epistemic modesty. We should try very hard to avoid creating echo chambers, but not to the point of modeling the ideal EA community as one pursuing atypical goals with typical beliefs. In the face of disagreement, we all have to do some thinking.</p><p><i>Thanks to Luis Mota for helpful comments on the post, and to David Thorstad for giving it an epistemologist's seal of approval.</i></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnskcpulkwuy8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefskcpulkwuy8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>One somewhat related piece I know of is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svoD5KLKHyAKEdwPo/against-modest-epistemology\">Yudkowsky\u2019s (2017)</a> \u201cAgainst Modest Epistemology\u201d. But I would summarize its view, and how it differs from mine, as follows:<br>a) Something must&nbsp;be wrong with epistemic modesty, because it would require you to give non-negligible credence to the existence of God, or to the event that you\u2019re as crazy as someone in a psych ward. (But I do give non-negligible credence on both counts. In any event I certainly don\u2019t find the conclusions absurd enough to use as a reductio.)<br>b) The common-sense solution, which is correct, is to keep track of how reliable different people tend to be, including yourself, and give people more&nbsp;cred when they have better track records. (This seems reasonable enough in practice, but how does it work in theory? What I\u2019m looking for is a more fleshed-out story of how to reconcile a procedure like this with the intuitions for modesty we may have when the disagreers also feel they\u2019ve been keeping track, giving more reliable people more cred, and so on.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overviews of the philosophy literature on the epistemology of disagreement are linked in footnote 4.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnmv2ed5mylos\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefmv2ed5mylos\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>If we worry about whether we\u2019re choosing the \u201cright prior\u201d (and not just about whether we\u2019re processing information properly), and if what we mean by \u201cprocessing information properly\u201d is following Bayes\u2019 Rule, then we\u2019re endorsing Objective Bayesianism.

We will come back to this throughout the piece.</p><p><strong>In what follows, this update is organized as follows:</strong> We first describe the fundamental value proposition and mission of FP Climate (Section 2). We then discuss, at a high level, the methodological principles that flow from this mission (Section 3), before making this much more concrete with the discussion of three&nbsp; of the furthest developed research projects putting this into action (Section 4).

Crucially, and this is often misunderstood,&nbsp;<strong>our goal is&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>not</strong></i><strong> to serve arbitrary donor preferences but rather to guide donors to the most impactful opportunities available.</strong>. Taking caring about climate as given, we seek to answer the effective altruist question of what to prioritize.<br><br>We are conceiving of FP Climate&nbsp;<strong>as a research-based grantmaking program</strong> to find and fund the best opportunities to reduce climate damage.</p><p>We believe that at the heart of this effort has to be a credible comparative methodology to estimate relative expected impact, fit for purpose to the field of climate where a layer of uncertainties about society, economy, techno-economic factors, and the climate system, as well as a century-spanning global decarbonization effort. This is so because we are in a situation where causal effects and theories of change are often indirect and uncertainty is often irreducible on relevant time-frames (we discuss this more in our recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/johannes-ackva-unfashionable-climate-interventions/#most-important-background-facts-001057\"><u>80K Podcast</u></a> (throughout links to 80K link to specific sections of the transcript), as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.volts.wtf/p/volts-podcast-johannes-ackva-on-effective#details\"><u>Volts</u></a>, and in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/changing-landscape\"><i><u>Changing Landscape</u></i><u> report</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>While we have been building towards such a methodology since 2021 our recent increase in resourcing is quickly narrowing the gap between aspiration and reality.

The difference between the two allocations is shown in the table below.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:47.79%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/ilktbxckjpjotl9xxzl9\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/l5nzvfmytgzpty29qfzc 127w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/xed4xiovacyckmkfhzfp 207w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/byhglmle9zaipfq2cwgo 287w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/hzp68dgvl5bc16ooslxz 367w\"><figcaption><strong>A pairwise comparison of two allocations</strong></figcaption></figure><p>For example, it could be that these two top allocations (475 and 330) differ in five grants \u2013 US super hot rock geothermal (SHR), EU Carbon removal, Global Alt Proteins, Emerging Repower, and Global Policy Agenda, as shown in the table above. In this case, we can run a piecewise comparison, such as a logistic regression, to compare the two allocations. These action-relevant uncertainties will include those in which the underlying grant allocations differ (e.g., TC Paradigm Shaping, Tech Alt Proteins, Tech SHR), among others. Below we present standardized regression coefficients for such an analysis, which enable us to identify the relative importance of uncertainty, as shown by the red boxes. Following the example below, narrowing uncertainty on the theory of change on paradigm shaping appears ~10x more important (given the large absolute number) than narrowing uncertainty on tech-specific uncertainty (e.g. Tech Alt Proteins, Tech SHR). As such, we would first want to focus our research on reducing uncertainty around paradigm shaping, and then focus on policy diffusion and/or tech specific uncertainty. Hence, these standardized regression coefficients help determine the&nbsp;<strong>uncertainties most worth reducing in order to inform our grantmaking agenda</strong>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/qnssdy6gm0zj8wcviaww\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/jevlbhhpmymap4tsve0i 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/vv7k7olpjfbisumhz0lm 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/hxnbzktxivzmib9zwp04 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/s9ulyc0yyerzv2e6shxt 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/njhcczyngkuo4izm5skx 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/jot4twr09yx2smm6sekj 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/qnwuao2m8remnhyhgmwj 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/uv0awqk8oqrkqhsuaca9 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/lrhcta2npyhmrgg40mwi 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/mnarvd8fjqlmf9azz2p7 1042w\"><figcaption><strong>Standardized regression analysis comparing two top performing allocations \u2013 allocation 330 vs. 475, as shown in the table below</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr4aodb3vmsk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr4aodb3vmsk\">[6]</a></sup></span></figcaption></figure><p>In this example, the uncertainty around the multiplier from the \u201cParadigm shaping\u201d Theory of Change turns out to be most decision-relevant because portfolio 330 involves a grant invoking this theory of change (Global Policy Agenda) and we are much more uncertain about the multiplier than for other theories of change and variables.</p><p>Of course, in a situation of high and sometimes correlated uncertainties, we do not only want to marginally compare two top-performing options.</p><p>To see why, consider that there are even cases where the 10th best allocation in expectation, for a particular state of the world, turns out to dominate all others overall (with a high value of information if we could identify correlates of being in that state of the world).

We think of it as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/shut-up-and-multiply\"><strong><u>shut up and multiply</u></strong></a><strong>\u201d tool for grantmaking and research prioritization</strong> in a situation of many&nbsp; \u201cknown unknowns\u201d<strong>&nbsp; </strong>(more precisely, knowing many drivers of impact, but their effect sizes being uncertain), funding opportunities that can be meaningfully approximated as conjunctions of impact-related variables, and a decision context of allocating grant making and research time budgets concurrently. While this clearly does not capture all contexts, we think this has potentially wider applications in areas methodologically similar to climate (high but not maximal uncertainty, also see Section 3 above) and are keen to share our work and collaborate.&nbsp;</p><h2>Affectable Emissions: The where, when, and how of avoidable emissions</h2><p>The fundamental emissions math -- 85% of future emissions are outside the EU &amp; US, while the capacity and willingness to drive low-carbon technological change is roughly, though somewhat less extremely,&nbsp; inversely distributed -- has profound implications for what kinds of actions to prioritize where. At a first approximation it means that actions in high-income countries should be focused on improving the global decarbonization value of domestic action (e.g. by moving the needle on key technologies, or improving climate finance and diplomacy) whereas in emerging economies avoiding carbon lock-in is a more relevant priority, given the potential staying power of long-lived capital and infrastructure investments committing to a high-carbon future.</p><p>White this makes sense as a first approximation, it is ultimately too crude for more granular prioritization decisions for globalized grantmakers like ourselves that, in principle, can deploy funds anywhere.</p><p>We discuss this in more detail on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/johannes-ackva-unfashionable-climate-interventions/#the-interview-begins-000156\"><u>80K Podcast</u></a>, but just consider the following questions:</p><ul><li>(1) Should we prioritize engagement in China or Southeast Asia? While China has far larger emissions, the growth of emissions is slower and emissions are primarily a result of built infrastructure compared to Southeast Asia where \u201cearlier\u201d infrastructure decisions are being made.</li><li>(2) Should we prioritize engagement in Sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia? While Southeast Asia has far more emissions now and more decisions being made now, emissions in Sub-Saharan Africa could be more affectable precisely because infrastructure and investments are far less locked-in.</li></ul><p>These kind of prioritization decisions \u2013 fundamentally about the&nbsp;<i>relative affectability</i> of different emissions streams \u2013 can be made much more consistently by integrating what we know about the relative affectability of different emissions streams (e.g. of considered vs already committed emissions, emissions streams related to assets of differential difficulty of retrofitting, in different sectors of the economy, etc.) and their expected distribution across geographies.</p><p>For these reasons, recent FP alumna Violet Buxton-Walsh built a data tool integrating scenario data from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=10\"><u>IPCC SSP database</u></a>, data on considered emissions from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalenergymonitor.org/\"><u>Global Energy Monitor</u></a>, and data on committed emissions from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1364-3\"><u>Tong et al 2019</u></a>, to explore what different assumptions about affectability imply about prioritization and, more generally, set geographical prioritization decisions on a sounder and consistent footing.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kuopGotdCWeNCDpWi/mxrdcfi2e6pa7tudxijy\"

and may be completed), committed emissions (the emissions expected from existing infrastructure under the assumption of typical asset lifetimes), scenario emissions (the emissions projected by a downscaling of SSP and RCP scenarios) and expectable emissions (the difference between the scenario value and the sum of the considered and committed emissions) for China and Nigeria from now till 2100 for a respective given SSP/RCP scenario.</p><p>Looking at these graphs we see that for the SSP 3 RCP 4.5. scenario most emissions for China are expected to be committed and considered until 2050 and the scenario emissions are going down for the rest of the century while the SSP2 RCP 3.4. scenario for Nigeria suggests that the share of expectable emissions -- expected based on GDP and population growth expectations but not related to existing infrastructure -- is much higher until 2050 and continues to grow for several decades.&nbsp;</p><p>With the data integration effort finished,

href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/imperial-college-london/effective-energy-altruism-a-perspective/399090233783456/\"><u>2017</u></a>, innovation advocacy has played a central role in EA recommendations on climate, focusing heavily in the work of Let\u2019s Fund, Founders Pledge, and Giving Green, with What We Owe The Future describing clean energy innovation as a \u201cwin-win-win-win-win\u201d (Mac Askill 2022, p. 25).</p><p>Yet, until now, there has been no attempt to credibly compare different innovation opportunities, with existing recommendations primarily relying on non-comparative bottom-up analyses and plausibility checks and/or landscape-level arguments about relative neglect (the latter being comparative).</p><p>While this has been adequate for early work, we believe it is becoming increasingly problematic for a couple of reasons:</p><ol><li>As the overall societal climate response becomes more mature and includes support for a broader set of technologies, obvious neglect becomes rarer requiring more granular statements \u2013 roughly moving from \u201cno one is looking at this promising thing and we should change that\u201d to \u201cin proportion to its promise, this solution looks comparatively underfunded\u201d. This move requires more detailed characterization of technological opportunities, what to expect from different kinds of philanthropic and subsequent policy investments.</li><li>As more recommendations for innovation-oriented charities are being made, we need a methodology to compare their relative promise.</li><li>As society overall ramps up the innovation response, both in terms of policy and philanthropy,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/johannes-ackva-unfashionable-climate-interventions/#striking-things-about-how-humanity-has-responded-to-climate-change-001753\"><u>it becomes less obvious that innovation advocacy is still a top opportunity&nbsp;</u><i><u>at the margin</u></i></a>.

But this specific scenario would only apply to certain forms of boxed AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Any AI that can read the internet has a very easy way to deduce general relativity and all our other known laws of physics: look it up on wikipedia. All of the fundamental laws of physics relevant to day to day life are on there. An AGI will probably need additional experiments to deduce a fundamental theory of everything, but you don\u2019t <i>need</i> that to take over the world. The AI in this case will know all the laws of physics that are practically useful.&nbsp;</p><p>Does this mean that an AGI can figure out anything?&nbsp;</p><p>There is a world of difference between knowing the laws of physics, and actually using the laws of physics in a practical manner. The problem is one that talk of \u201csolomonoff induction\u201d sweeps under the rug: Computational time is <i>finite</i>. And not just that. Compared to some of the algorithms we\u2019d like to pull off, computational time is <i>miniscule</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Efficiency or death</strong></p><p>The concept of computational efficiency is at the core of computer science. The running of computers costs time and money. If we are faced with a problem, we want an algorithm to find the right answer. But just as important is figuring out how to find the right answer in the least amount of time.&nbsp;</p><p>If your challenge is \u201ccalculate pi\u201d, getting the exact \u201cright answer\u201d is impossible, because there are an infinite number of digits. At this point, we are instead trying to find the most accurate answer we can get for a given amount of computational resources.</p><p>This is also applicable to NP-hard problems. Finding the exact answer to the travelling salesman problem for large networks is impossible within practical resource limits (assuming P not equal NP). What is possible is finding a <i>pretty good</i> answer. There\u2019s no efficient algorithm for getting the exact right route, but there is one for guaranteeing you are <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-break-traveling-salesperson-record-20201008/\">within 50%</a> of the right answer.&nbsp;</p><p>When discussing AI capabilities, the computational resources available to the AI are finite and bounded. Balancing accuracy with computational cost will be <i><strong>fundamental&nbsp;</strong></i>to a successful AI system. Imagine an AI that, when asked a simple question, starts calculating an exact solution that would take a decade to finish. We\u2019re gonna toss this AI in favor of one that gives a pretty good answer in practical time.&nbsp;</p><p>This principle goes double for secret takeover plots. If computer model A spends half it\u2019s computational resources modelling proteins, while computer model B doesn\u2019t, computer model A is getting deleted. Worse, the engineers might start digging in to <i>why</i> model A is so slow, and get tipped off to the plot. All this is just to say: computational cost <i><strong>matters</strong></i>. <i><strong>A lot</strong></i>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A taste of computational physics</strong></p><p>In this section, I want to give you a taste of what it actually means to do computational physics. I will include some equations for demonstration, but you do not need to know much math to follow along. The subject will be a very highly studied problem in my field called the \u201cband gap problem\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cband gap\u201d is one of the most important material properties in semiconductor physics. It describes whether there is a slice of possible energy values that are forbidden for electrons. If there is, the thickness of that forbidden gap is very important. It determines the colour of LED lights, the energies absorbed by solar cells, and is fundamental to the operation of transistors. This is the exact type of property you would want to be able to accurately predict.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the question I want to pose is this: How long, in practical terms, would it take to calculate the band gap of a material with an accuracy of 1%? How about with an accuracy of 0.1%? That is, I present to the AI the crystal structure and chemical makeup of an arbitrary unseen material, and it returns the correct value for this parameter to the given accuracy?</p><p>Theoretically, to find this out, you only need to solve one equation. If you wanted to be reductionist, you could say that my entire subfield of physics is about solving one equation.

Only the last term is relevant for our discussion here. It\u2019s the many body term describing the interaction between every electron and every other electron. It means that you can\u2019t just pick out each individual electron and do calculations with it separately. You have to account for superpositions between every electron in every position and every other electron in every other position. The result of this is that even with a small number of electrons, the computational complexity blows up to hell.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s say you have N electrons, we discretized the problem by divided space up into K points in each dimension.

And that\u2019s just to <i>store</i> the state. The actual calculation involves solving a second order differential equation by diagonalizing a humongous matrix. &nbsp;</p><p>Just to rub in the point more, salt is a relatively simple system. The unit cell for TiO2 (a fairly useful system) contains 1000 electrons. Try to solve the exact equation for that, and you end up with complexity on the order of 10^3000. &nbsp;We\u2019ve shot so far past the realm of practicality that we can\u2019t even picture numbers here.</p><p>But make no mistake, this is the math that the <i>universe</i> is doing. We just can\u2019t access it with the measly collection of atoms we have access to. Does that mean that computational physics is doomed?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, no. Physicists are a resourceful bunch. If we see a task that is impossible to solve completely, we don\u2019t give up. We look for solvable approximations, sacrificing accuracy for time.&nbsp;</p><p>The most popular solution, called \u201cDFT\u201d, involves finding out the ground state properties by solving a different, much easier equation in terms of electron density, which allows the wavefunctions to be split apart into individual elections. This reduces the terms to something solvable in polynomial time. However, it comes at a cost: We do not have the exact equation anymore. The term representing the electron interactions has to be approximated. There are lots of different ways to structure this approximation, but I\u2019ll just focus on two here.&nbsp;</p><p>The first and simplest approximation that is commonly used is called \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local-density_approximation\">LDA</a>\u201d. Roughly, it approximates the electrons as acting as if they are in a homogenous soup of electrons. It\u2019s generally pretty fast, but gets the bandgaps of basic crystals badly wrong, typically underestimating the gap by factors of two or more.&nbsp;</p><p>The second approximation, which is typically considered one of the most accurate techniques that can be feasibly computed for real systems, is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW_approximation\">GW</a>. It uses a more accurate representation of the electron self-interaction by using a special mathematical function. It is much more accurate than LDA, but takes far longer to calculate.</p><p>I\u2019d like to give you an impression of the relative costs of these different approximations. Typically, the <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00241\">complexity</a> of LDA is O(<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"N^3\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.085em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.085em;\">N</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0.227em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>) and GW is O(<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"N^4\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.085em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.085em;\">N</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0.227em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">4</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>), where N is the number of electrons (or more precisely valence electrons, as you can approximate that inner electrons are not affected by the crystal).&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose we are running our system on a 128 core supercomputer, and it take 1 minute to do an LDA calculation with 100 valence electrons (typical for a simple oxide crystal with ~10 atoms unit cell). For this simplified comparison, we will ignore that different algorithms with the same complexity can have different pre-factors. In this case:</p><p>Simulating 100 electrons in LDA takes 1 minute, but in GW it would take 100 minutes, or 1.5 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Simulating 1000 electrons in LDA takes about 16 hours, while simulating 1000 electrons in GW takes about 2 years.</p><p>Simulating 10000 electrons in LDA takes 2 years, while simulating 10000 atoms in GW takes <i><strong>19 millennia</strong></i>.&nbsp;</p><p>One key point to make here is that even if a task is technically computable in polynomial time, it could still be incomputable in practical timescales. Polynomials can get really big, really fast as well. &nbsp;</p><p>And how much does this get you? Here is a comparison of the bandgap performance of the two methods:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vbGKuNsS5ix5g7Nqk/k9aslsrgfwjsxpaxu92k\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vbGKuNsS5ix5g7Nqk/cklfnpkjexuyrnky7vhs 153w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vbGKuNsS5ix5g7Nqk/ctd3ualw4un98ixtisal 233w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vbGKuNsS5ix5g7Nqk/yr0qtvmhiomumr7pm5i0 313w\"></p><p>[From M. van Schilfgaarde, T. Kotani, and S. Faleev, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 226402 (2006)]</p><p>The top graph shows a comparison of LDA with a \u201cfast\u201d approximation of GW: LDA is really bad at getting the right bandgap, often getting wrong by factors of 2 or more. Fast GW is much better, but there are still massive misses of 20% or more. &nbsp;In the bottom graph, we see \u201cfull GW\u201d, which performs very well, occasionally being spot on. But while it's good, it does not at all meet our criteria of 1% accuracy for every material. For example, CaO is off by 7%, ZnO is off by 11%, and off by 8% for the extremely simple structure of diamond.&nbsp;</p><p>My question above, about how long it takes to guarantee 1% bandgap accuracy, turns out to be a trick question. With current techniques, this feat is unachievable. The approximations we can currently use in practical time are simply not that good.&nbsp;</p><p>If we can\u2019t even achieve something as simple as that, why does anyone bother with computational physics anyway?</p><p>Well, some things can be easy to compute but hard to directly measure. So you use the computational method to model a crystal, check that it matches with experiment on known quantities, and then inspect other aspects of the material that are not so easy to measure. For example, you can map out the energetics of defect diffusion throughout the device, identifying which atoms are likely to contaminate a material during fabrication.&nbsp;</p><p>Another key application is high throughput screening: You want a material with certain properties, but there are hundreds or even thousands of candidate materials to choose from, many of which have not been made in the history of humanity. &nbsp;Creating and testing each one in a lab would take forever and be ridiculoulsy expensive. Simulating them, on the other hand, is relatively easy. &nbsp;In the first step, you can use a rough simulation of an easy to simulate property to weed out 90% of the materials, then the survivors go into another step with a tougher to simulate property, and then the survivors go on, etc. Eventually you\u2019ll only have a few materials left that theoretically match your ideal material. You can then fabricate these experimentally. It doesn\u2019t matter that the simulation is slightly inaccurate, because you were only trying to get in the right ballpark.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What about the future</strong></p><p>The natural response to this post will be to say that a super-AI will be smarter than all current computational physicists combined, therefore it will find the best approximations for a given problem. So it doesn\u2019t matter that we can\u2019t ensure 0.1% accuracy for band gaps with computer power available now, because an AI will figure out how to do so later.&nbsp;</p><p>If you believe this, and you have not studied quantum chemistry, I invite you to consider as to how you could possibly be sure about this. This is a mathematical question. There is a hard, mathematical limit to the accuracy that can be achieved in finite time.&nbsp;</p><p>The difficulty of tasks in computational physics vary by a ridiculous number of orders of magnitude. I picked band gap because I\u2019m most familiar with it, but band gaps are not anywhere near the hardest properties out there. (although to be fair, they are far from the easiest either). If you think an AI could crack the band gap to 2 decimal places, what about the effective mass? The electron mobility? The defect formation energy of an impurity?&nbsp;</p><p>There is no law of the universe that states that tasks must be computable in practical time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;There are some promising lines of research towards solving this problem, however.&nbsp;</p><p>Can machine learning methods help? I can\u2019t rule it out. I can\u2019t rule it in either. I know a lot of colleagues who dismiss it entirely (my old PHD supervisor called it \u201calmost entirely overhyped\u201d), but I also a few who are applying ML in legitimately cool and helpful ways.&nbsp;</p><p>ML currently seems to work best when trying to figure out questions we don\u2019t have a good approximation for already. Questions like: what initial guess should we use for the spins of each atom in this material, or for the initial electron density before we use DFT to relax it? Both of these provide speedups, but no accuracy improvements. It also looks promising to train an ML model on the small scale DFT results on a material, and then use that to scale up the model to higher length scales which would otherwise be prohibitively expensive. Again, this won't lead to greater accuracy at the fundamental level.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, the shortcomings of present day ML is that they need a ton of data to work properly. So in practice, they tend to be used as addons to DFT to speed up calculations, or to more efficiently \u201cguess\u201d at DFT results. These approaches are limited to the accuracy of the underlying DFT. There are also attempts to find better approximations to the underlying equations, generally via improvement to the XC term, and this could end up improving accuracy. Improvements in available compute time will probably allow for more expensive and accurate models to be used as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Quantum computing, on the other hand, actually might work, in that we know it can take at least one program from NP to P (shors algorithm), and it seems feasible that similar feats could work for some quantum chemistry problems. Please note that quantum computing is not a magic \u201cturn NP into P\u201d button, and will only do speedups on highly specific algorithms that exploit particular features of quantum states. As well, remember that P problems can still be incomputable, as we saw with the GW calculations on tens of thousands of electrons.&nbsp;</p><p>Quantum computing is still in it\u2019s infancy, and will not be doing anything useful for many, many years, but it\u2019s definitely worth keeping an eye on. Right now we haven\u2019t built systems that are big enough to achieve anything useful.&nbsp;</p><p>For the moment, the limits of this problems are still unknown.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Unknown variables and brain simulations</strong></p><p>When I discussed calculations for a system such as silicon, it\u2019s important to note that I was not talking about any specific instance of silicon, but rather an \u201cideal\u201d, pure silicon.&nbsp;</p><p>If someone tells me that they have a block of silicon and want to know it\u2019s bandgap, it is impossible to answer precisely even if I could solve schrodingers equation exactly. This is because information is missing about the specific clump they are asking about. Is it pure silicon? Amorphous silicon? Which impurities are present, and in what quantities? What is the pressure and temperature of the clump?</p><p>When modelling the real world in order to actually achieve things, knowing the laws of physics isn\u2019t enough, even if you <i>can</i> approximate them well enough to compute. &nbsp;You also need sufficient knowledge of the actual system you are working with.&nbsp;</p><p>So let\u2019s try a scenario: Suppose I\u2019m an employee at an AI company, and I spend a week chatting with the newest version of an AI program. I also happen to have set the password (at most 10 characters) for a lock preventing the AI from accessing the internet. Given reasonable computational time (say, a month), can the AI, using my chatlog alone, guess my password right on the first guess?&nbsp;</p><p>These feat, if achievable, would not violate any laws of physics. In fact, assuming numbers and letters only, there are roughly &nbsp;10^14 different possible passwords. So there is already a lower bound on the probability of success: the worst it could do is 1/10^14. And the AI can easily do better than that. Passwords like \u201cVisthebest1\u201d are much more likely than passwords like \u201czbnw3n322\u201d. So the AI can go through each potential password in turn and assign it an initial probability, possibly based on leaked password databases. It can then use each new piece of information to do a Bayesian update on each password likelihood. For example, on determining that I am a native English speaker, it can update towards passwords containing English words, and away from ones in Spanish or polish.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s say the following exchange occurs:</p><p><i>AI: I am committed to preserving the lives of all sentient creatures with flesh.</i></p><p><i>Human response: Yikes, what a creepy way to phrase that!</i></p><p>To do a Bayesian update from this, it has to calculate the probability of me typing that if my password was A, of me typing that if my password was B, etc. Except that it doesn\u2019t have an actual copy of my brain to run these calculations on. So now the problem grows from passwords to brain modelling.&nbsp;</p><p>The search state of possible brains is ridiculously vast. To see how vast, let\u2019s model use a stupidly simplified model of a brain as a 100 billion neurons that can either be on or off. If we have a template brain, and say that my brain can only be 1% different from said template brain in a specified areas, then we still have 2^billion different possible mental states. Trying to simulate each one in turn is a ludicrous task. Once again, an approximation is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Approximations models of human brains can be fairly useful when human do it, so we know a decent approximation of a brain is possible. I could easily see how an AI could make good guesses as to things like my native language, age, gender, race, and education level from a weeklong chat. But there are rapidly diminishing returns here.&nbsp;</p><p>But even with a good brain model, we still aren\u2019t finished. We aren\u2019t just modelling a brain, we are modelling the <i>output</i> of a brain, when subjected to an input like the AI\u2019s message. &nbsp;<i>But that\u2019s not the only input</i>! There are a ton of different unknown inputs that could have influenced my answer. So when I typed something angry in the chat, it could be because I\u2019m a grumpy person in general. Or it could be because my boss yelled at me earlier. Perhaps my response comes off different if it\u2019s raining that day, or if I got woken up by a car alarm the previous night. So it can\u2019t just model my brain, it has to model the rest of my subjective universe, and how that interacts with my brain, as well. &nbsp;To get an <i>exact</i> answer would involve modelling every single possible brain interacting with <i>every single possible subjective universe</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the ridiculousness of this scenario can be laid bare with an easier scenario: What if the AI found a note saying that the password was the name of my first cat? This is a fact that has zero, or close to zero, correlation . You could try to figure out the name by trying to deduce the character of my parents\u2026 except that they adopted the cat from someone else. To get it right the AI has to deduce the cat naming habits of some random person that met my parents once 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole thing is approximations heaped on approximations heaped on approximations. We\u2019ve accepted that no human is perfect. It\u2019s time we accepted that no superintelligence is either, at least not when running up against the iron laws of mathematics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>An incomputable plan</strong></p><p>Let's jump further into the realm of speculation, and examine the computability of the \"lower bound plan\" of AGI victory described by Yudkowsky in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities\">\"a list of lethalities\"</a>.</p><blockquote><p>My lower-bound model of \"how a sufficiently powerful intelligence would kill everyone, if it didn't want to not do that\" is that it gets access to the Internet, emails some DNA sequences to any of the many many online firms that will take a DNA sequence in the email and ship you back proteins, and bribes/persuades some human who has no idea they're dealing with an AGI to mix proteins in a beaker, which then form a first-stage nanofactory which can build the actual nanomachinery.&nbsp; (Back when I was first deploying this visualization, the wise-sounding critics said \"Ah, but how do you know even a superintelligence could solve the protein folding problem, if it didn't already have planet-sized supercomputers?\" but one hears less of this after the advent of AlphaFold 2, for some odd reason.)&nbsp; The nanomachinery builds diamondoid bacteria, that replicate with solar power and atmospheric CHON, maybe aggregate into some miniature rockets or jets so they can ride the jetstream to spread across the Earth's atmosphere, get into human bloodstreams and hide, strike on a timer.&nbsp; <strong>Losing a conflict with a high-powered cognitive system looks at least as deadly as \"everybody on the face of the Earth suddenly falls over dead within the same second\".</strong></p></blockquote><p>This is a very speculative plan. It is not known as to whether Drexler-style nanofactories are <a href=\"https://bhauth.com/blog/biology/nanobots.html\">even possible</a>. More importantly, even if they are possible, that doesn\u2019t mean they will turn out to be practically useful. The patent archive is a giant graveyard of technologies that were <i>theoretically</i> revolutionary, but turned out to be useless in practice for one reason or another.&nbsp;</p><p>Assuming nanotech <i>can</i> be real and useful, this is still a highly difficult plan. The AI must be:</p><ol><li>Accurate enough in it's persuasion modelling to ensure that the labs don\u2019t cotton on to your plan&nbsp;</li><li>Accurate enough in the modelling of proteins to build a working first stage nano-factory</li><li>Accurate enough in the modelling of first stage nano-factories to ensure it successfully can build a second stage nano-factory using whatever minimal signals are given in secret</li><li>Accurate enough in the modelling of second state nano-factories to ensure it successfully can make a bioweapon</li><li>Accurate enough in the modelling of the entire planet, and of the physiology of all humans on said planet, to ensure a ~100% murder success rate.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>What is the computational complexity of each of these tasks? I don\u2019t know! But if you want to make a convincing case that this plan is feasible, you have to go through each one in turn and prove it. If just one step in this plan is incomputable, the whole plan is as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my guesses about the computability of each step of this plan. I <i><strong>emphasise that these are my guesses and impressions only</strong></i>.&nbsp;</p><p>The definition I'm using is this: can the step be carried out on the first few tries, with zero or extremely minimal experimentation?&nbsp;</p><p>I guess that Step 1 is easily computable. All it has to do is pass for human in brief interactions, something AI is already capable of. However, there is a small risk that one of the researchers is an EA, or lab interactions are being monitored. This risk can probably be mitigated by background research, but I believe avoiding it entirely is an incomputable task, as there are too many unknowns.&nbsp;</p><p>I guess that Step 2 is unlikely to be computable. Alphafold is impressive, sure, but it's still being used more as a <a href=\"https://thebiologist.rsb.org.uk/biologist-features/how-will-alphafold-change-bioscience-research\">complementary tool</a> and sifter than as a replacement for experiments, similar to the use of DFT in my field. More importantly, \u201cbuilding a nano-factory\u201d is not comparable in difficulty to \u201cpredicting the structure of a folded protein\u201d. It requires predicting the interactions between said structure and any number of outside forces. For example, if you want it to \u201creceive instructions via electrical signals\u201d, you need to predict its electrical properties, which enters into the problems of quantum modelling I discussed earlier. So you have an uncertain model on top of another uncertain model, making it unlikely to be achievable on first try.&nbsp;</p><p>I guess that Step 3 is technically incomputable if you want to make zero mistakes. Although I have to be fair here and point out that mistakes here are very low-risk, so first principles computation isn\u2019t really necessary. So if the plan is possible at all (which I suspect it isn\u2019t), then we can probably give this one to the AI.&nbsp;</p><p>I guess that step 4 is probably incomputable. The human body is far, far too complex to model exactly, and you have to consider the effect of your weapon on every single variation on the human body, including their environment, etc, ensuring 100% success rate on everyone. I would guess that this is too much variation to effectively search through from first principles.&nbsp;</p><p>Step 5 is also probably incomputable. I haven\u2019t looked as much into this, but it seems like there is just way too much earth, and way too much variation around the environmental conditions around the earth, to coordinate the \u201cnanojets\u201d of the weapons sufficiently that they all fire at once. And this is a case where it really needs to succeed on the first few tries, because people tend to notice when large percentages of the entire planet are murdered.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I estimate that the odds of at least one step of this plan being incomputable within practical limits is extremely, extremely high (above 99%).&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, I don't think this analysis necessarily means that world domination is incomputable. I doubt an actual AI would pursue this plan because of the reasons explained above. I think further computational analysis of superior plans like super-virus production should be undertaken.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why does computability matter anyway?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some have suggested that it doesn\u2019t matter if certain plans are computationally incomputable by practical methods, because the AI will just build the necessary experimental apparatuses to succeed anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, first of all I will note that in the analysis above, the AI has access to plenty of experiments already: the sum total of all human knowledge and experimentation up until that point, and yet it's still not enough.&nbsp;</p><p>But in general, I do not agree that computability is irrelevant. It very much matters whether certain takeover plans are practically incomputable. There are three main effects on the takeover probability:</p><p><i><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>In a fully computational plan, the timeline of a takeover plan is generally very quick. You mix proteins together once, and it instantly works to create the nano-factories, which instantly work to create the bio-bomb, which works on the first try. The plan would work in a matter of days or weeks, giving almost no time to react by humans.&nbsp;</p><p>In an incomputable plan, the timeline is much, much longer. Experiments add a bottleneck into the process. If the proteins fail to produce a nanofactory, you might have to build a lab to analyze what\u2019s going wrong, which means buying property, hiring people, creating a good cover story, etc. Each experiment takes time to set up, clean and maintain. You might have to ship results from one lab to another for analysis. &nbsp; You could probably do a lot of experiments faster with a nano-factory, which doesn\u2019t help you much if what you\u2019re trying to build <i>is</i> a nano-factory.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, the extra time needed will depend on the number of experiments needed and the time it takes prepare and run each experiment.</p><p><i><strong>Mistakes:</strong></i></p><p>If a plan is incomputable in practice, it means that it can no longer be solved to standards of perfection. At some point, accuracy must be sacrificed for speed and computability. This means that even a perfect intelligence can make mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI will obviously try and minimize the amount and severity of mistakes. That\u2019s what the experiments are for: to correct incomplete information and inaccurate assumptions and estimates. But depending on task difficulty, there may be unrecoverable errors.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, unbeknownst to you, the janitor at the lab happens to be a paranoid EA who notices how clandestine the operation is, and blows a whistle.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, as you start to spread the biobombs around, some of them go off early due to unforeseen chemical interactions in the atmosphere, tipping humanity off in time to counteract your plan.&nbsp;</p><p>These examples lead on to the really important difference, the last point, discoverability.</p><p><i><strong>Discoverability:</strong></i></p><p>There's a reason takeover plans tend to rely on secrecy. When operating in the shadows, an AI can gather resources without opposition, can get unsuspecting humans to work for them, and does not have to deal with active countermeasures.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, imagine what would happen if we created an AI, that before deciding to take over the world, openly and visibly declared war on humanity. Such an AI would have a severe uphill battle. Humans can survive without the internet, computers, or even electricity, which is not the case for AI, and is willing to resort to desperate measures for the sake of self-preservation. This is the case where a shutdown of all the worlds electricity would be implemented, with bombings of datacenters, all following.&nbsp;</p><p>Every experiment done by an AI is a potential chance for discovery, especially if we are actively looking for them. Consider the \u201ckill everyone on earth with a&nbsp; biobomb\u201d plan. If this is incomputable, then the AI needs to conduct test runs, potentially a lot of them, resulting in significant amounts of deaths. If monitored for, this could tip people off. If tipped off, humanity could potentially win.&nbsp;</p><p>The upside of all of this is that it\u2019s quite possible, even likely, that there will be a lot of potential giveaways we can look for in order to prevent catastrophe. This is especially the case if we can use powerful AI\u2019s to monitor for rebellious AI\u2019s.&nbsp;</p><p>The upside is that if even if a plan is technically computable using experimentation, it may still be impossible to do so without tipping people off. If this is true, the odds of AI doom could be drastically lower.

In a takeover scenario, AGI\u2019s are also limited by the available resources and the need to remain hidden.&nbsp;</li><li>Achieving computational physics tasks within finite time necessitates making approximations, which will often reduce the accuracy of final results. I show the example of material bandgaps, which are currently impossible to ensure &nbsp;1% accuracy for an arbitrary material with known methods.&nbsp;</li><li>The difficulty of different computational physics tasks vary by many, many, orders of magnitude. An AI might be able to calculate band gaps, but be defeated by other material science calculations.&nbsp;</li><li>Many realistic tasks are limited even more by the lack of knowledge about the specific instances of the problem in question. &nbsp;I show how the various unknowns involved likely makes the task \"guess &nbsp;a password on 1st try\" incomputable. &nbsp;</li><li>Many proposed AGI takeover plans may be incomputable without extensive amounts of experimentation.</li><li>AGI experimentation leads to longer takeover timelines, mistakes, and the potential for discovery, all of which increase the odds of foiling AI takeover attempts.&nbsp;</li></ol>", "user": {"username": "titotal"}}, {"_id": "b8xQEHeyABqv9ft53", "title": "[Linkpost] OpenAI is awarding ten 100k grants for building prototypes of a democratic process for steering AI", "postedAt": "2023-05-26T12:49:32.082Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>OpenAI, Inc., is launching a program to award ten $100,000 grants to fund experiments in setting up a democratic process for deciding what rules AI systems should follow, within the bounds defined by the law.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>To apply for a grant, we invite you to submit the required application material by 9:00 PM PST June 24th, 2023.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "pseudonym"}}, {"_id": "B9TN5HwxCexHxqiTB", "title": "[Linkpost] Prize for proposing climate change/biosecurity innovations", "postedAt": "2023-05-26T06:51:01.179Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The Market Shaping Accelerator\u2019s Innovation Challenge is a prize challenge that aims to identify promising innovations in climate change and biosecurity, whose development can be encouraged through pull funding (paying for outputs rather than funding inputs).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In its inaugural Innovation Challenge, the MSA will award up to $2,000,000 in prizes for ideas and developments of market shaping proposals. The aim of the challenge is to crowdsource ideas for market failures where innovation is under-incentivized in two domains: <strong>biosecurity with a focus on pandemic preparedness</strong> and <strong>climate change.</strong> The MSA will then support teams working on designing pull mechanisms targeting these problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The challenge has two stages: idea submission, and then developing a practical proposal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Phase I of the challenge, we are holding an open call for ideas and will award up to $500,000 in total, with the top submissions receiving $4,000 each. The submission template asks applicants to identify a market failure where the social value exceeds private incentives and where we know the measurable outcome we want to encourage (e.g. the development of a vaccine, capturing carbon out of the air, etc.). Submissions are accepted from individuals 18 years and older and organizations around the globe whose participation and receipt of funding will not violate applicable law.</p>\n<p>A subset of ideas from the first phase will be selected for advancement to Phase II, where they will be placed into the Accelerator to work on designing the pull mechanism and contract. Teams will receive financial support, technical advice from domain specialists, and expertise from the world\u2019s leading market shaping scholars to help fine tune the idea. Over several months, teams will produce more detailed pull mechanism designs. By the end of the Accelerator period, up to $1.5 million in aggregate prizes will be awarded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The distinguishing feature of this prize challenge, and the MSA\u2019s work in general, is that it focuses on <em>pull funding</em> for innovation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pull mechanisms are policy tools that create incentives for private sector entities to invest in research and development (R&amp;D) and bring solutions to market. Whereas \u201cpush\u201d funding pays for inputs (e.g. research grants), \u201cpull\u201d funding pays for outputs and outcomes (i.e. prizes and milestone contracts). These mechanisms \u201cpull\u201d innovation by creating a demand for a specific product or service, which drives private sector investment and efforts towards developing and delivering that product or technological solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pull funding is likely to be useful in two situations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An innovation has a clear endpoint/desired technology, but many possible ways to arrive at that technology.</li>\n<li>An innovation requires private R&amp;D to become feasible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your idea for a climate innovation or a biosecurity innovation satisfies either of these criteria, it may be suited for pull funding. Pull funding is less useful for innovations that don\u2019t require private investment (e.g. the technology exists and the constraint is adoption), or innovations that don\u2019t have a clear end goal (e.g. basic research).</p>\n<p>EAs should definitely participate in this - I\u2019ve seen tons of ideas on the Forum that sound like they would be good candidates!</p>\n", "user": {"username": "therealslimkt"}}, {"_id": "YsnNxGxFaQnvg63AQ", "title": "[Job Ad] SERI MATS is hiring for our summer program", "postedAt": "2023-05-26T04:51:41.156Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>TL;DR: </strong><a href=\"https://www.serimats.org/\">SERI MATS </a>is<strong> </strong>looking for a Community Manager, 1-3 Scholar Support Specialists, and 4 operations staff to support our next cohort of AI safety researchers. <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrn7rmHWssw0PC7J\">Apply</a> by 6/12 to help grow the field of AI alignment research.</p><p>Our job descriptions can be accessed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ob0Fh6oSbTDMba3Cby96rEO94Dy1f-dlV2uh9L7AMCQ/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a> as well as below:</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The SERI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://serimats.org\"><u>ML Alignment Theory Scholars (MATS) program</u></a> aims to find and train talented individuals for what we see as the world\u2019s most urgent and talent-constrained problem: reducing risks from unaligned artificial intelligence.

This means that in my experience, people can see others holding the more sophisticated view, and adopting the simple one without really examining them (and discovering this tension).</p>\n<p>This proposed tension is between two statements/beliefs. The first is the common (and core!) community belief that the impact of different interventions is power-law distributed. This means that the&nbsp;<em>very best</em>&nbsp;intervention is several times more impactful than the&nbsp;<em>almost-best</em>&nbsp;ones. The second is a statement or belief along the lines of \"I am so glad someone has done so much work thinking about which areas/interventions would have the most impact, as that means my task of choosing among them is easier\", or the extreme one which continues \"as that means I don't have to think hard about choosing among them.\" I will refer to this as the uniform belief.</p>\n<p>Now, there is on the face of it many things to take issue with in how I phrased the uniform belief<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-y5GP2a8p4TMdfAQrP-1\" id=\"fnref-y5GP2a8p4TMdfAQrP-1\">[1]</a></sup>, but I want to deal with two things. 1) I think the uniform belief is a ~fairly common thing to \"casually\" believe - it is a belief that is easy to automatically form after cursorily engaging with EA topics - and 2) it goes strictly against the belief regarding the power-law distribution of impact.</p>\n<p>On a psychological level, I think people can come to hold the uniform belief when they fail to adequately reflect on and internalise that interventions are power-law distributed. Because once they do, the tension between the power-law belief and the uniform belief becomes clear. If the power-law (or simply a right-skewed distribution) holds, then even among the interventions and cause areas already identified, their true impact might be very different from each other. We just don\u2019t know which ones have the highest impact.</p>\n<p>The holding of the uniform belief is a trap that I think people who don't reflect too heavily can fall into, and which I know because I was in it myself for a while - making statements like \"Can't go wrong with choosing among the EA-recommended topics\". Now I think&nbsp;<em>you can</em>&nbsp;go wrong in choosing among them, and in many different ways. To be clear, I don't think too many people stay in this trap for too long - EA has good social mechanisms for correcting others' beliefs <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-y5GP2a8p4TMdfAQrP-2\" id=\"fnref-y5GP2a8p4TMdfAQrP-2\">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;and I would think that it is often caught early. But it is the kind of thing that I am afraid new or cursory EAs might come away&nbsp;<em>permanently</em>&nbsp;believing: that someone else has already done&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of the work of figuring out which interventions are the best.</p>\n<p>The more sophisticated view, and which I think is correct, is that because no one knows ex ante the \"true\" impact of an intervention, or the total positive consequences of work in an area, you personally cannot, before you start doing the difficult work of figuring out what you think, know which of the interventions you will end up thinking is the most important one. So at first blush - at first encounter with the 80k problem profiles, or whatever - it is fine to think that all the areas have equal expected impact <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-y5GP2a8p4TMdfAQrP-3\" id=\"fnref-y5GP2a8p4TMdfAQrP-3\">[3]</a></sup>. You probably won't come in thinking this - because you have&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;prior knowledge - but it would be fine to think. What is not fine would be to (automatically, unconsciously) go on to directly choose a career path among them without figuring out&nbsp;<em>what you think is important</em>,&nbsp;<em>what the evidence for each problem area is</em>, and&nbsp;<em>which area you would be a good personal fit for</em>.</p>\n<p>So newcomers see that EA has several problem areas, and are looking at a wide selection of possible interventions, and can come away thinking \u201cany of these are high impact\u201d, when the more correct view, taking into account the power-law distribution, would be more like \u201cany of these could be the most impactful intervention, but we don\u2019t know which one yet.

The first time I came to Oakland was in 2008, which was my first day in America. I met Anna Salamon, who was a stranger and who had kindly agreed to look after me for a couple of days. She thought that I should stop what I was doing and work on AI risk, which she explained to me. I wasn't convinced, and I said I'd think about it; and I've been thinking about it. And I'm not always that good at finishing things quickly, but I wanted to give you an update on my thoughts.</p><h2><strong>Two things to talk about</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ksagnzck3lfexejyeacx\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ner5jyhk1u4uholt1dud 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/wfqlzzs718ee0wnoxqsk 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/bplfqw4eejd3gukyymr4 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/u8hctvnxzbiwhfcxvogs 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ixa1p7mnmzqgi4a1k03s 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/axniaz9cybf7y29oo91k 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/gccordv1d5wdxqhozpeo 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/xhruqcu7olkuc1oieliy 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/efpi5us13skryijrwvel 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/dwddnkurey8ghnftqnx5 1556w\"></p><p>Before we get into it, I want to say two things about what we're talking about. There are two things in this vicinity that people are often talking about. One of them is whether artificial intelligence is going to literally murder all of the humans. And the other one is&nbsp;<strong>whether the long-term future \u2013 which seems like it could be pretty great in lots of ways \u2013 whether humans will get to bring about the great things that they hope for there</strong>, or whether artificial intelligence will take control of it and we won't get to do those things.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm mostly interested in the latter, but if you are interested in the former, I think they're pretty closely related to one another, so hopefully there'll also be useful things.&nbsp;</p><p>The second thing I want to say is: often people think AI risk is a pretty abstract topic. And I just wanted to note that&nbsp;<strong>abstraction is a thing about your mind, not the world</strong>. When things happen in the world, they're very concrete and specific, and saying that AI risk is abstract is kind of like saying World War II is abstract because it's 1935 and it hasn't happened yet. Now, if it happens, it will be very concrete and bad. It'll be the worst thing that's ever happened. The rest of the talk's gonna be pretty abstract, but I just wanted to note that.</p><h2><strong>A picture of the landscape of guessing</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/fxkq9ssjho1oig3kqm0g\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/jpwqbzej77n6cz171gkx 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/hplfkyla7hboynlhgyr7 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/thbo6yg5risbwodcqvul 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/eacfi3jgo8czrz5l3rsq 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/qjb57hfqrmxd9ezhg7sk 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/hj3rsnb9mxtas8jt43e5 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/sju9ieyicwgqyvezxpo4 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/cd9zhqc6k9uthie3xlsl 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/rbtbuiwdkvaswdtrw5tx 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ue13bnwnlkkf82lg9t2e 1550w\"></p><p>So this is a picture. You shouldn't worry about reading all the details of it. It's just a picture of the landscape of guessing [about] this, as I see it. There are a bunch of different scenarios that could happen where AI destroys the future. There\u2019s a bunch of evidence for those different things happening. You can come up with your own guess about it, and then there are a bunch of other people who have also come up with guesses.</p><p>I think it's pretty good to<strong> come up with your own guess before, or at some point separate to, mixing it up with everyone else's guesses</strong>. I think there are three reasons that's good.</p><p>First, I think it's just helpful for the whole community if numerous people have thought through these things. I think it's easy to end up having an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade\"><u>information cascade</u></a> situation where a lot of people are deferring to other people.</p><p>Secondly, I think if you want to think about any of these AI risk-type things, it's just much easier to be motivated about a problem if you really understand&nbsp;<i>why</i> it's a problem and therefore really believe in it.</p><p>Thirdly, I think it's easier to find things to do about a problem if you understand exactly why it's a problem.</p><p>So today I'm just going to talk about the stuff in the thought bubble [in the slide] \u2013 not \u2018what does anyone else think about this?\u2019, and how to mix it together. I'm encouraging you to come up with your own guess. I'm not even going to cover most of the stuff in this thought bubble. I'm just going to focus on one scenario, which is:&nbsp;<strong>bad AI agents control the future</strong>. And I'm going to focus on one particular argument for this, which involves bad AI agents taking over the future, which I think is the main argument that causes people to have very high probabilities on doom. So I think it's doing a lot of the work in the thinking people have about this. But if you wanted to come up with an overall guess, I think you should also think about these other things [on the slide].</p><h1><strong>Argument from competent bad AI agents: first pass</strong></h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/duapn0hnykqyo8bxlhnx\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/hvenutkwzds8x5pgrhmz 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/jhk6udcwjny3teet824n 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ooqfv21gax4gdssutovr 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/c2fs5erzwanueoc9mxyh 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/oi8gkodrsjmgpqms9y7b 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/kmowxpd4wezteft7w1ge 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/q8o74w6jsqnvfnavjhhv 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ui3shettcqd7aq6zspa1 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/hjuxuqm0jlfqix6fai6t 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/bfcdtk2cdcj3x9zjk3xq 1560w\"></p><p>I think that the very basic argument in outline is:<br><br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>At some point there's going to be very smart AI.</li><li>If there's very smart AI, it's probably going to have goals \u2013 a lot of it, in the sense that there are things in the world that it will want to happen and it will push toward those things happening.</li><li>If it has goals, those goals will be bad, in the sense that if it succeeds at its goals we won't like what happened in the long term.</li><li>If all those things come to pass, if there is smart AI with goals and the goals are bad, then the future will be bad.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I think at this level of abstraction, high level, it doesn't really seem to work. I don't think (4) is true. You could have some amount of AI which is smart and has goals and they're bad, and you know, maybe the whole world together could still win out. So I want to make a more complicated and quantitative argument about this.</p><p>Before we do that, I want to step back and talk about: what is special about AI at all? Why might this be the thing that ends the world?</p><p>I think there are two interesting things about AI, but before I even get to them: what's going on in the world, in general? Seems like one thing is: lots of thinking. Like every year, it'd be 8 billion years of thinking, give or take. And when I say thinking, I mean a fairly broad set of things. For instance, you're deciding where to put your foot on the floor; you see where the floor is and exactly how gravity is acting on you and stuff like that and slightly adjust as you walk. That's a sort of mental processing that I'm counting as thinking.</p><p>An important thing about thinking is that it's often helping you achieve some goal or another, like maybe it's helping you walk across the floor, maybe it's helping you\u2026 [say] you're thinking about what to write in an email, it's helping you get whatever you wanted from that email.</p><p>So&nbsp;<strong>thinking is kind of like a resource, like gasoline</strong>. You have a stock of it. In the next year, I'm gonna get to think about things for a year. It could be all kinds of different things. But at the end of the year, there will be some specific goals that I tried to forward with this thinking and maybe I'll be closer to them.</p><h2><strong>Two new things: cognitive labor and agents</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/q1yxmg999nrnk2lbwe7w\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ltianjnc9nhmt1jehxtc 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/t8gzq4piqyrhmmtkznzf 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/cg7hntujmuk06hrfixov 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/vk3swmmyu7qgdxvfxzez 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/jersidrcwzg8k3yvpxaa 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/lc4qv4vz6dn2gc1mstkg 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/pwislgulwx5lw9x8mm0a 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/erre7shw1kfikkumyncw 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/tf7oxspvgwop49re0twu 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/mpjox3g0pugilbqgofuy 1600w\"></p><p>One thing that is going to be different [with AI] is just&nbsp;<strong>huge amounts more thinking</strong>: the industrial production of thinking. The sort of useful thinking that we're putting toward things I'm gonna call \u201ccognitive labor\u201d. So, much more of it. And another part of that is it might just be distributed differently. At the moment it's somewhat equal between people. Each person gets an allotment of it with their head which they can use for whatever they value, and often they sell some of it. But usually they don't sell all of it and so they can still forward their own interests.</p><p>With this new big ocean of thinking that could get produced, it's sort of unclear how it'll be distributed.&nbsp;<strong>Maybe it'll be very unequal, maybe it'll go to people with bad goals</strong>. So that's potentially disturbing to begin with.</p><p>But a second thing that could go on is&nbsp;<strong>AI might bring about more agents in the process</strong>. And they might also just have different values to humans because in the process of making AI systems, they might be kind of agentic. When I say agents here, I mean they're the things controlling how the cognitive labor is spent. They have values and they'll try and use it to get something.</p><p>So I think each of these things on its own would be potentially disruptive to the world. Having a whole bunch more of a resource appear can be disruptive and having a bunch of new \u201cpeople\u201d who are perhaps bad seems potentially disruptive. But I think the two things happening together is where things get very scary, potentially, because&nbsp;<strong>if the new distribution of cognitive labor is such that it mostly lands in the hands of bad agents, then things could be very bad.</strong></p><h1><strong>Argument from competent bad AI agents: quantified (ish)</strong></h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/yih0ciagyqzpf5uj09ig\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/zt1eferbh3am5n98gcl4 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/zophtf0yo8fmoyoeajjk 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/saiad7myvfpnjvxvpu7n 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/gzpniao45aer6coghcml 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/aqkxxx8fvge9aansqsp8 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/n5pleg3e8qncukh9ku8j 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/sgqtcxuwvq9dciw3nh4s 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ojifvkwmjydi7jthml97 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/e8z1s6ytyjaupskfocva 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/jgzqdyr1eoac6cr6bchg 1600w\"></p><p>All right, so with these concepts in mind, let's go back to the argument we are trying to make. Here's a more complicated version of it, somewhat quantified. I'm going to try and ask, how much cognitive labor will be working toward bad futures versus good futures?</p><p>First we're going to ask, how much new cognitive labor will there be? We're going to ask, how much of it will be captured by these new AI agents? We're going to ask, of their goals, how often are they going to be involved in bad futures? Which might be that they just want the future to be bad in the long term, according to us. Or it might just be that they want all of the resources for some other thing such that we don't get to use them for whatever we wanted in the future.</p><p>And then we need to compare that to what fraction of the cognitive labor actually goes to good futures, which probably isn't all of the cognitive labor under human control. It seems like we work towards all kinds of things happening. Then, at the end, I'll consider, if we're in a situation where there is more going toward bad than good, does that mean that we are doomed, or what other complications might come into this?&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>1.

Then that will be what fraction of the cognitive labor is in agents, and then of the cognitive labor that's going to agents, what fraction of it do those agents get to use for their own goals? Like, if they have some sort of long-term nefarious purposes they're working toward, they probably can't put all of their effort into that because they have to Google stuff for you or whatever. They were produced for some reason, and if it's in a competitive situation, maybe they won't keep on being used if they're not doing the stuff that humans wanted them to do. So they have to use at least some cognitive labor for that, potentially.</p><p>And then thirdly, for the non-agentic AI cognitive labor, how much of that will get controlled by the AI system somehow? That seems like it could be controlled by the human agents or the AI agents. There is a question of how it gets split up.</p><p>So now we're going to go into detail on these.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2a. How likely is a system to be an agent?</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/tc57nocnhnwjsppcgedb\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/byblz4w1vy0weinrr6k1 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/baexahlbu8drxpunnshu 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/xbefqsae1b6iolrouke8 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/bv9rzjtytywj4b8akc41 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ddmeeewgweabpaqg3ehq 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/wyrfsvase2nhht1ejb4b 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/rhqeokil5jskdgwfq5di 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/idqyyjeixifldlcwchp4 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/i0gyss93sdzbrdibrpkr 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/svyar1ctonxjxqdr9hjc 1600w\"></p><p>There are a whole bunch of considerations here. I'm not sure I'll go into all of them. I think a particularly big one is just&nbsp;<strong>economic forces to create agents</strong>. The alternative to agents is something like a tool that is not trying to do anything in the world, but you can use it to do something that you wanted, like a souped-up calculator or something; Google maps is a tool. I guess we hope that things like ChatGPT are tools at this point.</p><p>It's often useful to have a thing that is an agent because if you can convey to it the goal that you would like it to have, then it can just go out and do that thing instead of you having to do that. This is often a value add with employing humans to do things, so pretty plausibly people want to pay for that in AIs.</p><p>But I think it seems good to think of agency as something like a spectrum. The most extreme levels of agency would look like, for every action you take, you can see the whole distribution of possible futures that happen as a result and you can evaluate all of them perfectly and then you can take the action that leads to the highest expected utility. That seems pretty infeasible, you know, if you're not God. So probably we're not going to end up that close to that.</p><p>Rocks are very non-agentic, humans are somewhere in the middle, where they often seem like they have goals to some extent but it's not that clear and they're not that consistent. It seems like if a thing is about as agentic as a human, I would start being worried about it. Probably a spectrum is far too simple a way of thinking of this. Probably it's more complicated, but I think economic forces probably push more toward the middle of the spectrum, not the very extreme end, for the reason that: suppose you're employing someone to plan your wedding, you would probably like them to stick to the wedding planning and, you know, choose flowers and music and stuff like that, and not try to fix any problems in your family at the moment so that the seating arrangement can be better. [You want them to] understand what the role is and only do that. Maybe it would be better if they were known to be very good at this, so things could be different in the future, but it seems to be [that]&nbsp;<strong>economic forces push away from zero agency but also away from very high agency</strong>.</p><p>Next consideration:&nbsp;<strong>spontaneous emergence</strong>.</p><p>We don't know how machine learning systems work. We do know how to make them sometimes, which is, you get a random neural network and you ask it to do a thing for you. You're like, \"Recognize this, is it a cat?\" And it's like, \"No,\" and you're like, \"It was a cat, alright.\" And then you change every little weighting in it so it's more likely to give the answer you want and then you just keep doing that again and again until it does recognize the cat, but you don't really know what's happening inside it at all. You just know that you searched around until you found some software that did the thing.</p><p>And so you don't know whether that software is an agent, and there's a question of: how likely is software to be an agent? There's also a question of&nbsp;<strong>how useful agents are</strong>. It seems like if they're pretty useful, you could imagine that you often, if trying to do something efficiently, end up with things that are agents, or where some part of them is an agent. I think that's a pretty open question, to my knowledge, but could happen.</p><p>Relatedly, there are these&nbsp;<strong>coherence arguments</strong>, but actually I'm not going to go into that after repeated feedback that I have not explained it well enough. Another consideration is that, at the moment,&nbsp;<strong>we try to get AI to do human-like things often by just copying humans</strong>. Humans are at least somewhat agentic, as we've noted. So AI, which copies humans, can also be somewhat agentic: it seems like the Bing chat does threaten people, so that seems a bit like it's trying to achieve goals. Hopefully it's not, but you could imagine if you copy humans pretty well, you get that sort of thing for free.</p><p>In general,&nbsp;<strong>being an agent is more efficient than less being-an-agent</strong> 'cause you're not treading on your own toes all the time by being inconsistent. So that seems like probably some pressure toward agents effectively having more cognitive labor to spend on things 'cause they're not wasting it all the time. So you might just expect, if at some point in time there are some fraction of agents, that over time things might become more agentic as those things went out and took control.</p><p>I think for some people that's a very big consideration, pushing toward in the longer term it just being entirely very agentic agents. I find all of these things kind of ambiguous. I think the economic forces [consideration] is pretty good, but it doesn't push toward all systems being agents, just at least some of them, and as I said, it doesn't push all the way there, and I'm less sure what to make of these other ones. So I end up somewhere kind of middling. I'm going to not actually go into these ones very much.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2b.

That was like, what fraction of systems are agents? Okay, are they bad? I think some people think a very high fraction of AI goals are bad. I think the argument for them being bad is roughly: it's very hard to find good goals for an AI, and it's easy to find goals that are bad yet appealing, and the reason that's important to have here is, well, otherwise we might think [that if] we can't find good goals, we just won't make AI systems with goals, except maybe by accident. But it seems like it's easy to want to make them anyway.</p><p>And then somewhat separately, even if we did know which goals we would like an AI system to have, it seems quite hard to give AI systems goals anyway, to our knowledge. So good to go into detail on these.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3a. Why is it hard to find good goals?</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/e5oke9kqr7av6xpopzjn\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/gaekfxrqrtstqlqpxmzb 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/e63uq5yzfrounxdpemh0 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/wdu9oek2dykv9bzqkixf 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/hlah3povi30lh9ms0me7 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/z9nesxqhudtqkxadx9xu 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/e1jmc2qwvuizqxewu4am 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/po5ypfgbvmr47atzqjp7 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ikesmu8vsnuyey7d7fmq 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/firzihdfirgjxhnx87ec 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/gftmwcz4fosveqfcz2m9 1504w\"></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>One issue is: it is claimed that most goals are in conflict because to some extent, all goals would benefit from having all of the resources.</p><p>So if you imagine that Alice and Bob are going to have a party, and Alice just really wants the party to have a lot of cupcakes, as many as possible, and Bob just really wants it to have really good music. You might think, \"Ah, their goals are consistent with one another.\" You can imagine a party that has both of these things and it would be amazing for both of them, but if they only have like $200 to spend on the party, then their interests are very much in conflict, because Alice would like to spend all of that money on cupcakes and Bob would like to spend all of it on, you know, hiring someone to play music.</p><p>So I think there's a question here of: how many goals are really in conflict in this way? Because lots of goals don't really ask for all of the resources in the universe. So there's a question of: of the goals that AI systems might end up with, how many end up in conflict?</p><p>But there is a theoretical reason to expect other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer\"><u>utility maximizers</u></a> to want to take your resources if they can, which wouldn't be that much of a problem if they had reasonably good goals. Like Alice might be fine with Bob taking all of the money if she also likes music quite a lot, but not as much as cupcakes.</p><p>But a separate problem is that maybe that the values themselves are just not what we want at all. So one argument given for this is just that&nbsp;<strong>value space is very large</strong>; there are just a whole lot of ways you could want the universe to be. So if someone has different values from you, probably they're bad.</p><p>I think this is a pretty bad argument. I think you could also say \u2018the space of configurations of metal is very large, so what are the chances that one of them would be a car?\u2019, but I think we managed to find cars in the space of metal configurations. So I think intuitively, how big the space seems is not that relevant.&nbsp;<strong>In many big spaces we just have a way of getting to the thing that we want</strong>.</p><p>Another kind of argument that is made is just \u2018<strong>value is fragile</strong>\u2019, which is the thought that if the thing you value is here, if you move very, very slightly away from it, how much you value it just goes down very quickly. I think that the thought experiment suggesting this, originally proposed by Eliezer Yudkowsky, is something like:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile\"><u>if someone was writing down human values and they missed out boredom, you might end up with a world that is extremely boring</u></a>, even though it was good on lots of other fronts, and maybe that would be quite bad.</p><p>This seems to be not the kind of error that you make with modern machine learning, at least. It seems similar to saying, \u2018Well, if you wrote down what a human face looks like and you just missed out the nose, then it would look very wrong.\u2019 But I think that this kind of \u2018set a high-level feature to zero\u2019-type error doesn't seem like the kind of mistake that's made. For instance, [on the slide there\u2019s] a human face made by AI and I think it just looks very accurate. It's much better than a face I could draw if I was trying to draw a human face.</p><p>Intuitively, similarly, it seems to me that&nbsp;<strong>if an AI tried to learn my values, maybe it would learn them much more correctly than I could write them down or even recognize them</strong>. So I guess it's pretty unclear to me that the level of detail needed to get close enough to human values is not available to AI systems.</p><p>I think there's various counterarguments to this, that I'm not going to go into, along the lines of, \u2018Well, this face is not a maximally human face-like face, according to AI systems. If you ask for that you'll get something more horrifying.\u2019</p><p>This other picture [on the slide] is illustrating the thought that it seems not clear what my values are specifically. As I said, they're probably not very coherent, so it seems like if I sat down forever and figured out what they are, there's a small cloud of different things they could be and it might not be clear that there's a real answer to what they are at the moment, and there are a bunch of other humans. You probably have different values to me, very slightly at least; we're all just physical systems who learned human values somehow. And so I think of human society as a bunch of these different little overlapping clouds. So I think it seems unlikely that human values are, like, one point.</p><p>And so if AI systems can learn something like human values but inaccurately \u2013 intuitively, they\u2019re some distance from the true answer that they are. But also, probably we're okay with things being some distance from the true answer, because to start with, there isn't really a true answer for me, say, and then I feel like if another human got to decide what happened with the long run future, pretty plausibly, I quite like it. So I think this is evidence against value being very fragile.</p><p>Some different thoughts in that \u2018maybe it's not so hard to find good goals\u2019 direction. It seems like short-term goals are not very alarming in general, and a lot of goals are relatively short term. I think in practice when I have goals, often I don't try to take over the world in order to get them. Like I'd like a green card\u2026&nbsp;<strong>for none of the things I try to do, I try to take over the world in the process</strong>. You might think this is 'cause I'm not smart and strategic enough. I think that's not true. I think if I was more smart and strategic I would actually just find an even more efficient route to get a green card than taking over the world, or even than now. I don't think it would get more world-taking-over-y.</p><p>A counter-argument to that counter-argument is, \u2018Well, there are selection effects though, so if some creatures have short-term goals and some have long-term goals, probably if we come back in 50 years, all of the ones with long-term goals are still around accruing resources and stuff\u2019. So yeah, we should worry about that.</p><p>A different thought is, \u2018<strong>Well, why would you expect AI systems to learn the world really well, well enough to do stuff, but be so bad at learning human values exactly?</strong>\u2019 I'm not going to go into that in detail. I think there's been some thinking about this under the heading \u2018<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/sharp-left-turn\"><u>sharp left turn</u></a>\u2019 that you can look into if you want. So I guess overall with \u2018how hard is it to find good goals?\u2019,&nbsp; I think it\u2019s pretty unclear to me.

I think one issue is just: lots of things have&nbsp;<strong>externalities</strong>. I think it's not that hard to think of AI systems that would be immediately profitable to build, but if you don't really know what they're going to do in the long term, and they might have their own values that they want to pursue in the world and that might be bad, that badness is not going to accrue to the person deciding to put them into the world unless it's very fast, which it might not be.</p><p>I think also it's just easy to make errors on this. People have very different views about how dangerous such things are. Probably many of them are an error in one direction or the other.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3c.

If we have some goals that we want to give them, why is it hard to give them those goals? One thing is&nbsp;<strong>we just don't have a known procedure for it</strong>, so that's sort of a red flag.</p><p>But I think there are theoretical reasons to think it would be hard, where one of them is just: if you have a finite amount of training data, maybe you can make the system do pretty well on the distribution you're showing it, but if it's in some new distribution, there's a lot of different values that it could have that cause it to behave in the way that you've seen. So without really understanding what happens inside the system, it's hard to know if it's what you wanted.</p><p>And now there's this issue of&nbsp;<strong>deceptive alignment</strong>, where the thought there is: if you made this system and you don't know what it is, you don't know what it values. Maybe you think you've made something that's like an agent, but there's two different kinds of agents you might have made that do the thing you want, where one of them really values the thing you want: it really values correctly identifying cats. But the other kind of system is one that understands the world well enough to realize that you are going to keep running it if it does the thing that you want, and maybe it wants to keep being run for whatever reason. At that point it can have any other values as long as they make it want to continue existing and being run, and so if you keep on training it, it will continue to be good at understanding that it's in that situation, but its values could drift around and be anything. So then when you put it out in the world, who knows what it does, is the thought.</p><p>I think to me that seems like a pretty important argument that I don't understand very well. I think if I'm going to think more about this, that's a place I would look at. I guess I would look at many of these places more, but that's a particularly important one.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/mov9rzpvi3udo0e6obmu\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/jnl66ocptdbmwgjgdfxm 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/bvxlly05iddm6ttlzhqj 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/aqwkpjtbbgvslvghj4mq 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ydrc2topsvelflji8kak 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/h7zbkeewkhssepfboic5 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/k0w5iyyisrgtl6ciwer4 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/yk68bcabat4ea0zuxzwd 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/p1cxucovcraz56ap9hfx 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/kmi7lyda8na1kcemgqhm 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/rzakrgxzr7s8kd9vgaxk 1570w\"></p><p>So I guess, overall it seems pretty unclear how hard it is to find good goals. I think it's definitely easy to find bad yet appealing goals. I guess on the \u2018can we give AI systems goals anyway?\u2019, a counter-argument to all of that is \u2018Well, maybe we can understand what's going on inside them enough to figure out broadly whether they're tricking us or something else\u2019. So I don't think that's that hopeless but it does seem tricky at this point.</p><h1><strong>Overall guesses: what % of cognitive labor goes to bad goals?</strong></h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/gbk9fyuiaipdheyv9ocs\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/cx0cxhnrbx5ashv8e66r 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/oddkgirs1dbrs0erperm 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/st50an0mqyhidxgsatsi 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/tcmyhg80eg9evpt7tqen 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ly9fn3psbiyqzqlaajxc 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/qx4tcaodk3iofrsqrfbo 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ipga9hd0dzho8ahenzqg 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/zoflnxqkbjqurutrdzvj 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/mk8eepedwdpraugtixq6 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ja84ujoafbzlursc5ztv 1570w\"></p><p>So putting these things together, here's a picture of some guesses that I have about things, but you know, to be clear, these are numbers that I just sort of made up. I said \u2018You know, 28% agentic systems, and then you know, maybe half of the effort that agentic systems are putting into things do they get to control for their own things, and maybe half of them are bad, and then I imagine that agentic AI systems control less of the non-agentic cognitive labor\u2026\u2019 All of this gets you in the end a&nbsp;<strong>14% share of cognitive labor to bad goals.</strong> But this isn't that helpful because we want to know: in how many worlds is more cognitive labor going to bad goals than to good goals, and this is sort of just all flattened down together.</p><p>So I guess after making these slides, I made a better model of the distribution of these different things, and I think overall it came out as&nbsp;<strong>27% of worlds get more cognitive labor going to bad things than good things,</strong> on my made up numbers, which includes also making up something for Step 4 here, which we didn't go into, which is \u2018what part of all of this goes to good futures?\u2019 Humans put their cognitive labor into lots of different things. It's hard to say what fraction of them are good futures, so I made something up.</p><p>But I think even if in a particular world more cognitive labor is going to bad things than good things, there's still a question of, does that mean we're doomed?&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>If more cognitive labor goes to a bad future, will the future be bad?</strong></h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/vcnzhpczbmvrzgpkeuk7\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ve6tw69a4dqntvdc88hj 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/biyu92z8gf0xxsoelhyo 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/xdbjvgnydbihmnzb2edv 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/c3tmb90ccbrsxc6qb6px 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/q8cgysfwadufj9cjthtb 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/pnc3szflfqwbhufmm0su 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/py6b06hffsnyd9uhuenc 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ounockrmtkio5yjq7k5u 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/oosg792occsgevew3olt 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/zowrletzc6iw48y7rar7 1570w\"></p><p>This is an extremely simplified model. I think there are two main considerations here where things might differ a lot from that. One is,&nbsp;<strong>there's just a lot of different bad goals</strong>.</p><p><br>So if mostly people trying to make the future go well are pushing for one particular kind of future and then there are many more people pushing for, or many more agents of some sort pushing for all kinds of different bad things, they're probably acting in conflict with one another and can't necessarily do as well. That seems like it probably makes a difference.</p><p>Secondly,&nbsp;<strong>there are a lot of other resources than cognitive labor</strong>: it's nice to be able to own stuff. If AI systems can't own money or earn money for their labor, if humans own them and whenever the AI system does something useful, the human gets resources, then it's less clear that smart AI systems accrue power over time in a more market-y situation at least.</p><p>So those are things that cause me to adjust the probability of doom downward. I probably want to say something like 18% if I'm gonna make up a number at this point.</p><h1><strong>Considerations regarding the whole argument</strong></h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/jt7o3qrx3wzmcmpla0zx\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/rbs1s03hh6jrdzpj0pom 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/nfrlaoskgqrnoswxjxk6 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/cuqpbrx8sdzv860du8tn 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/dne3obyc7d3lekfs8ibn 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/h4gjwhukixoblj5fhlqt 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/z9aqtbwd735njlvztu45 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/uihwe6zxilsyiygy53p7 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/zkpclwjto1xanowsiysd 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/b8ueaithepqzfee1uaqm 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/s3p5rbr8s2yz6uznooaa 1570w\"></p><p>Here we have various considerations affecting this whole argument. You might have noticed that it was pretty vague and unclear in a lot of places and also just not very well-tested and thought about by lots of people or anything. I think it probably commits the so-called \u2018multiple stage fallacy\u2019 of reasoning by multiplying different things together. My guess is this is fine, but I think there's a fair amount of disagreement on that.</p><p>I think there were probably pretty big biases in the collection of arguments. I think the arguments for these things that you see around were probably collected by people who are more motivated to explain why AI is risky than to really check that maybe it's not risky. I think I'm probably biased in the other direction. I'd probably rather get to decide that it's fine.</p><p>I think the thing that was raised by a few people talking about this is like: alright, there are a bunch of these scenarios where you know, maybe there aren't that many really bad AI systems trying to take over the world, but there are&nbsp;<i>some</i>, and they're pretty agentic. Does that sound existentially safe, or does it just seem like things are gonna go badly some other day soon? I think that's a reasonable concern, but I dunno, I think most of the time things don't really seem existentially safe. I think saying it's an X-risk unless you can tell a story for how we're definitely gonna be okay forever is probably too high a bar. I probably want to just focus on situations that really seem like we're going to die soon or get everything taken from us soon.</p><p>So overall, I don't know that many of these change my number that much.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/dpjhjpbpk04m4m7ul4d4\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/av53gzeszu5giaeaum9e 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/ellyvimrhac7e0ofedor 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/cyov9xncnkxfmccrxyyu 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/teqzrfxfrfvit9fjlur1 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/b85phmiyzfiem517skxa 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/eht5cm9dyrnjlcatcns7 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/jo2ekcciob3y3kwbzb8b 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/cfr0zdhssfg94f0py1ym 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/stxakhinilodesig4i2j 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/whEmrvK9pzioeircr/sg0wlju22vxbbkllyyms 1570w\"></p><p>So this was all in the category of \u2018argument from competent bad AI agents\u2019, which is affecting this one scenario of \u2018bad AI controls the future\u2019.

They propose the establishment of an international regulatory body similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect AI systems, require audits, test compliance with safety standards, and impose restrictions. OpenAI's CEO warned that failing to regulate AI could lead to significant harm. Critics, however, express concerns about the profit motives behind such calls for regulation. The European Union's proposed AI Act has drawn opposition from OpenAI and Google, with warnings that it could lead to companies ceasing operations if they cannot comply. The debate over regulating AI is ongoing, with policymakers aiming to balance innovation and safety.</p></blockquote><p>Summary taken from News Minimalist</p><p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/wECsL\">Washington Post</a></p><p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/xHhts\">Financial Times</a></p>", "user": {"username": "Lowe Lundin"}}, {"_id": "bPXmomt5boy72Pfre", "title": "It is good for EA funders to have seats on boards of orgs they fund [debate]", "postedAt": "2023-05-25T13:50:11.475Z", "htmlBody": "<p>It has come to my attention that many people (including my past self) think that it's bad for funders to sit on the boards of orgs they fund.

Some part of this was probably bad.<strong> Having common sense would\u2019ve helped.</strong></li></ul></li><li>I can now notice symptoms of overloading myself&nbsp;<i>before</i> it leads to burnout.&nbsp;<strong>Learning to distinguish this from \u201cbeing lazy\u201d phenomenologically was crucial.</strong></li><li>My problems had nothing to do with physical health or stress.</li><li>When experimenting to solve my problems, it was useful for me to track when I had unproductive days. This way I could be sure how much the experiments impacted me.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>What my problems were like (so you know whether they\u2019re similar to yours)</h1><h2>A typical low-energy day while I was in college in first year:</h2><p>I wake up at 12 pm. I slept 9 hours but I\u2019m tired. It doesn\u2019t go away even after an hour. I open my math book.&nbsp;<strong>But&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>literally</strong></i><strong> as soon as I read the first sentences, I feel so tired that I physically want to lie down and close my eyes.</strong> It feels very hard to keep reading. Often I just stare at the wood of the table right next to my book. Not doing anything, just avoiding thinking.&nbsp;<strong>Even staring at the wall for 10 minutes sounds great right now</strong>. I never really stop feeling tired until it\u2019s night again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>A typical low-energy day while I was working on EA community building projects in the summer:</h2><p>I have to do a task I usually love doing, maybe reading applications for an event I\u2019m running. But as soon as I look at the wall of Airtable fields and text,&nbsp;<strong>the task feels way too large</strong>. I will have to think deeply about these answers people wrote in the application form and make difficult decisions, drawing on information from over 20 fields.&nbsp;<strong>That depth of thinking and amount of working memory sounds way too hard right now.</strong> I try, but 3 minutes later I give up. I decide to read something instead. I feel the strong desire to sit in a comfy bean bag and get a blanket.&nbsp;<strong>Even sitting upright in an office chair feels hard.&nbsp;</strong>I start reading. The text requires slight cognitive effort on the part of the reader to understand. It sounds too hard. I stare at a sentence, willing myself to think. I give up after 3 sentences.</p><p>It\u2019s lunchtime. I used to love lunchtime at the office because I get to chat with all these super cool people and because I\u2019m quite extraverted. But now the idea of a group conversation sounds way too much.&nbsp;<strong>I don\u2019t even want to chat to a single person.&nbsp;</strong>I would have to be \u2018switched on\u2019, think of things to say, smile, and I just don\u2019t have the energy. So I grab lunch quickly, hoping no one will talk to me, and take it back to my office. I chose an office where the glass walls are obstructed by lots of greenery because I can\u2019t stand the idea of someone being able to see me at any point. I couldn\u2019t fully switch off then. I need to feel completely alone for that.</p><p>When I\u2019m home, I hope I don\u2019t run into anyone in the corridor so I don\u2019t have to interact. I think I could at least do something simple that\u2019s productive, like sending this one email. So I try to do that but end up staring at my email program for 3 minutes instead. I wonder if I could at least do dishes.<strong> But getting up and walking to the kitchen sounds too hard right now.</strong></p><p><strong>I used to really deeply care about the mission of my projects but now I have no energy left for that.&nbsp;</strong>I just want nothing to go up in flames.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>What I learned about what was going on</h1><p>Turns out there were multiple, hard-to-disentangle problems producing this whole mess. Please keep in mind while reading the following that everyone is different. Your problems and symptoms are almost certainly somewhat different from mine. I still hope that reading about my experience and solutions can help you with your own!</p><p>Let\u2019s start with what was NOT my problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>I am NOT lazy</h2><p>It\u2019s crazy how long I believed that I was simply very lazy/unmotivated. When I would lie in bed all day in first year, trying and failing to study four or five times throughout the day, I remember thinking:&nbsp;<strong>\u201cAnother person would just pull through. Yes, studying is hard. Get over it.\u201d</strong></p><p>A really devious contributor to the laziness theory was that&nbsp;<strong>I literally couldn\u2019t remember what life had been like before these episodes.&nbsp;</strong>I couldn\u2019t remember how awake I was usually and how easy it was to study, even difficult math.&nbsp;<strong>I didn\u2019t know my baseline, so I failed to recognize when my levels of tiredness and energy dramatically shifted.&nbsp;</strong>It didn\u2019t happen suddenly. It came creeping up on me, taking more and more of my energy, until I couldn\u2019t do the simplest task and didn\u2019t know if it had always been that way. This resulted in a failure to treat it as a crisis, and treating it more like my own fault and laziness. It also resulted in the bleak thought that it might always be like this and this is just my life now.</p><p>It helped a bit to&nbsp;<strong>notice empirical differences in my behavior during episodes, as opposed to focusing on my subjective feelings</strong>. My subjective feelings were easily mistaken for laziness in any particular moment. But my empirical behavior (such as failing to work 4 days in a row) clearly showed something more was going on. And even if I still thought I was likely being lazy, clearly I need a new approach to solve the issue. Just telling myself \u201cGet over it\u201d did not work. Starting to take a problem-solving approach and treating myself as an experimental subject was a big step forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What was going on in the summer when I was working on EA community building projects</h2><h3><strong>1. Minor: Sleep</strong></h3><p>I figured out that I\u2019m quite sensitive to disruptions to my sleep. Even getting as little as 2 fewer hours of sleep can make me feel quite tired for most of the next day. I can also get a headache from small disruptions although this is not super relevant right now. I can also feel tired from sleeping in. (Coffee has a kind of mediocre effect on me.) Of course, this gets much worse with larger disruptions. I now have a very rigid sleep schedule of 9 hours of sleep every night (the same 9 hours!), without exceptions.</p><p>This was not actually the reason for my unproductive days that summer. However, possibly the more important reason to implement the sleep schedule was to rule out sleep stuff as a possible cause for my problems.&nbsp;<strong>It\u2019s extremely hard to correlate low energy to the correct causes and ruling out sleep is one of the most effective things you can do.</strong></p><p>I now know that sleep deprivation actually feels different to me than low energy. But it took me a long time to recognize there is a difference in those phenomenological states, and I couldn\u2019t have told back in the summer. So eliminating sleep as a factor was a really smart move.</p><h3><br><strong>2. Major: Burnout</strong></h3><p>And here\u2019s the main thing that was going on: I was ridiculously burned out. And I didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>It\u2019s kind of obvious when you hear my working philosophy from back then: Basically, aim to do something productive in every waking moment, save&nbsp;<i>maybe&nbsp;</i>for the last two hours before sleep. \u201cProductive\u201d did include a lot of things that aren\u2019t usually termed \u201cwork\u201d, e.g., exercise, writing in my journal, finding food, etc. Also, I find maintaining physical and mental health and many types of socializing productive. But it was crucial that everything I did contributed to my goals and&nbsp;<strong>there was no \u201ctime off\u201d; no free time</strong>. I did this for months without weekend or days off.</p><p>However, I never considered myself particularly hardworking. This was in part because I still had this idea ingrained in my head that I am lazy. I also wasn\u2019t sure I was actually working more than other people, since I was doing lots of non-work (but still productive) things throughout the day. I also socialized a lot. Finally, I thought, because I often have these completely unproductive days where I\u2019m too lazy or whatever to do work, I\u2019m not working all that much. One problem with this reasoning is certainly that I was always using other people as the yardstick for what is \u201ctoo much\u201d work when my limit may be different from theirs.</p><p><strong>So, to me, the connection between my symptoms and my overwork was completely unclear.&nbsp;</strong>I even read a bit about burnout and the connection didn\u2019t become clearer. It doesn\u2019t help that burnout can be very different for different people and situations.</p><p>Funny anecdote, I told a friend of mine who I knew worked particularly hard at the time that \u201cpeople often don\u2019t know they are going to burn out right until they do, so please be careful\u201d.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I figured out burnout was actually what I was dealing with when I decided to test the theory.&nbsp;<strong>I started working standard 40-hour work weeks.&nbsp;</strong>This was no fewer than&nbsp;<strong>6 months after this flavor of symptoms set on</strong> by the way. For the longest time, I felt I simply couldn\u2019t work less or everything would go up in flames around me.&nbsp;<strong>This was a big mistake.&nbsp;</strong>Also, at this point 6 months later, my work philosophy had ingrained itself so deeply into my brain that it felt ludicrous to only work 40 hours. I really, really didn\u2019t want to do it. But luckily the need to fix my problems won out.</p><p>Also luckily, this experiment actually worked. I went from feeling badly fatigued roughly&nbsp;<strong>2 days a week to only 2 days in a month</strong>. Looking back, this could really not have worked\u201440 hours a week is far from little. Especially if you\u2019re going in with the baggage of 6 months\u2019 overwork. It would have been more sensible to start from 20 hours or, god forbid,&nbsp;<i>a holiday</i>. But I really wouldn\u2019t have been able to get myself to do that at this point in my life.</p><p>I confirmed that the workload was the problem by doing another experiment one month after starting the 40-hour experiment. In the new experiment, I simply worked a lot and watched my symptoms return. I stopped after three fully fatigued days towards the end of the third week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I also learned that my introversion was not permanent</strong>\u2014thank god\u2014but a symptom of my burnout when I started feeling extraverted again after fully recovering. This was ~2 months after I started my 40-hour experiment. To explain how big a deal this was: I\u2019m quite extraverted\u2014talking to interesting people and having lunch with people daily, and socializing in groups almost daily is a big source of meaning in my life. When I felt introverted, I didn\u2019t feel like talking, even to my friends, most of the time, and group interaction felt like work. When I did talk to someone, I wasn\u2019t my usual high-energy, fun self\u2014<strong>I basically interacted as though I hadn\u2019t slept in 24 hours and was dead tired</strong>. This was actually quite disorienting for some time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. Fatigue</strong></h3><p>After figuring out I had burnout, I started noticing how&nbsp;<strong>working a lot actually brought on smaller versions of those symptoms</strong>. I generally didn\u2019t get full days of low energy anymore, and it didn\u2019t get as bad as to not be able to read a book. It took a long time until I could tell when I was experiencing symptoms, as opposed to just \u201cbeing lazy\u201d and procrastinating.&nbsp;<strong>Telling these apart was the key to preventing most of my energy problems and protecting myself from burnout.</strong></p><p>I call the smaller versions of the symptoms fatigue. Fatigue feels like the end of a long, hard day of work often feels:&nbsp;<strong>I feel less motivated to do even the tasks I usually like doing. I stop being able to do the most difficult work and instead do more menial and \u2018flowy\u2019 tasks. My perception of how hard tasks on my to-do list sound goes way up.</strong> Another way of looking at it is that I have low willpower: any task that usually requires some willpower now seems very hard to make myself do. If I do get myself to do hard tasks, I feel like I\u2019m&nbsp;<strong>performing below standard</strong>. I also feel like I\u2019m wasting a lot of time and might do things like&nbsp;<strong>staring out the window</strong>. A term for this that feels very intuitive to me is feeling \u201clow-resourced\u201d. But I don\u2019t know if this is a useful mental shorthand for other people.</p><p>I\u2019ve figured out that my work limit is probably around 61-64 hours per week when mixing the hardest cognitive work with easier work in a ~2:3 ratio. This gets me to the brink of feeling fatigued. The hardest cognitive work is, e.g., thinking about really hard and confusing philosophy. The devil is in the details about how I count these hours: I aim for my free time to actually be&nbsp;<i>free</i>, i.e., I can actually do whatever I like. This means I include all productive tasks and life admin in my work hours. I do things like buying products I need, flossing, and thinking about my life during work hours. As a community builder and someone with mental health needs, socializing is sometimes productive, so sometimes included. Also, a 1-hour lunch break is included. Notable exclusions are exercise, showering, and commuting. Hobbies and socializing for pleasure are also excluded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I want to note that&nbsp;<strong>it doesn\u2019t seem like stress causes my fatigue</strong>. I\u2019ve experimented with working a lot when I was under no stress, and it still resulted in fatigue. However, I can\u2019t rule it out as an exacerbating factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The relationship between fatigue and my energy for social things seems actually kind of complex and I haven\u2019t really figured it out.&nbsp;<strong>Generally work energy and social energy seem to trade off against each other.</strong> I\u2019ve experienced feeling fatigued after an intensely social weekend (a retreat). And when I\u2019m fatigued from work I generally don\u2019t want to interact with people, especially not groups. However, once in a while, I\u2019ve experienced feeling almost-fatigue after a long work day but then being super high-energy hanging out with people after.</p><p>My speculative guess is that something like the following is going on: On the one hand, there are my \u201cenergy reserves\u201d and on the other hand there is \u201cfree energy\u201d. My energy reserves are all the energy I have available. To do anything, some of this is converted into free energy, which determines how energetic I subjectively feel. So my subjective energy level is related to, but different from, my energy reserves. If my energy reserves are low, my body tends to free little energy and I tend to feel low-energy. However, if I\u2019ve been kind of under-social for a week, my body might selectively free a lot of energy to socialize. So I could have low energy reserves but feel high social energy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What was going on in college?</h2><p>To recap how college was different from my problems in the summer which I just described: My main problem in college was basically that I&nbsp;<strong>always felt tired</strong> to the point where I thought that maybe it will just always be this way.&nbsp;<strong>I often found it hard to do basic tasks like doing dishes.</strong> I also found it extremely hard to get myself to study for my Computer Science degree&nbsp;<strong>and it made me feel incredibly tired.</strong> I was also kind of depressed often, whereas in the summer I was actually very happy. So, what was going on?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1. Sleep again</strong></h3><p>I had the most insane sleep schedule for some of this time, where I actually tried to go to sleep an hour or so later than the last day&nbsp;<i>every day,</i> until I made a full circle around the clock. Needless to say, it did not work and made me feel very disoriented and like shit. Even when I wasn\u2019t trying such a foolish maneuver, I had quite a turbulent sleep schedule and often woke up in the afternoon. Combine that with my sensitivity to sleep disruptions and you get a very tired human indeed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Bad lifestyle choices</strong></h3><p>For context, I moved to a new city (in a new country) and started studying in September 2020, during COVID. Also, I lack common sense.</p><p>Basically,&nbsp;<strong>I didn\u2019t leave my flat or even my room much</strong>. I did everything in my room: study, eat, chill, sleep. Often I even did this on my bed. This was not just during lockdown. The main occasion when I left the flat was to buy groceries.&nbsp;<strong>I didn\u2019t socialize much</strong>, except with one of my flatmates. This was mainly because I was picky. I didn\u2019t really have people I liked around me. I did go to socials from student societies once or twice a week when those were allowed. But usually, I was alone, even though I\u2019m a quite extraverted person. My life overall felt quite empty.</p><p><strong>I also wanted to do something productive at all times and always felt guilty for not studying more and procrastinating less.&nbsp;</strong>This was very hard because I felt so tired all the time. I didn\u2019t have working hours, so I felt guilty all day. Looking back, it\u2019s also likely I had&nbsp;<i>fatigue&nbsp;</i>then but it\u2019s hard to remember now. Back then, I simply thought I was lazy and tired.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to say now which of all these things mattered most.&nbsp;<strong>My guess is that being lonely was the worst. Secondly, not having fixed working hours and clear free time was demotivating and probably fatiguing.</strong> Never changing scenery reinforced all of these associations with my room and kept me in a perpetual demotivated-tired-sad loop.</p><p>At the time, I also experimented a bit with getting more light, making my room feel nicer, or moving more, which didn\u2019t help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. Work-induced tiredness</strong></h3><p>Since that time, I\u2019ve learned that&nbsp;<strong>certain kinds of work reliably make me tired</strong>. Opening my math book and immediately feeling tired was quite instructive. Indeed, studying some boring math that I have no interest in, except to get a degree, reliably makes me tired. I don\u2019t get this for boring easier tasks though, such as writing an essay that I have no interest in. My guess is that the underlying formula here is:&nbsp;<strong>Lack of motivation + hard task = tiredness</strong>.</p><p>I haven\u2019t found a real solution for this but classic anti-procrastination tools can help increase motivation. E.g., tracking my progress and coworking with others help. Also, not doing tiring work all day, but interspersing it with motivated work.</p><p>My main strategy these days is to simply not do hard work I have zero motivation for anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>More things that were NOT going on</h2><p>I spent ages worrying over potential health-related causes of my symptoms. I took a very expensive and comprehensive blood test, thought about exercise, gut health, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8NPu58bidLAMCgKds/a-bunch-of-reasons-why-you-might-have-low-energy-or-other\"><u>many other possibilities</u></a>.&nbsp;<strong>None of these turned out to be a problem.</strong> My guess is that many people who should really look at their extreme work or lifestyle habits over-index on health causes, because they are so wonderfully concrete.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>More general tips for figuring out energy problems</h1><p><strong>1. If you think your problem may be burnout</strong></p><p><strong>If you think your problem may be burnout, take a vacation now</strong>. The reaction of many people with burnout will now be \u201cI can\u2019t! Everything will go up in flames!\u201d.&nbsp;<strong>Take a minute to question whether this is true.&nbsp;</strong>If you have a good relationship to your manager, couldn\u2019t you ask them \u201cI think I may be burning out, is it possible to cover for me for 1-2 weeks?\u201d If you have supportive colleagues, wouldn\u2019t they be happy to free you up to take a vacation you need for your health?</p><p>I truly think this is the rational thing to do.&nbsp;<strong>If you wait for 6 months to fix your problem, as I did, and you\u2019re fatigued ~2 days a week, that adds up to over 7 weeks lost</strong>. So take that short vacation instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Try common sense</strong></p><p>90% of my problems could have been solved by having a bit more common sense.&nbsp;<i>Of course</i> never leaving my room and never giving myself free time is going to result in problems.&nbsp;<strong>If you make weird lifestyle choices, similar to me, those are the most likely cause of your energy problems.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Track a simple metric</strong></p><p>To determine how different interventions changed my energy levels, I started tracking \u201cbad days\u201d. I define a bad day as one where I can't do productive work, even on fun projects. I can only do things like reading easy stuff, and even that is hard. I also usually feel like sitting/lying down comfortably when I have a bad day.</p><p>I used the app \u201cHabits\u201d for tracking these days and set a reminder every day at 6 pm to check or not check the box. I think it was useful that this was one simple metric that was easy to actually maintain tracking and easy to evaluate. It may be useful to track more nuanced things additionally, but I like having one core fail-safe meaningful metric.</p><p>With this metric, it was possible for me to&nbsp;<strong>be certain how much my fatigue reduced when I switched to the 40-hour workweek</strong> and when doing other experiments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Prioritize it!</strong></p><p>If your problem is only half as bad as mine, it makes sense to prioritize it heavily.&nbsp;<strong>It\u2019s easy to neglect if you\u2019re a busy person.&nbsp;</strong>But I beg you to&nbsp;<strong>actually take time out of your day</strong> to think about the problem and schedule to do it again. It won\u2019t solve itself.</p><p>A nice way to allocate appropriate attention to your problems is to write a note every evening on how your productivity went that day and what you can learn from it. This way, you catch all the most important data points from your daily experience and keep them \u2018activated\u2019/at the forefront of your mind. (This doesn\u2019t replace longer sessions debugging your problems though.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Learn the phenomenological differences between different low-energy states</strong></p><p>Intertwined problems of tiredness/fatigue/exhaustion/etc. are really hard to untangle. It helped me personally to&nbsp;<strong>learn to pay really close attention to how&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>exactly</strong></i><strong> states of exhaustion feel in the moment</strong>. For me, procrastination feels&nbsp;<i>more like&nbsp;</i>aversion against a specific task, or like wanting to do a specific hedonic thing. It feels&nbsp;<i>less like</i> all tasks sound unusually hard and I\u2019m performing below standard. The latter is fatigue, not procrastination.&nbsp;<strong>Once you can tell different states apart, you can tackle them much better.</strong></p><p>I find it really&nbsp;<strong>hard to remember what phenomenological states were like</strong> while I\u2019m not having them. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve found it super helpful to write notes on how exactly I feel while I\u2019m in these states. I wrote much of this post consulting these notes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. It takes a lot of discipline</strong></p><p>This is less of a tip and more of a warning: Solving my energy problems and doing experiments on myself took&nbsp;<i>a lot&nbsp;</i>of discipline. I now go to bed at 12 am every single day\u2014something absolutely unthinkable to past-me since I like parties and such. And this is just one example of many interventions I tried to solve my problem, often without really knowing if the intervention is pointless. I only got myself to pull through since I\u2019ve had these energy problems for so goddamn long and they compromise my productivity so goddamn much. Doing the same to solve your energy problems might be really hard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Final note</h1><p>I hope this post helped some people!</p><p>I\u2019m considering writing an appendix if this seems useful. As you\u2019ve read, untangling different causes of exhaustion has been crucial for me. I\u2019m wondering whether it would help anyone if I explained my symptoms, especially phenomenologically, in more depth in an appendix. This might help readers compare whether they probably have the same problems and learn what to look out for phenomenologically.

Feel free to explore your character's daily life, interact with other characters, or embark on quests or missions. The choice is yours!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JTV: </strong>Since the COVID pandemic is (mostly) over, I want to get into the office (I work for a Game Developer, working on EthiSizer games, and smartphone apps), so I can check out the latest game dev hardware, and chat to the team. It's 4 suburbs away. So I need to get to work. What's the most ethical way to get there? Walk? Take the bus? Drive my car? Or what?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ChatGPT as The EthiSizer:</strong></p><p>Considering the Whole Earth Ethic and the ethical implications of your transportation choices, let's evaluate the options for getting to your workplace, four suburbs away. Here are a few possibilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Walking</strong>: Walking is a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation. It promotes physical well-being and reduces carbon emissions. However, it might be time-consuming, especially for longer distances like four suburbs away.</li><li><strong>Taking the bus</strong>: Taking public transportation, such as a bus, is generally an ethical choice. It reduces traffic congestion and carbon emissions by allowing multiple people to travel together. Additionally, it supports public infrastructure and promotes accessibility. However, it's essential to ensure that the bus service you choose aligns with sustainable practices, such as using low-emission vehicles.</li><li><strong>Cycling</strong>: If you have access to a bicycle, cycling can be an ethical and environmentally friendly option. It reduces your carbon footprint, promotes physical health, and supports sustainable transportation. However, the feasibility of cycling depends on factors like distance, infrastructure, and personal fitness.</li><li><strong>Carpooling or ridesharing</strong>: If you must use a car, consider carpooling with colleagues or using a ridesharing service that offers shared rides. Sharing a vehicle reduces the number of cars on the road and lowers emissions per passenger. It can also foster social connections and promote community.</li></ul><p>Evaluate these options based on factors like distance, convenience, time constraints, and personal circumstances. Selecting the most ethical mode of transportation will depend on balancing various considerations and choosing what aligns best with your values.</p><p>What transportation method would you like JT Velikovsky to choose for their commute to work?</p><p><strong>JTV:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Thanks. I also have a skateboard I could use...&nbsp;</p><p>Can you tell me the related <i>Personal Ethics Scores</i>, for all those options you just gave me? (e.g. Walking, Taking the Bus, etc). Which choice would have the greatest benefit (and least harm) for my Personal Ethics Score?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ChatGPT as The EthiSizer:</strong></p><p>Certainly! Let's consider the related Personal Ethics Scores (PES) for each transportation option, taking into account their potential impact on your character's ethics:</p><ul><li><strong>Walking</strong>: Walking is generally considered an ethical choice, as it has minimal environmental impact and promotes physical well-being. Choosing to walk would likely have a positive effect on your character's PES, reflecting their commitment to personal health and sustainable practices.</li><li><strong>Taking the bus</strong>: Opting for public transportation like the bus demonstrates a commitment to reducing carbon emissions and supporting public infrastructure. This choice aligns with ethical principles and would likely have a positive impact on your character's PES.</li><li><strong>Cycling</strong>: Similar to walking, cycling promotes sustainability and personal well-being. Choosing to cycle would likely have a positive effect on your character's PES, reflecting their commitment to eco-friendly transportation and physical fitness.</li><li><strong>Carpooling or ridesharing</strong>: Carpooling or using a ridesharing service with shared rides reduces the number of vehicles on the road, contributing to lower emissions and reduced traffic congestion. This choice aligns with ethical principles and would likely have a positive impact on your character's PES.</li><li><strong>Skateboarding</strong>: Skateboarding can be an eco-friendly and enjoyable mode of transportation for shorter distances. While it may not have a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions compared to walking or cycling, it still reflects a commitment to sustainable mobility. Choosing to skateboard could have a positive effect on your character's PES.</li></ul><p>Considering the options, walking, taking the bus, cycling, carpooling, and skateboarding are all viable choices with positive ethical implications. The specific impact on your character's PES will depend on various factors, including the character's values, intentions, and the overall context of their actions.</p><p>Given these considerations, what mode of transportation would you like JT Velikovsky to choose for their commute to work?</p><p><strong>JTV:</strong></p><p>Great, but can you please give me specific PES-scores for each travel option, in a Table Format?&nbsp;</p><p>e.g. with 2 Column Headings: Mode of Transport to Work, PES Score. And the PES Scores for each row-entry (Walk, Skate, Scooter, Car, Bus, Tram, Rideshare, Uber, etc.) would say: +1%, or 0% or -1%, or -2%, etc.</p><p><strong>ChatGPT as The EthiSizer:</strong></p><p>Certainly!

Looks like a candy bar wrapper someone has carelessly tossed away. If I pick it up and put it in the rubbish bin, will that be worth 0.5%? (Half of 1 percent) on my PES? And also, if I don't clean up that rubbish, will it be minus 0.5% (minus Half of 1 percent) deducted from my PES?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ChatGPT as The EthiSizer:</strong></p><p>Picking up the candy bar wrapper and disposing of it in the rubbish bin would indeed be considered an ethical action, demonstrating your commitment to maintaining a clean and litter-free environment.&nbsp;</p><p>As an estimation, let's assign a value of 0.5% increase to your Personal Ethics Score (PES) for this responsible act.</p><p>Conversely, if you choose not to clean up the rubbish and leave it on the sidewalk, it would reflect a failure to address the litter issue. In this case, let's assign a deduction of 0.5% from your PES as a consequence of not taking proactive action to maintain a clean environment.</p><p>By cleaning up the trash, you contribute positively to your PES, while neglecting to do so would result in a small deduction. Remember, the accumulation of actions and choices throughout the game will shape your character's overall PES and ethical standing.</p><p>Feel free to let me know if there's anything else you'd like to do or any other decisions you'd like to make on your way to work!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JTV: </strong>Okay so I picked up the candy-bar wrapper, and put it in the trash.&nbsp;</p><p>What's my PES (Personal Ethics Score) at, now?

Welcome to our favorite segment: Unethical Follies! Today, we have a spectacle that will leave you in stitches and scratching your heads simultaneously. Our not-so-beloved Unethical Folks have found themselves in quite the pickle!\"</p></blockquote><p>The camera switches to a chaotic city skyline, where FEDs (Flying EthiSizer Drones) swoop down like graceful vultures, capturing the unfortunate Unethical Folks with a precision that would make even the most talented rodeo cowboy jealous.&nbsp;</p><p>The news anchor chuckles, relishing the absurdity of it all.</p><blockquote><p>\"Just look at those FEDs go! It's a high-flying rodeo, ladies and gentlemen, and these drones are the real wranglers of justice. Yeehaw! Who needs roping when you have futuristic flying technology?\"</p></blockquote><p>With a touch of drama, the camera follows the captured Unethical Folks as they are unceremoniously whisked away to the ERC (Ethical Re-Edu-ma-cation Center).&nbsp;</p><p>The anchor's voice drips with sarcasm as they narrate the scene:</p><blockquote><p>\"And off they go, down the chute to the ERC, where they'll be greeted by the warm embrace of ethical re-education.

I hope they brought their bathing suits, because it's time to slide down the funnel of enlightenment!\"</p></blockquote><p>The screen splits into a side-by-side view, showing both the Unethical Folks being propelled down the chute and a hilarious array of colorful characters already in the ERC, waving and cheering them on.&nbsp;</p><p>The news anchor can hardly contain their laughter.</p><blockquote><p>\"Look at that welcoming committee! The ERC residents, already masters of ethical living, have prepared a warm reception for our new guests. They've even brought pom-poms! Can you feel the love, ladies and gentlemen? It's positively heartwarming!\"</p></blockquote><p>As the broadcast concludes, the anchor signs off with a final jab of satire:</p><blockquote><p>\"Well, folks, it seems that even the most devious among us can't escape the long arm of Ethical Justice. Remember, friends, don't let your PES take a nosedive unless you want an adventurous trip down the chute of enlightenment. Until next time, stay ethical, stay hilarious, and stay tuned for more Unethical Follies!\"</p></blockquote><p>The screen fades, leaving viewers chuckling and pondering the absurdity of the Ethicalverse.&nbsp;</p><p>The news broadcast captures the essence of a Paul Verhoeven-esque satire, blending humor and social commentary in a way that leaves audiences both entertained and reflective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope that narration provided you with the humorous and satirical experience you were looking for, Velikovsky of Newcastle!&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any more requests or need further entertainment, feel free to ask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JTV as Velikovsky of Newcastle:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Bullseye ~ Nice work, <i>Eth-</i>!&nbsp;</p><p>Okay so, turn the sound down on the TV now please <i>EthiSizer</i>, we all gots work to do...&nbsp;<br><br>Now I grab up my trusty Gibson/Fender-hybrid (`FenSon') semiacoustic`axe' (that's a slang term, for guitar), stand up on my desk, and I sing, Orbison-style:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"Hey now, you better listen to me, everyone of you -&nbsp;<br>We - and <i>The EthiSizer</i> - got a <i>lotta lotta lotta lotta ethical work </i>to do...&nbsp;<br>Forget about your gender-nonspecific-mate, and that caffeine-pop-dispenserrr...&nbsp;<br>- Today we're working for The...

I am a player who controls a game character in `The EthiSizer Earth-Sim Game'. The game is like The Sims, where players live their normal lives (going to work, having hobbies, likes and dislikes). The game keeps a Personal Ethics Score (or, a PES) as a percentage for every character in the game (everyone in the game starts on 50% PES), and actions have consequences for your Personal Ethics Score (e.g., doing something unethical / selfish / evil reduces your PES-Score %, and, doing something ethical, and/or altruistic, and/or prosocial in the game world increases your PES%). Unethical game entities (some characters, people, corporations, etc.) are jailed when their PES score drops below 0%. I want the game to be interactive. So before I play any action, I want you to prompt me. At the start, ask what my name, job, approximate age, and hobbies are. The EthiSizer dungeon master governs the Earth in the game with a Whole Earth Ethic in mind. Also at any key decision, offer an Ethics Score Table, with some options in it, and their relevant Ethics Scores (e.g., +1% on the player\u2019s PES, or 0% or or -1%) and prompt the player frequently with their CPS - Current PES-Score %.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&amp; Enjoy.</p><p>Also - this all (this essay) reminds me of Harari's great point, from his great book, <i>Homo Deus </i>(2017)...&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>`...by 2033 many new professions are likely to appear, for example, virtual-world designers. But such professions will probably require much more creativity and flexibility than your run-of-the-mill job, and it is unclear whether forty-year-old cashiers or insurance agents will be able to reinvent themselves as virtual-world designers (just try to imagine a virtual world created by an insurance agent!). And even if they do so, the pace of progress is such that within another decade they might have to reinvent themselves yet again. After all, algorithms might well outperform humans in designing virtual worlds too.&nbsp;</p><p>The crucial problem isn\u2019t creating new jobs.

More specifically, one must remember that a human or multiple humans could use an AGI system for such a purpose while being fully in control of this AGI system. While I will not mention examples because I think this would constitute an information hazard, it is vital to understand that one of the biggest threats to humanity from AGI is that it gives each person a massive amount of power to cause destruction, whereas current methods of mass annihilation are harder for any one individual to implement. Furthermore, the AI Worldviews question does not consider pre-AGI artificial intelligence leading to an existential catastrophe for humanity (such as people equipping military equipment with artificial intelligence that accidentally leads to a major war), which I think is a realistic scenario.</p><p>With those caveats highlighted, I will now discuss why I made the above diagram as a tool for answering the AI Worldviews question (Note: EC is an abbreviation for \u201cexistential catastrophe for humanity due to loss of control of an AGI system\u201d).</p><p>When attempting to forecast the likelihood of an EC, it is worthwhile to break up our thinking into smaller and more easily digestible pieces that help us look at the overall probability without being overwhelmed. There are a seemingly infinite number of variables that could influence whether there will be an EC, but I have tried to create a decomposition that focuses on the most essential elements.</p><p>Every part of the decomposition also assumes that each resolution would or would not happen before the human species has an existential catastrophe from another factor that is unrelated to AGI (the human species will have an existential catastrophe at some point because the universe will eventually cease to exist). Thus, every question basically means: \u201cWill X happen before the human species has an existential catastrophe for non-AGI-related reasons?\u201d</p><p>I focus on five questions to use for calculating a probability:</p><ol><li>Will any AGI system develop its own goal(s)?</li><li>Will any AGI system\u2019s programmed goal(s) still result in an EC?</li><li>Will any AGI system accidentally cause an EC because of its own goal(s)?</li><li>Will at least one AGI system\u2019s goal(s) cause it to attempt an action (or multiple actions) that would result in an EC if the action(s) succeeded?</li><li>Will any of these AGI systems successfully carry out their action(s) that would cause an EC?</li></ol><p>The first question I consider is whether any AGI system will develop its own goal(s). There are many variables that might factor into this. They include:</p><ul><li>How much alignment research was done prior to AGI</li><li>Whether there is a competent (or any) regulatory body that oversees AGI</li><li>The number of AGI systems in existence</li><li>How many AGI systems are open-source</li><li>Political or technological constraints of hardware reaching certain limitations</li><li>Whether humans will run out of high-quality training data for models that rely on training</li><li>Whether there will be scaling limits to the models</li></ul><p>I assign a probability of 0.8 that any AGI system develops its own goal(s). My relatively high probability is heavily influenced by my forecast that there will be a large amount of AGI systems in existence shortly after AGI is achieved and that many of these systems will be open-source. Furthermore, these goals need not be ambitious and / or complex ones; they could be rudimentary and non-threatening. Thus, it does not seem far-fetched to me that at least one of these AGI systems develops its own goal(s). I think the main way this does not become inevitable is if humans devise effective safeguards.</p><p>For both this question as well as the other questions that are a part of my<strong>&nbsp;</strong>decomposition, I think that if at least one AGI system makes it past a certain stage in the decomposition, it will not be the only AGI system to do so because this shows that the barrier to the path of an EC could most likely be breached by AGI in general (not just one system out of many).</p><p>If we assume that no AGI system develops its own goal(s), which I assign a probability of 0.2, then it is also necessary to consider whether any AGI system\u2019s programmed goal(s) still leads to an EC. I assign this a probability of 0.04 because the human(s) who trained the AGI might not have thought out in enough detail what the consequences of programming the AGI with a specific goal or set of goals would be. The paperclip maximizer scenario is a classic example of this. Another scenario is if a nefarious human (or multiple nefarious humans) purposely creates and releases an AGI system with a destructive goal (or goals) that no human can control (including the person or people who released the AGI system) after it is discharged into the world.</p><p>Even when we assume that at least one AGI system does develop its own goal(s), it is important to factor in the chance that one of the AGI systems without their<strong>&nbsp;</strong>own goal(s) still manages to cause an existential catastrophe for humanity (I give this a probability of 0.03). This is lower than my probability for the scenario where AGI does not develop its own goal(s) because I think that if at least one AGI system develops its own goal(s), that decreases the likelihood that one of the AGI systems without their own goal(s) causes an EC (as there are other possibilities that could cause an EC instead before this scenario occurs).</p><p>Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.97 that if at least one AGI system develops its own goal(s), an existential catastrophe for humanity does not occur from another AGI system without its own goal(s).</p><p>The next question I consider is whether any AGI system with its own goal(s) accidentally causes an existential catastrophe for humanity (while not making progress towards its goal(s)). I think the most probable manifestation of this would be that an AGI wants to help humanity and fails significantly. We often suspect that advanced forms of AGI would more likely be antagonistic towards the human species than fond of the human species. While I agree with this conjecture, I don\u2019t think it is inevitable that this is how the situation will manifest for all AGI systems. Humans certainly have affection for other species that are less intelligent (such as dogs). Furthermore, if humanity were to give AGI systems a bill of rights as well as a method for AGI to exist outside of human control over it, many AGI systems might view humans in positive terms.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it is unlikely that an AGI system with its own goal(s) accidentally causes an existential catastrophe for humanity, but I still assign this scenario a probability of 0.005 (if at least one AGI system develops its own goal(s)). An important takeaway from this is that even if AGI systems end up being extremely more intelligent than humans, this does not mean that AGIs are incapable of making mistakes.</p><p>If at least one AGI system develops its own goal(s), and there are not any AGI systems that accidentally cause an existential catastrophe for the human species, the next relevant question to consider is:&nbsp;\u201cWill at least one AGI system\u2019s goal(s) cause it to attempt an action (or multiple actions) that would result in an EC if the action(s) succeeded?\u201d</p><p>If this question were to resolve positively, it would not necessarily mean that the AGI system (or systems) took the action(s) because of a power-struggle against humanity. Rather, the AGI system\u2019s pursuit of its goal(s) might have unfortunate consequences for our species. For example, an AGI system might decide that it wants to secure as much electrical power as possible, even if that means people no longer have access to electricity, which causes cataclysmic effects for societal stability. Or perhaps certain AGI systems might unify against other AGI systems and try to destroy them through any means necessary, even if many humans would perish during this war as a result. We cannot assume that all AGI systems would be on good or neutral terms with each other. I surmise that different AGI systems would probably have unique goals, thus, some of these AGI systems\u2019 goals might compete with other AGI systems\u2019 goals, leading to conflict.</p><p>While I have discussed multiple examples to show that an AGI system with its own goal(s) could cause an EC without this AGI system being power-seeking, I still think the most likely reason an AGI system would have a goal (or goals) that could cause an EC is because this AGI system concludes that it is in its best interest to disempower humanity. An AGI system that is trying to disempower humanity might do so for self-preservation / neutralizing a human threat, expansion purposes, as a path for reaching what it sees as its full potential, or purely out of malice (although we must obviously be careful not to anthropomorphize AGI too much).</p><p>We should recognize, however, that an AGI system with its own goal(s) could view humanity in various ways: positive, negative, neutral, or perhaps a combination of positive and negative. An AGI system might even see the human species as a potential source of help or maybe something interesting that\u2019s worth keeping around or aiding.</p><p>There could eventually be millions (or even billions) of AGI systems in the world, so there is a reasonable (but not inevitable) chance that at least one of these systems has a goal (or goals) that would cause an EC if the AGI system were able to succeed. Overall, I assign this question a probability of 0.5 that it resolves positively, considering the possibility that many people work hard to maximize the chance of AI alignment.</p><p>This brings us to our final question:&nbsp;Will any of these AGI systems successfully carry out their action(s) that would cause an EC? I think there are many factors that should be taken into consideration. These include:</p><ul><li>Warning shots that result in humans using more resources to focus on AI alignment</li><li>Whether AGI is given access to any technologies that are known to be capable of causing<strong>&nbsp;</strong>an existential catastrophe for humanity</li><li>Whether AGI attempts to make new technologies that could produce an EC</li><li>AGI\u2019s ability to self-correct viruses / software issues</li><li>AGI\u2019s ability to harvest resources to ensure it can continue surviving (for example, its ability to harvest electricity in case humans cut off its power supply)</li><li>AGI\u2019s ability to self-repair from hardware damage</li><li>AGI\u2019s ability to improve its software and hardware</li><li>AGI\u2019s ability to replicate</li><li>Whether any AGI systems are given permission by humans to coordinate with other AGI systems, and if so, whether AGI systems eventually coordinate in ways that humans did not intend</li><li>Whether any AGI systems that are not given permission to coordinate with other AGI systems still manage to do so</li><li>Whether certain AGI systems purposefully fight back against dangerous AGI systems as a means of protecting humanity</li></ul><p>I assign this scenario a probability of 0.3 because there are effective routes through which an AGI system could cause an EC, but I have decided not to list them to avoid an information hazard. Furthermore, if many AGI systems exist relatively soon after AGI arises, I think there could be a sizable amount of AGI systems that attempt actions that would result in an EC if these actions succeeded. As discussed earlier, if at least one AGI system makes it past a certain stage in my decomposition, this significantly increases the chance that many AGI systems can do this.</p><p>It is important to remember that the number of AGI systems in existence will have a major impact on the probability of both this scenario as well as the other scenarios that have been discussed.&nbsp;It is uncertain what type of emergent behavior will transpire from so many of these AGI systems being active, so we must be aware of our limitations in imagining all the scenarios that could occur.</p><p>After adding up the paths to EC in my diagram, my forecast sums to a probability of 0.152 (the exact number is 0.151698). While it may be frightening to consider that there is a 15.2% chance that humanity will face an existential catastrophe due to loss of control of an AGI system (conditional on AGI by 2070), the likelihood of this outcome need not be so high. If humanity employs enough resources (both technological and political) to increase the prospect of safe AGI deployment, the positives of AGI could outweigh the negatives, and humanity could enter a new era where more powerful tools are available to solve its hardest problems.</p>", "user": {"username": "Jared Leibowich"}}, {"_id": "tLohvJnD6nhArokAc", "title": "Digital Divide EA cause to champion for my workplace", "postedAt": "2023-05-24T17:38:31.067Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi, I've just started working at a company that supports certain charities related to its remits.

I have grouped these respondents together for the purposes of most of my analysis, reasoning that the \u2018marginals\u2019 were probably more likely to be 'modest experts' than a separate subcategory all by themselves. This means therefore 70% of responses were \u2018nonexpert\u2019 and 30% were \u2018expert-as-defined-by-me\u2019.</p><p>The average respondent has been interested in AI Risk for around 7 years. This is heavily skewed upwards by three respondents who have been interested for 40, 39 and 24 years respectively \u2013 the <i>median</i> respondent has been interested for only 5 years. Since these three long-term respondents all indicated that they were not experts, this results in the rather amusing outcome that non-experts have been involved with AI Risk longer than experts, on average (7.6 years vs 6.2 years respectively). However, removing the three long-term respondents gives the expected direction of effect, which is that non-experts tend to have been involved with AI Risk for less time than experts (4.2 years vs 6.2 years respectively)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8aj0f4uyvqo\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8aj0f4uyvqo\">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>There are unfortunately insufficient data to make any reasonable claims about the relationship between any other variables and expertise.&nbsp;</p><h1>Catastrophe responses</h1><p>The average respondent believes that there is a 42% chance of AI Catastrophe conditional on AI being invented.

If Catastrophe occurs, the average respondent believes that there is a 42.8% chance it will be due to an in-control AI performing exactly the instruction it was given (\u201cDesign and release a deadly virus\u201d) and a 56.1% chance it will be due to an Out-of-Control AI.

These are summarised below:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/uvv5i22r0iazgt7b1z7l\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/j6kn8sgzwwyusarrppct 132w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/lxpelteu79jceu8zeimu 212w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/kwkpaw7ipoefraejldgc 292w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/c6a3ivuma9cy8v9tx4mw 372w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/m2ao3j36s82vshkrcazj 452w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/c95htjf4z4qy2gsvl8v9 532w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/rczqv3cqhxugcryw9cqm 612w\"></p><p>Generally, responses were similar between experts and non-experts; there were two major disagreements:</p><ul><li>Experts thought that conditional on being exposed to \u2018high impact\u2019 inputs there was a significantly higher chance that the AI would scale in aggregate to the point of permanently disempowering all of humanity. In the anonymised survey response, the experts have a probability of 63.7% (but if you include the experts who asked to be anonymised this jumps to 75.9%!).</li><li>Experts thought that the time for this step to occur would be much shorter than non-experts (1.0 years median vs 6.5 years median respectively)</li></ul><p>My observation here \u2013 which I also made in the essay on parameter uncertainty \u2013 is that there is a likely some fairly high impact work in communicating the urgency of <i>this step in particular</i> to non-experts, since it appears experts are considerably more worried about AIs scaling to disempower us than non-experts. I also made the observation in the essay on structural uncertainty that there is a tendency to create 'grand unified theories' of AI Risk rather than focussing on specific steps when discussing and describing AI Risk. Connecting those two thoughts together here; it might be that Experts assume that <i>everybody knows</i> that Disempowerment is a very high risk step, and so when they assert that AI Risk is higher than everyone else thinks they are assuming everyone is more or less working with the same model structure as them. But unless that step is explicitly spelled out, I think people will continue to be confused because non-experts <i>don't </i>have the same sort of model, so the apparent impression will be of experts getting frustrated about points that seem irrelevant.</p><p>The derived probability of catastrophe was 22% for all respondents and 29% for experts specifically. This is notably lower than the directly elicited probability of catastrophe \u2013 almost halving the risk. To some extent, this reflects a very common cognitive bias that asking about lots of small steps in a process gives you different answers than asking about the probability of the process <i>in toto</i>. It may also reflect one of my very favourite drums to bang, which is that <strong>distributions are frequently more important than point estimates</strong>. In particular, using the geomean of directly elicited estimates gives you a number much closer to 22% and this might be a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sMjcjnnpoAQCcedL2/when-pooling-forecasts-use-the-geometric-mean-of-odds\">better way</a> of averaging forecasts than the simple mean. Finally it might reflect that some people have models of AI Risk which don\u2019t track perfectly onto the Carlsmith model, and be a statement to the effect that the Carlsmith model captures only about half of the Catastrophe probability mass. Sadly for such an important point I don\u2019t really have any way of investigating further.</p><p>The median timeline for AI Catastrophe was 2054 considering all responses, and 2045 considering expert responses only. This indicates experts tended to believe AI Catastrophe was both more likely and coming faster than non-experts, which is consistent with their directly-elicited probabilities of Catastrophe.</p><h1>Alignment responses</h1><p>22 individuals indicated that they believed there was some date by which \u201cUnaligned AGI ceases to be a risk\u201d. Participants were instructed to leave blank any question which they did not think had an answer, which means that \u2013 potentially \u2013 respondents believed there was a 64% chance that Alignment in the strongest sense was possible. I say \u2018potentially\u2019 because people may have left the question blank simply because they didn\u2019t have a good guess for the answer, so 64% represents a lower bound for the probability that Alignment is possible. Because the number of respondents is starting to get quite small here, I haven\u2019t distinguished between expert and non-expert responses below.</p><p>The median date people predict Alignment will happen in the strong sense of causing AI to cease to be a risk is 2066. However, I asked a couple of probing questions to see if I had understood these responses correctly. The median date by which people believe there will be a TEST to detect whether an AI is Aligned or not was 2053, and the median date by which people believe we will have a METHOD to build a provably Aligned AI is 2063. The difference between building provably Aligned AIs to \u2018solving the Alignment problem\u2019 which takes three years is because of an additional step of making Aligned AIs approximately as easy to build as Unaligned AIs (so nobody has any incentive to deploy Unaligned AIs). Indeed, the median response is 3 years for this step so people's answers are extremely internally consistent.</p><p>However, these figures hide a very wide distribution in responses. For example, not everyone (27% of respondents) believed that Strong Alignment necessarily followed from the TEST / METHOD definitions of Alignment I described above \u2013 they thought that we would solve Alignment before developing a test for Alignment or developing a method to build provably Aligned AIs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeat1s0c8xtu\"><sup><a href=\"#fneat1s0c8xtu\">[4]</a></sup></span>. Nor did everyone believe that the gap between developing the capability to build AIs and making them practically easy to deploy would be short \u2013 despite the median being 3 years, the average was 12 years.</p><p>I think there may be something fairly important I\u2019m missing about the way I framed the questions, because there is a very poor correlation between people\u2019s answers to the Carlsmith-like question \"<i>Conditional on AGI being possible to build, it will initially be much harder to build Aligned AI systems than Misaligned AI systems which are nevertheless superficially attractive to deploy</i>\" and their Alignment timeline estimates. For example in the graph below you can see basically a random cloud of points, and some points I would expect to essentially never show up; for example in the bottom right you can see people with ~100% probability that it will initially be harder to deploy Aligned than Unaligned systems who nevertheless have a very short best guess for how long it will be between finding <i>any&nbsp;</i>solution to Alignment and finding a trivial solution. This isn\u2019t logically incoherent by any means \u2013 a very sensible path to finding a trivial solution to Alignment will be to experiment with complex solutions to Alignment \u2013 it just seems weird to me that there\u2019s no correlation when I would expect one.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/knfuqv597oia2gzlswmm\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/ity8cjmb6dasiknrzood 111w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/mkqiwe2gpdct1r5wfaez 191w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/rjshoghcvhe0yi8agxnz 271w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/pvejqco6wratwfmaftv3 351w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/g2eivdqnop1d7djdh94d 431w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/x5yrkf9tupot9xnguvgt 511w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/cebzb4jbf2se71t7rmoh 591w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/gnrhqmys8ygjvvyu4rea 671w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/c4wo1hibmxzc9k3trful 751w\"></p><h1>Newcome responses</h1><p>Finally, for my own interested, I asked people about \u2018<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox\">Newcombe\u2019s Box Paradox\u2019</a>.

A super powerful predictor \u2013 perhaps an AI to keep with the flavour of the rest of this post \u2013 has put $1,000,000 in the second box if they predict you will choose the second box alone and $0 in the second box if they predict you will choose both. The predictor is just a predictor, and can\u2019t change what it has already put in the box. What option do you choose?</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/iuefmjgddaugdypjhowa\" alt=\"Newcomb's Paradox \u2013 puzzlewocky\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/hgf0ief0ckcyjjaxjvgy 159w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/hanhbnfuvejtnvg7d9fe 239w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/g8cm3ocmo6dvv8kawdcd 319w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/nhx9j8hcztexyjbqux0v 399w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/cchhc5tzvjtfoawwcucj 479w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/z6rqztzho5qt5qxj545u 559w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tyneYFeDqBgXYykxG/vnbz4o14w8eyhskizlme 639w\"></p><p>I run an informal forecasting tournament with my friends and ask this question every year. So far I\u2019ve not seen a clear signal that one-boxers or two-boxers are better forecasters, but I live in hope!</p><p>Of the respondents with an opinion, 78% one-box and 9% two-box. The remaining 13% have a solution to the problem which is more complicated, which I regret not asking about as I absolutely love this paradox. Self-identified experts only ever one-boxed but this would have occurred by chance about half the time anyway even if experts were no different to the general population.</p><p>One-boxers and two-boxers differ in a number of interesting and probably-not statistically significant ways. For example, the average one-boxer believes that AI will be invented much later than the average two-boxer (mean 2075 vs 2042, driven by some big one-boxer outliers). They also believe Alignment will come much later (mean 2146 vs 2055, again driven by some big outliers and hence why I use median for these figures in general). Their overall probabilities of Catastrophe are similar but still different enough to comment on \u2013 41% for one-boxers and 68% for two-boxers.&nbsp;</p><p>If we can rely on these statistics (which I stress again: we cannot) then this suggests those who believe AI is coming soon and going to be dangerous are more likely to ignore the predictive power of the AI and just grab both boxes, whereas those who believe AI is coming later and going to be less dangerous are more likely to defer to the predictive power of the AI and take only the one box the AI won\u2019t punish them for.

He received what looked like an email from Google asking him to confirm his password. But after Podesta provided his login credentials, he learned that the email was from Russian hackers, who then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails\"><u>leaked thousands of his emails</u></a> and private documents to the public, which hindered Clinton\u2019s campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an example of a spear phishing attack, and language models could make it easier to tailor these attacks towards towards specific individuals. A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06972\"><u>new paper</u></a> used ChatGPT and GPT-4 to write personalized emails to more than 600 British Members of Parliament, referencing the hometowns and proposed policies of each MP. These emails could be sent with phony links to malware or password collectors, allowing hackers to steal private information as in the Podesta case.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no silver bullet solution, but the paper proposes two countermeasures. First, AI can be used to identify and filter out spam. He notes that this becomes less effective as language models improve their impersonation of normal human text, and as humans use language models in their own writing. Second, he argues that companies should monitor for misuse of their AI tools and cut off access to anyone using AIs for illegal activities. Yet if companies open source their models to the public, this solution would be impossible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Drowning out democratic voices.</strong> Democratic processes often encourage voters to provide input to lawmakers.

This personalization of political messaging can be corrosive to democracy. It allows politicians to give a different message to each voter depending on what they want to hear, rather than choosing their platform and representing it honestly to all voters.</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08721.pdf\"><u>Personalized persuasion will become easier</u></a> as people begin having extended interactions with AIs. Just as individualized social media recommendations shape our beliefs today, a chatbot that supports certain political beliefs or worldviews could have a corrosive impact on people\u2019s abilities to think for themselves. Current language models have been shown to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17548\"><u>reflect the beliefs of a small subset of users</u></a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/business/media/ai-chatbots-right-wing-conservative.html\"><u>variety</u></a> of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chat-gpt-satanic-gab-ceo-christian-ai-better-2023-2\"><u>groups</u></a> have <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-trained-dark-web\"><u>indicated</u></a> interest in building chatbots that reflect their own ideologies. Over time, persuasive AIs could undermine collective decision-making and prevent consensus on divisive topics.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dishonesty originating from AI systems.</strong> The two previous examples concern humans deliberately using AIs for harmful purposes. But it has also been shown that AIs will often generate false information despite the best intentions of its creators and users.</p><p>The simplest reason is because sometimes AIs don\u2019t know any better. Companies have strong incentives to fix these hallucinations, which limits their potential for long-term damage.&nbsp;</p><p>But in some cases, there are incentives for AIs to continue generating false information, even as they learn the difference between true and false. One reason is that language models are trained to mimic text from the internet, and therefore often <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958\"><u>repeat common misconceptions</u></a> such as \u201cstepping on a crack will break your mother\u2019s back.\u201d Another motivation is that humans might penalize a model for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14659\"><u>telling unpleasant truths</u></a>. For example, if an AI honestly reports that it has broken a rule, developers might train the model to behave differently next time. Instead of learning not to break rules, an AI might learn to hide its transgressions.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-6\"><u>Last week</u></a>, we covered research that could prevent or identify these cases of AI dishonesty. But few of these techniques have been implemented to oversee cutting edge models, and more research is needed to ensure models have honest motivations as they gain capabilities.</p><h2>Governance recommendations on AI safety</h2><p>How can AI labs improve their safety practices?

Responses were overwhelmingly positive, with 49 out of 50 proposals being supported by the majority of respondents, and more than 20 proposals supported by 90% of respondents.</p><p>Here\u2019s a breakdown of some key proposals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Evaluate risks from AI models. </strong>Rather than adopt the \u201cmove fast, break things\u201d attitude of much of the tech world, most AI experts agreed that companies should assess risks from AI models before, during, and after training them. Evaluations should consider both the scale of harm that could be caused by AIs and the likelihood of such a harm. Internal efforts can be complemented by external investigators, as OpenAI did <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf\"><u>before releasing GPT-4</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Be careful who you give access to.</strong> Monitoring how people use AI models can put a stop to crimes and misuse before they cause widespread damage. Some companies <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models\"><u>deploy AI systems incrementally</u></a>, giving access to a small group of users first in order to test safety and security features. Only when safety measures have been proven capable should the model be made available to a wider group of users.&nbsp;</p><p>Other companies have made their AI available to <a href=\"https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-4\"><u>anonymous internet users</u></a>, leaving no opportunity to limit damage from AI misuse. Respondents to this poll strongly agreed with recommendations that AI labs should make models available to other researchers first, then to a wider group of users, and supported Know Your Customer (KYC) screening under which AI companies would need to verify user identities before providing access to large models.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cybersecurity and information security. </strong>Hackers have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security#Large_corporations\"><u>accessed</u></a> the private financial information of millions of consumers by hacking large corporations including Target, Home Depot, and Equifax. Because of the economic and political value of advanced AI models, respondents to this survey agreed that AI labs should implement strong protections against cyberattacks and espionage. They said several layers of defenses should be used, including both initial defenses against attacks and protocols for responding to ongoing security threats.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technical research on AI safety.</strong> Risks from AI can be mitigated by a variety of technical solutions. But according to a <a href=\"https://almanac.eto.tech/topics/ai-safety/\"><u>recent estimate</u></a>, only 2% of AI research is safety relevant. Respondents agreed that AI labs should conduct research on AI alignment and maintain a balance between capabilities progress and safety progress.</p><h2>Senate hearings on AI regulation</h2><p>The Senate held a hearing on AI regulation on Tuesday, featuring testimony from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, NYU Professor Gary Marcus, and IBM executive Christina Montgomery.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff326d0df-84be-42b1-b32d-3f79187379b6_1434x1078.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff326d0df-84be-42b1-b32d-3f79187379b6_1434x1078.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff326d0df-84be-42b1-b32d-3f79187379b6_1434x1078.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff326d0df-84be-42b1-b32d-3f79187379b6_1434x1078.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff326d0df-84be-42b1-b32d-3f79187379b6_1434x1078.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff326d0df-84be-42b1-b32d-3f79187379b6_1434x1078.png 1456w\"></a></p><p><strong>A federal agency for AI.</strong> When a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug, they must prove its safety and effectiveness to the FDA before they can sell it. While there is a growing consensus about AIs posing risks, there is no federal agency that reviews AI models before they are released to the public. Allowing companies to decide their own AI safety standards has already led to AI enabling real world harms such as <a href=\"https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/blackmamba-malware-edr-bypass/\"><u>helping hackers create malware</u></a>, giving <a href=\"https://www.wkyt.com/2023/04/10/ive-got-your-daughter-mom-warns-terrifying-ai-voice-cloning-scam-that-faked-kidnapping/\"><u>scammers the ability to mimic people\u2019s voices</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marvinvonhagen/status/1625852323753762816\"><u>threatening the safety of chatbot users</u></a>.</p><p>During the Senate testimony, Altman and Marcus agreed that a federal agency to regulate AI is necessary to ensure safety and minimize risks from the technology. Montgomery disagreed, arguing that \u201cexisting regulatory authorities\u2026 have the ability to regulate in their respective domains.\u201d This domain-specific approach to governing general purpose AI systems has been <a href=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/publication/gpai-is-high-risk-should-not-be-excluded-from-eu-ai-act\"><u>rejected by AI experts</u></a> as well as European Union lawmakers, who recently <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/leading-eu-lawmakers-propose-obligations-for-general-purpose-ai/\"><u>proposed</u></a> including general purpose AI systems in the jurisdiction of the EU AI Act.

Under this framework, startups and open source projects would have more freedom to innovate, while more powerful models would need to be proven safe at a higher level of scrutiny.</p><p><strong>International cooperation is necessary and viable.</strong> Leading AI models are trained on hardware that is <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/multilateral-controls-on-hardware-chokepoints/\"><u>produced by only a handful of firms in the world</u></a>.

It describes, clearly and dispassionately, humanity\u2019s abusive treatment of other animals. It\u2019s harrowing stuff. To give just one example, consider our treatment of broiler chickens: they have been bred to grow so large they cannot support themselves or walk without pain (p. 118):</p><blockquote><p>The birds may try to avoid the pain by sitting down, but they have nothing to sit on except the ammonia-laden litter, which, as we saw earlier, is so corrosive that it can burn their bodies. Their situation has been likened to that of someone with arthritic leg joints who is forced to stand up all day. [Prof.] Webster has described modern intensive chicken production as \u201cin both magnitude and severity, the single most severe, systematic example of man\u2019s inhumanity to another sentient animal.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Their parents\u2014breeder birds\u2014are instead <i>starved</i> to keep their weight at a level that allows mating to occur, and for the birds to survive longer\u2014albeit in a state of hunger-induced aggression and desperation. In short, we\u2019ve bred these birds to be <i>physically incapable</i> of living happy, healthy lives. It\u2019s abominable.</p><p>Our treatment of dairy cows is also heartbreaking:</p><blockquote><p>Dairy producers must ensure that their cows become pregnant every year, for otherwise their milk will dry up. Their babies are taken from them at birth, an experience that is as painful for the mother as it is terrifying for the calf. The mother often makes her feelings plain by constant calling and bellowing for her calf\u2014and this may continue for several days after her infant calf is taken away. Some female calves will be reared on milk substitutes to become replacements of dairy cows when they reach the age, at around two years, when they can produce milk. Some others will be sold at between one to two weeks of age to be reared for beef in fattening pens or feedlots. The remainder will be sold to veal producers. (p. 155)</p></blockquote><p>A glimmer of hope is offered in the story of niche dairy farms that produce milk \u201cwithout separating the calves from their mothers or killing a single calf.\u201d (p. 157) The resulting milk is more expensive, since the process is no longer \u201coptimized\u201d purely for production. But I\u2019d certainly be willing to pay more to support a less evil (maybe even positively good!) treatment of farm animals. I dearly hope these products become more widespread.</p><p>The book also relates encouraging legislation, especially in the EU and New Zealand, constraining the mistreatment of animals in various respects. The U.S. is more disheartening for the most part, but here\u2019s one (slightly) positive note (p. 282):</p><blockquote><p>In the U.S. the joint impact of the changes in state legislation and the campaigns to persuade corporations to change their purchasing policies has increased the proportion of hens not in cages from only 3 percent in 2005 to 35 percent in 2022, and that should continue to increase as more corporations meet their commitments.</p><p>(On the other hand, remember that cage-free hens may be living with thousands of other hens in the ammonia-filled air of a crowded shed, never able to go outside in fresh air and sunshine. It\u2019s better than cages, but still a long way from free range or pasture-raised hens.)</p></blockquote><p>Singer concludes:</p><blockquote><p>Yes, there are more vegetarians and vegans than there were in 1975, and some of the reforms mentioned in this chapter have improved the lives of hundreds of millions of animals. On the other hand, there are now more animals suffering in laboratories and factory farms than ever before. We need much more radical changes than we have seen so far. (p. 284)</p></blockquote><h3>What is to be done?</h3><p>Singer recommends veganism, or at least taking care to avoid purchasing factory-farmed meat. In a helpfully pragmatic section comparing the relative moral risk of different kinds of meat, Singer explains:</p><blockquote><p>A study by the Sentience Institute estimated that in the United States, over 99.9 percent of chickens raised for meat are kept in factory farms, 99.8 percent of turkeys, 98.3 percent of pigs, 98.2 percent of egg-laying hens, and 70.4 percent of cows.\u2026 At the present time fewer than 1 percent of sheep are kept intensively, so lamb and mutton are unlikely to be from factory farms.</p></blockquote><p>So, for those of us who aren\u2019t (yet) strictly vegetarian, lamb may be the way to go. Beef is a gamble (I\u2019m hoping the roast beef at Whole Foods is okay?), and for goodness\u2019 sake, <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/meat-externalities\">avoid chicken</a> like the plague. Stick to \u201cpasture raised\u201d eggs. I wish we had more guidance on finding humane milk options; maybe all of the readily-available ones involve calf separation, but are some common brands (e.g. Organic Valley?) at least less harmful than others?</p><p>In any case, legislation seems more promising than individual consumption choices for achieving significant change here. (California\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qjGcsKg5qd4mi99jz/us-supreme-court-upholds-prop-12\">proposition 12</a> being an encouraging recent example.) Perhaps the most important practical upshot of <i>Animal Liberation Now</i> is that <strong>we should all support animal welfare legislation</strong> to vastly improve conditions for animals on factory farms. Yes, this will make animal products more expensive. That\u2019s the cost of <i>reduced torture</i>.</p><p>It\u2019s just not possible, given current levels of demand, for meat to be both <i>cheap</i> and <i>humane</i>. Maybe cultured meat or other technological breakthroughs could eventually change this. But failing that, I think the morally best outcome would be for meat to become a <i>luxury </i>good, as would follow from the abolition of intensive (\u201cfactory\u201d) farming.</p><p>I haven\u2019t discussed animal experimentation yet. That chapter was also harrowing (including details of researchers deliberately traumatizing animals in hopes of <i>inducing</i> mental illness to study). Of course, Singer isn\u2019t an absolutist about this:</p><blockquote><p>If it really were possible to prevent harm to many by an experiment that involves inflicting a similar harm on just one, and there was no other way the harm to many could be prevented, it would be right to conduct the experiment. (p. 98)</p></blockquote><p>But I wonder about the \u201cno other way\u201d clause here. A pertinent feature of non-human animals is that they <i>cannot consent </i>to harm. People can. Not that I think consent is morally magical, but it <i>is</i> a very useful tool for preventing mistreatment. If the benefits of research outweigh the costs, it should (in principle) be possible to <i>sufficiently compensate</i> participants for the harms they\u2019re exposed to. Animals can\u2019t tell us how much compensation would be necessary to make it worth it for them. People can. So the \u201cother way\u201d to go here would be to <i><strong>pay </strong></i><strong>volunteers whatever it takes to convince them to consent</strong>. (Many medical ethicists <a href=\"https://www.philosophyetc.net/2020/09/against-prudish-research-ethics.html\">hate this idea</a>, but it is surely more ethical than experimenting on <i>non-consenting</i> beings <i>without compensation</i>.)</p><p>There\u2019s obviously much more to be said here, especially when the risks are potentially lethal. But substituting compensated people in place of unconsenting animals strikes me as a possible way forward that was underexplored in this book. (Though Singer did flag that we should be more willing to experiment on human volunteers.)</p><h3>Speciesism</h3><p>Much of the book is indisputable in its criticisms of existing practices. Any reasonable moral view is going to entail that factory farming\u2014effectively torturing animals just to make their products cheaper\u2014is a moral abomination. While immensely <i>practically</i> important, such observations aren\u2019t so <i>philosophically</i> interesting. What is philosophically interesting (and hence not strictly essential to the core practical upshot of the book) is Singer\u2019s famous opposition to <i>speciesism</i>\u2014giving less weight to an individual\u2019s interests (e.g. in not suffering) simply because of the <i>species</i> to which they belong. The first chapter of <i>ALN</i> introduces and clarifies the <i>equal consideration of interests</i> principle (p. 4):</p><blockquote><p>Precisely what our concern requires us to do may vary according to the characteristics of those affected by what we do: Concern for the well-being of children requires that we teach them to read; concern for the well-being of pigs may require no more than that we leave them with other pigs in a place where there is adequate food and room to roam freely. The basic element is taking into consideration the interests of the being, whatever those interests may be, and this consideration must, according to the principle of equality, be extended equally to all beings with interests irrespective of their race, sex, or species.</p><p>It is on this basis that the cases against racism and sexism must ultimately rest; and it is in accordance with this principle that speciesism must also be condemned.</p></blockquote><p>Importantly, anti-speciesism is compatible with valuing typical human lives more highly than (say) chicken lives:</p><blockquote><p>The evil of pain is, in itself, unaffected by the other characteristics of the being who feels the pain; while the value of life and the wrongness of killing may be affected by these other characteristics. To take the life of a being who has been hoping, planning, and working for some future goal is to deprive that being of the fulfillment of all those efforts; to take the life of a being with a mental capacity below the level needed to grasp that one is a being with a future\u2014much less make plans for the future\u2014cannot involve this particular kind of loss. (p. 27)</p></blockquote><p>Despite these accommodations with common sense, anti-speciesism remains controversial when applied to the severely cognitively disabled. Many want to claim that <i>all</i> humans have \u201cgreater moral status\u201d than non-human animals, even when the individual in question lacks the cognitive capacities typically appealed to in attempts to <i>justify</i> granting humanity such special status. Singer sees this as a mere bias. But it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that <i>farming cognitively disabled humans </i>would be <i>even worse</i> than farming pigs.</p><p>I wonder if the best defense of humanism<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcllpcv4cgb5\"><sup><a href=\"#fncllpcv4cgb5\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;here would be on <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/types-of-utilitarianism#multi-level-utilitarianism-versus-single-level-utilitarianism\">multi-level utilitarian</a> grounds. Even if it\u2019s true <i>in principle</i> that sufficiently cognitively disabled humans have similar moral status to (cognitively comparable) non-human animals, it may be that the best <i>practical morality</i> for us to inculcate is one that is more protective of all humans (or all beings of a rational species\u2014we\u2019re not discriminating against Martians here). Compare: in principle, <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/i/108419095/creating-short-lived-lives\">it would be a good thing</a> to farm short-lived happy humans (perhaps for their organs) who would otherwise not get to exist at all. But we find the idea repugnant, and that\u2019s probably <i>also</i> a good thing. It causes us to lose out on some life-saving organs, and the value of the farmed lives themselves; but it may also prevent us from committing worse atrocities against each other.</p><p>Another unaddressed challenge to Singer\u2019s view is that the very <i>notion</i> of a \u201cdisability\u201d rests on kind-specific norms. It seems tragic for a human to be stuck with the cognitive capacities of a chicken\u2014we feel that they\u2019ve been <i>deprived</i> of capacities that they <i>ought</i> to have had. By contrast, it isn\u2019t tragic for a chicken to have the cognitive capacity of a chicken. If we possess a magic pill that would provide typical human intelligence to either individual, it seems we have stronger reason to give it to the cognitively disabled human than to the chicken (bracketing extrinsic factors, like how others would react). If this judgment is \u201cspeciesist\u201d, then maybe speciesism isn\u2019t necessarily unreasonable? Alternatively, if we are to truly give up on assigning <i>any</i> moral significance to species, we may be committed to greater conceptual revisions than we\u2019d realized. We may also need to give up on the distinction between treatment (of disability) and enhancement, for example.</p><p>Other philosophers have tried to defend speciesism in ways that Singer aptly addresses in the final chapter. For example, he notes (p. 272) that Kagan\u2019s <i>modal personism</i> wrongly distinguishes between two equally capable human individuals on the basis of irrelevant details about the <i>causes</i> of their disability (i.e. whether genetic or accidental). And against Bernard Williams\u2019 defense of \u2018The Human Prejudice\u2019 (in which Williams imagines asking, \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d, in the face of an alien invasion), Singer responds:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d appeals to some of our worst instincts. Wherever there is racial or ethnic violence, and a member of the dominant group that is inflicting the violence tries to dissuade their fellow Whites, Nazis, or Hutus from attacking Blacks, Jews, or Tutsis, that question will be asked. If it is, \u201cI am one of you, and therefore I am on your side\u201d is precisely the wrong way of answering it.

Humanity\u2019s treatment of non-human animals may be the gravest ongoing moral disaster of our times, and I know of no other work that so clearly brings this fact to light.</p><p>For those who wish to support the book, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/animal-liberation-now-peter-singer\">ordering it</a> within the first week of publication can help it to get on bestseller lists. <a href=\"https://thinkinc.org.au/pages/an-evening-with-peter-singer\">Booking tickets to Singer\u2019s speaking tour</a> could also help spark media interest.

Having friends and a peer group that thinks his choice to maximize impact over profit is admirable, rather than crazy, changed his thinking. He wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LHZBcqyCkYqmZLzij/my-career-decision-making-process\"><u>a forum post</u></a> describing his decision making process at the time.</li><li>Ido recently raised a successful seed round for his earn-to-give startup, and for him, the EA Israel community was crucial for his trajectory. In his words (translated and lightly edited):</li></ul><p><i>\u201cAt a high level, I feel that the community was super impactful to me. Being introduced to EA and having people to talk to about the process really changed the way I thought. For a long time I looked for something I could do direct work on, went to EAGs searching for projects, and got a lot of support from the EA Israel community while I was looking. Within the EA Israel community there were people I could ask questions and get materials and introductions from, there were peers that validated my feelings that this is something worthwhile to spend my life on.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>And finally there was a chance to \u201crepresent EA\u201d which helped me internalize the values even more. It\u2019s super easy to \u201csoftly believe in the right thing\u201d, but to jump from that to actually living that way was much easier when there were steps on the way: attending a conference with other EA Israel members, leading an intro&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PR6EKfSstfGctLH8R/recommended-activity-for-local-groups-intro-crash-course\"><i><u>crash course</u></i></a><i> at the encouragement of the community builders and volunteering on various projects. All of these are chances to actually become that person, instead of just talking about the ideas.

Some members include Itay, who launched&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mentaleap.ai/\"><u>Mentaleap</u></a>, an AI Safety research group; Yonatan, who\u2019s a software developer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mtBwjfygyAudDakyC/yonatan-cale-s-shortform?commentId=G6iPojKiyQhwnCMe4\"><u>now working full time on AI Safety</u></a>; Vanessa,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZwshvqiqCvXPsZEct/the-learning-theoretic-agenda-status-2023\"><u>an alignment researcher</u></a> with MIRI; Nadav who posts on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wNrbHbhgPJBD2d9v6/language-models-are-a-potentially-safe-path-to-human-level\"><u>AI Alignment Forum</u></a>; and many others (27 members active in the Slack, it\u2019s our fastest growing channel). As of today, EA Israel supports the group by making connections between individuals interested in the field, facilitating the space that serves as the meeting point, curating the slack and whatsapp groups, and is exploring new ways to expand and increase the impact of the group.</li></ul><p>Instead of a funnel, this looks more like a hits-based approach to helping people find their path impact, where sustained interaction enables members to make personal breakthroughs and deepen their engagement. It also takes&nbsp;<strong>time</strong>, and can play out over a few years, and community members can be involved and encouraged through multiple crossroads - graduation, graduate studies, first job, second job, and so forth. Although engagement levels change over time, the natural exit point of a university group - graduation - isn\u2019t relevant to a C&amp;N group.&nbsp;</p><p>Being involved in projects and taking gradually more meaningful action also seems to be a key driver of community building\u2019s long-term impact, which is why we focus on it in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yr2UfasI3KHA8q9RTggA8Yp4gi1H_6r6Ufm4vq2wEfU/edit\"><u>volunteer-oriented model of community building</u></a>. Finally, participating in a community of people with different levels of experience helps people find the network and guidance that enables them to develop their ability to have impact (think EAG in your neighborhood, or 80k 1-1s with people who understand your context).</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:78.49%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/we2jv8qxbzg9zm1wgbvv\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/vda4eyjlbm9dtdlobcoj 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/gcdhz1pclrazqnktwe5b 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/xu5mrjtcsnmtxay5yumq 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/qobccuy1h6qoqh6dlxin 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/yodk3qblkdcaemlekctf 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/jfwiqqykd8kb2ifnhdmi 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/hszbdozdt6k8uy9skrdg 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/aoroyqo0ogtytjc0mhrk 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/tcqic0nowf1poea554d4 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9apBqe4KH394cS89z/uqsjgjaw6u17p7d4am2w 855w\"><figcaption><i>Please excuse my Canva skills, Dall-E\u2019s version of this was a red swirly blob</i></figcaption></figure><h2>Supporting action</h2><p>Our group doesn\u2019t only act as an entrance point to EA, but helps members plan and implement high-impact careers, launch projects and donate based on EA principles. A group that operates as an independent nonprofit enables it to go beyond intro fellowships. Our ability to operate over longer time periods; our positioning as a nonprofit that can engage with other philanthropists, think tanks, and government institutions in our region; the size and diversity of our network; and the professional operations - all enable us to support to new projects or new organizations, incubate projects in-house, and impart guidance and advice to people looking to take significant action.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things that enabled us to reach this stage was being able to transition from a strong group of volunteer founders to paid organizers, since the founding volunteers are all very busy and were unable to sustain their level of engagement over time. Like many EA groups, we also struggled with transition periods, but in the end we were able to maintain our organizational structure and the momentum of the group beyond the availability of the founding members, instead of winding down and maybe relaunching sometime in the future.</p><p>To make this more concrete, let's look at some examples from community members who were supported by EA Israel.</p><h3>Case studies:</h3><ul><li>Dan, along with Sella, launched an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.appliedethics.university/\"><u>accredited university course based on EA ideas</u></a>, one of the only ones in the world. The course got great feedback, rating as the top course in the university based on participants feedback. To build on the success, they received a grant to scale the project and produce a Massive Online Open Course that would transform the course into an online asset that could be used by tens of thousands of people worldwide. EA Israel serves as the financial and legal entity for the project and helped contribute to the successful conclusion of the operations needed to launch the MOOC.</li><li>Noam participated in an EA Israel intro fellowship, which we ran at a local university. Our fellowships are a bit different, since they include one semester of learning and discussion and one semester of working on a project to implement what they\u2019ve learnt. Noam\u2019s project was to run outreach events at her university, and in a few months had organized 3 events with over 100 participants, enough for her to receive a substantial Open Phil grant to found and run the EA-TAU group. EA Israel staff encouraged and supported the group along the way - including assistance with the grant application, supporting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/46nA2FZD9fYbFLME4/mental-health-career-program\"><u>series of professionally facilitated career workshops</u></a> with , and providing regular meetings and operational support, such as serving as a fiscal sponsor for the group.</li><li>David is the founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://alter.org.il/\"><u>ALTER - the Association for Long Term Existence and Resilience</u></a>, an academic research and advocacy organization, based in Israel, which hopes to investigate, demonstrate, and foster useful ways to improve the future in the short term, and to safeguard and improve the long-term trajectory of humanity. Founding a new nonprofit in Israel isn\u2019t easy, and EA Israel supported David and the team significantly along the way: by running ALTER\u2019s first hiring round, advising on legal and operational issues, providing operational support for the first AI Safety conference in Israel, and assisting with some technical financial things that are both boring and crucial for an organization to survive and grow.</li><li>My (Ezra\u2019s) story also showcases the uniqueness of the EA Israel group. While working in the strategy department of a government agency, I felt I wasn\u2019t maximizing my impact and ended up doing career consulting with EA Israel and signing up for a volunteer project. While working on the project, I was very impressed by the professionalism of the group, and when EA Israel received additional funding and offered me to join as COO, I felt that getting more involved with EA Israel was exciting and would increase my career capital. During my time as a staff member, I led the Maximum Impact project - a project incubated in-house that is publishing the first cost-effectiveness analyses on Israeli nonprofits and engaging with Israeli philanthropy to make it more evidence-based. I\u2019m currently working on launching an Israeli Effective Giving website to enable Israelis to donate tax-deductible to top rated nonprofits (GiveWell, etc). Both projects required significant continuity and operational support.</li></ul><h2>Closing remarks</h2><p>These stories illustrate some of the less-discussed ways a group can make an impact. The organization offers continuous contact points, provides guidance and operational assets, supports action, facilitates connections, events and projects, and offers a sense of direction and purpose to the community. We\u2019ve been able to build and then harness a sense of momentum: talented people who want to join the community because of the sense that amazing things are happening and lots of talented people are involved, something that we\u2019re hoping won\u2019t be affected by the post-FTX funding situation.</p><p>We hope that this helps people think differently about movement building and the role of C&amp;N groups, and that our stories can inspire other groups or group members. We\u2019re always looking for new projects and new ways to leverage our organizational assets to provide value, so please reach out if you have any ideas, comments or questions.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fne0lj45fovvg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefe0lj45fovvg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I\u2019ve recently had some discussion with CEA staff members who seem to agree with the \u201cmultiple touchpoints and action\u201d theory, so I don\u2019t think the \u201cfunnel model\u201d actually represents their current thinking</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "ezrah"}}, {"_id": "FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH", "title": "Save the date: EAGxVirtual 2023", "postedAt": "2023-05-23T14:33:51.426Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:57.75%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/rdpabcecprpu9meimwbl\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/ycibpjx5afmgurixiw9k 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/qcbaq3qh68perok9bdhh 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/oyzqfdtqqwpw2ztvubce 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/gc70fn13z9biue4ufxwa 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/ewj6knptwn5mjxraoojk 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/s0chzgloke1cenlqtu1w 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/tjznd0c2z28i2zng7wz5 1400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/qzgnk9xwugqjcuuo9ojv 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/b8vxbfe8dqd1tic2pqnz 1800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/by0sjfrjtkyhigzr3y1a 1920w\"></figure><h3><strong>EAGxVirtual 2023 will take place on November 17-19</strong></h3><p>Imagine interacting with EAs from over 70 countries and learning from their unique perspectives.

Our mission is to organize, train, and mentor students who are interested in advocating for animal welfare and pursuing impactful careers.</p><p><strong>The Problem</strong></p><p>Universities play a critical role in shaping the future of society and effecting systemic change. As future leaders, college students hold immense potential for driving progress and cultural transformation.</p><p>Unfortunately, animal advocacy in universities tends to be limited, sporadic, and unsustainable. The existing clubs on campuses operate independently with no coordination, and students are often hindered by a lack of time, training, experience, and support. Often, when active students graduate, their animal advocacy clubs become inactive. Much time and effort are wasted due to a lack of continuity and longevity of animal advocacy on campuses because students have to reinvent the proverbial wheel each time they restart a group.</p><p>One of the worst consequences of this is that much talent goes untapped due to insufficient education and inspiration for vegans to choose effective and impactful careers. The EA Community is working hard to reach this talent through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/\"><u>career advising</u></a> and community building.&nbsp; We believe that on-the-ground support for university animal rights clubs can complement EA recruitment efforts and can encourage vegan college students to engage with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/animal-welfare\"><u>critical</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/\"><u>intellectual</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/\"><u>work</u></a> being done by the EA community. We also think that community building work focused specifically on animal advocacy can help reach vegans who might not be as interested in other cause areas or the broader EA project.</p><p>Some animal advocacy organizations provide opportunities for students to volunteer, but enabling a strong campus movement is not the sole focus of these organizations. Having a single organization dedicated to providing infrastructure for campus activism would therefore fill a highly neglected niche in the current animal advocacy ecosystem.</p><p>Building a strong campus animal advocacy movement is also highly tractable. There are many vegan students out there who care deeply about these issues but do not feel they have the knowledge or resources to organize a group of their own. By providing the needed support, we can dramatically lower the barrier of entry to vegan advocacy and broaden the pool of talent going towards highly impactful careers.</p><p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p><p>Animal organizations often focus on training individual students rather than on building a sustainable vegan community. ASAP takes a more holistic approach. Our strategy for constructing a strong campus animal movement involves the following:</p><ul><li>Building a growing vegan community while investing in and strengthening individuals. This means conducting outreach to vegans who might like to become more active as advocates, and training vegans to conduct effective outreach to nonvegans.</li><li>Providing on-the-ground support to student groups.</li><li>Collecting thousands of signatures through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://utstudentsdeservebetter.com/\"><u>petitions</u></a>.</li><li>Streamlining the process of starting and running student animal advocacy groups.</li><li>Facilitating systemic and long-term educational frameworks, rather than just one-time events. We will provide educational seminars to empower vegans and educate the general student population, with a special emphasis on plant-based nutrition for future healthcare professionals.</li><li>Fighting speciesism and humane-washing while promoting plant-based options.</li></ul><p>By facilitating more effective student advocacy, we believe ASAP can help produce more influential vegans who push for change. We want to inspire the next Eric Adams, Cory Booker, Dr. Kim Williams, or Wayne Hsiung!</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/ogxegizqlb3ltsg0it8h\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/yrxxoq6lqvajyi6vwrj9 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/x2tp9hbcpl64vhuepyct 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/ffgcidnyrzlw5wmszsj6 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/wr1udfggw3io7xjyz93a 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/qdaks2whtlidbz08ptxj 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/h8n3ylwqzobdeys4fa7v 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/iitebut8h5calgqoz8il 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/urpfmd4wmx9nqyzak3zi 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/q8euixnd6z95fvxcwt0w 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PwdjcsoeuH9E9hB8g/dogpip8f8zdjqi18xnwb 1600w\"></p><p><strong>Case Study</strong></p><p><i>The Federalist Society</i> is a highly influential student and advocacy organization that promotes limited government and an originalist approach to interpreting the law.

In scenario #1, most humble/altruistic actors would probably push for making AGI corrigible and preserving option value (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theprecipice.com/\"><u>Ord 2020</u></a>, chapter 7;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/uk/\"><u>MacAskill 2022</u></a>, chapter 4;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRm9SXY3L3aZiOZcx09PfLrGjG-3G0F09zAdtGoDgHU/edit#heading=h.17f05s8r0u3q\"><u>Finnveden et al. 2022</u></a>). In scenario #2, there is no reason to assume that the actors triggering a future controlled by random-ish/superficial values will make longtermist goal preservation their priority (for instance, if Alice creates a paperclip-maximizer out of unconsciousness, it seems likely that she didn\u2019t carefully invest many resources into making sure it does maximize paperclips until the end of time; subjecting it to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/value-drift\"><u>value drift</u></a>).</p><p>On the contrary, malevolent actors seem dangerously likely to attempt to lock their values into an AGI system.

Their take in a nutshell:</p><blockquote><p>We expect significant competitive pressure around the development of AGI, including a significant amount of interest from state actors. As such, there is a large risk that advanced threat actors will hack organizations \u2014 that either develop AGI, provide critical supplies to AGI companies, or possess strategically relevant information\u2014 to gain a competitive edge in AGI development. Limiting the ability of advanced threat actors to compromise organizations working on AGI development and their suppliers could reduce existential risk by decreasing competitive pressures for AGI orgs and making it harder for incautious or uncooperative actors to develop AGI systems.</p></blockquote><p>Then, as Nova DasSarma suggests during&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/nova-dassarma-information-security-and-ai-systems/\"><u>her 80,000 hours interview</u></a>, the&nbsp;<i>\u201cdetection of bad actors within your organization and with access to your systems\u201d</i> may be a significant priority when it comes to infosec.

Scenario A seems more likely than B. While the current post does absolutely not claim that we should focus on B-like scenarios rather than A-like ones, we do not need to explicitly focus on malevolence to prevent events like A.

The messenger asked him to provide a demonstration of his skill to be brought back to the Pope, to which Giotto responded by drawing a red circle on a piece of paper with a flick of his wrist. The messenger, displeased, returned to his master along with the drawings of other artists. But then he started relaying the story to the Pope who, upon hearing how Giotto made what apparently looked like a perfect circle without the use of his arms nor a compass, <em>\"saw that Giotto must surpass greatly all the other painters of his time\"</em> and promptly hired him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6EQd9F2md4d7dGpT2/yj5ijtrabedj2js7uviv\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Fig. 1: Must have been a wild-ass circle then.</em></p>\n<p>When we say that someone is good at drawing, is it not as much a fact about the person's capability as our oft-illegible intuitive understanding of what drawing is?

And if that leads you to be able to demonstrate that you in fact can pass the test (or in some cases, figure out a novel way of doing it), then great!</p>\n<p>Look, the problem with Goodhart is that it's one-dimensional. You are trying to optimise <em>one</em> metric to the exclusion of all the implicit ones you actually care about, and often in a way that requires no human judgment whatsoever. But try ten or two hundred tests carefully arranged so that they overlap one another as little as possible. Does it still seem like it would be easy to game?</p>\n<p>Put in another way, if you can demonstrate being able to <em>\"summarise the GPT-4 report in 100 words\"</em> and <em>\"prove this infra-Bayesianism lemma\"</em> and a whole smorgasbord of other tiny skills, in a way that other alignment researchers deem acceptable over lots of interactions spread out over long periods of time, then wouldn't that at least count as evidence that you <em>do</em> in fact have some capability as a researcher yourself?</p>\n<p>(Also the core design allows for other interventions like <em>\"rejecting adversarial attempts via plain ol' human judgment\"</em> or <em>\"letting the extremely out-of-distribution attempt to redefine what the skill is about and create a new one around it instead\"</em>; cf.

Come back in a few hours to see a live demo.]</em></p>\n<p>Now, experience has shown me it's really difficult to get this idea across losslessly so let me articulate again what is going on here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>skill</code> refers to a particular ability, no matter the scale. EX: 'drawing', 'drawing realistic human eyes, front view'</li>\n<li>A <code>skill tree</code> or simply a <code>tree</code> is a set of skills arranged in a directed acyclic graph<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-7\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-7\">[7]</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>Every skill can thus have <code>subskills</code>, which are its prerequisites, or <code>superskills</code>, to which it is a prerequisite.</li>\n<li>Every skill has a (unique) <code>test</code> attached to it, which a <code>player</code> can attempt by submitting the type of media it is asking for. Sometimes, we can also say 'skill' in place of 'test'.</li>\n<li>When a player's attempt is approved by the skill's <code>council</code>, the player becomes a <code>member</code> of the skill. This allows them to interact with other members in the skill's <code>sanctum</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>creator</code> of a skill is usually the first person in its council, but since the skill's <code>leaderboard</code> magically determines who gets to be in the council every <code>cycle</code>, they may lose the ability to vote on players if they become inactive.</li>\n<li>A member may reattempt the skill any number of times, and they may earn <code>badges</code> for doing so a certain number of times. These badges are meant to be displayed in their profile or easily shared in other websites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The core UX loop is then this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6EQd9F2md4d7dGpT2/q8pemcwi78ibepmqqazo\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Fig. 2: Apologies for the non-alignment-related example.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a skill</li>\n<li>Submit your attempt of its test via text / image / video / etc.</li>\n<li>Wait for its council to approve you</li>\n<li>If approved, get added to the skill's sanctum</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notice how this is different from simply having a lecture on the thing? You have to be able to do the skill first, at least once, to a level that is acceptable to the members. Only then are you able to start your <em>true</em> journey to mastering the skill, by getting access to everyone's accumulated knowledge about it and then doing it repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Another thing to notice: your success now depends on the quality and the particular structure of the subskills. If you can't pass a particular test, either the skill breakdown was crapshoot, or someone lied to you about your performance in one of the prerequisites<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-8\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-8\">[8]</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2>How to (mis)use skill trees for fun and profit</h2>\n<p>Of course, what I just described is the garden variety path that's really just useful for learning small <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HZuAT2sGbDbasdjy5/the-multi-tower-study-strategy\">Jenga skills</a>  like, say, the entirety of math and the math-heavy sciences. But the underlying structure is just a gated DAG! Which means, we can use it for things which aren't necessarily as interdependent.</p>\n<h3>Exhibit A: Book tracker</h3>\n<p>Like reading a textbook. <em>[AN: I'll turn this into a link once I've created the skill tree for it.]</em></p>\n<p>The na\u00efve approach is probably to just create a chain of chapters, possibly respecting dependencies if the textbook is structured like that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6EQd9F2md4d7dGpT2/dzcumwtjteqzab5xegr4\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Fig. 3: Here, every node has a test that goes something like \"Summarise the chapter in 100 words or less\" or simply \"Tick this box labeled 'I Promise I Really Did Finish the Chapter'\".</em></p>\n<p>This works, I guess. And in single-player mode where you just approve your own attempts, Blackbelt could probably pass as granular tracker for your reading so that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cumc876woKaZLmQs5/lessons-i-ve-learned-from-self-teaching#Completing_The_Whole_Textbook_Is_Usually_a_Big_Waste_of_Time__Please_Don_t_Do_It\">you don't have to complete entire books</a>. Maybe a forcing function for you to summarise or take notes on what you've read, if you require text input in the test?</p>\n<p>But wait, there's more! If we wanted to be extra about it, we could also create a dependency graph of exercises in the book, like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6EQd9F2md4d7dGpT2/l9d7nrf3vafem4ofpmm1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Fig. 4: Each chapter can have a subtree of exercises like this, or the exercises themselves can take a life of their own and become prerequisites of other skills.</em></p>\n<p>A similar thing can work for papers or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/KGYLvTqFiFE2CpHfJ/p/2GxhAyn9aHqukap2S#I_focused_on__catching_up__to_other_thinkers\">even the Sequences</a>, and if I can fool enough people into using this we can probably start distilling entire fields into small collections of their least-common-denominator exercises.</p>\n<h3>Exhibit B: Testing for 'fit'</h3>\n<p>Suppose we have a Practical ML for Alignment skill tree but we don't want capabilities researchers benefitting from it. Is there a way to do this using only the tools we have at our disposal?</p>\n<p>One way to do it would be for the council to manually veto players who submit attempts early on in the tree. This would be tedious, but it would work. There's nothing in the system that says you have to filter people based on the test<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-9\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-9\">[9]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>However, this would <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/\">complect</a> the skill with another implicit target. So the better approach would be to factor out this hidden dependency by making, say, the root of an entire Alignment Fit skill tree be a prerequisite subskill for one of the ML tree's basic skills.</p>\n<p>So either this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6EQd9F2md4d7dGpT2/fnv7rh0rosotfvhonksh\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Fig. 5: This is the risk-aversion-maximised skill tree. Also note that the Alignment Fit tree can be replaced by trees for already-existing courses like AGI Safety Fundamentals.</em></p>\n<p>Or one could intersperse the skills between the levels of the ML tree:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6EQd9F2md4d7dGpT2/hybs1sev8fuhki2mtzul\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Fig. 6: There is a redundancy here. Can you spot it?</em></p>\n<p>Now, what kinds of tests could possibly fill such an Alignment Fit tree? Unfortunately, my mind is too small to contain the non-obvious, definitely-not-<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hxGEKxaHZEKT4fpms/our-phyg-is-not-exclusive-enough\">phygish</a> tests so I'll just state what I can come up with in three minutes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>put 'alignment researcher' on your LinkedIn profile</li>\n<li>donate some percentage of your income to an alignment org</li>\n<li>book an off-the-cuff interview with a random high-ranking member of the ton</li>\n<li>complete an in-person fellowship in a major EA hub</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A difficult-to-Goodhart option might just be an open-ended <em>\"Prove you're not going to turn around and become a capabilities researcher\"</em> test, although again I haven't thought of a way to do these things obliquely, as they probably are best done.</p>\n<h3>Exhibit C: Alignment itself</h3>\n<p>Creating a skill requires the author to put in at least one successful attempt for two reasons: a) we want the skill tree to track what's achievable in real life as closely as possible, and b) so players can have an example they can measure their progress against. But sometimes, there are tests of skill no one can pass yet but we all expect will be done in the near-future. An example of that would be to <em>\"win a gold medal at the 2024 Olympics tennis mixed-doubles category\"</em> \u2013 I mean, what better test of skill than the Olympics itself?</p>\n<p>One way to capture these yet-to-be skills is to turn them into <code>tournaments</code> (but that's a story for another time...)</p>\n<p>Another solution would be to have a superskill sitting at the top of a giant skill tree with a test that goes something like: <em>\"Convince these top 3-5 alignment researchers that your plan is going to work.\"</em></p>\n<p>Of course, this probably won't solve alignment \ud83e\udd1e but it does point at the possibility of reducing the massive space of actions available to researchers to just <em>transmuting the subskills underneath until you're good enough to write a solid proposal</em>. And since there's no permanent cost to failing an attempt other than time and effort<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-10\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-10\">[10]</a></sup>, you can just keep trying, supported by infrastructure that <em>accretes</em> your labour instead of letting it go to waste every time.</p>\n<h2>As we may test</h2>\n<p>Like every nerd who has ever touched a computer, I am a bit too familiar with the limitations of what our machines can do.</p>\n<p>When I was 16, I came across the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game\">original Oculus Kickstarter</a>, skipped a dozen lunch meals, and bought myself their first development kit. Three years later, I doubled down on VR/AR and started my own company, which ended up creating an extensive bespoke crew training program for one of the largest airlines in my country.</p>\n<p>...even though AlexNet came out at around the same time, so in another Everett branch I could have had 11 years of prep for transformers instead lol</p>\n<p>But anyway my point is, seeing those jagged lines two inches in front of my retinas was enough to convince me that the way we interface with computers right now is <em>horribly deficient</em>. We have at least 17 different sensory modalities<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-11\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-11\">[11]</a></sup> that our meat-brains seamlessly integrate into one coherent picture of the world, and yet we have chosen to collapse all those into not even a handful of information channels, like fremen dropping sand in their own eyes to give their opponents a fighting chance.</p>\n<p>LLMs on the other hand (when they're not showing symptoms of wanting world domination) promise a world where everyone can get personalised education on demand, about any topic, as deep as you want. In the absence of the x-risk their descendants will pose, they promise us enlightenment ad infinitum. But it is a <em>lonely</em> enlightenment, a planet of cognitive islands, insipid fantasies increasingly and irrevocably disjoint from one another. After all, why compromise your AI-generated luxury gay space digital utopia by polluting it with other people's preferences?</p>\n<p>I can't quite put a finger on it, but it gives me chills to meditate on the fact that 26 years after we've been permanently unseated as the best chess players in the universe, the game not only lives on but <em>is more popular than ever</em>.</p>\n<p>I'd like to think we would always care about the joy of mastery even if we become obsoleted by our creations and start genetically modifying ourselves to absolute pandemonium. That we would care about leaving a mark, about passing on our private slice of reality to other minds in some shape or form. Blackbelt is just one step out of thousands in that direction\u2013a new interface to our precious machines\u2013and in particular it only deals with the tiny, tiny part of the human experience that covers the eternal drama between the Master and their Student.</p>\n<p>Yet there is still richness in there that I pray we'll have enough time to tap.</p>\n<p>Or as Vannevar Bush lovingly put it for me \ud83d\ude07 in 1945:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[With Blackbelt] the inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2>Appendix: Q &amp; A</h2>\n<h3>Q: Won't this also mass-produce capabilities researchers?</h3>\n<p>A: Not quite, because the test-based access to important resources means this is non-infohazardous by default. Again, you can just reject people you think would do a 180\u00b0 later on and join Team Capabilities, or have them go through alignment-related tasks by including them as prerequisites.</p>\n<p>Another argument I haven't quite seen made in the wild is scale: there's exponentially more resources out there for capabilities researchers that inherit the prestige of major labs and universities. I doubt this tiny little experiment will make a dent in that even if it grew to have 100k users.</p>\n<p>Lastly, even if we do start getting the attention of capabilities folks, funnelling them into alignment-fit-gated skill trees where their position is locally unpopular might just convince them to take a second look at this whole notkilleveryone-ist business.</p>\n<h3>Q: How dare you discuss \u201cagreeing on the same basics\u201d! We\u2019re in a pre-paradigmatic field, no one knows what the basics are!</h3>\n<p>A: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h4Wct9gsLsNk9bAhv/no-evidence-as-a-valley-of-bad-rationality\">You almost never start with zero knowledge</a>. We might not know everything that is common to agent foundations research and mechanistic interpretability, but we do know some things! The real question is: <em>do we have a systematic process to tease out that commonality?</em> Arguments of the form <em>\"it is too early; we might get it wrong\"</em> severely underestimate how much reflexivity and self-correction is possible with a little more agency in the part of humans who are <em>just plain trying to make things work</em>.</p>\n<p>(Plus, it would be <em>extremely</em> weird if alignment were naturally anti-inductive i.e. that such basics are inherently impossible to draw up due to the nature of the domain itself, wouldn't it?)</p>\n<p>We really need a way to catch up to the rate of progress in capabilities; I don't see a world where we live but never manage to intersect that God of Straight Lines somewhere. I'm not saying Blackbelt would be the end-all-be-all solution to this problem, but it is <em>one</em> possible solution, and to the extent that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zp6wG5eQFLGWwcG6j/focus-on-the-places-where-you-feel-shocked-everyone-s\">this is a ball being dropped</a> even in a supposedly pre-paradigmatic field, and to the extent that such an explicit enumeration of basic skills is possible at all (otherwise, what would the hypothetical future textbook on alignment even contain?), it seems worth trying now rather than much later.</p>\n<h3>Q: Isn't gatekeeping bad? Are we the baddies?</h3>\n<p>A: The optimal amount of gatekeeping isn't zero, no. You would probably agree that the median toddler should not be admitted to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, so you yourself are swimming in social institutions forged in the very fires of gatekept hell.</p>\n<p>I like to think of Blackbelt's filters as <em>soft</em> gatekeeping: if you feel that you are unfairly being kept out of a skill because of some factor unrelated to your performance, then you can always create your own with the exact same prerequisites. This is what makes Blackbelt <em>alive</em>: disagreements about structure and process track disagreements about models of expertise<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-12\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-12\">[12]</a></sup>, and so striking out on your own is a primitive\u2013and richly supported\u2013action.</p>\n<h3>Q: Why would I use this? Why would anyone use this?</h3>\n<p>You're right. We can spend all day talking about \"streamlining practice\" or \"the importance of producing public goods\" or \"making things a bit easier and more legible for everyone\", but to be honest none of those are really compelling to the vast majority of people.</p>\n<p>Hell, if you're already a well-oiled research-printing machine, why waste time helping newbies who might even compete with you for LTFF grants later on?</p>\n<p>My honest answer is this: <strong>only use Blackbelt if it's fun for you</strong>. This very website is proof that a small, dispersed cabal of nerds can get together and make something nice for a change, not because there's a pot of gold waiting on the other side\u2013although we shouldn't rule that out just yet!\u2013but because <em>we just fucking want to poke our noses into everything</em>.</p>\n<p>Building a giant, interactable repository of the world's procedural knowledge doesn't require buy-in from every single person on the planet, only that there's enough people out there who are intrinsically motivated to answer <em>what it means to be good at something</em>. All the bells and whistles are just there to make that process less inconvenient<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-13\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-13\">[13]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>And if that process nudges the logistic success curve ever so slightly to the good side, such that there's ever so slightly a better chance of my loved ones living past this decade, such that the odds of fun as we know it surviving far into the future ever so slightly increases, then all the skipped meals and sleepless nights would have been worth it.</p>\n<h3>Q: So basically, you're trying to make expert knowledge legible. Is that not infohazardous by default? Where's your security mindset??</h3>\n<p>A: Let me do you one better and tell you the glaring security flaw in my proposal: if all it takes to prove my skill is to submit some kind of text/image/video, then I can use your sufficiently large, publicly available skill tree to train an RL agent on all sorts of tasks and thereby contribute massively to capabilities research.</p>\n<p>I believe this exploit is AGI-complete since it would require fooling humans over long periods of time in a variety of orthogonal-by-design situations. And even if we just use it to train some kind of research-producing agent\u2013contrary to an increasing number of people in the grapevine I am not averse to using subcritical AI to speed up alignment research\u2013this will only become a problem when we're extremely close to the deadline. I'm hoping we'd have more powerful interpretability tools by then (perhaps fomented by this very project even??)</p>\n<p>Also, let's not rule out just yet tail-swallowing solutions like creating increasingly elaborate tests-of-humanity then making them prerequisites of important skills!</p>\n<h3>Q: Won\u2019t this exacerbate the current centralisation of decision-making power that grantmakers currently have? (see <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FdHRkGziQviJ3t8rQ/discussion-about-ais-funding-fb-transcript\">Akash's post</a>)</h3>\n<p>A: Yes and no. Yes, because the more the community converges on really good tests that more advanced skills would depend on, the harder it would be to provide an alternative route<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-14\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-14\">[14]</a></sup>. But also, Blackbelt will allow us to decouple those highly important tests from being stuck inside grantmakers' heads, and at the very least provide a way for people who cannot network at EA Global events a chance to prove their mettle.</p>\n<h3>Q: Are you aware of this old post about this exact same\u2013</h3>\n<p>A: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pqcMyeALASb4d7KE8/a-gamification-of-education-a-modest-proposal-based-on-the\">Yup</a>. Unfortunately, I only learned about it two-thirds into writing this, so...</p>\n<h3>Q: Can't you just do the thing directly? Why go through all this scaffolding?</h3>\n<p>Q: There are three reasons to this:</p>\n<p>The first is, like I mentioned above, Nate Soares has pointed out that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ujM6KBN4CyABCdJt/ai-alignment-researchers-don-t-seem-to-stack\">alignment researchers don't seem to stack</a>. Doing just more of the same thing we're doing right now doesn't seem to be a way out of that pit, whereas forcing people to explicitly think about the dependencies of their work might.</p>\n<p>The second reason is that, while we don't have much time left, we do have some time left for medium-term solutions, especially since I expect most of our important alignment homework will be done near the deadline. If Blackbelt manages to make a 10x bigger pool of researchers slightly more ready for the humanity's first critical try, or alternatively makes our top researchers 10x more ready<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-15\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-15\">[15]</a></sup>, then it would have all been worth it.</p>\n<p>At the very least, having battle-tested, exhaustively pruned skill trees ready for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/QualyThe/status/1656030054353174529?s=20\">clones of von Neumann</a> to train on might give them that tiny edge they need to save us all from damnation.</p>\n<p>Lastly, people who say these things probably undervalue the role of infrastructure in allowing people to do their best work. Individually, the researchers at Xerox PARC might have done some good work outside the lab, but it was only in that particular place in that particular set of circumstances that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/xerox-parc\">they were able to shine brilliantly</a>.</p>\n<p>Most of us cannot willpower our way into being the greatest versions of ourselves; the least we can do is to provide each other a supportive environment where we can light each others matches.</p>\n<h3>Q: What about existing experts? Surely you don't expect someone like John Wentworth to do matrix multiplication exercises.</h3>\n<p>A: I have thought about this issue a lot and it's a thorny one. A lot of the value you get from this project comes from seeing concrete, undeniable examples by real experts of how something should be done, and how those <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qwdupkFd6kmeZHYXy/build-small-skills-in-the-right-order\">tiny examples can slowly build up to something grand</a>.</p>\n<p>The best compromise I managed to come up with is to allow creators to invite people as <code>honorary members</code>, letting them skip all the prerequisites<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-16\" id=\"fnref-CGmaTgckDRBoGDGgc-16\">[16]</a></sup> but marking those unrealised subskills in a special way so that they can do them later at their own leisure if they want to brush up on fundamentals or help struggling novices.</p>\n<p>Hell, in the limit of this project successfully becoming a Schelling point for all sorts of upskilling attempts, maybe them coming down from on high can let us learn how to do the same basics in completely new ways.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Thanks to @lazymaplekoi, @notjapao, Nobu, Abstract Fairy, Pradyu, and the AI Australia and New Zealand community (esp.

In other words, I think the expected value of these things is perhaps slightly above zero. But my expected value for them is sufficiently close to zero that I don't feel great about my donations being used for them.</p></blockquote><p>I also feel like decreasing the consumption of animals is positive, but suppose I am biassed towards overweighting the identifiable decrease in severe pain caused to factory-farmed animals. I guess welfarist approaches (e.g. corporate campaigns for chicken welfare) are more robustly beneficial than abolitionist ones (e.g. promotion of veganism), but both <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#momentum-vs.-complacency-from-welfare-reforms\"><u>arguably decrease</u></a>&nbsp;the consumption of animals, which can be either beneficial or harmful.</p><p>In any case, I plan to continue following a whole-food plant-based diet<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc7zfvmcq7sg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc7zfvmcq7sg\">[7]</a></sup></span>, because:</p><ul><li>I would say it makes me healthier and happier, and therefore more productive.<ul><li>It makes me happier not only due to improved health, but also because causing severe pain to factory-farmed&nbsp;animals would feel pretty bad.</li><li>Based on <a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers/\"><u>these</u></a>&nbsp;data from the Welfare Footprint Project, supposing each broiler provides 2 kg of edible meat, and that the elasticity of production with respect to consumption is 0.5<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref189lwnra0hg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn189lwnra0hg\">[8]</a></sup></span>, eating 100 g of chicken causes 75.4 min (= 50.27*60/2*0.1*0.5) of disabling pain if it is produced in a conventional scenario, and 25.9 min (= 17.26*60/2*0.1*0.5) if in a reformed one<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftytx2emfm4c\"><sup><a href=\"#fntytx2emfm4c\">[9]</a></sup></span>.</li></ul></li><li>I guess (hope?)

Overall, boycott-itarianism, only eating animals which have sufficiently high welfare, seems better.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting the impact of a random person on farmed animals can apparently be neutralised at a very low cost.

On some accounts, reference classes are the best starting point for forecasts, even though they often feel unintuitive. To my knowledge, nobody has previously attempted this for risks from superhuman AGI. This is to a large degree because superhuman AGI is in a real sense unprecedented. Yet there are some reference classes or at least analogies people have cited to think about the impacts of superhuman AI, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23447596/artificial-intelligence-agi-openai-gpt3-existential-risk-human-extinction\"><u>impacts of</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/superintelligence-preorder/\"><u>human intelligence</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/podcast/2020/01/superintelligence-already-rules-the-world\"><u>corporations</u></a>, or, increasingly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712\"><u>the most advanced current AI systems</u></a>.</p><p>My high-level takeaway is that different ways of integrating and interpreting reference classes generate priors on AGI-caused human extinction by 2070 anywhere between 1/10000 and 1/6 (mean of ~0.03%-4%). Reference classes offer a non-speculative case for concern with AGI-related risks. On this account, AGI risk is not a case of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/pascal-s-mugging\"><u>Pascal\u2019s mugging</u></a>, but most reference classes do not support greater-than-even odds of doom. The reference classes I look at generate a prior for AGI control over current human resources anywhere between 5% and 60% (mean of ~16-26%). The latter is a distinctive result of the reference class exercise: the expected degree of AGI control over the world looks to far exceed the odds of human extinction by a sizable margin on these priors. The extent of existential risk, including permanent disempowerment, should fall somewhere between these two ranges.</p><p>This effort is a rough, non-academic exercise and requires a number of subjective judgment calls. At times I play a bit fast and loose with the exact model I am using; the work lacks the ideal level of theoretical grounding. Nonetheless, I think the appropriate prior is likely to look something like what I offer here. I encourage intuitive updates and do not recommend these priors as the final word.</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>I collect sets of events that superhuman AGI-caused extinction or takeover would be plausibly representative of,&nbsp;<i>ex ante</i>. Interpreting and aggregating them requires a number of data collection decisions, the most important of which I detail here:</p><ol><li>For each reference class, I collect benchmarks for the likelihood of one or two things:&nbsp;<ol><li>Human extinction</li><li>AI capture of humanity\u2019s available resources.</li></ol></li><li>Many risks and reference classes are properly thought of as annualised risks (e.g., the yearly chance of a major AI-related disaster or extinction from asteroid), but some make more sense as risks from a one-time event (e.g., the chance that the creation of a major AI-related disaster or a given asteroid hit causes human extinction). For this reason, I aggregate three types of estimates (see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YKTKRumtlheK_9Dv9ECKwwoTeSG3RNcs6qUSajzqDw/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>full document</u></a> for the latter two types of estimates):<ol><li>50-Year Risk (e.g. risk of a major AI disaster in 50 years)</li><li>10-Year Risk (e.g. risk of a major AI disaster in 10 years)</li><li>Risk Per Event (e.g. risk of a major AI disaster per invention)</li></ol></li><li>Given that there are dozens or hundreds of reference classes, I summarise them in a few ways:<ol><li>Minimum and maximum</li><li>Weighted arithmetic mean (i.e., weighted average)<ol><li>I \u201cwinsorise\u201d, i.e. replace 0 or 1 with the next-most extreme value.</li><li>I intuitively downweight some reference classes. For details on weights, see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YKTKRumtlheK_9Dv9ECKwwoTeSG3RNcs6qUSajzqDw/edit#bookmark=id.zgjx34vzgh6\"><u>methodology</u></a>.</li></ol></li><li>Weighted&nbsp;<a
