I had interacted with Rotary Clubs many times in a few projects I coordinated in Latin America and personally. There's a lot to learn from them, especially the way Rotary builds communities, and their influence in some is very interesting (in a few Brazilian states, they partnered with courts to donate a % of fines to communities).

I was a member of my local Rotaract club for years until I eventually aged out of their 18-30 age limit. I think I actually at one point got us to send some donations from one of our events to the Against Malaria Foundation. Overall, it was a great experience, although I ended up not joining Rotary Club proper later, mostly because I moved away from my hometown and didn't know anyone in the Rotary Club of my current city.</p><p>I do agree that EA can learn a lot from Rotary as a highly successful organization and community and I'm glad to see someone else mention it here.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Joseph_Chu"}}]
