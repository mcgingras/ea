This addresses barriers to family planning access.</li><li>In 2022, MHI tested and refined their training program and materials through small pilots in Ghana. Preliminary data showed increased counseling and contraceptive uptake.</li><li>A larger 6-week pilot completed in October 2023 reached 50 providers and 20,000 clients across 6 hospitals. Results on contraceptive uptake are expected in December.</li><li>If pilot results are strong, MHI aims to scale up through partnership with the Ghana Health Service, working towards government adoption of their model.</li><li>MHI estimates averting disability-adjusted life years for under $100 each, competitive with top cost-effective charities. Government adoption could lower this to $34 per DALY.</li><li>As a post-seed organization, MHI faces funding challenges, but believes EA donations offer flexibility and trust compared to government grants. Different donation amounts could fund specific program components.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
