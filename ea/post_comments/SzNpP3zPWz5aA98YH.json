It's not that I think all governance overhead is bad \u2013 e.g., I think boards are quite essential if the board members are &nbsp;actually engaged and committed to an org's mission. Also, I think EA orgs should give regular updates where the leadership communicates transparently the reasons why they did what they did, speaking real talk instead of putting up a PR front. (I think there's a lot of room for improvement here!)</p><p>*It's not like governance safeguards will magically change people who don't have the required qualities into competent good actors. I concede that there's a lot of truth to \"power (without accountability) corrupts.\" So, one might argue \"even good leaders may turn bad if they aren't accountable to anyone.\" However, that seems like a definitional dispute. As a \"good leader,\" you'd be terribly scared of mission-drift and becoming corrupted, so you'd seek out a way to stay accountable to people whose judgment you respect. If you're not terribly scared of these things, or if you're the only person in the world whose judgment you respect, then you're not a good leader in the first place. Processes work well when they're designed by a founder (or CEO) who's highly committed to the org's mission and who has a vision. Stuff that's externally imposed on people rarely has its desired effects. If we want to reap the fruits of highly impactful organizations or institutions, we have to be prepared to give some founders or CEOs (the right ones!) a cushion of initial trust.

Actually, at least in the EU and UK, whistleblowers pointing out things like fraud or illegal stuff are protected by the law.

Also, in some countries there are regulations what whistleblower protections you should have in place - I assume orgs do follow it where it applies.&nbsp;<br>2. Many orgs where it makes sense have some policies/systems in this direction, but not necessarily under the name of 'whistleblower protection'. &nbsp;<br>3. Majority of EA orgs are orgs which are quite small. I don't think if you have a team of e.g. four people, having<i> a whistleblower protection scheme &nbsp;</i>works the same way as in org with four hundred people. In my view, what actually often makes more sense, is having external contacts for all sort of issues - e.g. the community health team. &nbsp;<br>4. Overall, I think often the worst situation is when you have a system which <i>seemingly &nbsp;</i>does something, but actually does not. For example: a campus <i>mental health support system</i> which is actually not qualified to help with mental health problems, but keeps track who reached out to them, is probably worse than nothing.<br><br>My bottom line is something like &nbsp;... <i>'whistleblower protection scheme' &nbsp;</i>may be good to implement in some cases, and some orgs have them.

Whistleblower incentive mechanisms meanwhile seem much more worthwhile to investigate, because such a mechanism could be operated by a small centralized function without adding any new bureaucracy to existing organisations.

But knowing what we know now, I'd indeed be worried about a hypothetical world where FTX hadn't collapsed! Where Sam's vision of things and his attitude to risks gets to have such a huge degree of influence within EA.

Will said he was busy and would forward it to his team. I said 'please reach out if you have any more questions' and never heard from anyone again. It won't be hard to come up with concrete experiments/ideas for a specific context/organisation/task/team but I'm not sure why it would be productive for me to do that publically rather than at the request of a specific organisation/team.

All of that at a time when the companionship is still mostly just in Rivendell planning for future moves (and while Sauron is getting ready to kill lots of humans, elves, and dwarves).<br><br>Of course, the communists <i>also </i>claimed that the world is broken when they tried to convince more people to join them and seek influence to make the world better. So, I concede that it's not <i>a priori</i> unreasonable to consider it urgent and morally pressing, when you come across a group of self-proclaimed world-improvers on an upwards trajectory (in terms of real-world influence), to scrutinize if they have their head together and have the integrity needed to in expectation change things for the better rather than for the worse.</p><p>The world is complicated; it matters to <i>get things right</i>.

So, I'd say it's on you to make an attempt to at least present EA in a fair light \u2013 though I of course understand that, as a <i>critic</i> of EA, it's reasonable that this isn't your main priority.

I have strong feelings that social norms &nbsp;or norms of discourse should never disincentivize trying to do more than the very minimum one can get away with as an apathetic person or as a jerk. For example, I'm annoyed when people punish others for honesty in cases where it would have been easy to tell a lie and look better. Likewise, I find it unfair if having the stated goal to make the future better for all sentient beings is somehow taken to imply \"Oh, you care for the future of <i>all </i>humans, and even animals? That's suspicious \u2013 we're definitely going to apply extra scrutiny towards you.\" Meanwhile, AI capabilities companies continue to scale up compute and most of the world is busy discussing soccer or what not.

If not, asking EA to reach it is an isolated demand for rigour, and creates terrible incentives.\" Like - what follows?</p></blockquote><p>EAs who are serious about their stated goals have the most incentive of anyone to help the EA movement get its act together. The idea that \"it's important to have good institutions\" is something EA owes <i>to outsiders</i> is what seems weird to me. Doesn't this framing kind of suggest that EAs couldn't motivate themselves to try their best if it weren't for \"institutional safeguards.\" What a depressing view of humans, that they can only act according to their stated ideals if they're watched at every step and have to justify themselves to critics!<br><br>EAs have discussions about governance issues EA-internally, too. It's possible (in theory) that EA has as many blindspots as Zoe thinks, but it's also possible that Zoe is wrong (or maybe it's something in between). Either way, I don't think &nbsp;anyone in EA, nor \"EA\" as a movement, has any obligation to engage in great detail with Zoe's criticisms if they don't think that's useful.* (Not to say that they don't consider the criticism useful \u2013 my impression is that there are EAs on both sides, and that's fine!)</p><p>If a lot of people agree with Zoe's criticism, that creates more social pressure to answer to her points. That's probably a decent mechanism to determine what an \"appropriate\" level of minimally-mandatory engagement should be \u2013 though it depends a bit whether the social pressure comes from well-intentioned people who reasonably informed about the issues or whether some kind of \"let's all pile on these stupid EAs\" dynamics emerge. (So far, the dynamics seem healthy to me, but if EA keeps getting trashed in the media, then this could change.)</p><p>*(I guess if someone's impression of EA was \"group of people who want to turn all available resources into happiness simulations regardless of what existing people want for their future,\" then it would be reasonable for them to go like, \"wtf, if that's your movement's plan, I'm concerned!\" However, that would be a strawman impression of EA. Most EAs endorse moral views according to which individual preferences matter and \"eudaimonia\" is basically \"everyone gets what they most want.\" Besides, even the few hedonist utilitarians [or negative utilitarians] within EA think preferences matter and argue for being nice to others with different views.)</p><blockquote><p>The questions should just be - are these actions beneficial in helping EA be more impactful?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SzNpP3zPWz5aA98YH/if-ea-community-building-could-be-net-negative-what-follows?commentId=7nc3eJ8BCchaLjokK#fnv5sf11g09ap\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp;Are there other ways of achieving the same goals better than what's proposed?

Still, in the end, it's up to EAs themselves to decide which criticisms to engage with at length and where it maybe isn't so productive.</p><blockquote><p>For example, they might want someone more capable to deliver the ring, and not just the person who happened to inherit it from his cousin.</p></blockquote><p>In the books (or the movies), this part is made easy by having a kind and wise old wizard \u2013 who wouldn't consider going with Gandalf's advice a defensible decision-procedure!&nbsp;<br><br>In reality, \"who gets to wield power\" is more complicated. But one important point in my original comment was that EA doesn't even have that much power, and <i>no ring </i>(nor anything analogous to it \u2013 that's a place where the analogy breaks). So, it's a bit weird to subject EA to as much scrutiny as would be warranted if they were about to enshrine their views into the constitution of a world government. All longtermist EA is really trying to do right now is trying to ensure that people won't be dead soon so that there'll be <i>the option</i> to talk governance and so on <i>later on</i>. (BTW, I do expect EAs to write up proposals for visions of AI-aided ideal governance at some point. I think that's good to have and good to discuss. I don't see it as the main priority right now because EAs haven't yet made any massive bids for power in the world. Besides, it's not like whatever the default would otherwise be has much justification. And you could even argue that EAs have done the most so far out of any group promoting discourse about important issues related to fair governance of the future.) &nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "7nc3eJ8BCchaLjokK", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "L8yKoTa6tbiYhWuQz", "postedAt": "2023-01-04T19:56:03.332Z", "postId": "SzNpP3zPWz5aA98YH", "htmlBody": "<p>I feel pretty confused by this and would love better estimates of the actual amount of money that was \"lost\" in the FTX situation.

But people who have a lot of power and influence and funding also face incentives to maintain a status quo that they benefit from. EA is no different, and people seeking to do good are not exempt from these kinds of incentives. And EAs who are serious about things should acknowledge that they are subject to these incentives, as well as the possibility that one reason outsiders might be speaking up about this is because they think EAs aren't taking the problem seriously enough. The benefit of the outside critic is NOT that EAs have some special obligation towards them (though, in this case, if your actions directly impact them, then they are a relevant stakeholder that is worth considering), but because they are somewhat removed and may be able to provide some insight into an issue that is harder for you to see when you are deeply surrounded by other EAs and people who are directly mission / value-aligned.<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>What a depressing view of humans, that they can only act according to their stated ideals if they're watched at every step and have to justify themselves to critics!</p></blockquote><p>I think this goes too far, I don't think this is the claim being made.

There are also people who disagree with some longtermists vision of the future, there are people who think EA's general approach is bad, and it could follow that those people will think $$ on EA causes are poorly spent and should be spent in [some different way]. There are also people who think EA is a talent drain away from important issues. Of course, this doesn't interact with the extent to which EA is \"obligated\" to respond, especially because many of these takes aren't great. I agree that there's no obligation, per se. But the claim is \"outsiders are permitted to ASK you to fix your problems\", not that you are <strong>obligated </strong>to respond (though subsequent sentences RE: \"I can demand\" or \"you should\" might be a source of miscommunication).</p><p>I guess the way I see it is something like - EA isn't obligated to respond to any outsider criticism, but if you want to be taken seriously by these outsiders who have these concerns, if you want buy-in from people who you claim to be working with and working for, if you don't want people at social entrepreneurship symposiums seriously considering questions like \"<a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a42330166/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fallout/#:~:text=Is%20the%20way%20to%20do%20the%20most%20good%20to%20destroy%20effective%20altruism%3F\">Is the way to do the most good to destroy effective altruism?</a>\", then it could be in your best interest to take good-faith criticisms and concerns seriously, even if the attitude comes across poor, because it likely reflects some barrier in you achieving your goals.

Also, I find that talking with midcareer professionals it's much easier to mention donations rather than switching their career. So I think that more emphasis on donations from people of modest means could help EA diversify with respect to age.</p>", "parentCommentId": "8BqCgz7LLRvL7wdNR", "user": {"username": "Denkenberger"}}, {"_id": "oHxAjCWqcmqG2sjkz", "postedAt": "2023-01-07T18:38:06.303Z", "postId": "SzNpP3zPWz5aA98YH", "htmlBody": "<p>I find it implausible that EA movement building is net-negative (&lt;10%).
