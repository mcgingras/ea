This is the idea that there is a 1 to 1 relationship with overwork and burnout. Our society can oversimplify burnout as a problem with overwork, therefore, take a break and overcome your burnout. Research done by Christina Maslach points to there being feelings of efficacy and cynicism that also play a role in our burnout.

And then what do we do?</p></blockquote><p>Hannah:</p><blockquote><p>Like, every time you get a unit of mental health from the wellness factory and you\u2019re like, \u201cImmediately distribute to impact!\u201d then you\u2019re basically almost empty, or like a little bit in the red all of the time. And that\u2019s just very risky and costly. It\u2019s obviously painful, but it\u2019s also going to put you at risk for burnout and for needing to take longer breaks to basically recover and care for yourself. [...] This is a hard one though. It feels <i>so</i> compelling. And the thing I remind myself of is that that feeling of compellingness is simply an incomplete description of what\u2019s true. It does feel really compelling to use 100% of my capacity, and I do really feel that urge to allocate capacity whenever it shows up. But if and when I ever do this \u2014 which I do occasionally try versions of it \u2014 I end up feeling the effects, and it is not preferable. It\u2019s almost like I have to tell myself, \u201cYou\u2019re not well calibrated on this. You think that you want zero slack and ease, but you want an amount.\u201d</p><p>[...] But what I recognise is that at times when I\u2019ve packed my schedule as full as the numbers allow, I end up being, I think, a less thoughtful therapist. I think there is a risk of resenting the work, which I very much do not want to do. I actually genuinely love therapy and being a therapist.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I feel like it\u2019s probably the case that there are a bunch of examples in other contexts where systems need slack: like businesses that have budgets where they have to build in 10% budget wiggle room so that they don\u2019t overspend or something. I wonder if having those models or those examples closer to hand would help me be like, \u201cThis is like an established pattern in the world, where no one thinks that businesses can run at 100% capacity and never have issues. They all choose to do this thing called slack. And maybe we should just trust \u2014 including for-profits who want to maximise profit \u2014 that they are doing what\u2019s best for the company or for the aim.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The other big [indicator of how to know when perfectionist tendencies go from helpful to unhelpful] would be if it\u2019s costing you in ways that are greater than the benefit of the marginal perfecting. The sorts of costs I\u2019m thinking of are around time and opportunity costs, and also particularly losing clarity on what does and doesn\u2019t need to be perfected. An analogy here is frugality: if you find yourself overspending on a lot of things, and you\u2019re like, \u201cI need to make a change,\u201d then the corrective is not \u201cbuy nothing going forward\u201d; it\u2019s about conserving your resources so that you can use money to purchase more value, and not use it when it doesn\u2019t purchase more value.</p><p><strong>I think perfectionism or optimising or things in this neighbourhood are the same, where we want to retain the option of judiciously applying the marginal rigour and precision and all the rest \u2014 </strong><i><strong>when</strong></i><strong> it is actually going to buy us more value. We have to discern when that is and isn\u2019t the case, because otherwise we\u2019ll run out of resources.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I'm not sure how exactly this would best port across to the computer analogy!</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "David Mears"}}, {"_id": "rQBi3zxdgcNyciiL7", "postedAt": "2023-07-26T02:19:44.038Z", "postId": "6sykvCXRC5rjgtoQt", "htmlBody": "<p>I think you're quite right - and if we're going to port it over to the analogy, I would venture to say that if you know you're I'm going to need to run a high resource task at some point, you need to conserce capacity to be able to extend the limits as needed.

Imagine you want to walk to your favorite store. If you're at home, you probably know the way by heart and can navigate there reliably. But now imagine you've been up for a while and have been walking around for hours following some semi-random commands from different people. And by following all these unrelated commands, you've now ended up doing a handstand on some hill next to a lake on the opposite end of town, where you've never been before. It can easily happen now that, from that weird state, going to the store close to your home will not work out and you get stuck somewhere.\nRestarting the computer is basically the same as teleporting home. It's in a well defined, clean, predictable state again, where you know that most of the usual day to day actions can be performed reliably. And the longer it's running without restart, the more chances it has to, in one way or another, get into a state that makes it fail at certain tasks you want it to do.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "markus_over"}}, {"_id": "8NbwdvyGkxyGMisgN", "postedAt": "2023-08-06T17:42:09.326Z", "postId": "6sykvCXRC5rjgtoQt", "htmlBody": "<p>Great post!

Another thing worth pointing out is another advantage of giving yourself capacity. I try to operate at around 80-90% capacity. This allows me time to notice and pursue better opportunities as they arise, and imo this is far more valuable to your long-term output than a flat +10% multiplier. As we know from EA resources, working on the right thing can multiply your effectiveness by 2x, 10x, or more. Giving yourself extra slack makes you less likely to get stuck in local optima.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jay Bailey"}}, {"_id": "yM8WWuwRR8iKcijcz", "postedAt": "2023-08-08T14:43:40.942Z", "postId": "6sykvCXRC5rjgtoQt", "htmlBody": "<p>I like that phone metaphor better....
