This leads me to initially believe we likely should update based on this/consider it more strongly than bullish equity sentiment towards some AI themes.</p><p>However on the flipside I think the size of this market does mean it can retain inefficiencies around subtle themes for longer. &nbsp;I think of this as a form of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HLqWn5LASfhhArZ7w/expecting-short-inferential-distances\">Expecting Short Inferential Distances</a> - there are a lot of inferential reasoning steps around TAI, scaling, take-off &nbsp;etc.. which make it slower for conviction to spread when compared to something like demographic shifts which have a much more straightforward causality. This is relevant because to move government bond markets requires people to take this bet with a huge amount of assets as this is a very capital-intensive trade with a lot of exposure to other uncorrelated risks/conflating variable (climate, demographics, geopolitics, populism etc..). The reason I think it may be unlikely that many people are making this bet is related to this:</p><blockquote><p>An analysis of the most capital-efficient way to bet on short AI timelines and the possible expected returns (\u201cthe greatest trade of all time\u201d).</p></blockquote><p>I suspect there are far more highly levered bets that market participants with a high-conviction belief in short TAI timelines could take, potentially diluting the impact on lower beta instruments (like bonds). For example I expect even being long fairly broad equity markets might outperform this bet and much more targeted bets (especially if they could be hedged against other risks, bringing them closer to &nbsp;a 'pure' TAI bet) could be expected to return many multiples of the short-US30Y trade.</p><p>If the amount of money being managed by those with high conviction TAI views is 'small' (&lt;&lt;$100bn) then I expect there are many &nbsp;more favourable inefficiencies/price dislocations for them to exploit and not a sufficient mass of 'smart TAI' money to spill over into long-dated bonds.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Cam"}}, {"_id": "DxfwK97xFJwEmkgyk", "postedAt": "2023-01-10T18:05:31.494Z", "postId": "8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx", "htmlBody": "<p>Great post<br><br>Regarding the second point about how EAs (or anyone else) might exploit an inefficiency in this space, I think it's tricky just because the amount of other risks that inform the pricing of long-dated bonds.

They may not be rich and for various related reasons they are unable to immediately correct the market (i.e., the market is actually temporarily <i>inefficient</i>). However, if they are right/superior, they either a) can keep profiting over and over again until they become liquid/rich enough to individually correct the market, and/or b) other people see that this person is profiting over and over again so they jump in and contribute to market correction.\"<br>The problem is that it might be the case that there is only one or two cycles for profit with AGI until the world goes crazy, but it could take many years for this strategy to actually profit, during which time the market will be \"temporarily\" inefficient. If real interest rates don't rise for 15 years, and only start to rise ~5 years before AGI, the market is inefficient for 15 years because small players can't profit to fix the situation.</li><li>\"But those are just two causal mechanisms,\" the authors/defenders hypothetically reply, \"and sometimes the market still corrects even without those mechanisms; look at the big short!

it's trying to do the equivalent of predicting the market reaction to the Fed reaction a couple of years later.</p><p>The entire OP is written as if we lived in an alternate universe where it is way way easier than history has actually shown, to figure out what happens in broad markets after any sort of complicated or nontrivial event occurs in real life that isn't on the order of \"unexpected Fed rate hike\" or \"company reports much higher-than-expected profits\". &nbsp;And it's written in such a way as to mislead EAs reading it about the general confidence that the field of economics is able to justly put in predictions about broad market reactions to strange things.</p><p>If you haven't already looked at OP's recommended investment instrument of (short) LPTZ, which holds inflation-protected Treasuries and is therefore their recommended way of tracking real interest rates, I recommend the following exercise: &nbsp;First try to figure out what you would have believed <i>a priori,</i> without benefit of hindsight, real interest rates would do over the course of a pandemic. &nbsp;Then, decide what investment strategy you'd have followed with LTPZ if you thought you knew about a pandemic ahead of the market. &nbsp;Then, decide what you think happened to real interest rates <i>with</i> benefit of hindsight. &nbsp; Then, go look at the actual price trajectory of their recommended instrument of <a href=\"https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/15-year-us-tips-index-exchange-traded-fund/\">LTPZ</a>.</p><p>I am not sure I can properly convey this thought that I am trying to convey; I have had trouble actually conveying this thought to EAs before. &nbsp;The thought is that people often do long careful serious-sounding writeups which EAs then take Very Seriously, because they are so long and so seriously argued, but in fact fail to bind to reality entirely, in a way that doesn't have to do with the details of the complicated arguments. &nbsp;Very serious arguments about what ought to happen to the price of an ETF that tracks 15-year TIPS, via the intermediate step of arguing about what logically ought to happen to real interest rates, are the sort of thing that, historically, average economists have not really been able to pull off; it's a kind of thought that you should expect fails to achieve basic binding to reality. &nbsp;What would LTPZ or its post-facto equivalent have been doing around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis? &nbsp;My model says 'no prediction'; they'll have done whatever. &nbsp;Afterwards somebody will make up a story about it in hindsight, but it is not the sort of thing where history says that long complicated analyses are remotely reliably good at doing it in advance.</p><p>But there are even <i>weaker </i>links in the argument, so let's accept the LTPZ step arguendo and pass on.</p><p>An even bigger problem is that, since everybody is going to die before anything really pays out, the marginal foresightful trader does not have a strong incentive to early-on move the market toward where the market would end up in equilibrium after everyone agreed on the actual facts of the matter and had time to trade about them.</p><p>Prediction markets, I sometimes explain to people, are tools for transmitting <i>future observables,</i> or more generally<i> propositions that people expect to publicly agree on at some future point even if they don't agree now,</i> lossily backward in time, manifesting as well-calibrated probability distributions.</p><p>To run a prediction market, you first and foremost need a future publicly observable measurement, which is a special case of a place where we expect most people to agree on an extreme probability assignment later, even though they don't agree now or don't make extreme probability assignments now. &nbsp;You cannot run a prediction market on whether supplementing lots of potassium can produce weight loss; you can only run a prediction market about what an experiment will report in the way of results, or what a particular judge will say the experimental evidence seems to have indicated in five years. &nbsp;You cannot <i>directly observe</i> \"whether potassium causes weight loss\" as an underlying fact of biology, so you can't have a prediction market about that; you can only <i>observe</i> what somebody reports as an experimental result, or what a particular person appointed as judge <i>says out loud</i> about the state of evidence later.</p><p>The marginal foresightful trader usually has a motive to run ahead of the market and make trades now, based on where the equilibrium ought to settle later; <i>not </i>because they are nobly undertaking a grand altruistic project of transmitting facts backward in time and making the market behave nicely from the standpoint of theoretical economics, but because they expect to get paid after everyone makes the common observation and the market settles into a new equilibrium reflecting that state of knowledge. &nbsp;And then they expect to have that money, or to get a bonus for earning that money for their proprietary trading firm, and for that money to still hold its value, and for them to be able to spend the money on nice things.</p><p>In the unusual case of foomdoom, even <i>if </i>doom proceeds slowly enough that a large-enough group of marginal foresightful traders see the foomdoom coming, even <i>if</i> there is somehow a really definitive fire alarm that says \"extremely high probability you are dead within two to four years\", it is <i>incredibly </i>unlikely that <i>everyone in the world</i> will agree that yes we'll all be dead in two to four years, and that the markets will settle into the equilibrium that an economist would say corresponds to the belief that we'll all be dead in two to four years; which is what's required for the foresightful proprietary trader to score a huge profit and get a big bonus that year and have time to spend it on some fancy way of passing the remaining time.</p><p>People do not usually agree on what will happen in two to four years. &nbsp;This kind of agreement that reliably reflects a fact, and makes a market pay out in a way that you can trust to correspond to that fact, is usually achieved after that fact is publicly definitively observed, not two to four years ahead of the observation.</p><p>In case of foomdoom the world never settles into equilibrium later, the bets never pay out, there is never that moment where everybody says \"What a foresightful trader that was!\" and agree on the fact that yes we sure are all dead now. &nbsp;So <i>even if</i> a proprietary trader sees doom coming, they do not have much of an incentive to <i>dutifully transmit that information backward in time</i> in order to make the market behave <i>now</i> in the way that an economist thinks ought to correspond to the equilibrium it would settle into after everybody agreed that they were dead.</p><p>That incentive would only exist if you expected everybody to agree that they were going to die in a few years, far enough ahead of everybody actually being dead, for the markets to settle into equilibrium and foresightful traders to collect bonuses on having made the trade before that. &nbsp;Which is a <i>much stronger and stranger</i> thing to claim, about a planet like Earth, than the <i>usual much weaker claim</i> that a few sharp traders might see a fact coming, and move the markets a few years ahead of time to where they would go <i>after everybody agreed on that fact later</i>.</p><p>Though even then, of course, we have cases like the financial crisis of 2006-2008, where some traders did see it coming and turn huge profits, but couldn't move enough marginal money around to actually shift the entire broader market.</p><p>To suppose that the market is broken around foomdoom is really not a remotely surprising market behavior to suppose! &nbsp;Even in a world where <i>nearly </i>all the prices are efficient relative to you and that's why you can't make 10%/day trading Microsoft stock!</p><p>What happened in 2006-2008 was much more broken than that! &nbsp;Marginal traders saw it coming, and some of them won huge even though CDSs were not trivial to short; but they didn't move enough money to shift anything remotely as large as 'real interest rates' ahead of the actual materialization of the disaster.</p><p>The market's behavior around Covid also showed much more obliviousness than this; it showed the kind of obliviousness where people I'd previously marked as the strongest EMH challengers reported collecting vast profits over a timespan of a couple of months. &nbsp;(But on chains of logic much less fraught than OP's, because in real life you can't call LTPZ movements or real interest rate changes in advance, just things on the order of 'buy volatility'.)</p><p>We should not believe 'the market', in the sense of that unusually intelligent entity whose opinions we actually pay attention to, driven by the highly incentivized marginal trader, has any opinion on AGI <i>except </i>that \"in the next few years, <i>not everyone will have started believing</i> that they are going to die in a few years after that\". &nbsp;The market is showing <i>no actual opinion on foomdoom, only on what most market participants will believe about foomdoom in a couple of years.</i> &nbsp; The usual incentive mechanism whereby, if a pandemic starts, <i>in a few years most market participants will agree that this pandemic happened</i> and foresightful traders will collect bonuses and spend them - as is responsible for the market sometimes but not always being foresightful, because it is paid to be foresightful - is in this case broken. &nbsp;We are really <i>always</i> seeing, when the market foretells an observable's value a few years later, that the foresightful marginal trader thinks that a few years later lots of people will hold a certain opinion; it's just that usually, this common opinion is being mundanely driven by a direct observation.</p><p>The market says, \"It won't be the case that in 2030, everyone agrees that they were killed by AGIs.\" &nbsp;The market isn't saying anything about whether that's because everyone agrees they are alive, or because nobody is left to agree anything.</p><p>OP reads like somebody has heard that markets sometimes anticipate things ahead of them happening, that markets sometimes transmit information lossily backward in time, and doesn't quite seem to have understood the mechanism behind it; that what <i>everyone</i> will agree on later, unusually foresightful marginal traders can sometimes cause the market to reflect <i>now</i> even though not everyone agrees on it yet. &nbsp;Instead they are talking about \"What if the market believed...\" as if this kind of market belief reflected <i>a numerical majority of the people in the market</i> believing that foomdoom would kill us all before 30-year bonds paid out. &nbsp;But this is not where the market gets its power to say things that we ought to pay special attention to (though even then market isn't always right about those things, or even righter than us, especially if those things are a little strange, eg Covid etc). &nbsp;The market gets its power from unusually foresightful marginal traders expecting to get a payoff from what <i>everyone believes later </i>after the thing actually happened and therefore most market participants agree about what happened. &nbsp;And this transmission mechanism is broken w/r/t AGI doom in a way that it wouldn't even be broken for an asteroid strike; with an asteroid strike, you might get weird effects from money losing its value in the future, but at least people could all agree on the asteroid strike coming. &nbsp;With AGI, I think you'd have to be pretty naive to expect everybody to agree that AGI will kill us in two years, two years before AGI kills us. &nbsp;So it is inappropriate to <i>skip over a step we can usually skip over,</i> and compress the true proposition \"The market doesn't believe that everyone in 2030 will believe that in 2030 everyone is dead\", to the false proposition \"The market doesn't believe that in 2030 everyone will be dead.\"</p><p>Though again - also just to be clear - AGI ruin is a harder call than Covid and I wouldn't strongly expect the market to get it right, even if transmission weren't broken; and even if I thought the market would get it right after seeing GPT-4 and that transmission wasn't broken, I wouldn't buy \"short LTPZ\" as a surefire way to profit.</p>", "parentCommentId": "M3fnWPQq2pegK4NaL", "user": {"username": "EliezerYudkowsky"}}, {"_id": "wschbjTyM3jDFbu6r", "postedAt": "2023-01-12T15:18:38.661Z", "postId": "8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx", "htmlBody": "<p>It\u2019s unclear to me that just because the number/liquidity of traders \u201cin the know\u201d is not very small (e.g., it is more than 0.1% of capital) this leads to the market correcting itself.

If they decide to hear out a first round of arguments but don't find them compelling enough, they drop out of the process. (Let's say that how compelling an argument seems is its \u201ctrue strength\u201d plus some random, mean-zero error.) If they do find the arguments compelling enough, they consider further investigation worth their time. They then tell the evangelist (or search engine or whatever) why they still object to the claim, and the evangelist (or whatever) brings a second round of arguments in reply. The process repeats.</p><p>As should be clear, this process can, after a few iterations, produce a situation in which most of those who have engaged with the arguments for a claim beyond some depth believe in it. But this is just because of the filtering mechanism: the deeper arguments were only ever exposed to people who were already, coincidentally, persuaded by the initial arguments. If people were chosen at random and forced to hear out all the arguments, most would not be persuaded. ...\"</p><p>Related, I think: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pxALB46SEkwNbfiNS/the-motivated-reasoning-critique-of-effective-altruism\">The motivated reasoning critique of effective altruism</a>, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/\">Epistemic learned helplessness</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fng7a59s74qg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefg7a59s74qg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I can't find a quick link about it that concisely explains just the argument \u2014 would appreciate one!</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnl3afjrmfm3\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefl3afjrmfm3\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>ChatGPT's explanation of what \"shorting government debt\" means:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In finance, \"shorting\" (or \"short selling\") refers to the process of selling an asset that the seller does not own with the expectation that the price of the asset will decrease.

I found that LessWrong's conversation took off about a week after the stock market started to crash. Given what we knew about COVID-19 prior to Feb. 20th, when the market first started to decline, I felt that the stock market's reaction was delayed. And of course, there'd been plenty of criticism of the response of experts and governments. But I was playing catch-up. I certainly was not screaming about COVID-19 until well after that time.</p>\n<p>Today, I found the most detailed timeline I've seen of confirmed cases around the world. It goes day by day and country by country, from Jan. 13th to the end of March.</p>\n<p>That timeline shows that Feb. 21st was the first date when at least 3 countries besides China had 10+ new confirmed cases in a single day (Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Iran).</p>\n<p>That changes my interpretation of the stock market crash dramatically. Investors weren't failing to synthesize the early information or waiting for someone to yell \"fire!\" They were waiting to see confirmed international community spread, rather than just a few cases popping up here and there.

I think market data can be a valuable source of information about the probability of various AI scenarios--along with other approaches, like forecasting tournaments, since each has its own strengths and weaknesses. I think it\u2019s a pity that relatively little has yet been written on extracting information about AI timelines from market data, and I\u2019m glad that this post has brought the idea to people\u2019s attention and demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to make at least some progress.</p><p>That said, there is one broad limitation to this analysis that hasn\u2019t gotten quite as much attention so far as I think it deserves. (Basil: yes, this is the thing we discussed last summer\u2026.) This is that low real, risk-free interest rates are compatible with the belief<br>1) that there will be no AI-driven growth explosion,&nbsp;<br>as you discuss--but also<i>&nbsp;</i>with <i>some</i>&nbsp;AI-growth-explosion-compatible beliefs investors might have, including<br>2) that future growth could well be very fast&nbsp;<i>or&nbsp;</i>very slow, and<br>3) that growth will be fast but marginal utility in consumption will nevertheless stay high, because AI will give us such mindblowing new things to spend on (my \u201c<a href=\"https://philiptrammell.com/static/New_Products_and_Long_term_Welfare.pdf\">new products</a>\u201d hobby-horse).<br>So it seems impossible to put any upper bound (below 100%) on the probability people are assigning to near-term explosive growth purely by looking at real, risk-free interest rates.</p><p>To infer that investors believe (1), one of course has to think hard about all the alternatives (including but not limited to (2) and (3)) and rule them out. But (if I\u2019m not mistaken) all you do along these lines is to partly rule out (2), by exploring the implications of putting a yearly probability on the economy permanently stagnating. I found that helpful. As you observe, merely (though I understand that you don't see it as \u201cmerely\u201d!) introducing a 20% chance of stagnation by 2053 is enough to mostly offset the interest rate increases produced by an 80% chance of Cotra AI timelines. You don\u2019t currently incorporate any negative-growth scenarios, but even a small chance of negative growth seems like it should be enough to fully offset said interest rate increase. This is because of the asymmetry produced by diminishing marginal utility: the marginal utility of an extra dollar saved can only fall to zero, if you turn out to be very rich in the future, whereas it can rise arbitrarily high if you turn out to be very poor. (You note this when you say \u201cthe real interest rate reflects the&nbsp;<i>expected&nbsp;</i>future economic growth rate, where importantly the expectation is taken over the risk-neutral measure\u201d, but I think the departure from caring about what we would normally call&nbsp;<i>the expected growth rate</i> is important and kind of obscured here.)</p><p>This seems especially relevant given that what investors should be expected to care about is the expected growth rate of their own future consumption, rather than of GDP. Even if they\u2019re certain that AI is coming and bound to accelerate GDP growth, they could worry that it stands some chance of making a small handful of people rich and themselves poor. You write that \u201ctruly transformative AI leading to 30%+ economy-wide growth\u2026 would not be possible without having economy-wide benefits\u201d, but this is not so clear to me. You might think that\u2019s crazy, but given that I don\u2019t, presumably some other investors don\u2019t.</p><p>Anyway: this is all to say that I\u2019m skeptical of inferring much from risk-free interest rates alone. This doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t draw inferences from market data, though! For one thing, on the hypothesis that investors believe \u201c(2)\u201d, we would probably expect to see the \u201cinsurance value\u201d of bonds, and thus the equity premium, rising over time (as we do, albeit weakly). For another thing, one can presumably test how the market reacts to AI news.

I'll give a number of reasons.</p><ol><li>Rates markets don't price in events (even ones that are fully known) more than one or two years ahead of time (Y2K, contentious elections in Italy or France, etc). This is generally outside participants time horizons but also...</li><li>A lot can happen in two years (much less ten years). Major terrorist attack, pandemic, nuclear war to name three possibilities all of which would fully torpedo any bet you would make on AI, no matter how certain you are of the outcome.</li><li>The premise is not obviously true that higher growth leads to higher real yields. That is one heuristic among many when thinking about what real yields should do. It's important to think about the mechanism here - if real yields are well below the economic growth rate then businesses are incentivized to borrow money to invest in projects which earn that growth rate. But this is really a return on capital phenomenon, not a growth rate phenomenon. It's much more applicable to a scenario of humanoid robots where you have to invest large amounts of money up front to yield a return in wage savings over time. Zero marginal cost software doesn't require the same kind of capital investment so there is no surge in borrowing necessary to attain the economic growth.&nbsp;</li><li>The heuristic of rates=growth is really better thought of as what rate is necessary to equilibrate savings and investment. So even a massive demand for investment funds can be offset by willing savers. In the case where gains from AI were evenly distributed it's plausible to say the income effect is such that people generally will &nbsp;feel richer and thus want to consume more today (and will require a high interest rate to &nbsp;push consumption from today to tomorrow). But in reality the wealth gains from AI will probably accrue to a small slice of the population. Rich people have very low marginal propensities to consume (and high marginal propensities to save). So a surge in wealth to rich people is generally thought to push interest rates down.</li><li>Saving the most practical point for last: Interest rates in developed economies are heavily influenced by where the Fed wants them to be in order to fulfill their mandate of full employment and 2% inflation. If there were a huge speculative increase in interest rates in anticipation of a growth surge ten years from now that would torpedo current borrowing and thus the economy. So the Fed would fight back by cutting the overnight interest rate and, if necessary, purchasing bonds. The Fed's ammo is essentially unlimited and they would get their way and you would lose money.</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "joshuab"}}, {"_id": "4cxdDjQfuqzLvgGxs", "postedAt": "2023-01-21T19:40:32.149Z", "postId": "8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx", "htmlBody": "<p>Cheers, I thought this comment was very informative</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "z67DeSS4Egmn4uHcc", "user": {"username": "NegativeNuno"}}, {"_id": "nHm6hGvfjJfnRbWbd", "postedAt": "2023-01-25T18:16:04.132Z", "postId": "8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx", "htmlBody": "<p>By the way, someone wrote this Google doc in 2019 on \"<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k92xc46h8P4XlD-WPKj-Hcn7wboTT_fVuVXFpSvKhNo/edit#heading=h.7hd2d0wh7pl7\">Stock Market prediction of transformative technology</a>\".
