For instance, it would be helpful to at least briefly identify some specific problems, explain why you think EA is currently using the \"same scorecard for innovations from mature ecosystems\" to address those problems, and explain why that isn't working for those specific problems. It doesn't need to be verbose, but having specific claims to evaluate would be helpful.</p>\n<p>The use of all caps in the title could also be a factor to explain some votes. Use of all caps is discouraged as explained in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yND9aGJgobm5dEXqF/guide-to-norms-on-the-forum\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yND9aGJgobm5dEXqF/guide-to-norms-on-the-forum</a></p>\n<p>(I did not vote on your post, by the way.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jason"}}]
