The reasons you gave only support autonomy instrumentally through other values.

Generations of philosophers have painstakingly identified necessary and sufficient conditions for its attainment, subjected those conditions to revision and critique, scrapped their original accounts, started again, given up and argued that the concept is devoid of meaning, and so on. I cannot hope to do justice to the richness of the literature on this topic here. Still, it\u2019s important to have at least a rough and ready conception of what autonomy is and the most general (and hopefully least contentious) conditions needed for its attainment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have said this before, but I like Joseph Raz\u2019s general account. Like most people, he thinks that an autonomous agent is one who is, in some meaningful sense, the author of their own lives. In order for this to happen, he says that three conditions must be met:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Rationality condition:</em> The agent must have goals/ends and must be able to use their reason to plan the means to achieve those goals/ends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Optionality condition:</em> The agent must have an adequate range of options from which to choose their goals and their means.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Independence condition:</em> The agent must be free from external coercion and manipulation when choosing and exercising their rationality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have mentioned before that you can view these as \u2018threshold conditions\u2019, i.e. conditions that simply have to be met in order for an agent to be autonomous, or you can have a slightly more complex view, taking them to define a three dimensional space in which autonomy resides. In other words, you can argue that an agent can have more or less rationality, more or less optionality, and more or less independence. The conditions are satisfied in degrees. This means that agents can be more or less autonomous, and the same overall level of autonomy can be achieved through different combinations of the relevant degrees of satisfaction of the conditions. That\u2019s the view I tend to favour. I think there possibly is a minimum threshold for each condition that must be satisfied in order for an agent to count as autonomous, but I suspect that the cases in which this threshold is not met are pretty stark. The more complicated cases, and the ones that really keep us up at night, arise when someone scores high on one of the conditions but low on another. Are they autonomous or not? There may not be a simple \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer to that question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, using the three conditions we can formulate the following \u2018autonomy principle\u2019 or \u2018autonomy test\u2019:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Autonomy principle:</em> An agent\u2019s actions are more or less autonomous to the extent that they meet the (i) rationality condition; (ii) optionality condition and (iii) independence condition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Kaj_Sotala"}}, {"_id": "fN2WLHAQ6ApRm5Evo", "postedAt": "2017-07-22T10:27:00.593Z", "postId": "38ZpdnHMcJG9vHKJf", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks.
