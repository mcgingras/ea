There are a couple types of \"clawbacks\" under bankruptcy law:</p><ul><li>Preference action (<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/547\">11 USC 547</a>): Generally allows clawback of most transfers by an insolvent entity or person made within 90 days of filing for bankruptcy. The concept here is that courts don't want people to be able to transfer money away to whoever they want to have it just before filing for bankruptcy. My <i>GUESS </i>(this really really isn't legal advice, I'm really not a bankruptcy lawyer) is that any money transferred to a grantee before ~early August won't be able to be clawed back in a preference action. Caveat: There are special rules around transfers to insiders, so the situation might be more complicated for grantees that have multiple types of relationships to FTX.</li><li>Fraudulent transfer action (<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/548\">11 USC 548</a>): Generally allows clawback of transfers made within 2 years of a bankruptcy filing in cases where the transfer was meant to help conceal or perpetrate the fraud (very rough characterization -- trying to balance precision and comprehensibility here). This is the classic Madoff/Ponzi case, where a person/company will pay out some creditors in order to encourage others to invest, meaning that the clawed-back transfers were ones that helped the fraudulent scheme itself work. There's a special provision (subsection (a)(2)) that says charitable donations usually can't be clawed back this way, but it doesn't seem like grant money was necessarily flowing through a 501c3 entity, so I wouldn't assume this applies. Still, my <i>GUESS </i>(this really really isn't legal advice, I'm really not a bankruptcy lawyer) is that grants won't be treated as the kinds of transfers addressed by section 548 because they don't help perpetuate fraud.</li></ul><p>This leaves the situation somewhat unclear for grantees who received funds between August and now. I would <i>GUESS </i>(this really really REALLY isn't legal advice) that disbursed grants being clawed back isn't super likely because of a cluster of factors that I won't be able to clearly describe. This is not very helpful but it's all I can offer. If I get a better understanding of the situation in the next few days I will post an update.</p><p>Because of the specter of a bankruptcy proceeding looming over all of this, I would be surprised if additional grant funds were disbursed in the near future. I'm not sure if any bankruptcy petition has already been filed (I've heard conflicting things), but once it is money <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/549\">is effectively frozen</a>.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "catehall"}}, {"_id": "qEZjLwEewTuKJsDsB", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T20:38:17.243Z", "postId": "BesfLENShzSMeb7Xi", "htmlBody": "<p>Where are you getting 90 days from? &nbsp;I found <a href=\"https://higgsjohnson.com/the-extraterritorial-effect-of-clawback-claims-in-insolvency-proceedings-the-bahamas-experience/#:~:text=Bahamian%20insolvency%20law%20permits%20a,the%20commencement%20of%20its%20liquidation.\">six months</a>, although this was very quick and I could easily have missed something.</p>", "parentCommentId": "CCQppBZcnKo5jABPC", "user": {"username": "Elizabeth"}}, {"_id": "8yLrvkrJtcS7pd3oX", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T20:45:12.513Z", "postId": "BesfLENShzSMeb7Xi", "htmlBody": "<p>See the first bullet point in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BesfLENShzSMeb7Xi/community-support-given-ftx-situation?commentId=QrEB5q35LxCAPqFvH\">this comment</a></p>", "parentCommentId": "qEZjLwEewTuKJsDsB", "user": {"username": "Fermi\u2013Dirac Distribution"}}, {"_id": "KKwCEzBzY4GWgjjAK", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T20:47:17.939Z", "postId": "BesfLENShzSMeb7Xi", "htmlBody": "<p>that's pointing to US law, yes?</p>", "parentCommentId": "8yLrvkrJtcS7pd3oX", "user": {"username": "Elizabeth"}}, {"_id": "DTFeE8rjiDY2JpxhN", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T20:52:53.807Z", "postId": "BesfLENShzSMeb7Xi", "htmlBody": "<p>This looks like the position under Bahamian law (which <i>might</i> be the relevant law, not Antigua and Barbuda law or US law, given FTX was operating in the Bahamas - I just don't know how this actually works).&nbsp;</p><p>Re the 90 day rule in the United States, see here &nbsp;under the heading 'Avoidable Transfers': &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics\">https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics</a></p><p>Just to reiterate, I'm not a US, Antigua+Barbuda or Bahamas lawyer, and this isn't legal advice.</p>", "parentCommentId": "qEZjLwEewTuKJsDsB", "user": {"username": "Tyrone Barugh"}}, {"_id": "gdZpj2Xm63zRmatb7", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T20:55:14.124Z", "postId": "BesfLENShzSMeb7Xi", "htmlBody": "<p>Yes, as was the part of Tyrone-Jay Barugh's comment referencing the 90 day rule.</p>", "parentCommentId": "KKwCEzBzY4GWgjjAK", "user": {"username": "Fermi\u2013Dirac Distribution"}}, {"_id": "w8ZhMutZctyjszyx2", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T21:00:09.938Z", "postId": "BesfLENShzSMeb7Xi", "htmlBody": "<p>Do you know how likely it is that United States law applies?
