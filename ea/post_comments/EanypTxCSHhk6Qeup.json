But I think there are good reasons to believe they might be very sub-optimal. Firstly, most people (right now and throughout history) would be terrified of everything they care about being destroyed and replaced with hedonium. Secondly, even you say that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me feel good and it is in direct opposition to most of my values\u201d, despite being one of the few proponents of a hedonium shockwave. I\u2019m unsure why you are identifying with the utilitarian part of you so strongly and ignoring all the other parts of you.</p><p><br>Anyway, I won\u2019t expand because this topic has been discussed a lot before and I\u2019m unlikely to say anything new.

I've just read a lot of blogs and it turns out that we can maximise that by turning everything into a homogenous substance of hedonium, including you, your mom, your girlfriend, the cast of Friends, all the great artworks and wonders of nature. When shall we start working on that?</p><p><strong>Heart:&nbsp;</strong>Ummm, a small part of me think that'd be great but... I'm starting to think that maybe happiness and suffering is not ALL I care about, maybe it's a bit more complex. Is it ok if we don't turn my mom into hedonium?</p><p>My point is, in the end, you think that suffering is bad and happiness is good because your emotions say so (what other reason could there be?). Why not listen to other things your emotions tell you?
