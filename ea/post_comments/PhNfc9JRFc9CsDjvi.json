I think it's good to continually evaluate the structure and flows of things. But here's my problem, and probably it's because I don't have enough of a sense of how things flow amongst CEA and EV and other entities, maybe you could write more of how you see the energy flowing overall in EA and where these entities exist in that. People more aware probably find this article more helpful than me.&nbsp;<br><br>From what I do know, here's how I see the flow; it appears that EA has a series of \"funnels\" or \"channels\" where people come in; the forum, university groups, virtual programs, EAG's, books, PR outreach, etc. and so these people flow in to EA through these various channels and then they decide to commit to giving money or to seek an EA job or 80K recommended job or charity job and become more an actual part of EA.&nbsp;<br><br>So it seems to me that all the expansion of EA goes on beyond the funnels...more org's start, more org's expand and create more jobs and research contributions, more charities start...that expansion can go on forever, that's where the growth is...but the funnel remains the same. I think CEA is the funnel, they organize all the local groups, the Virtual Programs, the regional gatherings, the forum...that funnel will slowly grow and expand and adjust itself while the bigger EA world beyond the funnel continues to expand even more wildly. I think the Centre for Effective Altruism is a great name for the funnel.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course the funnel doesn't control all the wild expansion of org's and charities, those each have their own visions and energies. The funnel just provides a stable front entrance anyone can easily find before they enter and go off in a million different directions. And for certain issues, like having a nurse station for EA's mind boo-boo's, or a principal's office to interdict bullies, it's good to have those by the front door, easy to find.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "JeffreyK"}}, {"_id": "NiiejwJ2tBYsK9pQ9", "postedAt": "2023-04-26T23:10:36.795Z", "postId": "PhNfc9JRFc9CsDjvi", "htmlBody": "<p>Also,</p><blockquote><p>From what I can tell, \u2018CEA\u2019 was never meant to be the name of anything substantial ( William MacAskill&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9a7xMXoSiQs3EYPA2/the-history-of-the-term-effective-altruism\"><u>reports that</u></a> it was just meant to be the unassuming name of the umbrella organization which 80k and GWWC wanted to form back in the day) - and I think it feels right (in a poetic/nostalgic way) that the community finally moves on from it to something better.</p></blockquote><p>Loving these '<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/90/c4/62/90c46288278efa4b2a54907b73b6ad6b.jpg\">It is time</a>' vibes.</p><p>I feel it's becoming increasingly hard for EA orgs/leaders to feel good about learning, growing and adapting, because before they've had a chance to really process a problem, dozens of EAs have publicly and unforgivingly called them out on it.

I\u2019ll say I don\u2019t have any direct evidence that overall trust has gone down, though I see it as an extremely reasonable prior. I say this only because I think it\u2019s the kind of thing that would be easy to have an information cascade about, where \u201ceveryone knows\u201d that \u201ceveryone knows\u201d that trust is being lost. Sometimes there\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3wBCKM3D2dXkXnpWY/announcing-cea-s-interim-managing-director\"><u>surprising results</u></a>, like that the \u201coverall affect scores [to EA as a brand] haven't noticeably changed post FTX collapse.\u201d There are some possibilities we\u2019re considering about tracking this more directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For me, I\u2019m trying to balance trust being important with knowing that it\u2019s normal to get some amount of criticism and trying not to be overreactive to that. For instance, in preparation for a specific project we might run, we did some temperature checking and getting takes on how people felt about our plan.&nbsp;</p><p>I do want people to have a sense of what we actually do, what our work looks like, and how we think and approach things so that they can make informed decisions about how to update on what we say and do. We have some ideas for conveying those things, and are thinking about how to prioritize those ideas against putting our heads down and doing good work directly.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Thoughts on the suggestions for improving trust&nbsp;</h3><p>To say a bit about the ideas raised in light of things I\u2019ve learned and thought about recently.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>External people</strong></p><p>Conscientious EAs are often keen to get external reviews from consultants on various parts of EA, which I really get and I think comes from an important place about not reinventing the wheel or thinking we\u2019re oh so special. There are many situations in which that makes sense and would be helpful; I recently recommended an HR consultant to a group thinking of doing something HR-related. But my experience has been that it\u2019s surprisingly hard to find professionals who can give advice about the set of things we\u2019re trying to do, since they\u2019re often mostly optimizing for one thing (like minimizing legal risk to a company, etc.) or just don\u2019t have experience with what we\u2019re trying to do.&nbsp;</p><p>In the conversations I\u2019ve had with HR consultants, ombudspeople, and an employment lawyer, I continually have it pointed out that what the Community Health team does doesn\u2019t fall into any of those categories (because unlike HR, we work with organizations outside of CEA and also put more emphasis on protecting confidentiality, and unlike ombudspeople, we try more to act on the information we have).&nbsp;</p><p>When I explain the difference, the external people I talk to extremely frequently say \u201coh, that sounds complicated\" or \"wow, that sounds hard\u201d. So I just want to flag that getting external perspectives (something I\u2019ve been working a bunch on recently) is harder than it might seem. There just isn\u2019t much in the way of direct analogues of our work where there are already known best practices. A good version according to me might look more like talking to different people and trying to apply their thinking to an out-of-distribution situation, as well as being able to admit that we might be doing an unusual thing and the outside perspectives aren\u2019t as helpful as I\u2019d hope.&nbsp;</p><p>If people have suggestions for external people it would be useful to talk to, feel free to let me know!</p><p><strong>More</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>updates</strong></p><p>Appreciate the point about updating the community more often - this definitely seems really plausible. We were already planning some upcoming updates, so look out for those. Just to say something that it\u2019s easy to lose track of, it\u2019s often much easier to talk or answer questions 1:1 or in groups than publicly. Figuring out how to talk to many audiences at once takes a lot more thought and care. For example, readers of the Forum include established community members, new community members, journalists, and people who are none of the above. While conversations here can still be important, this isn\u2019t the only venue for productive conversation, and it\u2019s not always the best one. I want to empower people to feel free to chat with us about their questions, thoughts or perspectives on the team, for instance at conferences. This is part of why I set up two different office hours at the most recent EAG Bay Area.</p><p>It\u2019s also worth saying that we have multiple stakeholders in addition to the community at large [for instance when we think about things like the AI space and whether there\u2019s more we could be doing there, or epistemics work, or work with specific organizations and people where a community health lens is especially important], and a lot of important conversations happen with those stakeholders directly (or if not, that\u2019s a different mistake we\u2019re making), which won\u2019t always be outwardly visible.</p><p><strong>The other suggestions</strong><br>Don\u2019t have strong takes or thoughts to share right now, but thanks for the suggestions!</p><p>For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m interested in talking to community members about their perspective on the team [modulo time availability]. This already happens to some extent informally (and people are welcome to pass on feedback to me (directly or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLnp5LVp0WwCOVKDHEZwh-5NPHz-ZwJEqsMe_Z38MPO8tUEg/viewform\"><u>by form</u></a>) or to the team (including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HvXX7zFLBY0ligvCucfzDrtdUt4H9-YN6laFpIneGko/viewform?edit_requested=true\"><u>anonymously</u></a>)). When I went looking for people to talk to (somewhat casually/informally) to get feedback from people who had lost trust, I ended up getting relatively few responses, even anonymously. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because people felt uncomfortable or scared or upset, or just didn\u2019t have the time or something else. So I want to reiterate that I\u2019m interested in this.</p><h2>Privacy</h2><p>I wanted to say here that we\u2019ve <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NbkxLDECvdGuB95gW/the-community-health-team-s-work-on-interpersonal-harm-in\">said for a while</a> that we share information (that we get consent to share) about people with other organizations and parts of CEA [not saying you disagree, just wanted to clarify]. While I agree one could have concerns, overall I think this is a huge upside to our work. If it was hard to act on the information we have, we would be much more like therapists or ombudspeople, and my guess is that would hugely curtail the impact we could have. [This may not engage with the specifics you brought up, but I thought it might be good to convey my model].</p><h2>Independence / spinning out</h2><p>Just to add to my point about there still being a board, a director and funders in a world where we spin out, I\u2019ll note that there are other potential creative solutions to gaining independence e.g. getting diverse funding, getting funding promises for more time in advance (like an endowment), and clever legal approaches such as those an ombudsperson I interviewed said they had. We haven\u2019t yet looked into any of those in depth.</p><p>For what it\u2019s worth, I think on the whole we\u2019ve been able to act quite independently of CEA, but I acknowledge that that wouldn\u2019t be legible from the outside.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "qzT5L7pmsJdhF9ywm", "user": {"username": "ChanaMessinger"}}, {"_id": "vJL7aeyQtxD7Jkx7N", "postedAt": "2023-04-29T01:14:48.646Z", "postId": "PhNfc9JRFc9CsDjvi", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>&nbsp;In the conversations I\u2019ve had with HR consultants, ombudspeople, and an employment lawyer, I continually have it pointed out that what the Community Health team does doesn\u2019t fall into any of those categories (because unlike HR, we work with organizations outside of CEA and also put more emphasis on protecting confidentiality, and unlike ombudspeople, we try more to act on the information we have).</p><p>When I explain the difference, the external people I talk to extremely frequently say \u201coh, that sounds complicated\" or \"wow, that sounds hard\u201d</p></blockquote><p>I wonder if the external reaction suggests that CH may be asked to wear too many hats in a way that makes it more challenging to wear them with excellence. Learning that CH is <i>sui generis</i> --or at least very atypical when compared to other movements -- potentially suggests that other movements may have learned (through trial and error, most likely) that certain functions are better off separated than merged into one group of people.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, in the discussion of privacy, you suggest that a role \"much more like therapists or ombudspeople\" would \"hugely curtail the impact we could have.\" I'm sure that is true for many aspects of CH's work, but it's not clear to me why it would be true for all aspects. As a society, we've decided that it is net positive for people to be able to receive certain kinds of help with <i>very </i>robust confidentiality protections -- hence we have priests, psychologists, and lawyers among others. With pretty limited exceptions, we have decided that when it comes to supporting people \"who are dealing with personal or interpersonal problems,\" those support providers should not be able to use the information obtained for any other purpose. (In many but not all circumstances, the person seeking support can consent to other uses of the information.)&nbsp;</p><p>As a practical matter, it's hard for people to fully \"unhear\" what they have heard. Whether in recognition of that practical reality, or to reassure people considering seeking help, we normally avoid putting people in both a role of help-provider and a role that would potentially require them to somehow evaluate the help-seeker, or put information they learned as a help-provider out of mind.</p><p>One usual approach for providing support in the broader community is to have an independent contractor providing Employee Assistance Program services, where nothing that the care-seeker said (or even their invocation of EAP assistance) can make its way back to the people who could even potentially take adverse action based on that information. I think that's probably the right track for <i>some</i> portion of CH's work -- it would be helpful to give people coming to CH for help with their own personal or interpersonal problems the option to receive support from someone who is strongly sealed off from any non-support-providing roles and functions.</p>", "parentCommentId": "h6eWK4MeBJkFJJ4uS", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "dY3MnujBkJCbwhSJK", "postedAt": "2023-04-30T14:31:31.202Z", "postId": "PhNfc9JRFc9CsDjvi", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for those links.
