It's so wrong that people only put themselves in the shoes of the haves, rather than the have-nots when formulating their &quot;morals&quot;. Although, I think that framing cannot be underestimated here. Framing serious philanthropy as a moral necessity has a negative effect because no one wants to be told what to do -- all that will happen is people will pull away and actually strengthen their selfish justifications. Framing serious philanthropy as an ideal, however, should have a positive effect, as people love nothing more than to strive for ideals THAT THEY FEEL THEY HAVE CHOSEN! Even the word &quot;ethics&quot; implies requirements that make you a &quot;bad person&quot; if unmet. I think that replacing the word &quot;ethics&quot; with &quot;values&quot; would have the effect I'm talking about -- making hardcore philanthropy appear as aspirational and self-esteem-building rather than an attempt at convincing yourself you're &quot;not a bad person.&quot;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Austen_Forrester"}}, {"_id": "k2d3jPf7ewCnEyZXL", "postedAt": "2014-08-16T03:36:00.000Z", "postId": "W7Ms6fvE2ZzoqcEPH", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Austen.

McGinn says\nthat he finds this a dystopian prospect. No doubt he is thinking of himself as\na potential donor rather than as a person in urgent need of aid. From that\nperspective, the thought of being bombarded with images of people suffering is\nindeed dystopian. But if I imagine myself as a victim of a natural disaster,\nand think of my life and the lives of my family as being saved by the existence\nof the Charity Channel, I have a very different view.</blockquote></p>", "parentCommentId": "WHmFGgXQDAx2wehyN", "user": {"username": "Pablo_Stafforini2"}}, {"_id": "Y4poRKrqNnCkYHd8A", "postedAt": "2022-04-24T13:44:36.782Z", "postId": "W7Ms6fvE2ZzoqcEPH", "htmlBody": "<p>Strong upvoting in 2022, I think it's a useful reminder for the current discussions about free spending and not being funding constrained.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Lorenzo Buonanno"}}]
