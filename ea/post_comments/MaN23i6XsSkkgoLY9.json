Most of them were seemingly convinced that the EAs on campus weren't actually interested in doing good, because there was money being spent on sending students to fly abroad for conferences, hosting discussion groups, opening an office/hang out space in our insanely expensive city, etc. Which, to be fair, was a far cry from how the campus homeless shelter I worked at was spending money  \u2014 we cherished small donations from our fundraising drives, spending it almost exclusively on programs benefitting the guests we served, often just getting together basic bits of clothing and hygiene products.</p>\n<p>I tried to explain to my friends the EA argument for spendy-ness (I still believe it is the best way to do good, deep down) but I just couldn't seem to convince them that it wasn't a ruse of motivated reasoning.

It feels wrong in the same way that it would feel wrong to say \"we should only spend time doing (activity if that activity is highly effective/it would increase our productivity in EA work\". EA is a community, for better or worse, and I think it's bad for communities to create norms that are bad for community members well-being.
