I don't think it has to be very complicated. Essentially, we commit to doing journal-independent review and rating, we get some funding to pay for editorial/reviewer time, and we give it a try, on existing platforms like OSF + PreReview.</p>\n<p>Perhaps someone needs to 'take the lead' on this? I'd love to but not sure I have the bandwidth.
