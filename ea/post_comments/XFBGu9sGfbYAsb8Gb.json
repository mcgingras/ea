It strikes me [I'm speaking in a personal capacity, etc.] the challenge for EA is a combination of the fact the resources are quite centralised <i>and </i>that trustees of charities are (as you say) not accountable to anyone. One by itself might be fine. Both together is tricky. &nbsp;I'm not sure where this fits in with your framework, sorry.&nbsp;</p><p>There's one big funder (Open Philanthropy), many of the key organisations are really just one organisation wearing different hats (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GoWNiPbrEb6NHD3MF/announcing-interim-ceos-of-evf\">EVF</a>), and these are accountable only to their trustees. What's more, &nbsp;as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1?commentId=7cDqgi7bjdJ3uS9pS#comments\">Buck notes here</a>, all the <i>dramatis personae</i> are quite friendly (\"lot of EA organizations are led and influenced by a pretty tightly knit group of people who consider themselves allies\"). &nbsp;Obviously, some people will be in favour of centralised, unaccountable decision-making - those who think it gets the right results - but it's not the structure we expect to be conducive to good governance in general.</p><p>If power in effective altruism were decentralised, that is, there were lots of 'buyers' and 'sellers' in the 'EA marketplace', then you'd expect competitive pressure to improve governance: poorly run organisations will be wracked by the \"gales of creative destruction\" as donors go elsewhere.</p><p>If leaders in effective altruism were accountable, for instance, if EVF became a membership organisation and the board were elected by its (paying?) members, that would provide a different sort of check and balance. I don't think it's reasonable for individual donors, i.e. Dustin Mosktovitz and Cari Tuna, or cause-specific organisations, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zuqpqqFoue5LyutTv/the-ea-community-does-not-own-its-donors-money\">to submit their money to the democratic will</a>, but it seems more sensible for central organisations, those that are something like natural monopolies and ostensibly serve the whole community, to have democratic elements.</p><p>As it is, the governance structure across EA &nbsp;is, essentially, for its leaders to police themselves - and wait for media stories to break.

I find it really helpful to think of EA as a marketplace for maximum impact goods and services. Like your local farmers' market, but instead of selling fruit and vegetables, people are offering charities, charity recommendations, and so on. (I've been reflecting on this for a while, and might write it up as a standalone post). The analogy doesn't have to be perfect to be informative. In this framing, what we'd want, presumably, is for there to be lots of competition and choice, so that consumers get a better deal. You don't want there to be just one guy that sells fruit, and only sells oranges, for example.</p>\n<p>The challenge for EA is that one buyer dominates the market: Open Philanthropy is, I think, 50+% of total. In effect, you're going to get <em>about</em> as much variety as OP wants, when they do their own 'shopping': if OP wants to buy your fruit, you're in business; if they don't, it's much harder to survive in the market. If they want there to be a greater variety of sellers, they can create demand for them - equivalent to saying \"hey, if you start selling apples in the market, we'll buy 10 crates\" or whatever. But it's not clear if it's a good use of their money, by their lights, to create a market for products they don't really want and other people may not want. It puts the new vendors in an odd, risky position too if they only exist because they have one, questionably enthusiastic consumer.  They could see it as a good use of money: they'd be subsiding the creation of products in the hope of creating demand and bringing other people into the market. Hence, it's not obvious the main buyer in a marketplace would want to creat variety vs just seek out the specific things they want.*</p>\n<p>*Mutatis mutandis, there are the same issues if major funders engage in regranting, which is like giving your friends some of your money and asking them to buy stuff in the market. If your friends have the same preferences to you, they'll buy the same stuff, so there's no point. If they buy stuff you'd hate, then you'll think you shouldn't have given them money.

Fwiw FTX Foundation explicitly wanted to do this - they had a category for 'competition to existing EA orgs'. This could have been because as a different org they were sceptical of OP's priorities, &nbsp;though this seems unlikely given the substantial overlap between the people involved, so it seems more like a genuine desire for a better marketplace.</p><blockquote><p>If your friends have the same preferences to you, they'll buy the same stuff, so there's no point.
