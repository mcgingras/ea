I would really like to publish more of AMF's PDM data to enable this kind of work. Unfortunately, we have to prioritize how we spend our time in the small AMF team, and this task hasn't made it to the top yet.</p>\n<p>If you were interested in doing a more in-depth analysis (and have the time required for this) it might be good to let Rob (our CEO) know. This can help in prioritizing this type of task.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Sjlver"}}, {"_id": "JCrf2i9vw2HeheYJc", "postedAt": "2022-10-19T21:15:01.175Z", "postId": "9NsBFPP2hgcNmHckh", "htmlBody": "<p>Done, thanks.</p>", "parentCommentId": "KhfJ3c9qNWcoKre8Q", "user": {"username": "brb243"}}]
