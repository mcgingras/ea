Criteria have been pretty in-flux. My sense has been that a lot of it is just dependent on who CEA knows well-enough to feel comfortable inviting, and who seems to be obviously worth coordinating with.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Which senior decision makers in EA played a part in the decision to make the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FG9JJmAYDq9Ghuudg/some-potential-lessons-from-carrick-s-congressional-bid\"><u>Carrick Flynn campaign</u></a> happen? Did any express the desire for it not to? Who signed off on the decision to make the campaign manager someone with no political experience?</p></blockquote><p>I mean, my primary guess here is Carrick. I don't think there was anyone besides Carrick who \"decided\" to make the Carrick campaign happen. I am pretty confident Carrick had no boss and did this primarily on his own initiative (though likely after consulting with various other people in EA on whether it was a good idea).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[edit: On more reflection and talking to some more people, my guess is there was actually more social pressure involved here than this paragraph implies. Like, I think it was closer to \"a bunch of kind-of-but-not-very influential EAs reached out to him and told him that they think it would be quite impactful and good for the world if he ran\", and my updated model of Carrick really wasn't personally attracted to running for office, and the overall experience was not great for him]</strong></p><p>I expressed desire for it not to happen! Though like, I think it wasn't super obvious to me it was a wrong call, but a few times when people asked me whether to volunteer for the Carrick campaign, I said that seemed overall bad for the world. I did not reach out to Carrick with this complaint, since doing anything is already hard, Carrick seemed well-intentioned, and while I think his specific plan was a mistake, it didn't seem a bad enough mistake to be worth very actively intervening (and like, ultimately Carrick can do whatever he wants, I can't stop him from running for office).</p><blockquote><p>Why did&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1591091481309491200?s=20&amp;t=UAgGv28JCpmGjuCMu3c3Ag\"><u>Will MacAskill introduce Sam Bankman-Fried to Elon Musk</u></a> with the intention of getting SBF to help Elon buy twitter?

My guess is it's not, but like, Twitter does sure seem like it has a large effect on the world, both in terms of geopolitics and in terms of things like norms for the safe development of technologies, and so at least to me I think if you had taken Sam's net-worth at face-value at the time, this didn't seem like a crazy idea to me.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know why Will vouched so hard for Sam though, that seems like a straightforward mistake to me. I think it's likely Will did not consult anyone else, as like, it's his right as a private individual talking to other private individuals.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Why did Will MacAskill choose not to take on board any of the<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarlaZoeC/status/1591524378566696964\"><u> suggestions of Zoe Cremer&nbsp;</u></a>that she set out when she met with him?</p></blockquote><p>My guess is because he thought none of them are very good? I also don't think we should take on board any of their suggestions, and many of them strike me as catastrophic if adopted. I also don't think any of them would have helped with this whole FTX situation, and my guess is some of them would have likely made it worse.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Will MacAskill has expressed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism\"><u>public discomfort</u></a> with the degree of hero-worship towards him. What steps has he taken to reduce this? What plans have decision makers tried to enact to reduce the amount of hero worship in EA?</p></blockquote><p>I don't know a ton of stuff that Will has done. I do think me and others have tried various things over the years to reduce hero worship. On Lesswrong and the EA Forum I downvote things that seem hero-worshippy to me, and I have written many comments over the years trying to reduce it. We also designed the frontpage guidelines on LW to reduce some of the associated community dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>I do think this is a bit of a point of disagreement between me and others in the community, where I have had more concerns about this domain than others, but my sense is everyone is pretty broadly on-board with reducing this.

What approaches are they taking community wide rather than just dealing with ad hoc incidents?</p></blockquote><p>I do think it is indeed really sad that people fear reprisal for disagreement. I think this is indeed a pretty big problem, not really because EA is worse here than the rest of the world, but because I think the standard for success is really high on this dimension, and there is a lot of value in encouraging dissent and pushing back against conformity, far into the tails of the distribution here.&nbsp;</p><p>I expect the community health team to have discussed this extensively (like, I have discussed it with them for many hours). There are lots of things attempted to help with this over the years. We branded one EAG after \"keeping EA weird\", we encouraged formats like whiteboard debates at EAG to show that disagreement among highly-engaged people is common, we added things like disagree-voting in addition to normal upvoting and downvoting to encourage a culture where it's normal and expected that someone can write something that many people disagree with, without that thing being punished.&nbsp;</p><p>My sense is this all isn't really enough, and we still kind of suck at it, but I also don't think it's an ignored problem in the space. I also think this problem gets harder and harder the more you grow, and larger communities trying to take coordinated action require more conformity to function, and this sucks, and is I think one of the strongest arguments against growth.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>A number of people have expressed suspicion or worry that they have been rejected from grants because of publicly expressing disagreements with EA.

I am just trying to use my experience at EA Funds for some evidence about how these things usually go.</i></p><p>At least historically in my work at EA Funds this would be the opposite of how I usually evaluate grants. A substantial fraction of my notes consist of complaining that people seem too conformist to me and feel a bit like \"EA bots\" who somewhat blindly accept EA canon in ways that feels bad to me.&nbsp;</p><p>My sense is other grantmakers are less anti-conformity, but in-general, at least in my interactions with Open Phil and EA Funds grantmakers, I've seen basically nothing that I could meaningfully describe as punishing dissent.&nbsp;</p><p>I do think there are secondary things going on here where de-facto people have a really hard time evaluating ideas that are not expressed in their native ontology, and there is a thing where if you say stuff that seems weird from an EA framework this can come across as cringe to some people, and I do hate a bunch of those cringe reactions, and I think think it contributes a lot to conformity. I think that kind of stuff is indeed pretty bad, though I think almost all of the people who I've seen do this kind of thing would at least in the abstract strongly agree that punishing dissent is quite bad, and that we should be really careful around this domain, and have been excited about actively starting prices for criticism, etc.</p><blockquote><p>FTX Future Fund decided to fund me on a project working on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.resiliencer.org/about-us\"><u>SRM and GCR</u></a>, but refused to publicise it on their website.

I continue to in no way speak on behalf of funds, and this is all just my personal opinion.&nbsp;</i></p><p>I would have to look through the data, but my guess is about 20% of EA Funds funding is distributed privately, though a lot of that happens via referring grants to private donors (i.e. most of this does not come from the public EA Funds funding). About three-quarters (in terms of dollar amount) of this is to individuals who have a strong preference for privacy, and the other quarter is for stuff that's more involved in policy and politics where there is some downside risk of being associated with EA in both directions (sometimes the policy project would prefer to not be super publicly associated and evaluated by an EA source, sometimes a project seems net-positive, but EA Funds doesn't want to signal that it's an EA-endorsed project).&nbsp;</p><p>SFF used to have a policy of allowing grant recommenders to prevent a grant from showing up publicly, but we abolished that power in recent rounds, so now all grants show up publicly.</p><p>I personally really dislike private funding arrangements and find it kind of shady and have pushed back a bunch on them at EA Funds, though I can see the case for them in some quite narrow set of cases. I personally quite dislike not publicly talking about policy project grants, since like, I think they are actually often worth the most scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>What sort of coordination, if any, goes on around which EAs talk to the media, write highly publicised books, go in curricula etc? What is the decision making procedure like?</p></blockquote><p>There is no formal government here. If you do something that annoys a really quite substantial fraction of people at EA organizations, or people on the EA Forum, or any other large natural interest group in EA, there is some chance that someone at CEA (or maybe Open Phil) reaches out to someone doing a lot of things very publicly and asks them to please stop it (maybe backed up with some threat of the Effective Altruism trademark that I think CEA owns)</p><p>I think this is a difficult balance, and asking people to please associate less with EA can also easily contribute to a climate of conformity and fear, so I don't really know what the right balance here is. I think on the margin I would like the world to understand better that EA has no central government, and anyone can basically say whatever they want and claim that it's on behalf of EA, instead of trying to develop some kind of party-line that all people associated with EA must follow.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The image, both internally and externally, of SBF was that he lived a frugal lifestyle, which it turns out was completely untrue (and not majorly secret).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/sam-bankman-fried-high-risk-approach-to-crypto-and-doing-good/\"><u>Was this known when Rob Wiblin interviewed SBF on the 80000 Hours podcast and held up SBF for his frugality?</u></a></p></blockquote><p>I do think this was a quite misleading narrative (though I do want to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ohabryka/status/1591695184588591106\">push back</a> on your statement of it being \"completely untrue\"), and people made a pretty bad mistake endorsing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Up until yesterday I thought that indeed 80k fucked up pretty badly here, but I talked a bit to Max Dalton and my guess is the UK EAs seemed to maybe know a lot less about how Sam was living than people here in the Bay Area, and it's now plausible to me (though still overall unlikely) that Rob did just genuinely not know that Sam was actually living a quite lavish lifestyle in many ways.&nbsp;</p><p>I had drafted an angry message to Rob Wiblin when the interview came out that I ended up not sending because it was a bit too angry that went approximately something like \"Why the hell did you tell this story of SBF being super frugal in your interview when you know totally well that he lives in one of the most expensive apartments in the Bahamas and has a private jet\".

It also doesn't explain the decision around the choice of campaign manager etc.</li><li>With regards to buying twitter: whilst it is Will's right to do whatever he wants, it really does call into question whether it is correct for him to be the \"leader of EA\" (or EA to have a defacto leader in such a way). If he has that role, surely he has certain responsibilities, and if he doesn't want to fulfil those responsibilities, surely its time for him to step away from that role? I guess maybe I think that a fuck up as big as how hard Will vouched for SBF should hugely call into question how much power we should be giving Will.</li><li>With regards to Zoe's ideas, I think I would actually like to see Will's reasoning. A number of them could have been run as &nbsp;experiments anyway (more democratic funding via delibrative groups, debates/double cruxxing etc at EAGs etc.), so it doesn't seem the justification for implementing nothing is that strong. But nonetheless I would like to see the justification from Will.</li><li>With regards to hero worshipping, I guess the fact Will has done little to reduce it should be pretty concerning to us.</li><li>With regards to the fear of disagreement, I do braodly agree things are getting done, and I thank you for your work with the disagree vote on the forum. I still think the Karma system messes with things anyway, but thanks for implementing that. I do however think we need much braoder discussions about this.</li><li>With regards to private funding, I think its important to note it was FTX Future Funds decision to make the funding private; I wanted it public, indeed, I did publicise this on my website. This was funding not given through a recommendation or a regranter but directly, that me as the grantee wanted to be public knowledge.</li><li>With regards to coordiantion and the media, there does however seem to be decent levels of coordination. Will's book got about $10 Million in funding (edit- this is unconfirmed although I have heard it from multiple sources, and I think the number is pretty plausible given how many adverts etc. the book got- I should also say if it was that much, I think it was probably a good use of money) and far more converage than even Toby's book got. It seems to always be the same faces talking to the media (ie mostly Will to be honest), so either there is coordination, or Will is not pointing journalists to other members of the community to talk to. I guess either naturally EA has developed some kind of internal government which those who have that power should probably try and reduce, or there has been some coordiantion here and making and encouraging Will (and I guess until recently to a lesser extent SBF) the face of EA was some kind of more delibrate decision.

Maybe I should write a longer post on this, but my general observation is that many people have suddenly started looking for the \"adults in the room\", mostly so that they can say \"why didn't the adults prevent this bad thing from happening?\", and that they have decided that \"EA Leadership\" are the adults.&nbsp;</p><p>But I'm not sure \"EA Leadership\" is really a thing, since EA is a movement of all kinds of people doing all kinds of things, and so \"EA Leadership\" fails to identify specific people who <i>actually have any responsibility towards you. </i>The result is that these kinds of questions end up either being vague or suggesting some kind of mysterious shadowy council of \"EA Leaders\" who are secretly doing naughty things.</p><p>It gets worse! When people do look for an identifiable figure to blame, the only person who looks vaguely like a leader is Will, so they pick on him. But Will is not the CEO of EA! He's a philosopher who writes books about EA and has received a bunch of funding to do PR stuff. But people <i>really want</i> him to be the CEO of EA so they can be angry that he's not being more CEO-like, and that seems pretty unfair to me.</p><p>But I think the reality is: there are no adults in the room, who are managing everything behind the scenes, and who you can be angry at for failing you. There are a lot of people doing various specific ways, and working with each other in various more-or-less coordinated ways. \"EA\" does not do things, \"EA\" did not \"endorse\" SBF. Some specific individuals may have done this, but the shadowy council of EA Leadership did not meet at midnight to declare SBF the Chosen Saviour.</p><p>Habryka gave nice answers to the questions already, which is great. Here are some grumpy answers:</p><ul><li>Why is the attendance of the Coordination forum secret? Why should it be open? It's a get-together for some people to talk to each other, why are they obliged to be super-transparent to you? It's not the Secret Gathering of EA Leadership.</li><li>Why did Will not consult people before he talked to Elon? Because he's an individual who can do his own thing, and there's no Council of Elders of EA to be \"consulted\" at times like this.&nbsp;</li><li>Why did Will not adopt Zoe's suggestions? Is that <i>Will's job</i>? To enforce the uptake of structural reforms across EA? Sounds like the sort of thing the CEO of an organization might be responsible for... but Will isn't the CEO of EA.</li><li>Why isn't Will doing something about people hero-worshipping him? Because that's also not his job? If you're concerned about people hero-worshipping Will, perhaps you should get angry at the people doing it instead of Will, who's not obviously doing anything to encourage it.</li><li>Why has the community health team not solved emergent social problems on the forum? Because that's hard? And maybe also not their job? Perhaps <i>we as a community</i> should be being nicer to people.</li><li>What is the decision-making procedure for things going into the media? There probably isn't one? That would imply a some kind of central EA comms org, which doesn't exist. CEA has a comms department, but I think they mostly help people out when requested. Probably any number of orgs do their own comms stuff as they see fit.</li><li>I won't comment on Carrick except that Habryka points out that <i>Carrick did it</i>, again, no anointing by EA Leadership or anything.</li></ul><p>To be clear, I'm not saying we as a community get a free pass, nor that specific individuals or organizations shouldn't get some criticism.

In particular, when exploring an area of knowledge with others, we can perform in roles such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Truth-building roles</strong>: mutual truth-seeking involving exchange of truthful information\n<ul>\n<li><strong>scout</strong> (explores information and develops truthful information for themselves)</li>\n<li><strong>soldier</strong> (attacks and defends ideas in a ways that self-convince of existing beliefs)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Manipulative roles</strong>: at least one side seeking to manipulate the other without regard for the other's interests\n<ul>\n<li><strong>salesperson</strong> (sells ideas and gathers information)</li>\n<li><strong>actor/actress</strong> (performs theatrics and optionally gathers information)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Scout and Soldier model breaks down when people believe that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the truth is cheap and readily accessible, and so communication about important topics should serve other purposes than truth-building.</li>\n<li>everyone else is engaged in manipulating rather  than truth-building, and so it's better to either withdraw or join everyone else in theatrics and sales.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of several lessons I drew from Galef's excellent work was the contrast between those who are self-serving and those who are open to contradiction by better information. However, a salesperson can gather truthful information from you, like a scout, develop an excellent map of the territory, and then lie to your face about the territory, leaving you with a worse map than before. Persons in the role of actors can accomplish many different goals with their theatrics, none of which are conducive to scouts engaged with them in developing truthful information.</p>\n<p>I like being a scout, almost to a fault but for my own benefit. However, when exploring knowledge with others, that's too difficult if their soldier or scout behaviors are neither, but actually sales or acting.

They are an amalgam of information, with lots of scenarios not properly represented, for I don't know what reasons, frankly. Not to mention that the science changes quickly, faster than Assessment Reports are released by the IPCC.

As someone who has worked on campaigns and follows politics, I thought the campaign had a pretty low chance of success because of the fundamentals (and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qi9nnrmjwNbBqWbNT/the-best-usd5-800-i-ve-ever-donated-to-pandemic-prevention?commentId=rxhT2WhvqzFJyjFHL\">asked</a> about it at the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qi9nnrmjwNbBqWbNT/the-best-usd5-800-i-ve-ever-donated-to-pandemic-prevention?commentId=9MPSrMPnLCaLHFst8\">time</a>) and that other races would have been better to donate to (either state house races to build the bench or congressional candidates with better odds like Maxwell Frost, a local activist who ran for the open seat previously held by Val Demings, listed pandemic prevention as a priority, and won. Then again, Maxwell raised a ton of money, more than all the other candidates combined, so maybe he didn't need those funds as much as other candidates). Salinas was a popular, progressive, woman of color with local party support who already represented much of the district at the state level and helped draw the new one. So, it seemed pretty unlikely to me that she would lose to someone who had not lived in the state for years, did not have strong local connections, and had never run a campaign before, even with a massive money advantage. And from what I understand, the people in the district were oversaturated with ads to the point of many being annoyed. So I think of this as probably being an example where EAs would have benefitted from relying on more outside experts for which races to pick and how to run a campaign. There were <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/List_of_U.S._Congress_incumbents_who_did_not_run_for_re-election_in_2022\">a lot of congressional retirements</a> this year, and there were probably better seats to try to win. Of course, nothing is going to guarantee a win though.<br><br><strong>On FTX:</strong> And it seems like if anyone had thought to ask to look at FTX's balance sheets, things might have been different? At least, considering what a mess those balance sheets are (or whatever records make sense, I'm not a financial expert)? If FTX refused or if they shared something that didn't make sense, maybe that would have been a warning sign. So that seems like another example of where more outside expertise could have maybe been beneficial and saved a lot of headaches. Individually, maybe no one has an incentive to vet FTX even if they get a grant from them. But if we care about the EA ecosystem as a whole, and hundreds of millions suddenly start pouring in from a new source, maybe someone with the relevant financial and accounting expertise should at least request to look at the balance sheets of the new megafunder, especially when it comes from an industry full of crashes and scams. I'm not sure if this would have changed things but the fact that it doesn't seem to have happened means there are probably many other things that we are missing. Things that people with relevant expertise are more likely to see. And I know people have said \"well look all these other VCs missed it, they never looked into it\" but EA sort of prides itself on NOT just doing what everyone else does but using reason and evidence to be more effective. We could have had a process for investigating any new megafunder a bit more thoroughly, perhaps with the help of outside experts. Not just donating to the same charities or picking the same career paths or volunteering for the same organizations just because other people do but being <i>effective</i>. So why would we think this is a good reason for failing to attempt better due diligence with respect to movement finances?

If Will went out and said \"Actually EAs believe that abortion should be outlawed with no exceptions for rape or to save the life of the mother\", and I don't personally endorse this claim but have been talking about how I am an EA at work, the damage is done regardless of whether he's \"the CEO of EA\" or just a philosopher. If he and his team has chosen to spread longtermism by writing a book and marketing it, then it comes with the responsibility of being in the public eye, and answering for things he says or actions he takes that people will interpret as \"this is what EA is about\"/\"this is what longtermism is about\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>But I think the reality is: there are no adults in the room, who are managing everything behind the scenes, and who you can be angry at for failing you.</p><p>There are a lot of people doing various specific ways, and working with each other in various more-or-less coordinated ways. \"EA\" does not do things, \"EA\" did not \"endorse\" SBF.

But some people in the EA community have more power and influence than me and can do so. So while there might not be a shadowy council of EA leadership, there are people who make decisions that affect and shape the EA movement in much greater ways than I can.

In this case, transparency might leada to more accountability, or it might lead to more decentralized decision making.
