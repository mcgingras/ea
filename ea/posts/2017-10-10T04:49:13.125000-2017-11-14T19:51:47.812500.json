We recommend reading it alongside Katja Grace's </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jzWxsrJqcAcHmYM7r/beyond-fire-alarms-freeing-the-groupstruck\"><i>recent response</i></a><i>.

Five out of the eight groups didn't react or report the smoke, even as it became dense enough to make them start coughing. Subsequent manipulations showed that a lone student will respond 75% of the time; while a student accompanied by two actors told to feign apathy will respond only 10% of the time. This and other experiments seemed to pin down that what's happening is pluralistic ignorance. We don't want to look panicky by being afraid of what isn't an emergency, so we try to look calm while glancing out of the corners of our eyes to see how others are reacting, but of course they are also trying to look calm.</p><p>(I've read a number of replications and variations on this research, and the effect size is blatant. I would not expect this to be one of the results that dies to the replication crisis, and I haven't yet heard about the replication crisis touching it. But we have to put a maybe-not marker on everything now.)</p><p>A fire alarm creates common knowledge, in the you-know-I-know sense, that there is a fire; after which it is socially safe to react. When the fire alarm goes off, you know that everyone else knows there is a fire, you know you won't lose face if you proceed to exit the building.</p><p>The fire alarm doesn't tell us with certainty that a fire is there. In fact, I can't recall one time in my life when, exiting a building on a fire alarm, there was an actual fire. Really, a fire alarm is <i>weaker</i> evidence of fire than smoke coming from under a door.</p><p>But the fire alarm tells us that it's socially okay to react to the fire. It promises us with certainty that we won't be embarrassed if we now proceed to exit in an orderly fashion.</p><p>It seems to me that this is one of the cases where people have mistaken beliefs about what they believe, like when somebody loudly endorsing their city's team to win the big game will back down as soon as asked to bet. They haven't consciously distinguished the rewarding exhilaration of shouting that the team will win, from the feeling of anticipating the team will win.</p><p>When people look at the smoke coming from under the door, I think they think their uncertain wobbling feeling comes from not assigning the fire a high-enough probability of really being there, and that they're reluctant to act for fear of wasting effort and time. If so, I think they're interpreting their own feelings mistakenly. If that was so, they'd get the same wobbly feeling on hearing the fire alarm, or even more so, because fire alarms correlate to fire less than does smoke coming from under a door. The uncertain wobbling feeling comes from the worry that others believe differently, not the worry that the fire isn't there. The reluctance to act is the reluctance to be seen looking foolish, not the reluctance to waste effort. That's why the student alone in the room does something about the fire 75% of the time, and why people have no trouble reacting to the much weaker evidence presented by fire alarms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>* * *</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's now and then proposed that we ought to start reacting later to the issues of Artificial General Intelligence (<a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/03/so_far_unfriend.html\">background here</a>), because, it is said, we are so far away from it that it just isn't possible to do productive work on it today.</p><p>(For direct argument about there being things doable today, see: Soares and Fallenstein (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\">2014/2017</a>); Amodei, Olah, Steinhardt, Christiano, Schulman, and Man\u00e9 (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565\">2016</a>); or Taylor, Yudkowsky, LaVictoire, and Critch (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2017/02/28/using-machine-learning/\">2016</a>).)</p><p>(If none of those papers existed or if you were an AI researcher who'd read them but thought they were all garbage, and you wished you could work on alignment but knew of nothing you could do, the wise next step would be to sit down and spend two hours by the clock sincerely trying to think of possible approaches. Preferably without self-sabotage that makes sure you don't come up with anything plausible; as might happen if, hypothetically speaking, you would actually find it much more comfortable to believe there was nothing you ought to be working on today, because e.g. then you could work on other things that interested you more.)</p><p>(But never mind.)</p><p>So if AGI seems far-ish away, and you think the conclusion licensed by this is that you can't do any productive work on AGI alignment yet, then the implicit alternative strategy on offer is: Wait for some unspecified future event that tells us AGI is coming near; and <i>then</i> we'll all know that it's okay to start working on AGI alignment.</p><p>This seems to me to be wrong on a number of grounds. Here are some of them.</p><p><strong>One:</strong> As Stuart Russell observed, if you get radio signals from space and spot a spaceship there with your telescopes and you know the aliens are landing in thirty years, you still start thinking about that today.</p><p>You're not like, \"Meh, that's thirty years off, whatever.\" You certainly don't casually say \"Well, there's nothing we can do until they're closer.\" Not without spending two hours, or at least <a href=\"http://www.readthesequences.com/MotivatedStoppingAndMotivatedContinuation\">five minutes</a> by the clock, brainstorming about whether there is anything you ought to be starting now.</p><p>If you said the aliens were coming in thirty years and you were therefore going to do nothing today... well, if these were <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10155616782514228\">more effective time</a>s, somebody would ask for a schedule of what you thought ought to be done, starting when, how long before the aliens arrive. If you didn't have that schedule ready, they'd know that you weren't operating according to a worked table of timed responses, but just procrastinating and doing nothing; and they'd correctly infer that you probably hadn't searched very hard for things that could be done today.</p><p>In Bryan Caplan's terms, anyone who seems quite casual about the fact that \"nothing can be done now to prepare\" about the aliens is <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html\">missing a mood</a>; they should be much more alarmed at not being able to think of any way to prepare. And maybe ask if somebody else has come up with any ideas? But never mind.</p><p><strong>Two:</strong> History shows that for the general public, and even for scientists not in a key inner circle, and even for scientists <i>in</i> that key circle, it is very often the case that key technological developments still seem decades away, five years before they show up.</p><p>In 1901, two years before helping build the first heavier-than-air flyer, Wilbur Wright told his brother that powered flight was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ldxfLyNIk9wC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%22i+said+to+my+brother+orville%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioiseChcnWAhWL-VQKHab6AqMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22i%20said%20to%20my%20brother%20orville%22&amp;f=false\">fifty years away</a>.</p><p>In 1939, three years before he personally oversaw the first critical chain reaction in a pile of uranium bricks, Enrico Fermi voiced <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=aSgFMMNQ6G4C&amp;pg=PA813&amp;lpg=PA813&amp;dq=weart+fermi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jy1pBOUL10&amp;sig=c9wK_yLHbXZS_GFIv0K3bgpmE58&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNofKsisnWAhXGlFQKHbOSB1QQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ten%20per%20cent%22&amp;f=false\">90% confidence</a> that it was <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/h8m/being_halfrational_about_pascals_wager_is_even/\">impossible</a> to use uranium to sustain a fission chain reaction. I believe Fermi also said a year after that, aka two years before the denouement, that <i>if</i> net power from fission was even possible (as he then granted some greater plausibility) then it would be fifty years off; but for this I neglected to keep the citation.</p><p>And of course if you're not the Wright Brothers or Enrico Fermi, you will be even more surprised. Most of the world learned that atomic weapons were now a thing when they woke up to the headlines about Hiroshima. There were esteemed intellectuals saying <a href=\"https://www.xaprb.com/blog/flight-is-impossible/\">four years <i>after</i> the Wright Flyer</a> that heavier-than-air flight was impossible, because knowledge propagated more slowly back then.</p><p>Were there events that, in <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Hindsight-Devalues-Science\">hindsight</a>, today, we can see as signs that heavier-than-air flight or nuclear energy were nearing? Sure, but if you go back and read the actual newspapers from that time and see what people actually said about it then, you'll see that they did not know that these were signs, or that they were very uncertain that these might be signs. Some playing the part of Excited Futurists proclaimed that big changes were imminent, I expect, and others playing the part of Sober Scientists tried to pour cold water on all that childish enthusiasm; I expect that part was more or less exactly the same decades earlier. If somewhere in that din was a superforecaster who said \"decades\" when it was decades and \"5 years\" when it was five, good luck noticing them amid all the noise. More likely, the superforecasters were the ones who said \"Could be tomorrow, could be decades\" both when the big development was a day away and when it was decades away.</p><p>One of the major modes by which hindsight bias makes us feel that the past was more predictable than anyone was actually able to predict at the time, is that in hindsight we know what we ought to notice, and we fixate on only one thought as to what each piece of evidence indicates. If you look at what people actually say at the time, historically, they've usually got no clue what's about to happen three months before it happens, because they don't know which signs are which.</p><p>I mean, you <i>could</i> say the words \u201cAGI is 50 years away\u201d and have those words happen to be true. People were also saying that powered flight was decades away when it was in fact decades away, and those people happened to be right. The problem is that everything looks the same to you either way, if you are actually living history instead of reading about it afterwards.</p><p>It's not that whenever somebody says \"fifty years\" the thing always happens in two years. It's that this confident prediction of things being far away corresponds to an epistemic state about the technology that feels the same way internally until you are very very close to the big development. It's the epistemic state of \"Well, I don't see how to do the thing\" and sometimes you say that fifty years off from the big development, and sometimes you say it two years away, and sometimes you say it while the Wright Flyer is flying somewhere out of your sight.</p><p><strong>Three:</strong> Progress is driven by peak knowledge, not average knowledge.</p><p>If Fermi and the Wrights couldn't see it coming three years out, imagine how hard it must be for anyone else to see it.</p><p>If you're not at the global peak of knowledge of how to do the thing, and looped in on all the progress being made at what will turn out to be the leading project, you aren't going to be able to see of your own knowledge <i>at all</i> that the big development is imminent. Unless you are very good at perspective-taking in a way that wasn't necessary in a hunter-gatherer tribe, and very good at realizing that other people may know techniques and ideas of which you have no inkling even that you do not know them. If you don't consciously compensate for the lessons of history in this regard; then you will promptly say the decades-off thing. Fermi wasn't still thinking that net nuclear energy was impossible or decades away by the time he got to 3 months before he built the first pile, because at that point Fermi was looped in on everything and saw how to do it. But anyone not looped in probably still felt like it was fifty years away while the actual pile was fizzing away in a squash court at the University of Chicago.</p><p>People don't seem to automatically compensate for the fact that the timing of the big development is a function of the peak knowledge in the field, a threshold touched by the people who know the most and have the best ideas; while they themselves have average knowledge; and therefore what they themselves know is not strong evidence about when the big development happens. I think they aren't thinking about that at all, and they just eyeball it using their own sense of difficulty. If they are thinking anything more deliberate and reflective than that, and incorporating real work into correcting for the factors that might bias their lenses, they haven't bothered writing down their reasoning anywhere I can read it.</p><p>To know that AGI is decades away, we would need enough understanding of AGI to know what pieces of the puzzle are missing, and how hard these pieces are to obtain; and that kind of insight is unlikely to be available until the puzzle is complete. Which is also to say that to anyone outside the leading edge, the puzzle will look more incomplete than it looks on the edge. That project may publish their theories in advance of proving them, although I hope not. But there are unproven theories now too.</p><p>And again, that's not to say that people saying \"fifty years\" is a certain sign that something is happening in a squash court; they were saying \u201cfifty years\u201d sixty years ago too. It's saying that anyone who thinks technological <i>timelines</i> are actually forecastable, in advance, by people who are not looped in to the leading project's progress reports and who don't share all the best ideas about exactly how to do the thing and how much effort is required for that, is learning the wrong lesson from history. In particular, from reading history books that neatly lay out lines of progress and their visible signs that we all know <i>now</i> were important and evidential. It's sometimes possible to say useful conditional things about the consequences of the big development whenever it happens, but it\u2019s rarely possible to make confident predictions about the <i>timing</i> of those developments, beyond a one- or two-year horizon. And if you are one of the rare people who can call the timing, if people like that even exist, nobody else knows to pay attention to you and not to the Excited Futurists or Sober Skeptics.</p><p><strong>Four:</strong> The future uses different tools, and can therefore easily do things that are very hard now, or do with difficulty things that are impossible now.</p><p>Why do we know that AGI is decades away? In popular articles penned by heads of AI research labs and the like, there are typically three prominent reasons given:</p><p>(A) The author does not know how to build AGI using present technology. The author does not know where to start.</p><p>(B) The author thinks it is really very hard to do the impressive things that modern AI technology does, they have to slave long hours over a hot GPU farm tweaking hyperparameters to get it done. They think that the public does not appreciate how hard it is to get anything done right now, and is panicking prematurely because the public thinks anyone can just fire up Tensorflow and build a robotic car.</p><p>(C) The author spends a lot of time interacting with AI systems and therefore is able to personally appreciate all the ways in which they are still stupid and lack common sense.</p><p>We've now considered some aspects of argument A. Let's consider argument B for a moment.</p><p>Suppose I say: \"It is now possible for one comp-sci grad to do in a week anything that N+ years ago the research community could do with neural networks <i>at all</i>.\" How large is N?</p><p>I got some answers to this on Twitter from people whose credentials I don't know, but the most common answer was five, which sounds about right to me based on my own acquaintance with machine learning. (Though obviously not as a literal universal, because reality is never that neat.) If you could do something in 2012 period, you can probably do it fairly straightforwardly with modern GPUs, Tensorflow, Xavier initialization, batch normalization, ReLUs, and Adam or RMSprop or just stochastic gradient descent with momentum. The modern techniques are just that much better. To be sure, there are things we can't do now with just those simple methods, things that require tons more work, but those things were not possible at all in 2012.</p><p>In machine learning, when you can do something at all, you are probably at most a few years away from being able to do it easily using the future's much superior tools. From this standpoint, argument B, \"You don't understand how hard it is to do what we do,\" is something of a non-sequitur when it comes to timing.</p><p>Statement B sounds to me like the same sentiment voiced by Rutherford <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015\">in 1933</a> when he called net energy from atomic fission \"moonshine\". If you were a nuclear physicist in 1933 then you had to split all your atoms by hand, by bombarding them with other particles, and it was a laborious business. If somebody talked about getting net energy from atoms, maybe it made you feel that you were unappreciated, that people thought your job was easy.</p><p>But of course this will always be the lived experience for AI engineers on serious frontier projects. You don't get paid big bucks to do what a grad student can do in a week (unless you're working for a bureaucracy with no clue about AI; but that's not Google or FB). Your personal experience will <i>always</i> be that what you are paid to spend months doing is difficult. A change in this personal experience is therefore not something you can use as a fire alarm.</p><p>Those playing the part of wiser sober skeptical scientists would obviously agree in the abstract that our tools will improve; but in the popular articles they pen, they just talk about the painstaking difficulty of this year's tools. I think that when they're in that mode they are not even trying to forecast what the tools will be like in 5 years; they haven't written down any such arguments as part of the articles I've read. I think that when they tell you that AGI is decades off, they are literally giving an estimate of <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/UnboundedScalesHugeJuryAwardsAndFuturism\">how long it feels to them</a> like it would take to build AGI using their current tools and knowledge. Which is why they emphasize how hard it is to stir the heap of linear algebra until it spits out good answers; I think they are not imagining, at all, into how this experience may change over considerably less than fifty years. If they've explicitly considered the bias of estimating future tech timelines based on their present subjective sense of difficulty, and tried to compensate for that bias, they haven't written that reasoning down anywhere I've read it. Nor have I ever heard of that forecasting method giving good results historically.</p><p><strong>Five:</strong> Okay, let's be blunt here. I don't think most of the discourse about AGI being far away (<i>or</i> that it's near) is being generated by models of future progress in machine learning. I don't think we're looking at wrong models; I think we're looking at no models.</p><p>I was once at a conference where there was a panel full of famous AI luminaries, and most of the luminaries were nodding and agreeing with each other that of course AGI was very far off, except for two famous AI luminaries who stayed quiet and let others take the microphone.</p><p>I got up in Q&amp;A and said, \"Okay, you've all told us that progress won't be all that fast. But let's be more concrete and specific. I'd like to know what's the <i>least</i> impressive accomplishment that you are very confident <i>cannot</i> be done in the next two years.\"</p><p>There was a silence.</p><p>Eventually, two people on the panel ventured replies, spoken in a rather more tentative tone than they'd been using to pronounce that AGI was decades out. They named \"A robot puts away the dishes from a dishwasher without breaking them\", and <a href=\"http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html\">Winograd schemas</a>. Specifically, \"I feel quite confident that the Winograd schemas--where we recently had a result that was in the 50, 60% range--in the next two years, we will not get 80, 90% on that regardless of the techniques people use.\"</p><p>A few months after that panel, there was unexpectedly a big breakthrough on Winograd schemas. The breakthrough didn't crack 80%, so three cheers for wide credibility intervals with error margin, but I expect the predictor might be feeling slightly more nervous now with one year left to go. (I don't think it was the breakthrough I remember reading about, but Rob turned up <a href=\"https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0326.pdf\">this paper</a> as an example of one that could have been submitted at most 44 days after the above conference and gets up to 70%.)</p><p>But that's not the point. The point is the silence that fell after my question, and that eventually I only got two replies, spoken in tentative tones. When I asked for concrete feats that were impossible in the next two years, I think that that's when the luminaries on that panel switched to trying to build a mental model of future progress in machine learning, asking themselves what they could or couldn't predict, what they knew or didn't know. And to their credit, most of them did know their profession well enough to realize that forecasting future boundaries around a rapidly moving field is actually <i>really hard</i>, that nobody knows what will appear on arXiv next month, and that they needed to put wide credibility intervals with very generous upper bounds on how much progress might take place twenty-four months' worth of arXiv papers later.</p><p>(Also, Demis Hassabis was present, so they all knew that if they named something insufficiently impossible, Demis would have DeepMind go and do it.)</p><p>The question I asked was in a completely different genre from the panel discussion, requiring a mental context switch: the assembled luminaries actually had to try to consult their rough, scarce-formed intuitive models of progress in machine learning and figure out what future experiences, if any, their model of the field definitely prohibited within a two-year time horizon. Instead of, well, emitting socially desirable verbal behavior meant to kill that darned hype about AGI and get some predictable applause from the audience.</p><p>I'll be blunt: I don't think the confident long-termism has been thought out at all. If your model has the extraordinary power to say what will be impossible in ten years after another one hundred and twenty months of arXiv papers, then you ought to be able to say much weaker things that are impossible in two years, and you should have those predictions queued up and ready to go rather than falling into nervous silence after being asked.</p><p>In reality, the two-year problem is hard and the ten-year problem is laughably hard. The future is hard to predict in general, our predictive grasp on a rapidly changing and advancing field of science and engineering is very weak indeed, and it doesn't permit narrow credible intervals on what can't be done.</p><p>Grace et al. (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08807\">2017</a>) surveyed the predictions of 352 presenters at ICML and NIPS 2015. Respondents\u2019 aggregate forecast was that the proposition \u201call occupations are fully automatable\u201d (in the sense that \u201cfor any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers\u201d) will not reach 50% probability until 121 years hence. Except that a randomized subset of respondents were instead asked the slightly different question of \u201cwhen unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers\u201d, and in this case held that this was 50% likely to occur <a href=\"http://www.bayesianinvestor.com/blog/index.php/2017/06/01/do-ai-experts-exist/\">within 44 years</a>.</p><p>That's what happens when you ask people to produce an estimate they can't estimate, and there's a social sense of what the desirable verbal behavior is supposed to be.</p><p>* * *</p><p>When I observe that there's no fire alarm for AGI, I'm not saying that there's no possible equivalent of smoke appearing from under a door.</p><p>What I'm saying rather is that the smoke under the door is always going to be arguable; it is not going to be a clear and undeniable and absolute sign of fire; and so there is never going to be a fire alarm producing common knowledge that action is now due and socially acceptable.</p><p>There's an old trope saying that as soon as something is actually done, it ceases to be called AI. People who work in AI and are in a broad sense pro-accelerationist and techno-enthusiast, what you might call the Kurzweilian camp (of which I am not a member), will sometimes rail against this as unfairness in judgment, as moving goalposts.</p><p>This overlooks a real and important phenomenon of adverse selection against AI accomplishments: If you can do something impressive-sounding with AI in 1974, then that is because that thing turned out to be doable in some cheap cheaty way, not because 1974 was so amazingly great at AI. We are uncertain about how much cognitive effort it takes to perform tasks, and how easy it is to cheat at them, and the first \"impressive\" tasks to be accomplished will be those where we were most wrong about how much effort was required. There was a time when some people thought that a computer winning the world chess championship would require progress in the direction of AGI, and that this would count as a sign that AGI was getting closer. When Deep Blue beat Kasparov in 1997, in a Bayesian sense we did learn something about progress in AI, but we also learned something about chess being easy. Considering the techniques used to construct Deep Blue, most of what we learned was \"It is surprisingly possible to play chess without easy-to-generalize techniques\" and not much \"A surprising amount of progress has been made toward AGI.\"</p><p>Was AlphaGo smoke under the door, a sign of AGI in 10 years or less? People had previously given Go as an example of What You See Before The End.</p><p>Looking over the paper describing AlphaGo's architecture, it seemed to me that we <i>were</i> mostly learning that available AI techniques were likely to go further towards generality than expected, rather than about Go being surprisingly easy to achieve with fairly narrow and ad-hoc approaches. Not that the method scales to AGI, obviously; but AlphaGo did look like a product of <i>relatively</i> general insights and techniques being turned on the special case of Go, in a way that Deep Blue wasn\u2019t. I also updated significantly on \"The general learning capabilities of the human cortical algorithm are less impressive, less difficult to capture with a ton of gradient descent and a zillion GPUs, than I thought,\" because if there were anywhere we expected an impressive hard-to-match highly-natural-selected but-still-general cortical algorithm to come into play, it would be in humans playing Go.</p><p>Maybe if we'd seen a thousand Earths undergoing similar events, we'd gather the statistics and find that a computer winning the planetary Go championship is a reliable ten-year-harbinger of AGI. But I don't actually know that. Neither do you. Certainly, anyone can publicly argue that we just learned Go was easier to achieve with strictly narrow techniques than expected, as was true many times in the past. There's no possible sign short of actual AGI, no case of smoke from under the door, for which we know that this is definitely serious fire and now AGI is 10, 5, or 2 years away. Let alone a sign where we know everyone else will believe it.</p><p>And in any case, multiple leading scientists in machine learning have already published articles telling us their criterion for a fire alarm. They will believe Artificial General Intelligence is imminent:</p><p>(A) When they personally see how to construct AGI using their current tools. This is what they are always saying is not currently true in order to castigate the folly of those who think AGI might be near.</p><p>(B) When their personal jobs do not give them a sense of everything being difficult. This, they are at pains to say, is a key piece of knowledge not possessed by the ignorant layfolk who think AGI might be near, who only believe that because they have never stayed up until 2AM trying to get a generative adversarial network to stabilize.</p><p>(C) When they are very impressed by how smart their AI is relative to a human being in respects that still feel magical to them; as opposed to the parts they do know how to engineer, which no longer seem magical to them; aka the AI seeming pretty smart in interaction and conversation; aka the AI actually being an AGI already.</p><p>So there isn't going to be a fire alarm. Period.</p><p>There is never going to be a time before the end when you can look around nervously, and see that it is now clearly common knowledge that you can talk about AGI being imminent, and take action and exit the building in an orderly fashion, without fear of looking stupid or frightened.</p><p>* * *</p><p>So far as I can presently estimate, now that we've had AlphaGo and a couple of other maybe/maybe-not shots across the bow, and seen a huge explosion of effort invested into machine learning and an enormous flood of papers, we are probably going to occupy our present epistemic state until very near the end.</p><p>By saying we're probably going to be in roughly this epistemic state until almost the end, I <i>don't</i> mean to say we know that AGI is imminent, or that there won't be important new breakthroughs in AI in the intervening time. I mean that it's hard to guess how many further insights are needed for AGI, or how long it will take to reach those insights. After the next breakthrough, we still won't know how many more breakthroughs are needed, leaving us in pretty much the same epistemic state as before. Whatever discoveries and milestones come next, it will probably continue to be hard to guess how many further insights are needed, and timelines will continue to be similarly murky. Maybe researcher enthusiasm and funding will rise further, and we'll be able to say that timelines are shortening; or maybe we\u2019ll hit another AI winter, and we'll know that's a sign indicating that things will take longer than they would otherwise; but we still won't know <i>how long.</i></p><p>At some point we might see a sudden flood of arXiv papers in which really interesting and fundamental and scary cognitive challenges seem to be getting done at an increasing pace. Whereupon, as this flood accelerates, even some who imagine themselves sober and skeptical will be unnerved to the point that they venture that perhaps AGI is only 15 years away now, maybe, possibly. The signs might become so blatant, very soon before the end, that people start thinking it is socially acceptable to say that maybe AGI is 10 years off. Though the signs would have to be pretty darned blatant, if they\u2019re to overcome the social barrier posed by luminaries who are estimating arrival times to AGI using their personal knowledge and personal difficulties, as well as all the historical bad feelings about AI winters caused by hype.</p><p>But even if it becomes socially acceptable to say that AGI is 15 years out, in those last couple of years or months, I would still expect there to be disagreement. There will still be others protesting that, as much as associative memory and human-equivalent cerebellar coordination (or whatever) are now solved problems, they still don't know how to construct AGI. They will note that there are no AIs writing computer science papers, or holding a truly sensible conversation with a human, and castigate the senseless alarmism of those who talk as if we already knew how to do that. They will explain that foolish laypeople don't realize how much pain and tweaking it takes to get the current systems to work. (Although those modern methods can easily do almost anything that was possible in 2017, and any grad student knows how to roll a stable GAN on the first try using the tf.unsupervised module in Tensorflow 5.3.1.)</p><p>When all the pieces are ready and in place, lacking only the last piece to be assembled by the very peak of knowledge and creativity across the whole world, it will still seem to the average ML person that AGI is an enormous challenge looming in the distance, because they still won\u2019t personally know how to construct an AGI system. Prestigious heads of major AI research groups will still be writing <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608986/forget-killer-robotsbias-is-the-real-ai-danger/\">articles</a> decrying the folly of fretting about the total destruction of all Earthly life and all future value it could have achieved, and saying that we should not let this distract us from <i>real, respectable concerns</i> like loan-approval systems accidentally absorbing human biases.</p><p>Of course, the future is very hard to predict in detail. It's so hard that not only do I confess my own inability, I make the far stronger positive statement that nobody else can do it either. The \u201cflood of groundbreaking arXiv papers\u201d scenario is one way things could maybe possibly go, but it's an implausibly specific scenario that I made up for the sake of concreteness. It's certainly not based on my extensive experience watching other Earthlike civilizations develop AGI. I do put a significant chunk of probability mass on \"There's not much sign visible outside a Manhattan Project until Hiroshima,\" because that scenario is simple. Anything more complex is just one more story full of <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Burdensome-Details\">burdensome details</a> that aren't likely to all be true.</p><p>But no matter how the details play out, I do predict in a very general sense that there will be no fire alarm that is not an actual running AGI--no unmistakable sign before then that everyone knows and agrees on, that lets people act without feeling nervous about whether they're worrying too early. That's just not how the history of technology has usually played out in much simpler cases like flight and nuclear engineering, let alone a case like this one where all the signs and models are disputed. We already know enough about the uncertainty and low quality of discussion surrounding this topic to be able to say with confidence that there will be no unarguable socially accepted sign of AGI arriving 10 years, 5 years, or 2 years beforehand. If there\u2019s any general social panic it will be by coincidence, based on terrible reasoning, uncorrelated with real timelines except by total coincidence, set off by a Hollywood movie, and focused on relatively trivial dangers.</p><p>It's no coincidence that nobody has given any actual account of such a fire alarm, and argued convincingly about how much time it means we have left, and what projects we should only then start. If anyone does write that proposal, the next person to write one will say something completely different. And probably neither of them will succeed at convincing me that they know anything prophetic about timelines, or that they've identified any sensible angle of attack that is (a) worth pursuing at all and (b) not worth starting to work on right now.</p><p>* * *</p><p>It seems to me that the decision to delay all action until a nebulous totally unspecified future alarm goes off, implies an order of recklessness great enough that the law of continued failure comes into play.</p><p>The law of continued failure is the rule that says that if your country is incompetent enough to use a plaintext 9-numeric-digit password on all of your bank accounts and credit applications, your country is not competent enough to correct course after the next disaster in which a hundred million passwords are revealed. A civilization competent enough to correct course in response to that prod, to react to it the way you'd want them to react, is competent enough not to make the mistake in the first place. When a system fails massively and obviously, rather than subtly and at the very edges of competence, the next prod is not going to cause the system to suddenly snap into doing things intelligently.</p><p>The law of continued failure is especially important to keep in mind when you are dealing with big powerful systems or high-status people that you might feel nervous about derogating, because you may be tempted to say, \"Well, it's flawed now, but as soon as a future prod comes along, everything will snap into place and everything will be all right.\" The systems about which this fond hope is actually warranted look like they are mostly doing all the important things right already, and only failing in one or two steps of cognition. The fond hope is almost never warranted when a person or organization or government or social subsystem is currently falling massively short.</p><p>The folly required to ignore the prospect of aliens landing in thirty years is already great enough that the other flawed elements of the debate should come as no surprise.</p><p>And with all of that going wrong simultaneously today, we should predict that the same system and incentives won't produce correct outputs after receiving an uncertain sign that maybe the aliens are landing in five years instead. The law of continued failure suggests that if existing authorities failed in enough different ways at once to think that it makes sense to try to derail a conversation about existential risk by saying the real problem is the security on self-driving cars, the default expectation is that they will still be saying silly things later.</p><p>People who make large numbers of simultaneous mistakes don\u2019t generally have all of the incorrect thoughts subconsciously labeled as \"incorrect\" in their heads. Even when motivated, they can't suddenly flip to skillfully executing all-correct reasoning steps instead. Yes, we have various experiments showing that monetary incentives can reduce overconfidence and political bias, but (a) that's reduction rather than elimination, (b) it's with extremely clear short-term direct incentives, not the nebulous and politicizable incentive of \"a lot being at stake\", and (c) that doesn't mean a switch is flipping all the way to \"carry out complicated correct reasoning\". If someone's brain contains a switch that can flip to enable complicated correct reasoning at all, it's got enough internal precision and skill to think mostly-correct thoughts now instead of later--at least to the degree that some conservatism and double-checking gets built into examining the conclusions that people know will get them killed if they\u2019re wrong about them.</p><p>There is no sign and portent, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hp5/after_critical_event_w_happens_they_still_wont/\">no threshold crossed</a>, that suddenly causes people to wake up and start doing things systematically correctly. People who can react that competently to any sign at all, let alone a less-than-perfectly-certain not-totally-agreed item of evidence that is <i>likely</i> a wakeup call, have probably already done the timebinding thing. They've already imagined the future sign coming, and gone ahead and thought sensible thoughts earlier, like Stuart Russell saying, \"If you know the aliens are landing in thirty years, it's still a big deal now.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Back in the funding-starved early days of what is now MIRI, I learned that people who donated last year were likely to donate this year, and people who last year were planning to donate \"next year\" would quite often this year be planning to donate \"next year\". Of course there were genuine transitions from zero to one; everything that happens needs to happen for a first time. There were college students who said \"later\" and gave nothing for a long time in a genuinely strategically wise way, and went on to get nice jobs and start donating. But I also learned well that, like many cheap and easy solaces, saying the word \"later\" is addictive; and that this luxury is available to the rich as well as the poor.</p><p>I don't expect it to be any different with AGI alignment work. People who are trying to get what grasp they can on the alignment problem will, in the next year, be doing a little (or a lot) better with whatever they grasped in the previous year (plus, yes, any general-field advances that have taken place in the meantime). People who want to defer that until after there's a better understanding of AI and AGI will, after the next year's worth of advancements in AI and AGI, want to defer work until a better future understanding of AI and AGI.</p><p>Some people really <i>want</i> alignment to <i>get done</i> and are therefore <i>now</i> trying to wrack their brains about how to get something like a reinforcement learner to <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/pointing_finger/\">reliably identify a utility function over particular elements in a model of the causal environment instead of a sensory reward term</a> or <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/\">defeat the seeming tautologicalness of updated (non-)deference</a>. Others would rather be working on other things, and will therefore declare that there is no work that can possibly be done today, <i>not</i> spending two hours quietly thinking about it first before making that declaration. And this will not change tomorrow, unless perhaps tomorrow is when we wake up to some interesting newspaper headlines, and probably not even then. The luxury of saying \"later\" is not available only to the truly poor-in-available-options.</p><p>After a while, I started telling effective altruists in college: \"If you're planning to earn-to-give later, then for now, give around $5 every three months. And never give exactly the same amount twice in a row, or give to the same organization twice in a row, so that you practice the mental habit of re-evaluating causes and re-evaluating your donation amounts on a regular basis. <i>Don't</i> learn the mental habit of just always saying 'later'.\"</p><p>Similarly, if somebody was <i>actually</i> going to work on AGI alignment \"later\", I'd tell them to, every six months, spend a couple of hours coming up with the best current scheme they can devise for aligning AGI and doing useful work on that scheme. Assuming, if they must, that AGI were somehow done with technology resembling current technology. And publishing their best-current-scheme-that-isn't-good-enough, at least in the sense of posting it to Facebook; so that they will have a sense of embarrassment about naming a scheme that does not look like somebody actually spent two hours trying to think of the best bad approach.</p><p>There are things we\u2019ll better understand about AI in the future, and things we\u2019ll learn that might give us more confidence that particular research approaches will be relevant to AGI. There may be more future sociological developments akin to Nick Bostrom publishing <i>Superintelligence</i>, Elon Musk tweeting about it and thereby heaving a rock through the Overton Window, or more respectable luminaries like Stuart Russell openly coming on board. The future will hold more AlphaGo-like events to publicly and privately highlight new ground-level advances in ML technique; and it may somehow be that this does <i>not</i> leave us in the same epistemic state as having already seen AlphaGo and GANs and the like. It could happen! I can't see exactly how, but the future does have the capacity to pull surprises in that regard.</p><p>But before waiting on that surprise, you should ask whether your uncertainty about AGI timelines is really uncertainty at all. If it feels to you that guessing AGI might have a 50% probability in N years is not enough knowledge to act upon, if that feels scarily uncertain and you want to wait for more evidence before making any decisions... then ask yourself how you'd feel if you believed the probability was 50% in N years, and everyone else on Earth also believed it was 50% in N years, and everyone believed it was right and proper to carry out policy P when AGI has a 50% probability of arriving in N years. If that visualization feels very different, then any nervous \"uncertainty\" you feel about doing P is not really about whether AGI takes much longer than N years to arrive.</p><p>And you are almost surely going to be stuck with that feeling of \"uncertainty\" no matter how close AGI gets; because no matter how close AGI gets, whatever signs appear will almost surely not produce common, share, agreed-on public knowledge that AGI has a 50% chance of arriving in N years, nor any agreement that it is therefore right and proper to react by doing P.</p><p>And if all that did become common knowledge, then P is unlikely to still be a neglected intervention, or AI alignment a neglected issue; so you will have waited until sadly late to help.</p><p>But far more likely is that the common knowledge just isn't going to be there, and so it will always feel nervously \"uncertain\" to consider acting.</p><p>You can either act despite that, or not act. Not act until it's too late to help much, in the best case; not act at all until after it's essentially over, in the average case.</p><p>I don't think it's wise to wait on an unspecified epistemic miracle to change how we feel. In all probability, you're going to be in this mental state for a while - including any nervous-feeling \"uncertainty\". If you handle this mental state by saying \"later\", that general policy is not likely to have good results for Earth.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Further resources:</p><ul><li>MIRI\u2019s research guide (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/research-guide/\">https://intelligence.org/research-guide/</a>) and forum (<a href=\"https://agentfoundations.org/\">https://agentfoundations.org</a>)</li><li>FLI\u2019s <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2016/02/29/introductory-resources-on-ai-safety-research/\">collection of introductory resources</a></li><li>CHAI\u2019s alignment bibliography at <a href=\"http://humancompatible.ai/bibliography\">http://humancompatible.ai/bibliography</a></li><li>80,000 Hours\u2019 AI job postings on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/job-board/\">https://80000hours.org/job-board/</a></li><li>The Open Philanthropy Project\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/open-philanthropy-project-ai-fellows-program\">AI fellowship</a> and general call for <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/concrete-problems-ai-safety\">research proposals</a></li><li>My brain-dumps on <a href=\"https://arbital.com/explore/2v\">AI alignment</a></li><li>If you're arriving here for the first time, my long-standing work on <a href=\"https://www.lesserwrong.com/sequences\">rationality</a>, and CFAR\u2019s <a href=\"http://rationality.org/workshops/upcoming\">workshops</a></li><li>And some general tips from <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/17s/what_should_the_average_ea_do_about_ai_alignment/\">Ray Arnold</a> for effective altruists considering AI alignment as a cause area.</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "EA Forum Archives"}}, {"_id": "GJCmiYBzBxkAvSox8", "title": "Intergenerational equity under catastrophic climate change", "postedAt": "2017-10-31T13:33:12.405Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Climate change raises the issue of intergenerational equity. As climate change threatens irreversible and dangerous impacts, possibly leading to extinction, the most relevant trade-off may not be between present and future consumption, but between present consumption and the mere existence of future generations. To investigate this trade-off, we build an integrated assessment model that explicitly accounts for the risk of extinction of future generations. We compare different climate policies, which change the probability of catastrophic outcomes yielding an early extinction, within the class of variable population utilitarian social welfare functions. We show that the risk of extinction is the main driver of the preferred policy over climate damages. We analyze the role of inequality aversion and population ethics. Usually a preference for large populations and a low inequality aversion favour the most ambitious climate policy, although there are cases where the effect of inequality aversion is reversed.</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Since the seminal work of Cline (1992) and Nordhaus (1994), the economics literature has mainly considered climate change as a problem of intertemporal consumption trade-off, where the costs of climate change mitigation measures lower consumption today, but increase consumption in the future as some damages due to climate change are avoided. This approach assumes that climate change occurs at a relatively slow pace \u2014 a pace which allows ecosystems and societies to adapt \u2014 and has reversible impacts.</p>\n<p>The literature on climate science has since then pointed out the possibility of tipping points, where the climate and ecosystems may change in abrupt and irreversible ways (Lenton et al., 2008; Scheffer et al., 2001), possibly bringing catastrophic outcomes. Tipping points may include the shutoff of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet or the dieback of the Amazon rainforest. Abrupt climate change may have indirect impacts, for instance through increased migration and conflicts (Reuveny, 2007; Hsiang et al., 2013).</p>\n<p>In the environmental economics litterature, catastrophic outcomes are translated into the irreversible reduction of society\u2019s level of consumption or welfare to zero (Cropper, 1976; Clarke and Reed, 1994), or into a discontinuous decline in welfare (Tsur and Zemel, 1996), which is partially reversible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-RhBEMR3KGyLp36Gho-1\" id=\"fnref-RhBEMR3KGyLp36Gho-1\">[1]</a></sup> In these models, catastrophic events are triggered by the level of pollution, whether exogenous or endogenous to the model. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been used to account for the effect of stochastic climate catastrophes on the optimal climate policy (Peck and Teisberg, 1995; Gjerde et al., 1999; Lontzek et al., 2015; Lemoine and Traeger, 2016). These studies conclude that stochastic tipping points justify more ambitious emission reductions than in the deterministic case. The risk of climate catastrophes is sometimes modelled as a sudden jump in climate damages when the temperature rises above a given temperature threshold (Ambrosi et al., 2003; Pottier et al., 2015), or through a power law damage function with a large exponent (Ackerman et al., 2010; Weitzman, 2012).</p>\n<p>In fact, the possibility that social welfare may drop to zero due to climate change can be interpreted as human extinction. The trade-off is then not only between present and future consumption, but also between present consumption and the possible future extinction of civilization due to climate change (Weitzman, 2009). While the economics literature has mainly focused on the first trade-off, this paper explores the second one. Few papers have approached this issue. Bommier et al. (2015) show that the representation of preferences in terms of risk aversion greatly matters for the appropriate level of mitigation when the risk of catastrophic collapse is accounted for. In their setting, the catastrophe depends on the pollution stock and can be construed as human extinction. Martin and Pindyck (2017) examine the impact of deadly disasters (e.g. disease outbreaks such as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic), and treat death as a welfare-equivalent reduction in consumption, relying on estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL).</p>\n<p>However, these works do not explicitly address the issue of population ethics, that is the collective attitudes towards population size. The fact that climate change and climate policies could affect the size of the earth\u2019s population raises the issue of evaluating policies with varying population size (Broome, 2012). The question of how to value population change, for instance when accounting for the possibility of climate catastrophes, has been largely ignored in the literature and should be treated in an explicit way to inform climate policy analysis (Millner, 2013; Kolstad et al., 2014).</p>\n<p>This paper aims at filling this gap, and at identifying public policies that can strike an acceptable compromise between present and future generations when the potential impact of catastrophic climate change on population is accounted for. As we account for the risk of catastrophic climate change, total population over all generations can vary, which raises the issue of the weight given to total population size in the evaluation. We use an IAM, which provides a simple representation of the interaction between climate and the economy, and allows us to evaluate climate policies. We follow Cropper (1976) and assume that the catastrophe is irreversible and is akin to truncating the planning horizon. We depart from the standard optimization framework, and instead consider various climate policies that are ordered according to their performance in terms of welfare. We explore the impact of inequality aversion, of attitudes towards population size and of the risk of extinction on the preferred climate policy.</p>\n<p>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the analytical framework, the model, and the numerical experiment. The analytical results demonstrate that we cannot predict the impact of changes of ethical parameters (inequality aversion and the value of population size) on policy decision. This is because the preferred climate policy depends on the relative impact of these ethical parameters on the welfare gained due to a lower hazard rate and the welfare lost due to a lower consumption stream. In the numerical analysis presented in section 3, we find cases where increasing inequality aversion favours the most ambitious climate policy. This rather unusual result is explained by the relative effect of inequality aversion on the risk and consumption components of the welfare difference. We also find that the risk of extinction is the main driver of the preferred policy over climate damages. Section 4 concludes.</p>\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/aurelie-mejean-et-al-intergeneration-equity-under-catastrophic-climate-change/\">Read the rest of the paper</a></strong></h3>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-RhBEMR3KGyLp36Gho-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The issue of global catastrophic risk has gathered a lot of interest well beyond the issue of climate change (Posner, 2004).

In recent times, we have grown more and more capable of destroying ourselves and our entire future forever, whether by nuclear war, catastrophic climate change, synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, or some other risk as yet unknown.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[00:12:27]</strong> Because the expected value of our future is so high, many think even a small reduction in the risk of extinction is extremely worthwhile in expectation. That said, I want to be clear that the case for focusing on our long-term future and the case for reducing the risk of extinction are conceptually distinct. There are ways to focus on the long-term future that don't involve reducing the risk of extinction. For example, instead of trying to ensure that our future is very long, you could just try to ensure that, to the extent that our future is long, it goes better rather than worse. Similarly, there are reasons to reduce the risk of extinction that don't have to do with the long-term future (for example, reasons to prevent the deaths of seven billion people, including potentially yourself and everyone you love).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[00:13:27]</strong> Nevertheless, many people who are focused on the long-term future, as a matter of fact, think that reducing the risk of extinction is a particularly good opportunity to make a difference.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_170 170w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_340 340w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_510 510w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_680 680w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_850 850w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_1020 1020w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_1190 1190w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_1360 1360w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_1530 1530w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/cf00e714dd9554a68581ffdb3277ff1ccb739eee234b903f.png/w_1686 1686w\"></figure><p>Let me talk briefly about a few possible objections. The first is discounting, which, in the context relevant here, means thinking that things matter less the further away from you they are in time. This just seems wrong to me and to many people. Imagine that you can save 10 people from the flu in 100 years or a thousand people from torture in a million years. Who should you save? You should save the thousand people from torture, but views that discount say otherwise. You can raise other similar objections.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[00:14:26]</strong> What about views based on the belief that we have no reason to add happy people to the population, including happy people in the future? I'm somewhat more sympathetic to these views than some others in this community, but it turns out they're extremely difficult to make work. The central difficulty, as I see it, is that even if you think we don't have a particularly strong reason to add happy people to the population, you should still think that we have very strong reason to ensure that the lives that we do add to the population go better rather than worse, even if those lives are worth living overall.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[00:15:05]</strong> For example, it matters whether we pollute this planet and leave to future generations a biosphere that leaves them substantially worse off, even if who lives in the future is contingent on our choice \u2014 and even if everyone has a life worth living, regardless. And that conviction, in conjunction with the conviction that we have no reason to add happy people to the population, produces either fairly counterintuitive results or violations of very plausible constraints on rationality. I'm happy to talk more about that in the Q&amp;A. Chapter 4 of <a href=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/40469/\"><u>Nick Beckstead's thesis</u></a> is also a nice introduction to these issues.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[00:15:51]</strong> Finally, you might be skeptical about our ability to make the future better in expectation, either because you think we might not have that kind of influence over the future or because we're just not in a position to know what will make the future better. I think that\u2019s a real question. But surely at least some people are in a position to make the future better or worse, in expectation. Donald Trump, for example, is in such a position. And when it comes to the risk of extinction, I, at least, find it pretty hard to think that we're totally clueless as to which options or outcomes would be better or worse.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[00:16:34]</strong> For example, it seems fairly clear that an all-out nuclear war between the US and Russia would be bad, in expectation, for our future. The same is true for a global engineered pandemic. And I think at least some people are in a position to lower the probability of those sorts of catastrophes.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you don't buy that, though, the stakes are high enough that I think the thing to do is not to give up but to try to learn more. These are only a few possible objections. There are many others and many further questions we can raise, but some of those questions are still open and we need people working on them. So if you are gripped by the broad idea here \u2014 even if you still have questions and objections \u2014 I encourage you to get involved.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_170 170w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_340 340w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_510 510w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_680 680w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_850 850w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_1020 1020w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_1190 1190w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_1360 1360w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_1530 1530w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37f5f614bb2048c82ca8b87ee8f4bca4809ab24fa9ee9e7e.png/w_1682 1682w\"></figure><p><strong>[00:17:32]</strong> Here are some ways you might do that. 80,000 Hours released a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/\"><u>long article about reducing the risk of extinction</u></a>, which has a lot of information about how you might make a difference.

Imagine our descendants millions of years from now, spread out across the galaxy, having experienced life with a depth and understanding unimaginable to us. And imagine them looking back on Earth, and on the 21st century, in light of everything that has happened since then. And what they would see, I think, is a seed: this tiny, fragile planet from which everything would spring.&nbsp;</p><p>As Sagan puts it, \u201cThey will marvel at how vulnerable the repository of all our potential once was, how perilous our infancy, how humble our beginnings, how many rivers we have to cross before we found our way.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><strong>Nathan Labenz (Moderator) [00:19:15]: </strong>Here\u2019s the first question from an audience member. You kind of addressed this when you talked about discounting, but one particular form of discounting that a questioner is asking about is discounting by the background rate of human extinction. Do you think that there is a rate at which we just go away, and that maybe that is a reasonable way to discount?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Joseph [00:19:48]:</strong> Yeah. If you think that we are very, very unlikely to reach a particularly long future, then some of this dialectic does alter a little bit. You might think it's less worthwhile, for example, to try to change the trajectory of human civilization in the long term. I don't actually think that it reduces the value in expectation of reducing the risk of extinction if you still think that the future is positive in expectation, but it might alter how you think about trajectory changes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan [00:20:25]:</strong> The next question is: Do you know of any information or have any thoughts on how people can maintain some sense of being action-oriented when they move into this line of thinking? It seems that people often end up chasing their tails getting bogged down in all of the considerations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Joseph [00:20:49]:</strong> Yeah, that's a good question. One thing that can be helpful psychologically is to be producing concrete output. So instead of just sitting around and talking to people, write something that people can respond to, or organize an event. I don't know if that is, in fact, any better, but it can feel better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan [00:21:18]:</strong> What are your thoughts on the signal that it sends to people outside of the EA community to focus on long-term risks rather than shorter term (and seemingly more immediately pressing) issues?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Joseph [00:21:35]:</strong> Well, in many cases, I think the goals are quite convergent. For example, I think reducing the risk of nuclear war or a global pandemic is something that everyone has a reason to care about, regardless of how they feel about the long-term future. Exactly how we prioritize those sorts of catastrophes relative to other goals we have in the short term is a further question. But in a lot of cases, I think the things that are going to be good for us in the long term are good for us in the short term too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan [00:22:13]:</strong> We have a few related questions on this theme of helping people now versus in the distant future. One person puts it pretty directly: You could argue that doing work to help people in the present is also a way of helping people in the future, maybe indirectly. So for somebody who is really focused on doing things that affect the here and now, obviously you don't have a lot of information about this person's behavior. But do you have thoughts on what the typical person who is very focused on the present should do to orient themselves more toward the long term?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Joseph [00:22:54]:</strong> I think that's going to depend a lot on the person's circumstances and what they're interested in \u2014 what they're good at or in a position to do. The 80,000 Hours article is helpful in this respect. That organization is very interested in tailoring the advice they give to a person's particular circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan [00:23:17]:</strong> Here's a short question that has come in: Is emphasis on the long-term future consistent with hedonism?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Joseph [00:23:29]:</strong> Yes, very consistent. [Laughter.] The simplest argument for the long-term future is if you're a hedonistic total utilitarian and you think that there will be a lot of hedons in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan [00:23:44]: </strong>Do you think that EA as a community should be more direct in its communication with the rest of the world about the ways in which it focuses on the long-term future, as opposed to letting the poverty cause area lead the way in our marketing (and having things like existential risk remain more sacred knowledge for those who are more deeply initiated into the community)?</p><p><strong>Joseph [00:24:13]:</strong> I'm not sure if I would want to describe existential risk in those terms. In general, I think many people in the EA community are fairly open, both about their interest in the long term and their remaining uncertainty about it. Will [MacAskill], for example, has done a lot of work on moral uncertainty and how to act when you're compelled by a view, but you also think you have doubts. And one thing I really want to emphasize is that it's possible to care a lot about the long-term future while also holding in mind other possibilities for what you might do, and even some skepticism toward the general argument for the long-term future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan [00:25:00]:</strong> I think those are all of the questions we have for now. Tell us where people can follow you online if they want to learn more about you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Joseph [00:25:10]:</strong> I have a website, <a href=\"https://www.josephcarlsmith.com/\"><u>josephcarlsmith.com</u></a>. That's a good way to learn more about me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan [00:25:14]: </strong>All right. A round of applause for Joseph Carlsmith for helping us orient towards the the long-term future.

This is distinct from cause-divergence - that effective altruists invest in several causes. Cause-neutrality does not entail cause-divergence, and it is confusing to use the term \u201ccause-neutrality\u201d for cause-divergence, as is sometimes done. Indeed cause-neutrality is compatible with effective altruism focusing solely on one cause. Similarly, cause-neutrality does not entail cause-agnosticism \u2013 agnosticism over which cause is best \u2013 and it is confusing to use the term \u201ccause-neutrality\u201d for cause-agnosticism, as is sometimes done.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>In addition to these conceptual clarifications, Schubert discusses some considerations of relevance for whether we should be cause-divergent and cause-agnostic.

I&apos;m Kat Steiner - a few of you may have met me at EA Global London recently. I&apos;m a librarian at the University of Oxford, so I spend a lot of time working with people on how to find literature (books, journal articles, reports) in their chosen area, how to organise it, and how to reference it correctly. After&#xA0;the conference, I realised that these are useful skills for the EA community to have as well, and I&apos;m more than willing to&#xA0;teach&#xA0;them! I usually take several hours in a practical class doing this so this is my attempt to distil just the fundamentals into a relatively readable blog post. &#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:&#xA0;</strong>I am not an academic, and EA covers a broad range of topics. I&apos;m sure many of you will have favourite sources which I will inevitably fail to mention. None of this is going to be a comprehensive list! So please share any&#xA0;databases and websites that you couldn&apos;t do without in the comments for everyone to see, and I hope that some of the sources I do include are new to you and worth checking out.</p>\n<p><strong>Second disclaimer:&#xA0;</strong>I am based in Oxford, so I am more familiar with the databases that Oxford subscribes to. If you are affiliated with another university, it is worth seeing if your library has guides (often called LibGuides) on the databases you have access to.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The TL;DR:</h2>\n<h3>1) What are you going to search for?</h3>\n<p>This involves breaking your question into concepts, thinking about the relevant importance of each one, coming up with synonyms, related concepts, broader and narrower terms, alternate spellings, that sort of thing. It feels like unnecessary work but it will save you time (and missing important content) in the long run.</p>\n<h3>2) Where are you going to search for it?</h3>\n<p>Think about how much time you have - it&apos;s usually worth using at least 2 subject-specific databases like ArXiv, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>You can also leverage Google&apos;s search algorithm to search within domains like .gov or .gov.uk, for useful PDF reports.</p>\n<h3>3) How are you going to search for it?</h3>\n<p>How does each website work? Is there an advanced search you can use for the words you came up with in 1? Can you filter by useful things like date or language? Do articles come with keywords, tags, or a thesaurus of useful terms?</p>\n<h3>4) Managing your PDFs, citations and referencing</h3>\n<p>Reference management software can save you a lot of time if you&apos;re writing long-form academic work or for publication. It will do all the pesky formatting of your references to a particular style, keep track of what you cite in your work as you go along, and even help you manage your PDFs. But it won&apos;t read the stuff for you, and you will have to do some data cleanup.</p>\n<h3>5) How libraries and librarians can help you!</h3>\n<p>Even if you&apos;re not part of a university, a local academic library may still be of use. You can often pay a small fee to be able to go there and use their electronic subscriptions (for non-commercial use), which means better databases and access to a lot more journal articles.</p>\n<p>Librarians can also help, either in person, or by writing LibGuides - try searching Google for some of those on your area of interest.</p>\n<p>Ok, let&apos;s get down to the details.</p>\n<h3>6) An attempt at a not-at-all comprehensive list of sources of literature</h3>\n<p>What it says on the tin.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>What are you going to search for?</h2>\n<p>We&apos;re going to take a concrete example. You have a vague idea what you want to know about, which is &apos;the effectiveness of deworming interventions in Africa&apos;. You might go to&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc\">PubMed Central</a>&#xA0;to search for that as it&apos;s medicine-related, but if you just put it in the simple search you get 459 results, way too many to read! And they might not even contain all of the relevant literature - what if the article was about Kenya but didn&apos;t mention Africa?</p>\n<p>It&apos;s important to think about your terms - what synonyms might there be? What broader or narrower terms could you use? Do you get too many results or too few? How important are your concepts - do you really want articles that mention deworming in the full text but not the abstract, or the title? Are there alternative spellings for some of the concepts? Globalisation vs. globalization, labour vs labor are two common ones. Also acronyms are important - consider spelling them out as well as using the abbreviation (QALY, DALY, RCT).</p>\n<p>Mind-mapping is great for this sort of work. For the example above, I came up with:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/k4HeiG/image1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I&apos;ve split the question into 3 concepts and tried to think of related terms for each one. Then I&apos;ve grouped them together and thought about how I would logically search for them with OR and AND (these are called Boolean operators). Some databases also allow NOT, but you have to be careful in using it because you can lose relevant papers just because they mention an irrelevant word in passing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/nzFocb/image2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Where are you going to search for it?</h2>\n<p>We&apos;re all pretty used to searching Google and perhaps&#xA0;<a href=\"https://scholar.google.co.uk/\">Google Scholar</a>&#xA0;- you plug in a few words and you get millions of results. You scroll down the first half a page, click a few links, and you&apos;re away. Fantastic. But what about all the stuff you&apos;re missing because it&apos;s on the 5th page, or the 50th?</p>\n<p>Google&#xA0;will always try to give you as many results as it can, in what it considers the most &apos;relevant&apos; order. But when you&apos;re searching for dry academic literature, this can work against you, and you run the risk of not finding important things, as well as wasting time reading poorly-researched stuff.</p>\n<p>Google Scholar<strong>&#xA0;</strong>is a little different - it&apos;s trying to find scholarly articles and citations which match your search. But it will still include a lot of stuff that&apos;s completely unrelated to your topic if you&apos;re not careful, and it doesn&apos;t vet its contents, not does it contain everything ever written. And if you want to search really specifically, its attempts to be clever can work against you.</p>\n<p><strong>Subject-specific databases&#xA0;</strong>are very different from Google in that they don&apos;t do as much of the searching work for you. They won&apos;t search for synonyms or related terms, so you need to think about those first - luckily we did that in the previous section. But they are more likely to give you actually relevant results instead of a lot of noise. They are also curated by humans (or in the case of <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/\">Semantic Scholar</a>, machine-learning techniques), which means that someone has tried to work out what an article is all about, even if it doesn&apos;t give many clues in the title. Some databases tag articles with subjects or keywords drawn from a controlled vocabulary to help you, and some like Web of Science will tell you where an article has been cited later (although never comprehensively).</p>\n<p>See the end of this article for a list of some databases you might want to try searching in, as well as good sources of data and reports.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>How are you going to search for it?</h2>\n<p>Now we need to think of a way to search for these concepts. It&apos;s generally best to look for an&#xA0;<em>advanced search&#xA0;</em>option. That will tell you what search techniques are available - sometimes you can narrow down by date, language, and so on. Often they look a lot like this:</p>\n<p>So I might build my search up in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc\">PubMed</a>&#xA0;with:&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>deworm* OR de-worm* OR &quot;intestinal worm*&quot; or &quot;soil-transmitted helminth*&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>I&apos;m using * to say that I don&apos;t care what comes after the start of the word - this picks up things like deworming or worms</p>\n<p>I&apos;m also using the &quot; marks to say I want to find a whole phrase and not the separate words.</p>\n<p>And I&apos;m using OR in capitals to say I want to match at least one of these terms because they&apos;re synonyms (sort of).</p>\n<p>I&apos;d probably also choose to search for these in the title, because I do actually want my article to be&#xA0;<em>about&#xA0;</em>deworming. I do that with the drop-down menu.</p>\n<p>Then on the next line, I add my next concept, Africa. I don&apos;t want to lose things that don&apos;t mention Africa in the title or abstract if they mention other countries, so I&apos;ll search all fields for&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Africa OR African OR Africans</strong></p>\n<p>I could use the * again but PubMed gives me an error - it found too many options for words starting Africa, so I pick the ones I care the most about.</p>\n<p>I type this into the second line down so the concepts are linked by AND, because I want to find something to do with deworming AND something to do with Africa.</p>\n<p>Then I move on to my third concept. I might search in the abstract for</p>\n<p><strong>effective OR effectiveness OR &quot;cost-effective*&quot; OR &quot;cost effective*&quot; OR &quot;cost-benefi*&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>Having done that search I find 25 results. Much more manageable! It&apos;s worth doing a few more searches with different combinations of title, abstract, full text, just to see if there are some I&apos;m missing, but that&apos;s a really good start.</p>\n<p>Obviously, PubMed isn&apos;t going to have all the articles ever on deworming, so you might want to try a different database like Web of Science (if you have it through your university) which covers more of the social sciences as well - doing that quickly gave me 50 results so you do get different things.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/g-ifhvkWTfk\"></iframe></p>\n<h4><strong>Other tips and tricks</strong></h4>\n<p>Some databases have a thesaurus and a set of keywords for each article - this can be manually done by experts or via machine learning like&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/\">Semantic Scholar</a>. These are great if you&apos;ve missed an important synonym or bit of jargon from the field. You&apos;re unlikely to find a perfect thesaurus term for each of your concepts, but you can use a combination of your own terms and those from a thesaurus to good effect.</p>\n<p>Web of Science does lots of fancy work on citations - you can see who has cited a paper later. Google Scholar also does this for free so it&apos;s useful to check that out if you think you&apos;ve found a seminal paper. To trace citations backwards, look at the list of references as you&apos;re reading and try and find them.</p>\n<h4>Being clever when searching Google</h4>\n<p>Even Google has an advanced search option! After you&apos;ve run a search it&apos;s under &apos;Settings&apos;. You can use quote marks &quot; to search for particular phrases or filter by region, language, date.</p>\n<p>You can also use it to search a particular domain - say you want to know what the UK government has written about deworming - you can put .gov.uk in the &apos;site or domain&apos; box (only one domain at a time, sadly). You can dictate that your search terms appear in the title of the page, or the url, not just somewhere in the text. You can also restrict the file type, so if you&apos;re looking for reports, PDFs would be a good bet.</p>\n<p>Here is a video of me demoing some of these techniques:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pd-r9npR9II\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h2>Reference management</h2>\n<p>Here is a teaser of what reference management software can help you achieve:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/115P7SSLZ2E\"></iframe></p>\n<p>If you are thinking of writing content for publication, or really any long-form academic work, you should be thinking about how you&apos;re going to keep track of and reference what you read. It&apos;s easy to lose track of where ideas came from and you don&apos;t want to be accused of plagiarism down the line, or waste lots of time having to search for things you read months ago all over again.</p>\n<p>Reference management software does some of this work for. The two main free options are Mendeley and Zotero, and the two main paid ones are Endnote and Refworks. If you use LateX to typeset then you may be familiar with BibTeX - you can also use the other types of software even if you are using LaTeX.</p>\n<p>Most of the choice between them is personal preference and whether or not you want to pay (or you have institutional access). They all do broadly the same thing, so I will keep things fairly generic, but with a Mendeley flavour, as that&apos;s what I know most about.</p>\n<p>You can use browser plugins like the Mendeley Web Importer to add details of what you&apos;re reading in your browser (webpages, online news sites, PDFs of journal articles) automatically to your library.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>You can use your software as a way to organise your PDFs, either by saving them all to one folder and getting the software to add details of anything in there into your library, or by having the software automatically rename your PDFs using a particular schema.</p>\n<p>You can use plugins for Word, Pages, etc. to help you correctly reference - find the item you want to cite in your library and it will automatically insert the reference in your text and in the Reference List at the end. If you need to correct anything about the citation (page numbers, year, authors), you can refresh your document and it will automatically make the corrections!</p>\n<p>Some versions of this software will allow you to share libraries and documents (with limited cloud storage capacity usually) with other people so this can be helpful when you are writing collaboratively.</p>\n<p>Of particular relevance to EA: you may be working on something really interdisciplinary and want to submit it to several different journals. These journals will all have their own ways of referencing, and these vary widely between disciplines. For example, philosophy uses footnotes and endnotes, while social sciences mostly use in-line citations - this is where you would say something like &quot;Librarianship is an interesting degree to study (Jenkins, 2014),&quot; and then both have a reference list at the end. And the references will have slightly different formatting - italics, where to put the full stops, how many authors to include if there are loads. You don&apos;t want to be doing all of that by hand if each journal has different requirements - instead, your reference management software will do it all with one click just by selecting a different citation style.</p>\n<p><em>Cautionary note:</em><strong>&#xA0;</strong>This software isn&apos;t going to solve all your problems. You do still have to do a fair amount of manual cleanup on your library of citations - if you put rubbish in, you&apos;ll get rubbish out in your reference list. Sometimes browser plugins can&apos;t pick stuff up from a secured PDF and you have to type the details of the journal article in yourself. But overall, I think anyone planning to write anything for publication should definitely consider getting to grips with Zotero or Mendeley - it will save you time in the long-run!</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><strong>Where can you go for more help</strong></h3>\n<p>If you&apos;re part of a university, your librarian! I do one-to-one tutorials on these things all the time, and big classes for all our new graduate students. Your library almost certainly does too.</p>\n<p>The internet! There are loads of resources written by librarians called LibGuides which are available free to read. Oxford&apos;s one on reference management software is here&#xA0;<a href=\"http://libguides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/reference-management\">http://libguides.bodleian<wbr>.ox.ac.uk/reference-management</a><wbr>&#xA0;These are also fantastic sources of places to search - here are some on EA-related areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://ox.libguides.com/c.php?g=422754&amp;p=2886757\">International development data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ox.libguides.com/computer_science/computerscience\">Computer science</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://libguides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/economics\">Economics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ox.libguides.com/c.php?g=422801&amp;p=2886967\">Evidence-based social intervention</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&apos;re not affiliated with a university, but you live in a big university town, you should check what membership options there are for independent researchers. For example, in Oxford, it&apos;s pretty cheap to get a reader card for the Bodleian Libraries, and then you can go in and access all of their online resources (except a few legal databases). More information is here:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/using/getting-a-readers-card\">http://www.bodleia<wbr>n.ox.ac.uk/using/getting-a-<wbr>readers-card</a></p>\n<p>This is something for non-profits to consider as well: it may be worth factoring in a regular bit of money and time for someone to go and sit in a library and run some literature searches - you&apos;ll often get better results with a subject-specific database and you can download PDFs of the articles to read later using the library&apos;s paid subscriptions. (Be aware that this usually isn&apos;t allowed if you&apos;re a commercial business, but otherwise it&apos;s fine as long as you&apos;re not obviously trying to download the entirety of JSTOR in one go).</p>\n<p>The Bodleian even offers a scanning service where if they only have a print copy of an older item, you can have a scan of a chapter or article within 24 hours for &#xA3;2 if you have a reader card. So you wouldn&apos;t even need to send someone to scan it themselves.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><em>An attempt at a not-at-all comprehensive list of sources of literature</em></h3>\n<p>[Some of these are completely free, some have some free and some paid-for content, and some are subscription-only.

One of the ways to such prediction is the analysis of the convergent drives of any future AI, started by Omohundro. We show that one of the convergent drives of AI is a militarization drive, arising from AI&#x2019;s need to wage a war against its potential rivals by either physical or software means, or to increase its bargaining power. This militarization trend increases global catastrophic risk or even existential risk during AI takeoff, which includes the use of nuclear weapons against rival AIs, blackmail by the threat of creating a global catastrophe, and the consequences of a war between two AIs. As a result, even benevolent AI may evolve into potentially dangerous military AI. The type and intensity of militarization drive depend on the relative speed of the AI takeoff and the number of potential rivals. We show that AI militarization drive and evolution of national defense will merge, as a superintelligence created in the defense environment will have quicker takeoff speeds, but a distorted value system. We conclude with peaceful alternatives.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>Link without registration and opened for commenting: </span></div>\n<div><span>https://docs.google.com/document/d/15D71qhhY-ZsAY7syzZsr1lKopTODbdeXVPElaPaIqyA/edit</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>If you are on academia.edu:&#xA0;</span></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/35130825/Military_AI_as_a_Convergent_Goal_of_Self-Improving_AI\">https://www.academia.edu/35130825/Military_AI_as_a_Convergent_Goal_of_Self-Improving_AI</a></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "turchin"}}, {"_id": "XW4Nou4ToBcGgteoC", "title": "Blind Empiricism", "postedAt": "2017-11-12T22:23:47.083Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Previous: <a href=\"/ea/1gw/living_in_an_inadequate_world/\">Living in an Inadequate World</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The thesis that needs to be contrasted with modesty is not the assertion that everyone can beat their civilization all the time. It&#x2019;s not that we should be <em>the sort of person</em> who sees the world as mad and pursues the strategy of believing a hot stock tip and investing everything.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s just that it&#x2019;s <em>okay</em> to reason about the particulars of where civilization might be inadequate, <em>okay</em> to end up believing that you can state a better monetary policy than the Bank of Japan is implementing, <em>okay</em> to check that against observation whenever you get the chance, and okay to update on the results in <em>either</em> direction. It&#x2019;s okay to act on a model of what you think the rest of the world is good at, and for this model to be sensitive to the specifics of different cases.</p>\n<p>Why might this <em>not</em> be okay?</p>\n<p>It could be that &#x201C;acting on a model&#x201D; is suspect, at least when it comes to complicated macrophenomena. Consider Isaiah Berlin&#x2019;s distinction between &#x201C;hedgehogs&#x201D; (who rely more on theories, models, global beliefs) and &#x201C;foxes&#x201D; (who rely more on data, observations, local beliefs). Many people I know see the fox&#x2019;s mindset as more admirable than the hedgehog&#x2019;s, on the basis that it has greater immunity to fantasy and dogmatism. And Philip Tetlock&#x2019;s research has shown that political experts who rely heavily on simple overarching theories&#x2014;the kind of people who use the word &#x201C;moreover&#x201D; more often than &#x201C;however&#x201D;&#x2014;perform substantially worse on average in forecasting tasks.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1-definition\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Or perhaps the suspect part is when models are &#x201C;sensitive to the specifics of different cases.&#x201D; In a 2002 study, Buehler, Griffin, and Ross asked a group of experimental subjects to provide lots of details about their Christmas shopping plans: where, when, and how. On average, this experimental group expected to finish shopping more than a week before Christmas. Another group was simply asked when they expected to finish their Christmas shopping, with an average response of 4 days. Both groups finished an average of 3 days before Christmas. Similarly, students who expected to finish their assignments 10 days before deadline actually finished one day before deadline; and when asked when they had previously completed similar tasks, replied, &#x201C;one day before deadline.&#x201D; This suggests that taking the <em>outside view</em> is an effective response to the planning fallacy: rather than trying to predict how many hiccups and delays your plans will run into by reflecting in detail on each plan&#x2019;s particulars (the &#x201C;inside view&#x201D;), you can do better by just guessing that your future plans will work out roughly as well as your past plans.</p>\n<p>As stated, these can be perfectly good debiasing measures. I worry, however, that many people end up misusing and overapplying the &#x201C;outside view&#x201D; concept very soon after they learn about it, and that a lot of people tie too much of their mental conception of what good reasoning looks like to the stereotype of the humble empiricist fox. I recently noticed this as a common thread running through three conversations I had.</p>\n<p>I am not able to recount these conversations in a way that does justice to the people I spoke to, so please treat my recounting as an unfair and biased illustration of relevant ideas, rather than as a neutral recitation of the facts. My goal is to illustrate the kinds of reasoning patterns I think are causing epistemic harm: to point to some canaries in the coal mine, and to be clear that when I talk about modesty&#xA0;I&apos;m not just talking about Hal Finney&apos;s majoritarianism or the explicit belief in civilizational adequacy.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>i.</h2>\n<p>Conversation 1 was about the importance of writing code to test AI ideas. I suggested that when people tried writing code to test an idea I considered important, I wanted to see the code in advance of the experiment, or without being told the result, to see if I could predict the outcome correctly.</p>\n<p>I got pushback against this, which surprised me; so I replied that my having a chance to make advance experimental predictions was important, for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, I thought it was important to develop a skill and methodology of predicting &#x201C;these sorts of things&#x201D; in advance, because past a certain level of development when working with smarter-than-human AI, if you can&#x2019;t see the bullets coming in advance of the experiment, the experiment kills you. This being the case, I needed to test this skill as much as possible, which meant trying to make experimental predictions in advance so I could put myself on trial.</p>\n<p>Second, if I could predict the results correctly, it meant that the experiments weren&#x2019;t saying anything I hadn&#x2019;t figured out through past experience and theorizing. I was worried that somebody might take a result I considered an obvious prediction under my current views and say that it was evidence against my theory or methodology, since both often get misunderstood.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2-definition\">2</a></sup> If you want to use experiment to show that a certain theory or methodology fails, you need to give advocates of the theory/methodology a chance to say beforehand what they think they predict, so the prediction is on the record and neither side can move the goalposts.</p>\n<p>And I still got pushback, from a MIRI supporter with a strong technical background; so I conversed further.</p>\n<p>I now suspect that&#x2014;at least this is what I think was going on&#x2014;their mental contrast between empiricism and theoreticism was so strong that they thought it was unsafe to have a theory <em>at all</em>. That having a theory made you a bad hedgehog with one big idea instead of a good fox who has lots of little observations. That the dichotomy was between making an advance prediction <em>instead of doing the experiment</em>, versus doing the experiment <em>without any advance prediction</em>. Like, I suspect that every time I talked about &#x201C;making a prediction&#x201D; they heard &#x201C;making a prediction instead of doing an experiment&#x201D; or &#x201C;clinging to what you predict will happen and ignoring the experiment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>I can see how this kind of outlook would develop. The policy of making predictions to <em>test</em> your understanding, to put it on trial, presupposes that you can execute the &#x201C;quickly say <em>oops</em> and abandon your old belief&#x201D; technique, so that you can employ it if the prediction turns out to be wrong. To the extent that &#x201C;quickly say <em>oops</em> and abandon your old belief&#x201D; is something the vast majority of people fail at, maybe on an individual level it&#x2019;s better for people to try to be pure foxes and only collect observations and try not to have any big theories. Maybe the average cognitive use case is that if you have a big theory and observation contradicts it, you will find some way to keep the big theory and thereby doom yourself. (The &#x201C;Mistakes Were Made, But Not By Me&#x201D; effect.)</p>\n<p>But from my perspective, there&#x2019;s no choice. You just have to master &#x201C;say <em>oops</em>&#x201D; so that you can have theories and make experimental predictions. Even on a strictly empiricist level, if you aren&#x2019;t allowed to have models and you don&#x2019;t make your predictions in advance, you learn less. An empiricist of that sort can only learn surface generalizations about whether this phenomenon superficially &#x201C;looks like&#x201D; that phenomenon, rather than building causal models and putting them on trial.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>ii.</h2>\n<p>Conversation 2 was about a web application under development, and it went something like this.</p>\n<p><strong>Startup Founder 1:</strong> I want to get (primitive version of product) in front of users as fast as possible, to see whether they want to use it or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong> I predict users will not want to use this version.</p>\n<p><strong>Founder 1:</strong> Well, from the things I&#x2019;ve read about startups, it&#x2019;s important to test as early as possible whether users like your product, and not to overengineer things.</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong> The concept of a &#x201C;minimum viable product&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t the minimum product that compiles. It&#x2019;s the least product that is the <em>best tool in the world</em> for some particular task or workflow. If you don&#x2019;t have an MVP in that sense, of course the users won&#x2019;t switch. So you don&#x2019;t have a testable hypothesis. So you&#x2019;re not really learning anything when the users don&#x2019;t want to use your product.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3-definition\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Founder 1:</strong> No battle plan survives contact with reality. The important thing is just to get the product in front of users as quickly as possible, so you can see what they think. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m disheartened that (group of users) did not want to use (early version of product).</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong> This reminds me of a conversation I had about AI twice in the last month. Two separate people were claiming that we would only learn things empirically by experimenting, and I said that in cases like that, I wanted to see the experiment description in advance so I could make advance predictions and put on trial my ability to foresee things without being hit over the head by them.</p>\n<p>In both of those conversations I had a very hard time conveying the idea, &#x201C;Just because I have a theory does not mean I have to be insensitive to evidence; the evidence <em>tests</em> the theory, potentially falsifies the theory, but for that to work you need to make experimental predictions in advance.&#x201D; I think I could have told you in advance that (group of users) would not want to use (early version of product), because (group of users) is trying to accomplish (task 1) and this version of the product is not the best available tool they&#x2019;ll have seen for doing (task 1).</p>\n<p>I can&#x2019;t convey it very well with all the details redacted, but the impression I got was that the message of &#x201C;distrust theorizing&#x201D; had become so strong that Founder 1 had stopped trying to model users in detail and thought it was futile to make an advance prediction. But if you can&#x2019;t model users in detail, you can&#x2019;t think in terms of workflows and tasks that users are trying to accomplish, or at what point you become visibly the best tool the user has ever encountered to accomplish some particular workflow (the minimum viable product). The alternative, from what I could see, was to think in terms of &#x201C;features&#x201D; and that as soon as possible you would show the product to the user and see if they wanted that subset of features.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s a version of this hypothesis which does make sense, which is that when you have the minimum compilable product that it is physically possible for a user to interact with, you can ask one of your friends to sit down in front of it, you can <em>make a prediction</em> about what parts they will dislike or find difficult, and then you can see if your prediction is correct. Maybe your product actually fails much earlier than you expect.</p>\n<p>But this is not like getting early users to voluntarily adopt your product. This is about observing, as early as possible, how volunteers react to unviable versions of your product, so you know what needs fixing earliest or whether the exposed parts of your theory are holding up so far.</p>\n<p>It really looks to me like the modest reactions to certain types of overconfidence or error are taken by many believers in modesty to mean, in practice, that theories just get you into trouble; that you can either make predictions <em>or</em> look at reality, but not both.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iii.</h2>\n<p>Conversation 3 was with Startup Founder 2, a member of the effective altruism community who was making Material Objects&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll call them &#x201C;Snowshoes&#x201D;&#x2014;who had remarked that modern venture capital was only interested in 1000x returns and not 20x returns.</p>\n<p>I asked why he wasn&#x2019;t trying for 1000x returns with his current company selling Snowshoes&#x2014;was that more annoyance/work than he wanted to undertake?</p>\n<p>He replied that most companies in a related industry, Flippers, weren&#x2019;t that large, and it seemed to him that based on the outside view, he shouldn&#x2019;t expect his company to become larger than the average company in the Flippers industry. He asked if I was telling him to try being more confident.</p>\n<p>I responded that, no, the thing I wanted him to think was orthogonal to modesty versus confidence. I observed that the customer use case for Flippers was actually quite different from Snowshoes, and asked him if he&#x2019;d considered how many uses of Previous Snowshoes in the world would, in fact, benefit from being replaced by the more developed version of Snowshoes he was making.</p>\n<p>He said that this seemed to him too much like optimism or fantasy, compared to asking what his company had to do next.</p>\n<p>I had asked about how customers would benefit from new and improved Snowshoes because my background model says that startups are more likely to succeed if they provide real economic value&#x2014;value of the kind that Danslist would provide over Craigslist if Danslist succeeded, and of the kind that Craigslist provides over newspaper classifieds. Getting people to actually buy your product, of course, is a separate question from whether it would provide real value of that kind. And there&#x2019;s an obvious failure mode where you&#x2019;re in love with your product and you overestimate the product&#x2019;s value or underestimate the costs to the user. There&#x2019;s an obvious failure mode where you just look at the real economic value and get all cheerful about that, without asking the further necessary question of how many decisionmakers <em>will</em> choose to use your product; or whether your marketing message is either opaque or easily faked; or whether any competitors will get there first if they see you being successful early on; or whether you could defend a price premium in the face of competition. But the question of real economic value seems to me to be one of the factors going into a startup&#x2019;s odds of succeeding&#x2014;Craigslist&#x2019;s success is in part explained by the actual benefit buyers and sellers derive from the existence of Craigslist&#x2014;and worth factoring out before discussing purchaser decisionmaking and value-capturing questions.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4-definition\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>It wasn&#x2019;t that I was trying to get Founder 2 to be more optimistic (though I did think, given his Snowshoes product, that he ought to at least <em>try</em> to be more ambitious). It was that it looked to me like the outside view was shutting down his causal model of how and why people might use his product, and substituting, &#x201C;Just try to build your Snowshoes and see what happens, and at best don&#x2019;t expect to succeed more than the average company in a related industry.&#x201D; But I don&#x2019;t think you can get so far as even the <em>average</em> surviving company, unless you have a causal model (the dreaded inside view) of where your company is supposed to go and what resources are required to get there.</p>\n<p>I was asking, &#x201C;What level do you want to grow to? What needs to be done for your company to grow that much? What&#x2019;s the obstacle to taking the next step?&#x201D; And&#x2026; I think it felt immodest to him to claim that his company could grow to a given level; so he thought only in terms of things he knew he could try, forward-chaining from where he was rather than backward-chaining from where he wanted to go, because that way he didn&#x2019;t need to immodestly think about succeeding at a particular level, or endorse an inside view of a particular pathway.</p>\n<p>I think the details of his business plan had the same outside-view problem. In the Flippers industry, two common versions of Flippers that were sold were Deluxe Flippers and Basic Flippers. Deluxe Flippers were basically preassembled Basic Flippers, and Deluxe Flippers sold for a much higher premium than Basic Flippers even though it was easy to assemble them.</p>\n<p>We were talking about a potential variation of his Snowshoes, and he said that it would be too expensive to ship a Deluxe version, but not worth it to ship a Basic version, given the average premiums the outside view said these products could command.</p>\n<p>I asked him <em>why</em>, in the Flippers industry, Deluxe sold for such a premium over Basic when it was so easy to assemble Basic into Deluxe. Why was this price premium being maintained?</p>\n<p>He suggested that maybe people really valued the last little bit of convenience from buying Deluxe instead of Basic.</p>\n<p>I suggested that in this large industry of slightly differentiated Flippers, maybe a lot of price-sensitive consumers bought only Basic versions, meaning that the few Deluxe buyers were price-insensitive. I then observed again that the best use case for his product was quite different from the standard use case in the Flipper industry, and that he didn&#x2019;t have much direct competition. I suggested that, for his customers that weren&#x2019;t otherwise customers in the Flippers industry, it wouldn&#x2019;t make much of a difference to his pricing power whether he sold Deluxe or the much easier to ship Basic version.</p>\n<p>And I remarked that it seemed to me unwise in general to look at a <em>mysterious</em> pricing premium, and assume that you could get that premium. You couldn&#x2019;t just look at average Deluxe prices and assume you could get them. Generally speaking, this indicates some sort of rent or market barrier; and where there is a stream of rent, there will be walls built to exclude other people from drinking from the stream. Maybe the high Deluxe prices meant that Deluxe consumers were hard to market to, or very unlikely to switch providers. You couldn&#x2019;t just take the outside view of what Deluxe products tended to sell like.</p>\n<p>He replied that he didn&#x2019;t think it was wise to say that you had to fully understand every part of the market before you could do anything; especially because, if you had to understand why Deluxe products sold at a premium, it would be so easy to just make up an explanation.</p>\n<p>Again I understand where he was coming from, in terms of the average cognitive use case. When I try to explain a phenomenon, I&#x2019;m also implicitly relying on my ability to use a technique like &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Singlethink\">don&#x2019;t even start to rationalize</a>,&#x201D; which is a skill that I started practicing at age 15 and that took me a decade to hone to a reliable and productive form. I also used the &#x201C;notice when you&#x2019;re confused about something&#x201D; technique to ask the question, and a number of other mental habits and techniques for explaining mysterious phenomena&#x2014;for starters, &#x201C;detecting goodness of fit&#x201D; (see whether the explanation feels &#x201C;forced&#x201D;) and &#x201C;try further critiquing the answer.&#x201D; Maybe there&#x2019;s no point in trying to explain why Deluxe products sell at a premium to Basic products, if you don&#x2019;t already have a lot of cognitive technique for not coming up with terrible explanations for mysteries, along with enough economics background to know which things are important mysteries in the first place, which explanations are plausible, and so on.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, it seems to me that there is a learnable skill here, one that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists at least <em>have</em> to learn if they want to succeed on purpose instead of by luck.</p>\n<p>One needs to be able to identify mysterious pricing and sales phenomena, read enough economics to speak the right simplicity language for one&#x2019;s hypotheses, and then not come up with terrible rationalizations. One needs to learn the key answers for how the challenged industry works, which means that one needs to have explicit hypotheses that one can test as early as possible.</p>\n<p>Otherwise you&#x2019;re&#x2026; not quite doomed <em>per se</em>, but from the perspective of somebody like me, there will be ten of you with bad ideas for every one of you that happens to have a good idea. And the people that do have good ideas will not really understand what human problems they are addressing, what their potential users&#x2019; relevant motivations are, or what are their critical obstacles to success.</p>\n<p>Given that analysis of ideas takes place on the level it does, I can understand why people would say that it&#x2019;s futile to try to analyze ideas, or that teams rather than ideas are important. I&#x2019;m not saying that either entrepreneurs or venture capitalists could, by an effort of will, suddenly become great at analyzing ideas. But it seems to me that the outside view concept, along with the Fox=Good/Hedgehog=Bad, Observation=Good/Theory=Bad messages&#x2014;including the related misunderstanding of MVP as &#x201C;just build something and show it to users&#x201D;&#x2014;are preventing people from even starting to develop those skills. At least, my observation is that some people go too far in their skepticism of model-building.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5-definition\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Maybe there&#x2019;s a valley of bad rationality here and the injunction to not try to have theories or causal models or preconceived predictions is protective against entering it. But first, if it came down to only those alternatives, I&#x2019;d frankly rather see twenty aspiring rationalists fail painfully until one of them develops the required skills, rather than have nobody with those skills. And second, god damn it, there has to be a better way.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iv.</h2>\n<p>In situations that are drawn from a barrel of causally similar situations, where human optimism runs rampant and unforeseen troubles are common, the outside view beats the inside view. But in novel situations where causal mechanisms differ, the outside view fails&#x2014;there may not be relevantly similar cases, or it may be ambiguous which similar-looking cases are the right ones to look at.</p>\n<p>Where two sides disagree, this can lead to <em>reference class tennis</em>&#x2014;both parties get stuck insisting that their own &#x201C;outside view&#x201D; is the correct one, based on diverging intuitions about what similarities are relevant. If it isn&#x2019;t clear what the set of &#x201C;similar historical cases&#x201D; is, or what conclusions we should draw from those cases, then we&#x2019;re forced to use an inside view&#x2014;thinking about the causal process to distinguish relevant similarities from irrelevant ones.</p>\n<p>You shouldn&#x2019;t avoid outside-view-style reasoning in cases where it looks likely to work, like when planning your Christmas shopping. But in many contexts, the outside view simply can&#x2019;t compete with a good theory.</p>\n<p>Intellectual progress on the whole has usually been the process of moving from surface-level resemblances to more technical understandings of particulars. Extreme examples of this are common in science and engineering: the deep causal models of the world that allowed humans to plot the trajectory of the first moon rocket before launch, for example, or that allow us to verify that a computer chip will work before it&#x2019;s ever manufactured.</p>\n<p>Where items in a reference class differ causally in more ways than two Christmas shopping trips you&#x2019;ve planned or two university essays you&#x2019;ve written, or where there&#x2019;s temptation to cherry-pick the reference class of things you consider &#x201C;similar&#x201D; to the phenomenon in question, or where the particular biases underlying the planning fallacy just aren&#x2019;t a factor, you&#x2019;re often better off doing the hard cognitive labor of building, testing, and acting on models of how phenomena actually work, even if those models are very rough and very uncertain, or admit of many exceptions and nuances. And, of course, during and after the construction of the model, you have to look at the data. You still need fox-style attention to detail&#x2014;and you certainly need empiricism.</p>\n<p>The idea isn&#x2019;t, &#x201C;Be a hedgehog, not a fox.&#x201D; The idea is rather: developing accurate beliefs requires both observation of the data <em>and</em> the development of models and theories that can be tested by the data. In most cases, there&#x2019;s no real alternative to sticking your neck out, even knowing that reality might surprise you and chop off your head.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Cross-posted to <a href=\"https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/6n9aKApfLre5WWvpG/blind-empiricism\">Less Wrong</a> and <a href=\"https://equilibriabook.com\">equilibriabook.com</a>.

The problem of the system exploiting loopholes and finding ways to maximize rewards in undesirable ways is mainly introduced when the system&#x2019;s resourcefulness is great enough, and its policy search space large enough, that operators can&#x2019;t foresee even in broad strokes what the reward-maximizing strategies are likely to look like. If this idea gets rounded off to just &#x201C;making an RL system smarter will always reduce its alignment with the operator&#x2019;s goal,&#x201D; however, then a researcher will misconstrue what counts as evidence for or against prioritizing reward hacking research.</p>\n<p>And there are many other cases where ideas in AI alignment tend to be misunderstood, largely because &#x201C;AI&#x201D; calls to mind present-day applications.

It\u2019s important because it poses a significant risk of suicidal behavior, because it causes a lot of suffering, and because sex offenders can drastically reduce other people\u2019s progress toward their goals.</p>\n<p>Sexual violence receives a lot of attention, but attention is not the same as taking effective action. Level of attention is a heuristic we can use to quickly locate areas where the most effective options haven't been applied yet, but heuristics are an imperfect method. We will miss things if heuristics are all that we use. Sexual violence is very complicated, there are a lot of common myths about it, and it's hard to reason about such an upsetting topic. After spending hundreds of hours reading research, I'm concerned that too few people understand sexual violence well enough to seek out and use the most effective options.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;learned more, I&nbsp;saw that it is worth evaluating for effective altruism potential. The amount of impact looks huge, and multiple options are worth trying.</p>\n<p>These figures might surprise you: unfortunately, sexual violence is very common. Figures from the Center for Disease Control show that 36.3% of women and 17.1% of men in the US have been sexually assaulted. [1] Part of this commonness is the difficulty of catching the offenders due to stigma and insufficient evidence. Using figures from the Department of Justice, RAINN showed that the majority of sex offenders walk free. [2] A meta-analysis of unreported rape studies found that 6% of men are undetected rapists [12] (and there doesn\u2019t appear to be a study with the percentage of women who are undetected rapists). It can be hard for sexual violence survivors to talk about sexual violence. A lot of what happens ends up hidden.</p>\n<p>I estimated various quantities related to impact including: the number of sexually violent people in EA, the number of lives that can be saved, the amount of productivity currently being lost, the effect on movement building, the effect on diversity / potential for disadvantage reduction, and suffering reduction. The amount of impact at stake is high.</p>\n<p>I evaluated nineteen sexual violence reduction options and included relevant research in the tractability section.</p>\n<p>I also addressed the question of whether this is a neglected area. William MacAskill said in \u201cDoing Good Better\u201d that \u201cIf a specific area has already received a great deal of funding and attention, then we should expect it to be difficult to do a lot of good by devoting additional resources to that area. In contrast, within causes that are comparatively neglected, the most effective opportunities for doing good have probably not been taken.\u201d [13] Because&nbsp;no EA had&nbsp;previously done work to identify the most effective opportunities to reduce sexual violence in effective altruism, this should probably be considered neglected until the most effective actions have been taken. Due to time constraints, I wasn\u2019t able to fully evaluate neglectedness on a global scale, but I have a specific concern about this which I detailed in the neglectedness section.</p>\n<p>There is potential for an excellent cost-benefit ratio between the necessary time investment and the results that are possible. It is worth considering investing more resources into sexual violence reduction.</p>\n<p>In-network sexual violence reduction is very likely to be an effective altruism cause as a high-leverage way to protect EAs, increase effective altruism diversity, job satisfaction and productivity, as a way to reduce the talent shortage by retaining more employees and volunteers, and as a way to attract more people and grow the movement. Outside of the effective altruism network, sexual violence reduction has potential to be an effective altruism cause through saving lives, suffering reduction, disadvantage reduction, and by increasing productivity but more research is needed to further explore&nbsp;EA potential on a global scale. Of the nineteen methods explored, there are two methods that have the potential to scale globally.</p>\n<p>(Note: For those that are unfamiliar, there are some concerns about social science research which I had to work around. For instance, the replication crisis, the concerns covered in \"Statistics Done Wrong\", and the various issues identified by John Ioannidis. To address these concerns, I found multiple review articles and meta-analyses wherever possible. If I couldn't find any, I looked for as many studies as I could find and included them all.</p>\n<p>This method is not perfect. For instance, Ioannidis has warned about some specific vulnerabilities in meta-analyses and review articles. There really is not a way to create a perfect research based article, especially not while covering this much ground at the same time. It is simply too complicated. There wasn't a perfect method for me to use anyway.</p>\n<p>I could have chosen to do nothing because the research is flawed. I decided that the subject is too important to ignore. I decided not to make the perfect the enemy of the good and I made the best of it.)</p>\n<p>(Note: The belief that most effective altruists care about sexual violence is not in question. Many people, including effective altruists, do not have a strong awareness of how much risk there is, how much impact is at stake or which actions have the best chance to succeed. Additionally, some people are not aware of the amount of leverage that is possible. Awareness about these areas needs to be raised.)</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2>Table of Contents:</h2>\n<h3>Article Scope:</h3>\n<p>In-network sexual violence reduction vs. global sexual violence reduction.</p>\n<h3>Impact:</h3>\n<p>Estimating the number of sexually violent people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why we should not assume that effective altruism repels sex offenders</li>\n<li>About 6% of men are rapists and an unknown percentage of women.</li>\n<li>A rough estimate of rapists in EA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sexual violence reduction as a life saver</p>\n<p>Sexual violence reduction as suffering reduction</p>\n<p>Sexual violence reduction for diversity and disadvantage reduction</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparing sexual violence rates by gender</li>\n<li>Greatly multiplied risk to women due to the gender ratio in EA</li>\n<li>Gay and bisexual people have around twice the sexual violence risk</li>\n<li>List of specific disadvantages that EA women, bisexuals and homosexuals face</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Potential of sexual violence reduction to prevent productivity loss</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The low estimate</li>\n<li>The high estimate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sexual violence reduction as part of movement building</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The male sex offenders studied are shockingly prolific</li>\n<li>Sex offenders increase turnover in workplaces</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sexual violence reduction for lawsuit prevention</p>\n<h3>Neglectedness:</h3>\n<p>Global neglectedness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expecting sexual violence to leave enough evidence prevents solving it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main challenges in evaluating neglectedness in our network:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Survivorship bias makes gathering numbers tricky</li>\n<li>Most sex offences are not reported</li>\n<li>An alternative: focusing on whether we could be more effective</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Observations about sexual violence in the EA network</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A list for informational purposes only (please take no drastic actions)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Effective sexual violence reduction isn\u2019t an EA focus yet</p>\n<h3>Tractability:</h3>\n<p>The key obstacle</p>\n<p>Alternative sexual violence reduction options explored</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for work quality issues.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye on suspected offenders for other forms of misbehavior.</li>\n<li>Look into setting up a sting operation (sex offenders are often criminal generalists).</li>\n<li>Strike a balance between dismissing accusations and witch-hunting people.</li>\n<li>Create a robust sex offender detection strategy.</li>\n<li>Help solve male-female relations issues.</li>\n<li>Help minimize sexual violence risk factors throughout your social network.</li>\n<li>Encourage careful thinking and learning about certain sexual behaviors.</li>\n<li>View less serious sexual assaults like groping as a security heuristic.</li>\n<li>Learn self-defence, promote self-defence, and/or offer self-defence education.</li>\n<li>Offer a prevention program.</li>\n<li>Encourage sex offenders to seek help if you can do so safely.</li>\n<li>Do more research on sexual violence treatment.</li>\n<li>Encourage or host dry events and parties.</li>\n<li>If appropriate, consider having the accused work from home.</li>\n<li>Centralize reports so that survivors can ally with each other.</li>\n<li>Help replace stereotypes about sexual violence situations with real information.</li>\n<li>Object to pressure to go to private and secluded areas alone or with someone.</li>\n<li>Join EAs and Rationalists Against Abuse (ERAA) on Facebook.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<h3>Funding Link</h3>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2>Article Scope:</h2>\n<p><strong>In-network sexual violence reduction vs. global sexual violence reduction.</strong></p>\n<p>Sexual violence is a human rights issue all over the world, causing problems on multiple levels. Some of the sections in this article are limited to in-network sexual violence reduction because of the extreme cost of quantifying and scaling on a global level. For instance, the amount of sexual violence risk varies by country, sometimes by a lot. Consider the abhorrent treatment of women in Afghanistan and the unusually bad prison rape situation in Russia. The amount of variance could be quite high. There are 200 countries in the world. A good estimate of the amount of sexual violence risk present in all 200 countries would require an entire article of its own. It is necessary to quantify the amount of sexual violence in each country in order to quantify impacts like lives lost, suffering, etc. Quantifying all the impacts requires additional articles.</p>\n<p>Another notable difference between large and small scale sexual violence reduction is that most of the methods that have a chance to get good results can only be used to ban the offender from a particular organization or group. There is no way to ban them from the entire world. The methods that do have some potential to scale globally are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sting operations to catch offenders, if they result in incarceration.* (This might be made to work without risking sexual traumas to the sting operation staff. See the tractability section.)</li>\n<li>Finding a cure for sexual violence and a way to persuade sex offenders to use it. (It might be easier than you\u2019d think to persuade them. See the tractability section.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, there just isn\u2019t enough information on these two methods to make global level estimates yet. Good researchers need to be hired. Research funding is needed. I am not qualified to do this research by myself, though I\u2019d be happy to get involved. I hope the information I included in this article is useful to people interested in investing in research on these methods. Feel free to contact me through the effective altruism forum or Facebook if you\u2019re interested in doing large scale sexual violence risk reduction.</p>\n<p>* Due to the high rate of prison rape, increasing the rate of incarceration for a given country may not reduce the sexual violence rate on net in that country.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2>Impact:</h2>\n<h3>Estimating the number of sexually violent people.</h3>\n<p><strong>Why we should not assume that effective altruism repels sex offenders:</strong></p>\n<p>Effective altruism probably attracts more altruists, but does it repel sex offenders? Four things to consider:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.) It appears common for people to believe that sex offenders are never empathetic or altruistic. People also seem to believe that altruistic and empathetic people never commit sex offences. According to studies, rapists demonstrated more empathy than other types of criminals [14], however rapists have empathy deficits specifically toward their victims [14][15] and have higher hostility toward women. [15] Rapists may have a comparable amount of empathy to others. [16] How can this be? \u201cIt is suggested that empathy deficits in rapists might better be construed as cognitive distortions specific to their victims.\u201d [14] Essentially, rapists have irrational thinking patterns that seem to selectively sabotage empathy for their victims. Being capable of empathy isn\u2019t everything a human needs to behave well. We also need to think clearly enough to avoid prejudices and misunderstandings so that we can empathise with everyone in each situation.</p>\n<p>2.) There have been some incidents in the EA social network which suggest that having more effective sexual violence reduction methods would be an improvement for EA. For anonymized examples, see the neglectedness section.</p>\n<p>3.) Some sex offenders are masters of deception. \u201cThe first author interviewed one sex offender who reported that he had used newspaper reports of his release (including an old newspaper photograph of his face) as the pretext by which he entered into conversations about sex with new victims. Many sex offenders have histories of using demonstrations of \"good touches\" and \"bad touches\" to enter into sexually inappropriate activities with children. One of the most notorious sadistic pedophile murderers of all time, John Wayne Gacey, worked in disguise as a clown.\u201d - \u201cMyths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders\u201d [18] One of my two EA sex offenders was both stealthy in committing his offence and cunning in covering it up with a smearing attack afterwards. Some sex offenders are not particularly strategic. Many rapists are drunk at the time of the offence. Some are opportunistic and take advantage of time and place. Multiple types of sex offenders exist. We may not have a complete list of different types yet. It\u2019s not safe to assume that any type of sex offender will simply leave altruists alone.</p>\n<p>Exploitative people may actually prefer effective altruists as targets because many of them are young, so more likely to be naive. They would find it easier to target us if we tend to trust other group members more. We might trust people too much because a lot of people think that altruism and criminal behavior are mutually exclusive. Additionally, altruists may be more generous or forgiving, so highly selfish and exploitative people may particularly seek us out. Psychopaths are known for their charm and for their ability to blend in. Date rapists are known for enticing people to go on a date and then spiking their drink or luring them into a secluded location. If we happen to have anything that harmful people want or prefer, there is no reason to believe that they\u2019d keep out. They are known for blending in.</p>\n<p>4.) Dawkins doesn\u2019t believe that the selfish simply leave altruists alone:</p>\n<p>\u201cEven in the group of altruists, there will almost certainly be a dissenting minority who refuse to make any sacrifice. If there is just one selfish rebel, prepared to exploit the altruism of the rest, then he, by definition, is more likely than they are to survive and have children. Each of these children will tend to inherit his selfish traits. After several generations of this natural selection, the \u2018altruistic group\u2019 will be over-run by selfish individuals, and will be indistinguishable from the selfish group. Even if we grant the improbable chance existence initially of pure altruistic groups without any rebels, it is very difficult to see what is to stop selfish individuals migrating in from neighboring selfish groups\u201d [17]</p>\n<p><strong>About 6% of men are rapists and an unknown percentage of women.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It\u2019s hard to find figures for sexual harassers and gropers, but less hard to find these for rapists. One obstacle to finding out how many rapists there are is that most are undetected, that is to say they are never convicted or even taken to court. One study pooled the results of four self-report studies together to find out what percentage of men are undetected rapists. Unfortunately, the study only has a figure available for men. That number is 6% (ranging from 6%-14.9% in the studies it referenced). [12] Rapists don\u2019t usually say \u201cyes\u201d when you ask them if they are a rapist. For whatever reason, they just do not self-identify as rapists. In this study, rapists were defined as people who answered yes to one of the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have you ever been in a situation where you tried, but for various reasons did not succeed, in having sexual intercourse with an adult by using or threatening to use physical force (twisting their arm, holding them down, etc.) if they did not cooperate?</li>\n<li>Have you ever had sexual intercourse with someone, even though they did no want to, because they were too intoxicated (on alcohol or drugs) to resist your sexual advances (e.g., removing their clothes)?</li>\n<li>Have you ever had sexual intercourse with an adult when they didn't want to because you used or threatened to use physical force (twisting their arm; holding them down, etc.) if they didn't cooperate?</li>\n<li>Have you ever had oral sex with an adult when they didn't want to because you used or threatened to use physical force (twisting their arm; holding them down, etc.) if they didn't cooperate?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are more actions that count as rape than are listed here, for instance: intercourse with a non-consenting disabled person (in which case they may not employ physical force), intercourse with a sleeping person, intercourse with an adult over whom someone else has legal power of attorney. It may be that 6% is a low estimate.</p>\n<p>While looking for the number of female rapists, I found a meta-analysis on female sex offenders. The percentage of sex offenders reported to the police who are female is 2.2%. The police data seems to have a reporting bias. The percentage found in surveys is 11.6%. [19] Please remember that these are the percentages of sexually violent people who are female, not the percentage of females who are sexually violent.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t see a way to use the 2.2% and 11.6% figures to estimate the number of female rapists. If I calculate 2.2% or 11.6% of police reports or convictions, the result will have a massive under-reporting bias. Numbers from victim reports are not directly comparable to numbers from undetected rapist surveys. Therefore, if I try to compensate for the under-reporting bias by taking 2.2% or 11.6% of the 6% male rapists figure from undetected rapist studies, this will be inaccurate. Among other things, reports from victims can include the same rapist more than once because one rapist might target multiple people. Therefore, multiplying numbers from victim reports of sex offences against the percentage of undetected rapists might give an exaggerated result. For what it\u2019s worth, female sex offenders are unlikely to reoffend. (Their recidivism rate is less than 3%.) [24] However, I\u2019m still not sure that the numbers from victim studies are comparable enough to the numbers from undetected rapist studies to put them together for an estimation.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no undetected female rapist studies were found in the search. Given the appearance that female rapists are rare, it\u2019s doubtful that such studies exist. There just doesn\u2019t seem to be a good way to estimate them using the available information.</p>\n<p><strong>A rough estimate of rapists in EA:</strong></p>\n<p>There are a large number of factors that may influence the number of sex offenders in a particular group. For instance,&nbsp;Younger men have higher testosterone levels, and younger women are more likely to be targeted for sexual violence.&nbsp;Determining how each&nbsp;of these factors influences sexual violence risk&nbsp;can be very complicated. For instance, do highly educated people commit fewer crimes, or are they simply more likely to get away with crimes?&nbsp;Do people of a particular race commit more crimes, or are they just more likely to be convicted due to prejudice?&nbsp;Given the very large number of studies on sexual violence risk factors, and the complexity of processing them all, it would be extremely time consuming to take all of the factors into account. It could easily require an article of the same length as this one, just&nbsp;to create&nbsp;an estimate which takes all known relevant factors into account. To ensure enough time for the other parts of this article, a&nbsp;simple rough estimate has been created based on information about the overall population. Please remember that this is an *estimate*.</p>\n<p>According to the 2015 survey of effective altruists, there were 2,352 respondents who consider themselves an EA. [20] Some people are so uninvolved that they would not take the EA survey. They should not be counted. Others are so very busy that they&nbsp;might not take the EA survey either, even though they should be counted. Unless research is done to determine what percentage of EA takes the EA survey, we cannot assume that it is accurate. For that reason, I am using the total number of EAs from the survey as the low estimate. For the high estimate, I am using the EA Facebook group. There are over 13,861 people in the effective altruism Facebook group. [21] Not all of these people are active.&nbsp;The&nbsp;exact number of EAs is unknown but probably lies between these two figures.&nbsp;So, as an estimate, there are probably between 2,352-13,861 people in the effective altruism movement.</p>\n<p>Using the number above (6% of men are rapists) to estimate, and after encoding the following information in rot13 to keep it out of search engines and discourage quoting: fvapr 73% bs gur fheirl erfcbaqragf ner znyr, gurer ner na rfgvzngrq 100-600 (103-607) znyr encvfgf va gur rssrpgvir nygehvfz zbirzrag, tvira 2,352-13,861 crbcyr gbgny.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are an unknown number of female rapists.</p>\n<h2>Sexual violence reduction as a life saver:</h2>\n<p>Sexual violence harms the health of both men [3] [4] and women. Multiple studies have shown that rape survivors have a greatly increased risk of death via suicide. [5] [30] This is true even in very tough individuals, like those in the military. [31]</p>\n<p>A summary of a study of 4008 women conducted by National Institute of Drug Abuse: \u201cWhen asked if they ever thought seriously about committing suicide, 33% of the rape victims and 8% of the non-victims of crime stated that they had seriously considered suicide. Thus, rape victims were 4.1 times more likely than non-crime victims to have contemplated suicide. Rape victims were also 13 times more likely than non-crime victims to have actually made a suicide attempt (13% vs. 1%).\u201d [5] Multiple sources attributed the suicidal behavior to rape or the psychological impact of rape.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to find specific sexual violence information that pertains to male sexual violence survivors, and sometimes no study has been done. Therefore, only the number of female rape survivors who attempted suicide will be used in the following rough estimates.</p>\n<p>For a sense of how suicide differs by gender: women are more likely to attempt suicide while men are more likely to die from it. [6]</p>\n<p>Suicide attempts are not always fatal: 25 people attempt suicide for every death. &nbsp;[7]</p>\n<p>Each rapist might have committed an average of 7.2 rapes (there isn\u2019t an unbiased sample available that I could find). [8]</p>\n<p>So far we have:</p>\n<p>7.2 rapes per 1 rapist.</p>\n<p>12% higher chance of a suicide attempt after a rape (a 13% chance minus the 1% usual risk).</p>\n<p>4% chance of a suicide death for each suicidal person (1 in 25).</p>\n<p>0.48% chance of a death for each person raped (1 in 208).</p>\n<p>3.5% chance that each rapist contributed to a death on average.</p>\n<p>Notes: Sometimes rapists may target the same person more than once. It would be difficult to find research on how frequently this happens. In theory, the rape-related suicide risk already includes this, so attempting to adjust for that might exaggerate the suicide risk estimate. The estimate is not based on studies about future rapes, this is based on studies of past rapes. This is the information that is available. For that reason, it\u2019s not possible to use this to provide a figure like \u201cFor every X rapists stopped from committing future rapes, we will save one life on average.\u201d For the sake of curiosity, a different estimate can be provided:</p>\n<p>If a rough estimate of 29 would-be rapists were stopped before they started, at least one life would be saved (on average). The \u201cat least\u201d is there to hint at the fact that because past rapes don\u2019t include future rapes, the would-be rapists might have targeted more than 7.2 people over their lif etimes.</p>\n<p>To go about it a better way: for every 208 people we prevent from being raped, a rough estimate of one life will be saved on average.</p>\n<h2>Sexual violence reduction as suffering reduction:</h2>\n<p>According to a systematic review, rape is \u201cone of the most severe of all interpersonal traumas\u201d. [44] Another study said \u201cRape victims were found to be significantly more depressed, generally anxious, and fearful than control subjects.\u201d [45] In a study called \u201cThe Psychological Impact of Rape\u201d, the impacts are explored in detail. [46] Here is a summary:</p>\n<p><strong>Effects hours later:</strong></p>\n<p>92% were terrified and confused</p>\n<p>96% were scared, worried and trembling</p>\n<p>96% felt exhausted</p>\n<p>88% felt restless</p>\n<p>84% felt depressed</p>\n<p><strong>1 week later:</strong></p>\n<p>94% met the criteria for PTSD (though not the time requirement)</p>\n<p><strong>2 weeks later:</strong></p>\n<p>75% were depressed (mildly to severely)</p>\n<p><strong>1 month later:</strong></p>\n<p>44% were moderately to severely depressed</p>\n<p>Many still met the PTSD criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>3 months later:</strong></p>\n<p>47% still met the criteria for PTSD<br>Likely to experience fear, anxiety, self-esteem trouble and sexual dysfunction.</p>\n<p>Significantly more distressed than non-victims.</p>\n<p><strong>1 year later:</strong></p>\n<p>Likely to experience fear, anxiety, self-esteem trouble and sexual dysfunction.<br>Significantly more distressed than non-victims.</p>\n<p><strong>2 years later:</strong></p>\n<p>More likely to experience fear, social adjustment issues, depression and sexual disorders.</p>\n<p><strong>3 years later:</strong></p>\n<p>Differences on several fear and anxiety measures compared with non-victims.</p>\n<p>Rape causes intense suffering to most survivors, and the suffering can last a long time for some of them.</p>\n<h2>Sexual violence reduction for diversity and disadvantage reduction:</h2>\n<p><strong>Comparing sexual violence rates by gender:</strong></p>\n<p>According to the most recent NISVS report by the Center for Disease Control, far more women than men have experienced sexual violence over their lifetimes, though men and women experienced a comparable amount of rape* in the 12 month period the survey covered. [1] (See tables 3.1 and 3.5.)</p>\n<p>* It is important to note that the way rape against men is defined in research often leaves out envelopment or puts this in a different category like \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d. Envelopment has been included in the rape definition used for this article. When reading sexual violence research, please remember to check the definitions and categories of violence to see what is contained in each.</p>\n<p>Women experienced more sexual coercion, unwanted sexual contact and non-contact unwanted sexual experiences both over their lifetimes and also in the year the survey covered.</p>\n<p><strong>Greatly multiplied risk to women due to the gender ratio in EA:</strong></p>\n<p>The 73% / 27% male to female ratio in the effective altruism movement creates a significantly worse sexual violence risk for women (though some areas of the movement have a different gender balance like in animal charities). Please remember the estimate of male rapists in the effective altruism movement from the beginning of the article. It is not possible to calculate the exact number of rapists in the movement. Estimating them is the best that anyone can do.</p>\n<p>There are 635-3742 women the male rapists in the movement might target. The ratio of male rapists to women outside the movement is around 1:17 (3:50), based on a 50/50 gender ratio. The estimated ratio of male rapists to women in the EA movement is 1:6, which is significantly worse. In the rationalist diaspora sector of the movement (like LessWrong) the gender ratio is 83.6% / 16.2% [47] and the estimated male rapist to female ratio is around 1:3.</p>\n<p>Worse, according to one study, the rapists surveyed committed an average of 7.2 rapes each. [8]</p>\n<p>To tie it all together:</p>\n<p>Outside EA: A 1:17 ratio means 7 rapes per&nbsp;17 women on average.</p>\n<p>Inside EA: A 1:6 ratio means 7 rapes per 6 women on average.</p>\n<p>Rationalists: A 1:3 ratio means 7 rapes per 3 women on average.</p>\n<p>Note 1: Some women are targeted multiple times.</p>\n<p>Note 2: The 7.2 rapes per rapist is based on past rapes. It\u2019s not a prediction of future rapes. This is to give the reader a sense of the disadvantage women face in male dominated environments.</p>\n<p>Note 3: We cannot assume that EA rapists target only other EAs. Sometimes, they might target people outside the social network. We cannot assume that EAs are targeted only by EA rapists. Sometimes they might be targeted by people outside the social network. Depending on how much of an EA\u2019s social life consists of contact with other EAs and also depending on how sociable they are, their individual risk will vary. There is not enough lifestyle information available on EAs for me to include numbers on this into the estimate.</p>\n<p>Female lawyers often work in offices with a similar gender ratio to EA. [48] According to The American Bar Association, between half and two thirds of female lawyers experienced or observed sexual harassment by male superiors, colleagues, or clients during the two years prior to the survey. [37]</p>\n<p>Gay and bisexual people have around twice the sexual violence risk:</p>\n<p>Bisexuals and homosexuals of both genders experience more sexual violence than heterosexuals. The problem can be around twice as bad for them. [41] (See tables 1 and 2.)</p>\n<p>List of specific disadvantages that EA women, bisexuals and homosexuals face:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Offenders increase their suicide risk more often.</li>\n<li>Offenders psychologically harm more of them.</li>\n<li>Offenders drive away a disproportionate number of them.</li>\n<li>Offenders reduce their progress toward their goals through psychological trauma and other health concerns.</li>\n<li>Offenders pose a threat, so they must self-impose various limitations for security purposes.</li>\n<li>Offenders damage more of their careers and reputations through cover-up slandering.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Reducing sexual violence is a way to significantly reduce their burden of disadvantage.</p>\n<h2>Potential of sexual violence reduction to prevent productivity loss:</h2>\n<p><strong>The low estimate:</strong></p>\n<p>For every 208 people protected from rape, a rough estimate of 1 life will be saved due to the related suicide risk. (See also: the \u201csexual violence reduction as a life saver\u201d section.) One lifetime includes up to ~80,000 hours of work. Not every effective altruist will spend their entire life working in EA, and not every effective altruist has 80,000 hours left in their career, so this wouldn\u2019t always yield an 80,000 hour productivity boost. *Up to* 80,000 hours of productivity could be saved by saving people from rape.</p>\n<p><strong>The high estimate:</strong></p>\n<p>If just one person is stopped from committing sex offences in the effective altruism movement, that could be as high-impact as gaining one new superstar level effective altruist, possibly better.</p>\n<p>According to a Harvard Business School working paper, employees who engage in misbehavior like sexual harassment (which includes sexual violence, rape, sexual assault and other inappropriate touching [9] [10]) are net negative. [11] One employee of this type does enough damage to more than cancel out the value created by an unusually productive person or \u201csuperstar worker\u201d, defined as \u201cin the top 1% of productivity\u201d. \u201cEven if a firm could replace an average worker with one who performs in the top 1%, it would still be better off by replacing a toxic worker with an average worker by more than two-to-one\u201d. In the paper, sexual harassment is provided as an example of toxic behavior on the extreme end of the scale for harm and severity, so the impact of reducing sexual violence could be greater.</p>\n<p>The ratio of effort to impact might be really excellent. To represent the productivity boost of adding a superstar worker, I\u2019ll estimate the impact in terms of hours gained.</p>\n<p>Careers don\u2019t always last a lifetime, so I\u2019ll start my range with just a five year long career. Five years contain 10,400 hours of work. A full lifetime contains 80,000 hours of work.</p>\n<p>Since many offences leave insufficient evidence, I\u2019ll quantify the time it takes to review the quality of someone\u2019s work to see whether there is evidence that they should be fired. (One strategy which has a chance to succeed, detailed below.) The time required for this probably ranges from minutes to hours.</p>\n<p>If it takes a few hours to review someone\u2019s work, and 10,400-80,000 hours worth of productivity are gained, then it could be that the impact gained is thousands of times greater than the time invested or more.</p>\n<p>Reviewing the work of a person accused of a sex offence won\u2019t always lead to a reason to fire them. The ratio of reviews to firings is unknown. Even if it were only 10:1, the cost benefit ratio is still very good.</p>\n<h2>Sexual violence reduction as part of movement building:</h2>\n<p><strong>The male sex offenders studied are shockingly prolific:</strong></p>\n<p>Some sex offenders who commit offences like groping, frotteurism (crotch rubbing), voyeurism, and exhibitionism can be quite prolific and each act has a chance to scare people out of the effective altruism movement.</p>\n<p>How prolific are they? It\u2019s difficult to get an unbiased sample of sex offenders. Even jail samples are biased because so many sex offenders are not sent to jail. For an example, the frottage offenders (who touch or rub a clothed person) surveyed in this study targeted an average of nine hundred people each. [22] That is not a typo. Given this much activity, one offender easily has the potential to drive more than one person out of EA. These \u201cless serious\u201d sexual assaults could be worsening the talent shortage.</p>\n<p>A lot of information on sexual violence includes only men or has a reporting bias that leaves out some of the female sex offenders, so I sought information on female sex offenders specifically. The studies I found said female sex offenders are unlikely to reoffend. Their recidivism rate is less than 3%. [24] [25] Sex offences committed by females are obviously still important. The point here is to gather numbers useful for getting a sense of the amount of impact that sex offenders have on the movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Sex offenders increase turnover in workplaces and&nbsp;probably movements:</strong></p>\n<p>There is very little research on movement building, so the chance that a sex offence will drive someone out of a movement is not known. It\u2019s reasonable to be concerned about this because toxic behavior like sex offences can increase turnover rates in workplaces [11] and the EA movement is&nbsp;partly composed of workplaces.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A study with a very large military sample found that \u201cFor every 1 standard deviation increase in sexual harassment experience, there is an effect size equivalent to a 21% greater risk of turnover\u2014despite controlling for the contribution of coworker satisfaction.\u201d [35]. The results of another study showed that \u201cthe odds of &nbsp;sexually harassed employees having turnover intentions are 1.63 times greater than for employees not experiencing sexual harassment.\u201c [36] All of the other available studies I could locate on the topic found that sexual harassment increases turnover intentions. [37] [38] [39] [40]</p>\n<h2>Sexual violence reduction for lawsuit prevention:</h2>\n<p>A sexual harassment lawsuit can cost into the millions of dollars, and a survey shows that many company policies are inadequate and may even violate \u201ceffective action\u201d. [42] I am not qualified to provide legal advice, I just want to raise awareness. For further information, please consult with a lawyer.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2>Neglectedness:</h2>\n<p><strong>Global neglectedness:</strong></p>\n<p>Expecting sexual violence to leave enough evidence prevents solving it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It does not appear to be widely known information that for every 1000 rapes committed, only 6 rapists go to jail. [2] If sexual violence tends to leave too little evidence, then calls for justice make an unrealistic demand on court systems. It seems to me that people have been expecting these crimes to leave enough evidence, so they haven\u2019t put enough investment into other avenues that have potential such as sting operations for the criminal generalist type of sex offender or a cure for paraphilias. To get an accurate idea of whether sexual violence reduction is neglected in each country requires more research to do the question justice.</p>\n<p><strong>The main challenges in evaluating neglectedness in our network:</strong></p>\n<p>Survivorship bias makes gathering numbers tricky:</p>\n<p>Due to survivorship bias, surveys of the movement asking about sexual violence will unfortunately be inaccurate. The problem is that people who have been targeted by sex offenders may have stopped participating in order to avoid the offenders. They may have even lost their jobs because of conflicts or mental health issues resulting from the attack. Nonetheless, a survey has been done. This survey should not be considered the main support. Data from the survey is included in the list of observations below.</p>\n<p>This problem of survivorship bias will likely affect information from most of the methods we could use to discover whether sexual violence is being handled effectively. For instance, asking around would only give us opportunities to gather information *if* we met the sexual violence survivors before the offence. There are some who we may not have ever met, if they left before we could meet them.</p>\n<p>Survivorship bias is a really big problem that makes gathering information about neglectedness hard.</p>\n<p>Most sex offences are not reported:</p>\n<p>Another problem is that the majority of sex offences are not reported. [2] One cannot simply contact EA organizations to ask how many reports they received because most of the sexual violence will not have been reported to them.</p>\n<p><strong>An alternative: focusing on whether we could be more effective:</strong></p>\n<p>Because there is not currently a way to directly measure the size of the problem in effective altruism, this section will instead focus on whether actions against known problems could be more effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Observations about sexual violence in the EA network:</strong></p>\n<p>A list of observations has accumulated over time as I participated in the movement. I\u2019ve seen some people taking action, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough awareness about what\u2019s likely to be effective. I\u2019ve seen others take no action. I can\u2019t be sure I haven\u2019t ended up with a biased view, but from what I\u2019ve seen there have been some problems and the problems happened in a lot of places. The nature and scope of what I\u2019ve seen suggests that there is plenty of room for improvement.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the #metoo phenomenon, I have chosen to be a bit more candid in this section than traditional social norms would usually allow. My personal belief is that sharing *anonymized* sexual violence related events has a lot of educational value (with the caveat that it\u2019s possible it may be experienced as entertainment by the people we\u2019re trying to raise awareness about, so my descriptions are as boring and concise as possible to prevent that [43]).</p>\n<p>Because a lot of sexual violence incidents lead to unresolvable he-said-she-said arguments, it isn\u2019t clear to me whether publicly outing the real identities of offenders does more good or more harm. Sex offenders can and will smear their survivors with rumors when survivors fight back. This makes unwary people confused and further attacks the victim.</p>\n<p>Sex offenders are not above trying to manipulate friends, witnesses, and investigating organizations, nor are they above gaslighting and manipulating the survivors themselves. The result of an outing can be a huge intractable mess which causes a lot of pain and trouble for a lot of people, including the survivor.</p>\n<p>For some situations and/or survivors, outing might do some good. For others, it will only cause harm.</p>\n<p>Each person has to make their own decision about their own unique situation.</p>\n<p>Because my assessment tells me that outing the following people is not productive at this time, their identities have been intentionally anonymized.</p>\n<p>A list for informational purposes only (please take no drastic actions):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I was told after one EA sex offence, by the offender\u2019s co-worker, that the inappropriate touching was due to \u201cconfusion\u201d related to having read pickup literature. The behavior is unacceptable regardless, but to see what was going on, I decided to read some pickup literature myself. Below is what I found after I was directed to \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d (TRP) by a friend.\n<p>Note: opening up the following three sources is not safe for work, though this summary of them intentionally avoids explicit descriptions. \u201cMale Dominance: A Beginner's Guide\u201d on \u201cThe Red Pill Room\u201d, a blog with over 3 million views, advocates using name-calling, hair pulling, manhandling, and general aggression with women. [32] For another example, a \u201cSixteen Commandments\u201d article on Reddit claims that \u201cTouching a woman inappropriately on the first date will get you further with her than not touching her at all.\u201d [33] In a Reddit compilation PDF known as \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d one author explains that /r/TheRedPill has become a major \"front page of the manosphere\u201d (a play on the Reddit slogan \u201cWelcome to the front page of the internet\u201d). Another author in the compilation states \u201cTRP advocates taking advantage of women to bend them to your will. It absolutely says \"the best basis for a good relationship is Stockholm Syndrome\".\u201d [34]</p>\n<p>Perhaps not all pickup authors encourage violence, but there are definitely some notable examples who do.</p>\n<p>Even if, as some sources claim, some women do like aggressive behavior, this is definitely not true of all women. In addition, it seems to be the case that there is a risk of psychological trauma even among women who can enjoy aggression. Encouraging sexual aggression is not a low-risk thing to do.</p>\n<p>A lot of other people have mentioned pickup. It seems to me that a lot of people in my network have been influenced by pickup artistry. That there exists a sexually aggressive form of pickup and that it has likely influenced or confused some of the people in our social network is concerning. That EAs might use the existence of this pickup lit as an excuse to commit sex offences, or as a way to cover them up is also concerning.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Red Pill\u201d is not merely a stream of crudeness. There are many valid pains and complaints listed in the compilation PDF, mixed with things like exercise and health tips, in between its insults and encouragements to be insolent and aggressive. The book depicts a large schism between men and women. This is very detailed, so it isn\u2019t easy to evaluate how many of the problems it describes are accurate to reality, but at least some of the problems are real. There are wounds to be healed between men and women and the wounds are on both sides.</p>\n<p>There are deep problems here. They won\u2019t be solved overnight. We need to fix various male-female relations issues and promote accurate information about healthy sexuality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>I took an informal survey of the group Women and Non-Binary in Effective Altruism. I included an anonymous feedback form so that participants would feel more comfortable with replying. One of the respondents reported a bad experience with bringing a sex offence to an authority in our social network.</li>\n<li>During an after party for EA Global, someone came up from behind and committed frotteurism against me. There was an obstruction in front of the security camera at the time. These might be unrelated, but it makes sense to think that sex offenders are more likely to strike when accountability is low.</li>\n<li>In an EA workplace, one of the workers unexpectedly kissed me. I was not trying to date this person or anything. I had already turned him down, explaining that I wasn\u2019t available. After he kissed me, I told him \u201cI don\u2019t want you to kiss me.\u201d and he did it again immediately.</li>\n<li>I\u2019ve encountered a significant minority of people who do oppose sexual violence but don\u2019t regard the problem as important. In other words, there is too little \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Information about impact could go a long way.</li>\n<li>An investigator was hired to check for evidence of a sex offence, but sex offences usually leave insufficient evidence. What evidence is left by a kiss, a grope, a rub? Nothing. Money was spent on the investigation. It seems like the right thing to do. However, given that sex offenders usually aren\u2019t caught, one cannot simply investigate a sex offence and decide it didn\u2019t happen because there was no evidence of it. If interpreted this way, investigations can create a false sense of security.\n<p>To be accurate, one has to become very knowledgeable about all the unintuitive ways that victims can respond and choose very carefully between conclusions like that it was an unsubstantiated / unfounded accusation, a partially true / partially false accusation, a false accusation and various others. It takes a lot of information to do this accurately and even professionals in the criminal justice system are known to make mistakes according to research. Professionals like psychologists who work with sexual violence survivors are also needed. A lot of education is needed. (See also: the \u201cHelp replace stereotypes about sexual violence situations with real information.\u201d section.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>A group was being targeted with an unusual number of communications that promoted things like a sexual violence method and sexual violence risk factors. This activity overwhelmed one of the members of the management team. Instead of addressing the problem of an increased number of people promoting sexual violence in the group, most of the management team abandoned the group.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given these observations, I think there is a lot of room for improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Effective sexual violence reduction isn\u2019t an EA focus yet:</strong></p>\n<p>Even if most EAs wouldn\u2019t neglect sexual violence on purpose, most of them don\u2019t have the time to do a thorough job of figuring out what might be an effective way to solve such a complicated and challenging problem. This is not an area that any EA organization specializes in. Sexual violence is more of an issue that comes up from time to time when people are busy working toward other goals. Given the impact at stake, the time required to do the topic justice, and the fact that no EA organization has specialized in it, I believe it\u2019s likely that effectiveness has not yet been maximized throughout the movement. Promoting information on the options and their effectiveness has a chance to do a lot of good</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2>Tractability:</h2>\n<p><strong>The key obstacle:</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as the Department of Justice showed, sex offenders *usually* evade the law. The data supplied by RAINN shows that even in cases where the police become involved, the suspects are likely to go free.</p>\n<p>The law has high standards. Our legal system insists that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. In the legal system, there are serious punishments at stake, so this approach makes sense. Unfortunately, sexual violence often does not leave enough evidence for the criminal justice system to work with.</p>\n<p>Anger is natural, but if we insist on punishment as our only strategy against sex offenders, our burden of proof will leave us mostly undefended.</p>\n<p>In cases where we have too little evidence, we can\u2019t just punish people. This would create a culture of witch hunting. If we create an opportunity to witch hunt, we\u2019ll open ourselves up to being taken advantage of by unscrupulous people.</p>\n<p>Sexual violence is an important enough issue that this challenge shouldn\u2019t stop us. It is for this reason that I offer an exploration of alternative options.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternative sexual violence reduction options explored:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Look for work quality issues.</strong></p>\n<p>Periodically double checking the quality of work being produced by all employees may create opportunities to remove toxic workers. This includes sexually violent people. Harvard Business School explains in a working paper that \u201cworkers with poorer quality performance are more likely to be toxic. Here, a one standard deviation increase in the quality of production results in a 27% decrease in the hazard.\u201c [11]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep an eye on suspected offenders for other forms of misbehavior.</strong></p>\n<p>Some sex offenders misbehave in other ways. One study found that 99 sex offenders committed 20,000 nonsexual offences. [22] That\u2019s not a typo. That\u2019s an average of over 200 offences per person.</p>\n<p>Rapists contributed a disproportionate share.</p>\n<p>Some of the other misbehavior by sex offenders might leave more evidence behind than their sex offences, creating opportunities to oust them. Think carefully about the rules they might have been tempted to break, and any details that seem out of place. Report any useful observations to authorities.</p>\n<p>It could be worthwhile to check the quality of their work as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Look into setting up a sting operation (sex offenders are often criminal generalists).</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously, there is an ethical concern worth worrying about when it comes to what might happen to people participating in a sting operation to bust sex offences. Participants could be traumatized by a sex offender. Gladly, there seems to be significant overlap between sexual violence and other forms of misbehavior which are easier to set up a sting operation for. Therefore, well-designed sting operations meant to detect crimes like theft or fraud may also catch people who commit sex offences. A well-designed sting operation could result in you having the evidence you need to get rid of sex offenders and other criminals by firing the person, having them banned from events, or possibly even put in prison.</p>\n<p>It takes skill to design something which only catches people who are actually misbehaving without generating a bunch of false positives. It also takes skill to avoid unfairly causing people to misbehave (called \u201centrapment\u201d).</p>\n<p>Before attempting a sting operation, ask a lawyer about what is legal for you to do in your region. Also ask what you\u2019ll be able to legally accomplish with the type of evidence you might collect. To minimize risks like false positives and entrapment, please get a knowledgeable person to help design the sting operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Strike a balance between dismissing accusations and witch-hunting people.</strong></p>\n<p>What percentage of rape accusations are false? According to DiCanio, the researchers and prosecutors generally agree on a number somewhere in the range of 2% to 10%. [23] Since 90%-98% of rape accusations are probably true, it makes sense to take them seriously. Since there is a much lower but still uncomfortable chance of them being wrong, it also makes sense to be concerned about punishing an innocent person.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is concern that if we punish people based on accusations alone, more people will make accusations. This is because an incentive would be created for people to make false accusations. Depending on what the punishment is, unscrupulous people could use accusations for all sorts of strategies. Accusations could also be abused in a general way: threatening to make an accusation against someone could be used to control them.</p>\n<p>There are some things which are appropriate to do in the event of an accusation. For instance, do not send people off to be alone with the accused in a meeting room. Do consider reviewing their work for quality issues, looking for evidence of other types of misbehavior, and persuading them to seek treatment if these things can be done safely.</p>\n<p>There are other things which are not appropriate to do in the event of an accusation such as putting them in jail without evidence.</p>\n<p>What is and isn\u2019t appropriate will vary from one situation to the next. Please think about this very carefully.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create a robust sex offender detection strategy.</strong></p>\n<p>Given the state of psychology research, studies on the personality traits of sex offenders *alone* are unlikely to be enough to give us the level of accuracy we desire when it comes to figuring out which people are likely to commit sex offences and which people are not. However, that does not mean they\u2019re worthless. Combining a lot of different numbers and types of research together has the potential to produce far more accurate information than using one type of research alone.</p>\n<p>We can combine all the following together into one probability estimate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The prior probability that an individual is a rapist based on unreported rape research.</li>\n<li>Research on recidivism and the amount of activity different types of offenders tend to have can be used to help estimate future risk.</li>\n<li>We can adjust probabilities based on the percentage of accusations that are found to be true and false.</li>\n<li>We can take into account behavioral risk factors such as whether the person believes rape myths.</li>\n<li>We can then tweak a probability further using personality research.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This could also help people who have been falsely accused to be deemed low risk.</p>\n<p>It might identify people who are low risk due to having reformed, if there is enough relevant research about that.</p>\n<p>This could help us predict and prevent sexual violence.</p>\n<p>It turns out that there is a plethora of information on the various personality traits and other characteristics of sex offenders. [57] [58] [59] [60] (The first citation in this list contains a wide variety of related references. These are just what I found with searches for links between the big five and various terms for sexual violence. A much broader search could be done for links between sexual violence and other personality tests or characteristics.)<br>A thorough analysis is needed to process the available research and to develop and test research-based methods of calculating sexual violence probabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Help solve male-female relations issues.</strong></p>\n<p>Providing a constructive alternative to sexism and hostility could help to reduce these risk factors for sexual violence. For instance, we could open up a dialogue with double crux sessions between people of different genders, focusing on gender related issues. This would take attention away from people who are promoting hatred to people in the group and channel that attention into positive progress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Help minimize sexual violence risk factors throughout your social network.</strong></p>\n<p>Various studies show that certain beliefs about sex and gender are risk factors for sexual violence. [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] If we succeed at reducing confusion and either change aggressive attitudes or drive away the people who harbor them, this could help reduce our risk.</p>\n<p>Specific examples of risk factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Adversarial attitudes about relationships [61]</li>\n<li>Attitudes that violence is acceptable (both the offender and survivor) [62]</li>\n<li>Rape-supportive attitudes and beliefs [65]</li>\n<li>The presence and acceptance of violence [63] (review)</li>\n<li>Rape myths [61]</li>\n<li>Male patriarchal values [66]</li>\n<li>Men's acceptance of traditional sex roles [61]</li>\n<li>Some gender attitudes [65]</li>\n<li>Peer influence (both the offender and survivor) [62]</li>\n<li>Miscommunication about sex [61]</li>\n<li>Sexual misperceptions [64]</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The research probably has not identified a complete list of risk factors. For example, unfortunately, little research has been done to help prevent sexual violence against men. I did find one study on myths about male rape [67] so I can provide a few examples.</p>\n<p>Additional risk factors - rape myths that apply to male rape:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cMen cannot be raped.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201c\u2018Real\u2019 men can defend themselves against rape.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cOnly gay men are victims and/or perpetrators of rape.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cMen are not harmed by rape (or not as much as women).\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cA woman cannot sexually assault a man.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cSexual assault by someone of the same sex causes homosexuality.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cHomosexual and bisexual individuals deserve to be sexually assaulted because they are immoral and deviant.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cIf a victim physically responds to an assault he must have wanted it.\u201d</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please do not stigmatize sexual violence survivors by claiming they\u2019ll become rapists. The abuse to abuser hypothesis is questionable. For one example of why you shouldn\u2019t believe this: more women have been raped than men, but more men are rapists than women. Even if having been sexually abused is a risk factor for some subset of the population who commit sexual violence, we should not assume most survivors will become sex offenders, and this applies to both genders. For more detailed information on the abuse to abuser hypothesis, read \u201cMyths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders\u201d.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encourage careful thinking and learning about certain sexual behaviors.</strong></p>\n<p>Some believe there is a distinction to be made between some form of aggressive play or ritualized aggression and certain other forms of aggression which are deemed unacceptable. When the distinction is made, the version perceived as acceptable might be called \u201ckink\u201d or \u201cBDSM\u201d, etc. Some do not think that this distinction should be made, and believe that aggression should not be combined with sex. The purpose of this section is not to determine the best way or to advise. Making all of the ethical and health distinctions required for this would be a very large project in and of itself, so is outside the scope of this article. That would be unlikely to resolve the controversy anyway. The purpose is simply to refer to a few of the main ways of making the distinctions and to encourage careful thinking, reading and professional consultations to reduce the risk of negative consequences.</p>\n<p>This is not mental health advice, but it\u2019s worth noting that there are books psychologists use to make distinctions between what is considered normal and the class of mental disorders known as paraphilias. Specifically, the ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) and DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistic Manual). Visiting a psychologist is one way to make distinctions.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t take anything in this article as legal advice as I am not a lawyer. Not every kink is legal to act upon in every region. Even if mental health professionals deem a behavior normal or kinky, the legal distinctions don\u2019t always match the psychology distinctions. For another source of relevant information, contact a lawyer in your area.</p>\n<p>Please take this as a summary of information, not as encouragement or advice: Some believe that BDSM (Bondage, Domination, Submission/Sadism, Masochism) can be done ethically and in a healthy way. Even if you have a genuine intent to practice BDSM, you could still commit a sex offence by accident or cause physical harm. For instance, an attempt to practice BDSM role play rape can accidentally result in rape, complete with psychological trauma. Safety practices are employed to make BDSM safer such as consent (sometimes under BDSM specific consent philosophies), negotiation techniques, training, and use of a BDSM philosophy like RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink) or SSC (Safe, Sane, Consensual). Even when all precautions are taken to reduce risk, BDSM still poses some risk. Like sports or motorcycle riding, even things like a helmet won\u2019t bring your risk to zero. If you choose to explore BDSM please keep in mind that people who have received or caused harm during BDSM activities are more likely to leave the community. If you never meet them, you will not learn from their mistakes, and you will not see their level of risk aversion reflected in the community. If you meet people who encourage you to take risks you\u2019re not comfortable with, consider that they may be the lucky people who were left over after an unknown number of unlucky people stopped participating. If you\u2018re interested in BDSM, please consider all the risks very, very carefully and be sure to consult with knowledgeable professionals about the risks rather than just participants.</p>\n<p>If you are not qualified to advise people on which behaviors are ethical and healthy, you can certainly encourage people to think very carefully about the distinctions, explore the best sources of information, and visit all the relevant types of professionals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>View less serious sexual assaults like groping as a security heuristic.</strong></p>\n<p>Because those who commit frottage can be so prolific, sexual assaults like groping are worth reporting on their own. There\u2019s an additional reason to do so:</p>\n<p>Paraphilias are the mental disorders that motivate sex offences, and they tend to come in multiples. One study found that only 10.4 percent of paraphiliacs experienced a single paraphilia and 37.6 percent of them had five to ten paraphilias. [26] An offender with toucherism, the groping paraphilia, could have one or more other paraphilias which motivate them to do other kinds of things. Some paraphilias might not harm others (like masochism). However, hidden among our gropers, there are probably paraphiliacs with biastophilia or pedophilia, the paraphilias that motivate rapists and child molesters. A less serious offence does not necessarily mean you\u2019re dealing with a less serious offender. Ignoring gropers is a gamble.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Learn self-defence, promote self-defence, and/or offer self-defence education.</strong></p>\n<p>In 2005, the National Institute of Justice commissioned a report on the impact of victim self-protection. [27]. Based on this, they created a web page listing certain self-defence actions which reduce the risk of rape and injury: attacking or struggling against the attacker, running away, and verbally warning the attacker. [28]</p>\n<p>Other actions were found to increase risk: stalling, cooperating and screaming from pain or fear.</p>\n<p>Additionally, NIJ shared a study that showed mental health outcomes were better in those who fought back, even if they didn\u2019t win. [29]</p>\n<p>Warning: It\u2019s possible that these research results were skewed by a minority of people who have serious training and/or experience. Some experts regard self-defence courses as likely to give you a false sense of security. Before investing in self-defence training, an in-depth evaluation of effectiveness needs to be completed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Offer a prevention program.</strong></p>\n<p>Many programs were found to be ineffective [68][69] so you\u2019ll need to be careful when selecting a program. One important thing to consider when seeking a program is whether the effects are long-term. [70]</p>\n<p>I found one program which, according to one systematic review, \u201cdemonstrated significant effects on sexually violent behavior\u201d and has long-term results: Safe Dates. [69] The longest follow-up period assessed for the Safe Dates program was 4 years.</p>\n<p>According to the same review, another program, Shifting Boundaries, has a building-level intervention that may be of interest. The effectiveness of Shifting Boundaries was not assessed beyond 6 months. This is better than the results of a lot of other programs which *were* assessed long-term, as the long-term assessments of the other programs showed that they were *not* effective in the long-term. Therefore, Shifting Boundaries may have something worth trying while others are less likely to be useful.</p>\n<p>Please note: these programs were tested on a younger age group than most of the people in EA. I don\u2019t mention them because they are proven to be effective for our age group. I mention them because after going through every page of Google Scholar results for 11 different keyword searches, these are the only programs I found that were supported by research. There\u2019s a chance that these are worth trying to find out whether they work for us.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is to choose a program that gets short-term results and apply it repeatedly, every time the results wear off. To determine whether results can be maintained this way, testing is needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encourage sex offenders to seek help if you can do so safely.</strong></p>\n<p>Most nonincarcerated paraphiliacs in one study said they were motivated to seek treatment by family members, friends, lawyers or healthcare workers. [8] The study doesn\u2019t say what proportion of sex offenders were persuadable. The point is that some of them were persuadable. A significant proportion of the study\u2019s participants were referred this way, so there\u2019s a chance persuasion could work to get sex offenders into treatment. This could be researched further.</p>\n<p>Whether treatment will make a difference for a particular individual isn\u2019t easy to discern, but it\u2019s a serious enough problem that it makes sense for them to *try* treatment to see whether anything works for them. In case believing that treatment doesn\u2019t work for sex offenders is a self-fulfilling prophecy, it might be possible to get better results by taking a less discouraging attitude (while balancing this against the possibility of creating a false sense of security, of course).</p>\n<p>Most of us aren\u2019t qualified to diagnose or treat anyone but we can certainly be part of a more open culture around discussing and promoting the treatment of sexual offending. If people have too little awareness about the treatment options, they might not consider treatment. We can make sure they\u2019ve at least heard about the treatment options.</p>\n<p>If they have privacy concerns, you can urge them to see a lawyer or consider medical tourism. A visit to a lawyer is nowhere near as costly as the damage that sexual offending might cause to their reputations, careers, personal lives, and to their survivors. Some countries have more favorable privacy laws than others, and it may be viable for sex offenders to do medical tourism.</p>\n<p>Obviously, please remember to mind your own safety if you choose to persuade someone to seek treatment for sexual violence. Consider sending a message instead of talking in person. There are still some risks involved in sending messages such as being smeared with rumors if the sex offender is feeling paranoid. An anonymous message with no identifying information would be safer.</p>\n<p>It is also possible for a group to schedule an intervention with the offender to persuade them to get treatment together. This isn\u2019t risk-free, but might offer some increase in security through safety in numbers. On the other hand, a group intervention probably increases the risk of initiating rumors (including retaliatory rumors created by the offender) or starting a kerfuffle.</p>\n<p>Treatments are not something for non-professionals to toy with, but we can certainly talk about possibilities and encourage people with problems to seek professional help.</p>\n<p>Some offenders may have already tried the available treatments without success. Consider persuading such people to switch to earning to give or participating in sexual violence treatment studies instead of working in EA. This could really improve their impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do more research on sexual violence treatment.</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing in this article is medical advice. Please see a professional if you have any health concerns.</p>\n<p>Sex offenders might be treatable, but it\u2019s unclear how effective the options are and sources differ on that. Here\u2019s a brief introduction to the existing treatment research as well as some thoughts about additional areas that could be researched.</p>\n<p>According to \u201cMyths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders\u201d, \u201cMost therapists who treat sex offenders make a point of telling them early on that their condition is \"Incurable\" and \u201cit should be noted that for psychological conditions, the belief of the therapist that the condition is curable is one of the most robust predictors of whether the condition will be (Frank, 1974). The assertion of incurability is thus counterproductive for therapists, for offenders in treatment, and for those attempting to develop and safely evaluate better methods of intervention.\u201d [18]</p>\n<p>A large number of reviews and meta-analyses support various treatment methods [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81]. According to The Cochrane Group, psychological interventions for sex offenders are unsupported [82]. Cochrane\u2019s view on the state of the research in the area of drug treatment research is that it\u2019s pretty poor, so they couldn\u2019t draw strong conclusions about it [83]. According to other sources, it increases effectiveness to use therapy and drugs in combination. [75]</p>\n<p>Treatments that have been researched:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cognitive-behavioral therapy [81] [80] [78] [77] [72] [71]</li>\n<li>Hormonal medication (examples: progestogens and antiandrogens) [81] [75] [72] [71]</li>\n<li>Behaviour modification [81]</li>\n<li>The relapse prevention model of therapy [76]</li>\n<li>Circles of support and accountability [74]</li>\n<li>Treatment programs that adhere to what are known as \u201crisk-need-responsivity principles\u201d. [73]</li>\n<li>Antidepressants have been researched for use as a treatment [49], [50]. These do pose a risk of anorgasmia, especially if the dose is too high. Anorgasmia could be counterproductive, as frustration may increase risk. Additionally, mania is a risk and mania can include disinhibition of libido. [56]</li>\n<li>Combining SSRI with Methylphenidate SR: \u201cAddition of methylphenidate SR (mean dose = 40 mg/day; mean \u00b1 SD duration = 9.6 \u00b1 8.2 months) was associated with additional statistically significant effects on paraphilia/PRD-related total sexual outlet (p = .003) and average time per day (p = .04) in addition to improvement of putative residual ADHD and depressive symptoms.\u201d [51]</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My thoughts on areas where more research has a chance to be useful:</p>\n<p>Important: There are professionals who have more insight into this than I do. Definitely do a consultation with multiple experts before spending research money to test treatments.</p>\n<p>Note on testosterone reduction: although reducing testosterone has been shown to drastically reduce offending, this does not mean high testosterone is the cause of sexual offending. More about this is explained in \u201cMyths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders\u201d.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A large SSRI sexual side effects survey might be a fast way to identify existing drugs for further testing. A description from \u201cMyths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders\u201d [18]: \u201cthe case of a transvestite who had no motivation to lie about the efficacy of treatment. According to this man (and his wife), while taking buspirone (a medication with primary action on serotonergic autoreceptors), he was able to function sexually for the first time in his life with no fetishistic stimuli or fantasies. When he stopped the medication, his dependence on the activity or fantasy of wearing female clothing returned (Fedoroff, 1988). Since then, there have been numerous reports of successful treatment of the full range of paraphilic disorders with a variety of selective serotonergic reuptake inhibiters (SSRIs) (see Greenberg &amp; Bradford, 1997; Fedoroff, 1994).\u201d\n<p>In one study, 56% experienced sexual side-effects on SSRIs, so there could be a plethora of potential treatments among them. [52] Some of the sexual side effects might be useless or risky (like anorgasmia), but some of them might be helpful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The \u201cNoFap\u201d method or similar, if there is a way to make it through the initial frustration period safely. (Which is a larger risk? A sex offender, or a sexually frustrated sex offender?)</li>\n<li>An herbal supplement called Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To might have potential, as it was shown to decrease testosterone. [53] [54] [55] An alternative option might be important for patients who have trouble with anti-androgen side effects.</li>\n<li>Testosterone reduction surgery. This could be especially useful if reducing testosterone works for a patient but they can\u2019t tolerate medication side effects. I haven\u2019t checked, but there might be countries where doctors offer various surgical options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Researching treatments for sexual offending has a chance to be the most cost effective option on a large scale because after the initial research is done, the sex offenders will pay the costs of diagnosis and treatment themselves. With incarceration, taxpayers must keep paying around $30,000 per year per offender (not including the costs involved in catching them). If 6% of men are rapists as the research shows, and there are around 200 million adults in the U.S., keeping every U.S. sex offender in jail would cost at least 180 billion per year. Over the years, this would keep adding up. Treatment research will definitely cost us less in the long-term, and is probably less costly in the short-term too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encourage or host dry events and parties.</strong></p>\n<p>According to a research review, half of all sexual assault perpetrators are under the influence of alcohol at the time of the assault (this ranges from 30% to 75%, depending on the source) [84]. Additionally, researchers have consistently found a positive relationship between sexual assault perpetration and heavy drinking. The review covered three potential explanations for this relationship: one, that alcohol causes sexual violence. Two, that offenders drink \u201cliquid courage\u201d in order to become bold enough to act on aggressive sexual feelings. Three, that there is some other association (for instance: that the personalities of offenders just so happen to make them likely to engage in both alcohol consumption and sexual violence). The review found that alcohol contributes to sexual assault perpetration in multiple, complex ways.</p>\n<p>A different study showed that being released from minimum legal drinking age restrictions was associated with \u201csignificant and immediate increases\u201d in sexual assault perpetration among men throughout most of Canada. [85]</p>\n<p>From a study on the effectiveness of alcohol policy changes: \u201cAlcohol policy may represent one promising avenue for the prevention of sexual violence perpetration at the community level, but additional research is needed.\u201d [86]</p>\n<p>In any case, alcohol is not a necessary component of an EA event. Given the possibility that it might decrease risk to attendees, it seems sensible to have dry events and after parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If appropriate, consider having the accused work from home.</strong></p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have enough cause to fire an employee accused of sexual violence, keeping them away from the workplace might be a doable risk reduction strategy. Some people experience working from home as a reward or punishment, and some regions may have laws about this, so it could sometimes be an inappropriate option. If appropriate, getting them out of the office is a way to reduce the probability of sexual violence in the office.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Centralize reports so that survivors can ally with each other.</strong></p>\n<p>Sex offenders can be quite prolific. One offender could generate a lot of reports. If all of these reports go to different authorities, each authority may only perceive a single game of he-said-she-said which cannot be resolved. If all of the reports go to the same authority, their perspective may be different. If survivors approach the same person together, they can encourage an authority to assign a higher level of priority to implementing sexual violence reduction methods.</p>\n<p>I would be happy to introduce survivors of the same offender to each other. Unlike some of the other options, I am under no professional obligations to report any crimes or take any actions. I might share anonymized aggregated information like the total number of people reporting sexual violence, or, in cases where there are a lot of reports against one offender, the name of the offender (but not the survivors). I will not share a survivor\u2019s name without consent of the survivor, (nor the name of the offender unless there are a lot of reports against them).</p>\n<p>To make a report, you can message me through the effective altruism forum or find me on Facebook.</p>\n<p>If you want to report something to me anonymously, you can. Anonymity limits what I can do with your report because it reduces the credibility of the report. If you want to report something anonymously anyway, my anonymous feedback forms are here:</p>\n<p>Plain one-way feedback:<br> <a href=\"http://www.admonymous.com/kathy_forths_anonymous_feedback_form\">http://www.admonymous.com/kathy_forths_anonymous_feedback_form<br><br></a>Anonymous two-way conversation form:<br> <a href=\"https://sayat.me/KathyForth\">https://sayat.me/KathyForth</a><br><br> Please be aware that to make a police report, you need to visit the police directly. You can request for me to be your advocate, but I cannot make a police report for you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Help replace stereotypes about sexual violence situations with real information.</strong></p>\n<p>The National Victim Center and Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center offer this recommendation: \u201cMany widely held stereotypes about rape, who rape victims are and how they respond after the assault are not accurate. The American public, our criminal justice system, and jurors in rape trials should be provided with accurate information about these topics to eliminate misconceptions about rape and its victims.\u201d [5]</p>\n<p>Human psychology can be complicated and surprising. Even in life-threatening situations like car accidents, a significant proportion of people behave in a counter-intuitive way. In \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma\u201d, a book on psychological trauma, the author describes an emotionally detached response that many have to traumatic events called dissociation. [87]</p>\n<p>A few confusing examples to explain why education about this is so important:</p>\n<p>Example 1: A man claims that someone grabbed his bottom from behind. He didn\u2019t yell in surprise or move away. Instead, he remained still. Is he making a false report, or did he freeze in shock?</p>\n<p>Example 2: A woman claims that someone groped her. Her behavior seems really strange. Did the sexual assault trigger some kind of mental health episode for her or does the presence of symptoms mean this is a false report?</p>\n<p>Example 3: You meet someone who claims they were raped. You don\u2019t see any bruises or signs of a struggle. Does this mean they must have consented or that they felt too intimidated to fight back?</p>\n<p>Do sexual violence survivors ever experience denial, try to pretend that everything is fine and carry on business as usual? Do they ever blame themselves even though it isn\u2019t their fault? If they\u2019re not answering questions, could it be because they are too upset to find the words or can\u2019t make themselves actually say such horrible things out loud?</p>\n<p>These are the kinds of questions we need to be asking ourselves if we encounter a sexual violence survivor who responds in a way that\u2019s different from the stereotypes we have.</p>\n<p>Only a mental health professional with relevant experience is qualified to make distinctions about behaviors like these. If someone makes a report and the details don\u2019t match your stereotypes, consider consulting a psychologist who works with sexual violence survivors.</p>\n<p>It is not possible to do this topic justice in this article. This topic deserves an entire long article of it\u2019s own, complete with many references and multiple professional opinions.</p>\n<p>Please consider this section to be a very brief introduction to a complex problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Object to pressure to go to private and secluded areas alone or with someone.</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is very common for people to be sexually assaulted by someone they know such as an acquaintance, friend, date or lover. Reviews of studies done with college women show that between 10% to 25% of women have been raped by someone they know and that men are targeted in 10% of acquaintance rape cases. [88] [89] [90]</p>\n<p>Not only do sex offenders run free, some of them manage to blend in enough to gain the sort of access necessary for a sexual assault.</p>\n<p>If you notice that two people are required to spend time alone together in places where accountability is low, speak up. For examples: offices with no windows, out-of-the-way meeting rooms, vehicles and elevators. It doesn\u2019t take long to commit a sex offence, depending on what type it is. An elevator ride is easily long enough for a traumatic event to occur in the form of a groping or frotteurism. If people are sometimes required to work alone in secluded areas, this increases risk, too. Encourage management to decrease the risks employees are required to take.</p>\n<p>Never expect anyone to trust someone, even if you do. A sex offender might behave well around a man, but not a woman, or vice versa. They might have unexpected preferences that don\u2019t match you, but do match your friend. Unless you have relevant qualifications, do not expect yourself to be able to tell who is and is not a sex offender by guessing. Even professionals can find this challenging.</p>\n<p>Respect other people\u2019s personal security habits, even if you don\u2019t use the same ones. If someone doesn\u2019t want to take a ride with a person they don\u2019t know well, don\u2019t pressure them. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be alone with you, don\u2019t take it personally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Join EAs and Rationalists Against Abuse (ERAA) on Facebook.</strong></p>\n<p>There is a group and a page for those tough enough to learn about and oppose abuse within the EA/rationality social network. Even raising your own awareness makes a difference. Abusers are not always obvious. Many of them try to confuse people into accepting harmful behavior. Some abusers are confused, themselves, while others are just sadistic and have no objection to trying to hide their sadistic nature. The more shrewdness there is in our network, the more acts of abuse will be spotted and the more instances of confusion will be resolved. The more acts of abuse that are spotted, the more effective actions can be taken. Some of the abusers who\u2019ve joined us are educated and strategic. Therefore, the more non-abusive, educated, strategic people we have increasing their shrewdness, the better.</p>\n<p>In emergencies, call an emergency number like 911.</p>\n<p>This group is NOT for organizing vigilante actions. It is ONLY for organizing effective actions that are also legal.</p>\n<p>The page is public. The group is secret to protect the names of the members. To request access, contact me on Facebook.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>The amount of impact it\u2019s possible to have through in-network sexual violence reduction is high and could be extremely high. In the realm of human rights, sexual violence reduction has the potential to reduce suffering, decrease inequality for homosexuals, bisexuals and women, and save lives (because some survivors kill themselves). In the realm of productivity, up to 80,000 hours of work can be saved for every 208 people protected from rape due to the related suicide risk (for the low estimate). For the high estimate, up to 80,000 hours of work, at a level equal to a highly productive superstar worker (top 1%), might be saved by stopping just one sex offender according to a working paper from Harvard.</p>\n<p>There is no effective altruism organization which specializes in sexual violence reduction and the problem is too complex and unintuitive to assume that people will be effective by default. Additionally, there are places in the effective altruism network where there are signs that awareness needs to be increased.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of options that have a chance to succeed. The impact could be many times greater than the effort it takes to use the options explored herein. Testing is needed to determine the effectiveness of the options. Given the human rights concerns and the potential for a large productivity impact, testing options could turn out to be very worthwhile.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2>Funding Link:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/76645027/1132997725?ref=d5cnw8&amp;token=ea9d7d28\">Evaluate Sexual Violence Risk Reduction Options</a></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h2>References:</h2>\n<p>1.)

Maybe they don&#x2019;t really care <em>that</em> much about those voiceless pink blobs in the early days? Maybe this is one of those things that people think they&#x2019;re <em>supposed</em> to feel very strongly, and yet the emotion isn&#x2019;t actually there. Maybe parents just sort of inwardly shrug when their infants die, and only pretend to be sad about it. If they really cared, wouldn&#x2019;t they demand a system that didn&#x2019;t kill babies?</p>\n<p>In our taxonomy, this would be a &#x201C;decisionmaker is not beneficiary&#x201D; explanation, with the parents and doctors being the decisionmakers, and the babies being the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p>A much simpler hypothesis, isn&#x2019;t it?</p>\n<p>When we try to do inadequacy analysis, there is such a thing as <em>wrong guesses</em> and <em>false cynicism.</em></p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m sure there are some parents who don&#x2019;t bond to their babies all that intensely. I&#x2019;m sure some of them lie to themselves about that. But in the early days when Omegaven was just plain illegal to sell across state lines, some parents would drive for hours, every month, to buy Omegaven from the Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital to take back to their home state. I, for one, would call that an&#xA0;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/uo/make_an_extraordinary_effort/\"><em>extraordinary effort</em></a>. Those parents went far outside their routine, beyond what the System would demand of them, beyond what the world was set up to support them doing by default. Most people won&#x2019;t make an effort that far outside their usual habits even if their own personal lives are at stake.</p>\n<p>If parents are letting their babies die of liver damage <em>because the parents don&#x2019;t care</em>, we should find few extraordinary efforts in these and other cases of baby-saving. This is an observational consequence we can check, and the observational check fails to support the theory.</p>\n<p>For a fixed amount of inadequacy, there is only so much dysfunction that needs to be invoked to explain it. By the nature of inadequacy there will usually be more than one thing going wrong at a time&#x2026; but even so, there&#x2019;s only a bounded amount of failure to be explained. Every possible dysfunction is <em>competing</em> against every other possible dysfunction to explain the observed data. Sloppy cynicism will usually be wrong, just like your Facebook acquaintances who attribute civilizational dysfunctions to giant malevolent conspiracies.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re sloppy, then you&#x2019;re almost always going to find some way to conclude, &#x201C;Oh, those physicists are just part of the broken academic system, what would they really know about the Higgs boson?&#x201D; You will detect inadequacy every time you go looking for it, whether or not it&#x2019;s there. If you see the same vision wherever you look, that&#x2019;s the same as being blind.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>i.</h2>\n<p>In most cases, you won&#x2019;t need to resort to complicated background analyses to figure out whether something is broken.</p>\n<p>I mean, it&#x2019;s not like the only possible way one might notice that the US health care system is a vast, ill-conceived machine that is broken and also on fire is to understand microeconomics and predict <em>a priori</em> that aspects of this system design might promote inadequate equilibria. In real life, one notices the brokenness by reading economists who blog about the grinding gears and seas of flame, and <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/\">listening to your friends sob about the screams coming from the ruins</a>.</p>\n<p>Then what good does it do to understand Moloch&#x2019;s toolbox? What&#x2019;s the point of the skill?</p>\n<p>I suspect that for many people, the primary benefit of inadequacy analysis will be in undoing a mistake already made, where they disbelieve in inadequacy even when they&#x2019;re looking straight at it.</p>\n<p>There are people who would simply never <em>try</em> to put up 130 light bulbs in their house&#x2014;because if that worked, surely some good and diligent professional researcher would have already tried it. The medical system would have made it a standard treatment, right? The doctor would already know about it, right? And sure, sometimes people are stupid, but we&#x2019;re also people and we&#x2019;re also stupid so how could we amateurs possibly do better than current researchers on SAD, et cetera.</p>\n<p>Often the most commonly applicable benefit from a fancy rational technique will be to cancel out fancy irrationality.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1-definition\">1</a></sup> I expect that the most common benefit of inadequacy analysis will be to break a certain kind of blind trust&#x2014;that is, trust arrived at by mental reasoning processes that are insensitive to whether you actually inhabit a universe that&#x2019;s worthy of that trust&#x2014;and open people&#x2019;s eyes to the blatant brokenness of things that are easily <em>observed</em> to be broken. Understanding the background theory helps cancel out the elaborate arguments saying that you <em>can&#x2019;t</em> second-guess the European Central Bank even when it&#x2019;s straightforward to show how and why they&#x2019;re making a mistake.</p>\n<p>Conversely, I&#x2019;ve also watched some people plunge straight into problems that I&#x2019;d guess were inexploitable, without doing the check, and then fail&#x2014;usually falling prey to the Free Energy Fallacy, supposing that they can win just by doing better on the axis they care about. That subgroup might benefit, not from being told, &#x201C;Shut up, you&#x2019;ll always fail, the answer is always no,&#x201D; but just from a reminder to <em>check</em> for signs of inexploitability.</p>\n<p>It may be that some of those people will end up always saying, &#x201C;I can think of at least one Moloch&#x2019;s toolbox element in play, therefore this problem will be exploitable!&#x201D; No humanly possible strictures of rationality can be strict enough to prevent a really determined person from shooting themselves in the foot. But it does help to be aware that the skill exists, before you start refining the skill.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#x2019;re trying to move past modesty or overcome the Free Energy Fallacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Step one is to realize that here is a place to build an explicit domain theory&#x2014;to <em>want</em> to understand the meta-principles of free energy, the principles of Moloch&#x2019;s toolbox and the converse principles that imply real efficiency, and build up a model of how they apply to various parts of the world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Step two is to adjust your mind&#x2019;s exploitability detectors until they&#x2019;re not <em>always</em> answering, &#x201C;You couldn&#x2019;t possibly exploit this domain, foolish mortal,&#x201D; or, &#x201C;Why trust those hedge-fund managers to price stocks correctly when they have such poor incentives?&#x201D;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then you can move on to step three: the fine-tuning against reality.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>ii.</h2>\n<p>In my past experience, I&#x2019;ve both undershot and overshot the relative competence of doctors in the US medical system:</p>\n<p>Anecdote 1: I once became very worried when my then-girlfriend got a headache and started seeing blobs of color, and when she drew the blobs they were left-right asymmetrical. I immediately started worrying about the asymmetry, thinking, &#x201C;This is the kind of symptom I&#x2019;d expect if someone had suffered damage to just one side of the brain.&#x201D; Nobody at the emergency room seemed very concerned, and she waited for a couple of hours to be seen, when I could remember reading that strokes had to be treated within the first few hours (better yet, minutes) to save as much brain tissue as possible.</p>\n<p>What she was really experiencing, of course, was her first migraine. And I expect that every nurse we talked to <em>knew that</em>, but only a doctor is allowed to make <em>diagnoses</em>, so they couldn&#x2019;t legally <em>tell us</em>. I&#x2019;d read all sorts of wonderful papers about exotic and illuminating forms of brain damage, but no papers about the <em>much more common</em> ailments that people in emergency rooms actually have. &#x201C;Think horses, not zebras,&#x201D; as the doctors say.</p>\n<p>Anecdote 2: I once saw a dermatologist for a dandruff problem. He diagnosed me with eczema, and gave me some steroid cream to put on my head for when the eczema became especially severe. It didn&#x2019;t cure the dandruff&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d seen a doctor, so I shrugged and concluded that there probably wasn&#x2019;t much to be done, since I&#x2019;d already tried and failed using the big guns of the Medical System.</p>\n<p>Eight years later, when I was trying to compound a ketogenic meal replacement fluid I&#x2019;d formulated in an attempt to lose weight, my dandruff seemed to get worse. So I checked whether online paleo blogs had anything to say about treating dandruff via diet. I learned that a lot of dandruff is caused by the <em>Candida</em> fungus (which I&#x2019;d never heard of), and that <em>the fungus eats ketones</em>. So if switching to a ketogenic diet (or drinking MCT oil, which gets turned into ketones) makes your dandruff worse, why, your dandruff is probably the <em>Candida</em> fungus. I looked up what kills <em>Candida</em>, found that I should use a shampoo containing ketoconazole, kept Googling, found a paper stating that 2% ketocanozole shampoo is an order of magnitude more effective than 1%, learned that only 1% ketocanozole shampoo was sold in the US, and ordered imported 2% Nizoral from Thailand via Amazon. Shortly thereafter, dandruff was no longer a significant issue for me and I could wear dark shirts without constantly checking my right shoulder for white specks. If my dermatologist knew anything about dandruff commonly being caused by a fungus, he never said a word.</p>\n<p>From those two data points and others like them, I infer that medical competence&#x2014;not medical absolute performance, but medical competence relative to what I can figure out by Googling&#x2014;is high-variance. I shouldn&#x2019;t trust my doctor on significant questions without checking her diagnosis and treatment plan on the Internet, and I also shouldn&#x2019;t trust myself.</p>\n<p>A lot of the times we put on our inadequacy-detecting goggles, we&#x2019;re deciding whether to trust some aspect of society to be more competent than ourselves. Part of the point of learning to think in economic terms about this question is to make it more natural to treat it as a technical question where specific lines of evidence can shift specific conclusions to varying degrees.</p>\n<p>In particular, you don&#x2019;t need to be strictly better or worse than some part of society. The question isn&#x2019;t <em>about</em> ranking people, so you can be smarter in some ways and dumber in others. It can vary from minute to minute as the gods roll their dice.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the modest viewpoint seems to me to have a very <em>social-status</em>-colored perspective on such things.</p>\n<p>In the modest world, either you think you&#x2019;re better than doctors and all the civilization backing them, or you admit you&#x2019;re not as good and that you ought to defer to them.</p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t defer to doctors, then you&#x2019;ll end up as one of those people who try feeding their children organic herbs to combat cancer; the outside view says that that&#x2019;s what happens to most non-doctors who dare to think they&#x2019;re <em>better</em> than doctors.</p>\n<p>On the modest view, it&#x2019;s <em>not</em> that we hold up a thumb and eyeball the local competence level, based mostly on observation and a little on economic thinking; and then update on our observed relative performance; and sometimes say, &#x201C;This varies a lot. I&#x2019;ll have to check each time.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Instead, every time you decide whether you think you can do better, <em>you are declaring what sort of person you are</em>.</p>\n<p>For an example of what I mean here, consider writer Ozy Brennan&#x2019;s taxonomy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think a formative moment for any rationalist&#x2014;our &#x201C;Uncle Ben shot by the mugger&#x201D; moment, if you will&#x2014;is the moment you go &#x201C;holy shit, everyone in the world is fucking insane.&#x201D; [&#x2026;]</p>\n<p>Now, there are basically two ways you can respond to this.</p>\n<p>First, you can say &#x201C;holy shit, everyone in the world is fucking insane. Therefore, if I adopt the radical new policy of not being fucking insane, I can pick up these giant piles of utility everyone is leaving on the ground, and then I win.&#x201D; [&#x2026;]</p>\n<p>This is the strategy of discovering a hot new stock tip, investing all your money, winning big, and retiring to Maui.</p>\n<p>Second, you can say &#x201C;holy shit, everyone in the world is fucking insane. However, none of them seem to realize that they&#x2019;re insane. By extension, I am probably insane. I should take careful steps to minimize the damage I do.&#x201D; [&#x2026;]</p>\n<p>This is the strategy of discovering a hot new stock tip, realizing that most stock tips are bogus, and not going bankrupt.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2-definition\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this sociological hypothesis, people can react to the discovery that &#x201C;everyone in the world is insane&#x201D; by adopting the Maui strategy, or they can react by adopting the not-going-bankrupt strategy.</p>\n<p>(Note the inevitable comparison to financial markets&#x2014;the one part of civilization that worked well enough to prompt an economist, Eugene Fama, to come up with the modern notion of efficiency.)</p>\n<p>Brennan goes on to say that these two positions form a &#x201C;dialectic,&#x201D; but that nonetheless, some kinds of people are clearly on the &#x201C;becoming-sane side of things&#x201D; while others are more on the &#x201C;insanity-harm-reduction side of things.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>But, speaking first to the basic dichotomy that&#x2019;s being proposed, the whole point of becoming sane is that your beliefs <em>shouldn&#x2019;t</em> reflect what sort of person you are. To the extent you&#x2019;re succeeding, at least, your beliefs should just reflect how the world is.</p>\n<p>Good reasoners don&#x2019;t believe that there are goblins in their closets. The ultimate reason for this isn&#x2019;t that goblin-belief is archaic, outmoded, associated with people lost in fantasy worlds, too much like wishful thinking, et cetera. It&#x2019;s just that we opened up our closets and looked and we didn&#x2019;t see any goblins.</p>\n<p>The goal is simply to be the sort of person who, in worlds with closet goblins, ends up believing in closet goblins, and in worlds without closet goblins, ends up disbelieving in closet goblins. Avoiding beliefs that sound archaic does relatively little to help you learn that there are goblins in a world where goblins exist, so it does relatively little to establish that there aren&#x2019;t goblins in a world where they don&#x2019;t exist. Examining particular empirical predictions of the goblin hypothesis, on the other hand, <em>does</em> provide strong evidence about what world you&#x2019;re in.</p>\n<p>To reckon with the discovery that the world is mad, Brennan suggests that we consider the mix of humble and audacious &#x201C;impulses in our soul&#x201D; and try to strike the right balance. Perhaps we have some personality traits or biases that dispose us toward believing in goblins, and others that dispose us toward doubting them. On this framing, the heart of the issue is how we can resolve this inner conflict; the heart isn&#x2019;t any question about the behavioral tendencies or physiology of goblins.</p>\n<p>This is a central disagreement I have with modest epistemology: modest people end up believing that they live in an inexploitable world <em>because they&#x2019;re trying to avoid acting like an arrogant kind of person</em>. Under modest epistemology, you&#x2019;re not supposed to adapt rapidly and without hesitation to the realities of the situation as you observe them, because that would mean trusting <em>yourself</em> to assess adequacy levels; but you can&#x2019;t trust yourself, because Dunning-Kruger, et cetera.</p>\n<p>The alternative to modest epistemology isn&#x2019;t an <em>immodest</em> epistemology where you decide that you&#x2019;re higher status than doctors after all and conclude that you can now invent your own <em>de novo</em> medical treatments as a matter of course. The alternative is deciding for yourself whether to trust yourself more than a particular facet of your civilization at this particular time and place, checking the results whenever you can, and building up skill.</p>\n<p>When it comes to medicine, I try to keep in mind that anyone whatsoever with more real-world medical experience may have me beat <em>cold solid</em> when it comes to any real-world problem. And then I go right on double-checking online to see if I believe what the doctor tells me about whether consuming too much medium-chain triglyceride oil could stress my liver.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3-definition\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>In my experience, people who don&#x2019;t viscerally understand Moloch&#x2019;s toolbox and the ubiquitously broken Nash equilibria of real life and how group insanity can arise from intelligent individuals responding to their own incentives tend to unconsciously translate <em>all</em> assertions about relative system competence into assertions about relative status. If you don&#x2019;t see systemic competence as rare, or don&#x2019;t see real-world systemic competence as driven by rare instances of correctly aligned incentives, all that&#x2019;s <em>left</em> is status. All good and bad output is just driven by good and bad individual people, and to suggest that you&#x2019;ll have better output is to assert that you&#x2019;re individually smarter than everyone else. (This is what status hierarchy feels like from the inside: to perform better is to <em>be</em> better.)</p>\n<p>On a trip a couple of years ago to talk with the European existential risk community, which has internalized norms from modest epistemology to an even greater extent than the Bay Area community has, I ran into various people who asked questions like, &#x201C;Why do you and your co-workers at MIRI think you can do better than academia?&#x201D; (MIRI is the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the organization I work at.)</p>\n<p>I responded that we were a small research institute that sustains itself on individual donors, thereby sidestepping a set of standard organizational demands that collectively create bad incentives for the kind of research we&#x2019;re working on. I described how we had deliberately organized ourselves to steer clear of incentives that discourage long-term substantive research projects, to avoid academia&#x2019;s &#x201C;publish or perish&#x201D; dynamic, and more generally to navigate around the multiple frontiers of competitiveness where researchers have to spend all their energy competing along those dimensions to get into the best journals.</p>\n<p>These are known failure modes that academics routinely complain about, so I wasn&#x2019;t saying anything novel or clever. The point I wanted to emphasize was that it&#x2019;s not enough to say that you want risky long-term research in the abstract; you have to accept that your people won&#x2019;t be at the competitive frontier for journal publications anymore.</p>\n<p>The response I got back was something like a divide-by-zero error. Whenever I said &#x201C;the nonprofit I work at has different incentives that look <em>prima facie</em> helpful for solving this set of technical problems,&#x201D; my claim appeared to get parsed as &#x201C;the nonprofit I work at is <em>better</em> (higher status, more authoritative, etc.) than academia.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>I think that the people I was talking with had already internalized the mathematical concept of Nash equilibria, but I don&#x2019;t think they were steeped in a no-free-energy microeconomic equilibrium view of all of society where <em>most of the time</em> systems end up dumber than the people in them due to multiple layers of terrible incentives, and that this is normal and not at all a surprising state of affairs to suggest. And if you haven&#x2019;t practiced thinking about organizations&#x2019; comparative advantages from that perspective long enough to make that lens <em>more cognitively available</em> than the status comparisons lens, then it makes sense that all talk of relative performance levels between you and doctors, or you and academia, or whatever, will be autoparsed by the easier, more native, more automatic status lens.</p>\n<p>Because, come on, do you <em>really</em> think you&#x2019;re more authoritative/respectable/qualified/reputable/adept than your doctor about medicine? If you think <em>that</em>, won&#x2019;t you start consuming Vitamin C megadoses to treat cancer? And if you&#x2019;re <em>not</em> more authoritative/respectable/qualified/reputable/adept than your doctor, then how could you possibly do better by doing Internet research?</p>\n<p>(Among most people I know, the relative status feeling frequently gets verbalized in English as &#x201C;smarter,&#x201D; so if the above paragraph didn&#x2019;t make sense, try replacing the social-status placeholder &#x201C;authoritative/respectable/etc.&#x201D; with &#x201C;smarter.&#x201D;)</p>\n<p>Again, a lot of the benefit of becoming fluent with this viewpoint is just in having a way of seeing &#x201C;systems with not-all-that-great outputs,&#x201D; often observed extensively and directly, that can parse into <em>something</em> that isn&#x2019;t &#x201C;Am I higher-status (&#x2018;smarter,&#x2019; &#x2018;better,&#x2019; etc.) than the people in the system?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iii.</h2>\n<p>I once encountered a case of (honest) misunderstanding from someone who thought that when I cited something as an example of civilizational inadequacy (or as I put it at the time, &#x201C;People are crazy and the world is mad&#x201D;), the thing I was trying to argue was that the Great Stagnation was just due to unimpressive/unqualified/low-status (&#x201C;stupid&#x201D;) scientists.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4-definition\">4</a></sup> He thought I thought that all we needed to do was take people in our social circle and have them go into biotech, or put scientists through a CFAR unit, and we&#x2019;d see huge breakthroughs.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5-definition\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>&#x201C;<em>What?</em>&#x201D; I said.</p>\n<p>(I was quite surprised.)</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I never said anything like that,&#x201D; I said, after recovering from the shock. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t lift a ten-pound weight with one pound of force!&#x201D;</p>\n<p>I went on to say that it&#x2019;s conceivable you could get faster-than-current results if CFAR&#x2019;s annual budget grew 20x, and then they spent four years iterating experimentally on techniques, and then a group of promising biotechnology grad students went through a year of CFAR training&#x2026;<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6-definition\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>So another way of thinking about the central question of civilizational inadequacy is that we&#x2019;re trying to assess the <em>quantity of effort</em> required to achieve a given level of outperformance. Not &#x201C;Can it be done?&#x201D; but &#x201C;How much work?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This brings me to the single most obvious notion that correct contrarians grasp, and that people who have vastly overestimated their own competence don&#x2019;t realize: It takes <em>far</em> less work to identify the correct expert in a pre-existing dispute between experts, than to make an <em>original contribution</em> to any field that is remotely healthy.</p>\n<p>I did not work out myself what would be a better policy for the Bank of Japan. I believed the arguments of Scott Sumner, who is not literally mainstream (yet), but whose position is shared by many other economists. I sided with a particular band of contrarian expert economists, based on my attempt to parse the object-level arguments, observing from the sidelines for a while to see who was right about near-term predictions and picking up on what previous experience suggested were strong cues of correct contrarianism.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7-definition\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>And so I ended up thinking that I knew better than the Bank of Japan. On the modest view, that&#x2019;s just about as immodest as thinking you can personally advance the state of the art, since who says I ought to be smarter than the Bank of Japan at picking good experts to trust, et cetera?</p>\n<p>But in real life, inside a civilization that is often tremendously broken on a systemic level, finding a contrarian expert seeming to shine against an untrustworthy background is <em>nowhere remotely near</em> as difficult as becoming that expert yourself. It&#x2019;s the difference between picking which of four runners is most likely to win a fifty-kilometer race, and winning a fifty-kilometer race yourself.</p>\n<p>Distinguishing a correct contrarian isn&#x2019;t easy in absolute terms. You are still trying to be better than the mainstream in deciding who to trust.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8-definition\">8</a></sup> For many people, yes, an attempt to identify contrarian experts ends with them trusting faith healers over traditional medicine. But it&#x2019;s still in the range of things that amateurs can do with a reasonable effort, if they&#x2019;ve picked up on unusually good epistemology from one source or another.</p>\n<p>We live in a sufficiently&#xA0;poorly-functioning world that there are many visibly correct contrarians whose ideas are not yet being implemented in the mainstream, where the authorities who allegedly judge between experts are making errors that appear to me trivial. (And again, by &#x201C;errors,&#x201D; I mean that these authorities are endorsing factually wrong answers or dominated policies&#x2014;<em>not</em> that they&#x2019;re passing up easy rewards given their incentives.)</p>\n<p>In a world like that, you can often know things that the average authority doesn&#x2019;t know&#x2026; but <em>not</em> because you figured it out yourself, in almost every case.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iv.</h2>\n<p>Going beyond picking the right horse in the race and becoming a horse yourself, inventing your own new personal solution to a civilizational problem, requires a much greater investment of effort.</p>\n<p>I did make up my own decision theory&#x2014;not from a <em>tabula rasa</em>, but still to my own recipe. But events like that should be <em>rare</em> in a given person&#x2019;s life.&#xA0;Logical counterfactuals in decision theory are one of my <em>few</em> major contributions to an existing academic field, and my early thoughts on this topic were quickly improved on by others.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9-definition\">9</a>&#xA0;</sup>And that was a significant life event, not the sort of thing I believe I&#x2019;ve done every month.</p>\n<p>Above all, reaching the true frontier requires <em>picking your battles</em>.</p>\n<p>Computer security professionals don&#x2019;t attack systems by picking one particular function and saying, &#x201C;Now I shall find a way to exploit these exact 20 lines of code!&#x201D; Most lines of code in a system don&#x2019;t provide exploits no matter how hard you look at them. In a large enough system, there are rare lines of code that are exceptions to this general rule, and sometimes you can be the first to find them. But if we think about a random section of code, the base rate of exploitability is extremely low&#x2014;except in <em>really, really bad code</em> that nobody looked at from a security standpoint in the first place.</p>\n<p>Thinking that you&#x2019;ve searched a large system and found one new exploit is one thing. Thinking that you can exploit arbitrary lines of code is quite another.</p>\n<p>No matter how broken academia is, no one can improve on arbitrary parts of the modern academic edifice. My own base frequency for seeing scholarship that I think I can improve upon is &#x201C;almost never,&#x201D; outside of some academic subfields dealing with the equivalent of &#x201C;unusually bad code.&#x201D; But don&#x2019;t expect bad code to be guarding vaults of gleaming gold in a form that other people value, except with a very low base rate. There do tend to be real locks on the energy-containing vaults not already emptied&#x2026; <em>almost</em> (but not quite) all of the time.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you do not generate a good startup idea by taking some random activity, and then talking yourself into believing you can do it better than existing companies. Even where the current way of doing things seems bad, and even when you really do know a better way, 99 times out of 100 you will not be able to make money by knowing better. If somebody else makes money on a solution to that particular problem, they&#x2019;ll do it using rare resources or skills that you don&#x2019;t have&#x2014;including the skill of being super-charismatic and getting tons of venture capital to do it.</p>\n<p>To believe you have a good startup idea is to say, &#x201C;Unlike the typical 99 cases, in this particular anomalous and unusual case, I think I <em>can</em> make a profit by knowing a better way.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The anomaly doesn&#x2019;t have to be some super-unusual skill possessed by you alone in all the world. That would be a question that always returned &#x201C;No,&#x201D; a blind set of goggles. Having an unusually good idea might work well enough to be worth trying, if you think you can standardly solve the other standard startup problems. I&#x2019;m merely emphasizing that to find a rare startup idea that is <em>exploitable</em> in dollars, you will have to <em>scan and keep scanning,</em> not pursue the first &#x201C;<em>X</em> is broken and maybe I can fix it!&#x201D; thought that pops into your head.</p>\n<p>To win, choose winnable battles; await the rare <em>anomalous</em> case of, &#x201C;Oh wait, that could work.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>v.</h2>\n<p>In 2014, I experimentally put together my own ketogenic meal replacement drink via several weeks of research, plus months of empirical tweaking, to see if it could help me with long-term weight normalization.</p>\n<p>In that case, I did not get to pick my battleground.</p>\n<p>And yet even so, I still tried to design my own recipe. Why? It seems I must have thought I could do better than the best ketogenic liquid-food recipes that had ever before been tried, as of 2014. Why would I believe I could do the best of anyone who&#x2019;s yet tried, when I couldn&#x2019;t pick my battle?</p>\n<p>Well, because I looked up previous ketogenic Soylent recipes, and they used standard multivitamin powders containing, e.g., way too much manganese and the wrong form of selenium. (You get all the manganese you need from ordinary drinking water, if it hasn&#x2019;t been distilled or bottled. Excess amounts may be <em>neurotoxic</em>. One of the leading hypotheses for why multivitamins aren&#x2019;t found to produce net health improvement, despite having many individual components found to be helpful, is that multivitamins contain 100% of the US RDA of manganese. Similarly, if a multivitamin includes sodium selenite instead of, e.g., se-methyl-selenocysteine, it&#x2019;s the equivalent of handing you a lump of charcoal and saying, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a carbon-based lifeform; this has carbon in it, right?&#x201D;)</p>\n<p>Just for the sake of grim amusement, I also looked up my civilization&#x2019;s medically standard ketogenic dietary options&#x2014;e.g., for epileptic children. As expected, they were far worse than the amateur Soylent-inspired recipes. They didn&#x2019;t even contain medium-chain triglycerides, which your liver turns directly into ketones. (MCT is academically recommended, though not commercially standard, as the basis for maintaining ketosis in epileptic children.) Instead the retail dietary options for epileptic children involved mostly soybean oil, of which it has been said, &#x201C;Why not just shoot them?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Even when we can&#x2019;t pick our battleground, sometimes the most advanced weapon on offer turns out to be a broken stick and it&#x2019;s worth the time to carve a handaxe.</p>\n<p>&#x2026; But even then, I didn&#x2019;t try to synthesize my own dietary <em>theory</em> from scratch. There is nothing I believe about how human metabolism works that&#x2019;s unique or original to me. Not a single element of my homemade Ketosoylent was based on my personal, private theory of how <em>any</em> of the micronutrients worked. Who am I to think I understand Vitamin D3 better than everyone else in the world?</p>\n<p>The Ketosoylent didn&#x2019;t work for long-term weight normalization, alas&#x2014;the same result as all other replicated experiments on trying to long-term-normalize weight via putting different things inside your mouth. (The <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/a6/the_unfinished_mystery_of_the_shangrila_diet/\">Shangri-La Diet</a> I mentioned at the start of this book didn&#x2019;t work for me either.)</p>\n<p>So it goes. I mention the Ketosoylent because it&#x2019;s the most complicated thing I&#x2019;ve tried to do <em>without</em> tons of experience in a domain and <em>without</em> being able to pick my battles.</p>\n<p>In the simpler and happier case of treating Brienne&#x2019;s Seasonal Affective Disorder, I again didn&#x2019;t get to pick the battleground; but SAD has received far less scientific attention to date than obesity. And success there again didn&#x2019;t involve coming up with an amazing new model of SAD. It&#x2019;s not weird and private knowledge that sufficiently bright light might cure SAD. The Sun is known to work almost all the time.</p>\n<p>So a realistic lifetime of trying to adapt yourself to a broken civilization looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>0&#x2013;2 lifetime instances of answering &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to &#x201C;Can I substantially improve on my civilization&#x2019;s current knowledge <em>if I put years into the attempt?</em>&#x201D; A few people, but not many, will answer &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to enough instances of this question to count on the fingers of both hands. Moving on to your toes indicates that you are a crackpot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once per year or thereabouts, an answer of &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to &#x201C;Can I generate a synthesis of existing correct contrarianism which will beat my current civilization&#x2019;s next-best alternative, for just myself (i.e., without trying to solve the further problems of widespread adoption), after a few weeks&#x2019; research and a bunch of testing and occasionally asking for help?&#x201D; (See my experiments with ketogenic diets and SAD treatment; also what you would do to generate or judge a startup idea that wasn&#x2019;t based on a hard science problem.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Many</em> cases of trying to pick a previously existing side in a running dispute between experts, if you think that you can follow the object-level arguments reasonably well and there are strong meta-level cues that you can identify.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The accumulation of many judgments of the latter kind is where you get the fuel for many small day-to-day decisions (e.g., about what to eat), and much of your ability to do larger things (like solving a medical problem after going through the medical system has proved fruitless, or executing well on a startup).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>vi.</h2>\n<p>A few final pieces of advice on everyday thinking about inadequacy:</p>\n<p>When it comes to estimating the competence of some aspect of civilization, especially relative to your own competence, try to update hard on your experiences of failure and success. One data point is a hell of a lot better than zero data points.</p>\n<p>Worrying about how one data point is &#x201C;just an anecdote&#x201D; can make sense if you&#x2019;ve already collected thirty data points. On the other hand, when you previously just had a lot of prior reasoning, or you were previously trying to generalize from other people&#x2019;s not-quite-similar experiences, and then you collide directly with reality for the first time, one data point is <em>huge.</em></p>\n<p>If you do accidentally update too far, you can always re-update later when you have more data points. So update hard on each occasion, and take care not to flush any new observation down the toilet.</p>\n<p>Oh, and bet. Bet on everything. Bet real money. It helps a lot with learning.</p>\n<p>I once bet $25 at even odds against the eventual discovery of the Higgs boson&#x2014;after 90% of the possible mass range had been experimentally eliminated, because I had the impression from reading diatribes against string theory that modern theoretical physics might not be solid enough to predict a qualitatively new kind of particle with prior odds greater than 9:1.</p>\n<p>When the Higgs boson was discovered inside the remaining 10% interval of possible energies, I said, &#x201C;Gosh, I guess they <em>can</em> predict that sort of thing with prior probability greater than 90%,&#x201D; updated strongly in favor of the credibility of things like dark matter and dark energy, and then didn&#x2019;t make any more bets like that.</p>\n<p>I made a mistake; and I bet on it. This let me <em>experience</em> the mistake in a way that helped me better learn from it. When you&#x2019;re thinking about large, messy phenomena like &#x201C;the adequacy of human civilization at understanding nutrition,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s easy to get caught up in plausible-sounding stories and never quite get around to running the experiment. Run experiments; place bets; say <em>oops</em>.

But if there is no other easy way to dispose of rubbish, any individual has an incentive to pollute the water. A little pollution won\u2019t matter, so each individual might think it best to pollute. But if all individuals respond to this incentive, the total pollution ruins the water supply, destroying the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good\"><span>public good</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>One way of avoiding the problem is to set up social norms, and punish those who break the norms. You might fine or shun those who pollute the water supply. This will disincentivize pollution, and protect the supply for everyone. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Common-sense morality emphasizes the value of following social norms such as honesty and cooperation. Trust helps communities to cooperate, so we have a norm against lying. Helping others can make everyone better off, so we have a norm that we ought to help others. Being intellectually fair can help people to resolve disagreements, so we have norms against overconfidence and fallacious reasoning. We can call social common goods such as trust </span><span>social capital</span><span>.</span><span> Breaking norms, and therefore destroying social capital, generally is punished with a worse </span><span>reputation</span><span>. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>This means that there are normally two costs to breaking social norms. First, a broken norm damages the common good. The water supply is slightly poisoned; social capital is diminished. Second, the offender is harmed directly through punishment. They can expect to have a worse reputation if caught, and, in extreme cases, might suffer ostracization or job loss. </span><span>Both effects are amplified when an offender acts within a community: not only does the individual damage the public good and risk retribution </span><span>within</span><span> the community, but the community itself may also suffer reputational effects as a whole.</span><span> Since the community normally has a much more significant reputation than an individual, this extra effect can be large. For example, if a member of the community commits a crime, not only will that member be less well respected within the community, but also the community as a whole will look worse and more extreme.</span></p>\n<p><br><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995589/mirroredImages/cZCdfR2nxXQgrzESQ/kfy6rubwdw26ev7izye7.png\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/deontology/\"><span>Deontologists</span></a><span> argue that breaking key social norms, e.g., of honesty, is intrinsically wrong. </span><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/consequentialism/\"><span>Consequentialists</span></a><span> dispute this and argue that norm-breaking should be evaluated by its costs and benefits. It might therefore seem that consequentialists should frequently advocate norm-breaking for the greater good. However, because of large costs to reputation and social capital, even consequentialists should normally follow social norms. There is thus considerable convergence between deontologists and consequentialists, at least when it comes to typical situations and common moral choices.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>But following common-sense norms may not be enough. In some cases the benefits of social capital and good reputation are stronger than is normally realized, particularly when agents represent both themselves and a community. When acting as community members, agents should go further in following social norms than common-sense morality requires. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We have identified four norms which altruists have reason to follow with extraordinary fidelity, but which are often followed imperfectly. (See the concluding remarks for a discussion on how these norms were chosen.) &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span>Be intellectually humble</span></h2>\n<h3><span>The value of being intellectually humble</span></h3>\n<p><span>Intellectual humility is a recognition that one\u2019s beliefs may be false. This recognition may make an agent more likely to update their beliefs when presented with new convincing evidence, which should make their beliefs more accurate in expectation. It is particularly important for effective altruists to be intellectually humble because effective altruism is about using evidence and reason to do as much good as possible. Holding correct beliefs (or as close to correct as we can) both as individuals and as a community is very important for doing good. Holding incorrect beliefs about the best ways to do good normally leads to lower impact - it could even cause net impact to be negative.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Why we underestimate the extent to which we should be intellectually humble</span></h3>\n<p><span>Humans do not tend to be intellectually humble. Instead, we are systematically overconfident.</span><span> There are three ways in which we can characterise overconfidence: overestimation, overplacement, and overprecision.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>First, overestimation of one\u2019s performance, ability or success. For instance, when students rate their exam performance, they systematically overestimate how well they did.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Second, overplacement - the overestimation of one\u2019s performance relative to others. For instance, &nbsp;93% of a sample of American drivers and 69% of a sample of Swedish drivers reported that they were more skillful than the median driver in their own country.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Finally, overprecision - an excessive confidence in one\u2019s epistemic beliefs.</span><span> This is the most pervasive of the three biases.</span><span> When people are 90% confident of something, they are correct less than 50% of the time.</span><span> Intellectual humility mitigates against this overprecision.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Overprecision is a bigger problem when making forecasts, because it leads individuals to neglect other decision aids, such as statistical evidence.</span><span> Effective altruists are normally interested in forecasting their actions into the future, and often into the long term future, so this fact makes overprecision particularly worrying for effective altruists. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Intellectual humility is the opposite of overconfidence, so we think that practicing extraordinary intellectual humility may be a way to counteract overconfidence. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Potential costs of being intellectually humble</span></h3>\n<p><span>There appear to be some benefits to overconfidence. People generally perceive overconfident individuals as having a higher social status within a group.</span><span> If everyone in the effective altruist community rewarded intellectual humility, it might counteract this effect internally. However, overconfidence might still have benefits in other communities. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Overconfidence might also help people \u2018seem smart\u2019 - a specific type of social status. But in the long term, overconfidence is likely to be exposed by mistakes. If someone expresses high confidence in something, and then it is revealed to be conspicuously false, then that person\u2019s reputation is likely to suffer. On the other hand, having a reputation for intellectual humility may help build credibility. Suppose that you often say \u2018I could be wrong about this\u2019. Then one day you say \u2018I am very confident that I am right about this\u2019. Given your history of caution, people are likely to take your second idea more seriously than they would if you were frequently confident. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>As with many crucial norms, there are clearly complex tradeoffs to be made between the costs and benefits of overconfidence. However, (somewhat ironically) we are more confident about this norm being valuable than we are about the other norms in this article. </span></p>\n<h3><span>How to be extraordinarily intellectually humble</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Search for flaws in your own reasoning. </span><span>Try to work out the ways in which your current beliefs might be wrong. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Admit to those flaws</span><span>. If someone else points out a problem with an argument you make, try to acknowledge that. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Be curious about other people\u2019s opinions. </span><span>Try to understand the arguments of people who disagree with you and be open to the possibility that they may be correct and that you may have made a mistake.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span>Have collaborative discussions</span></h2>\n<h3><span>The value of having collaborative discussions </span></h3>\n<p><span>As a community, we are trying to figure out how to do the most good possible. This is a difficult problem, and we need to work together to solve it.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Studying the best ways of doing good often involves discussions on ethical positions and choices that may be important parts of people\u2019s identities. It is easy for discussions of such important issues to turn into antagonistic debates or disputes. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Such disputes are unlikely to lead to the right answer. A collaborative discussion is more likely to help all parties approach the correct answer.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Moreover, conflict could lead to the movement splitting. Examples of other movement splits include the split between </span><a href=\"https://herstoria.com/suffragists-and-suffragettes-an-overview-of-the-votes-for-women-campaign/\"><span>the suffragists and the suffragettes in the early 20th century</span></a><span>, the radical abolitionists and the moderate </span><span>antislavery reformers in the 18th and 19th century, and the civil rights movement and the black power movement in the late 20th century. </span><span>These splits tend to occur due to complex ideological conflicts, which become more problematic as movements grow. Collaborative discussions might help to resolve such conflicts. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Why we underestimate the value of collaborative discussions</span></h3>\n<p><span>People often have a hard time discussing sensitive issues collaboratively. For most people, the instinctive response to criticism is to be defensive. This defensiveness can be reinforced by cognitive biases. For example, when people are presented with someone else\u2019s argument, they are generally very good at spotting the weaknesses. But when they examine their own arguments, they are much worse at finding flaws. This is an example of a self-serving bias, which occurs due to the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem.</span><span> Trying to be extraordinarily collaborative can help overcome this bias. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Potential costs of having collaborative discussions </span></h3>\n<p><span>Having collaborative discussions is hard. We must overcome our natural bias to \u2018win\u2019 each discussion. However, the benefits of collaborative discussion seem to outweigh the cost of this effort. We are reasonably confident that this norm is valuable. </span></p>\n<h3><span>How to have extraordinarily collaborative discussions</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Aim for the highest levels of the disagreement hierarchy. </span><span>Paul Graham has developed a way to classify forms of disagreement. The best collaborative discussions will employ the higher level forms of disagreement such as addressing the argument and addressing the central point. A collaborative discussion will avoid the lower levels of the hierarchy (name calling, ad hominem arguments, responding to tone). Read more about the hierarchy </span><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html\"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Use the Center for Applied Rationality\u2019s (CFAR) double crux technique. </span><span>This technique involves working out the fundamental reason (or crux) for one\u2019s belief and one\u2019s discussion partner\u2019s contradictory belief. For example, imagine I believe A and my discussion partner believes not A. The crux of the argument, B, is something we also both disagree on, and which, if either of us changed our minds about B, it would also change our mind on A. By identifying the crux, you can look for experiments to test the crux. For instance, B might be something which has been researched, or that can be observed. Read more </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/\"><span>here</span></a><span>, and read a criticism of the technique </span><a href=\"https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/nm6XuC9CzNBrthpPB/contra-double-crux\"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Paraphrase the other person\u2019s position. </span><span>This allows you to establish whether you have fully understood what they were trying to communicate. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Take pride in having changed your mind</span><span> and compliment people who demonstrate an ability to change their mind. This comprises another norm that works in concert with having collaborative discussions.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Keep calm</span><span>. By staying calm, you can discuss a topic more objectively and are less likely to become defensive.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span>Be extraordinarily honest</span></h2>\n<h3><span>The value of being extraordinarily honest </span></h3>\n<p><span>Honesty requires refraining from lying. But our conception of honesty entails more than that. &nbsp;It also means avoiding misleading people in other ways. (Some might conceptualize this as intellectual honesty). On this conception, presenting the truth in such a way that people are likely to misinterpret it is dishonest. &nbsp;For example, consider the following famous exchange between Bill Clinton and Jim Lehrer during the Lewinsky scandal</span><span>:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Lehrer: \u201cNo improper relationship\u201d: define what you mean by that.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clinton: Well, I think you know what it means. It means that there is not a</span></p>\n<p><span>sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship, or any other kind of improper relationship.</span></p>\n<p><span>Lehrer: You had no sexual relationship with this young woman?</span></p>\n<p><span>Clinton: There is not a sexual relationship \u2013 that is accurate.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>There had been a sexual relationship between Lewinsky and Clinton. But Clinton\u2019s statement was technically true: at the time of the interview, Clinton and Lewinsky were no longer sexually involved. This way of deceiving by telling the truth is known as paltering. It falls under our conception of dishonest behaviour. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>A close parallel can be drawn between effective altruists and scientists. We expect scientists to be extremely honest when presenting their results and theories: we expect them to discuss the reasons why they might be wrong, and share disconfirming data. Effective altruists should be held to similarly high standards.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We often underestimate the negative indirect effects of being dishonest. These effects are even stronger within a community. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>For example, Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld, the two founding staff of GiveWell, promoted GiveWell on several blogs and in email forums either by disguising their identities and not revealing their associations with GiveWell.</span><span> This practice is known as astroturfing.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Of course, such tactics might have garnered GiveWell more donations to effective charities. However, we think that the costs of this dishonesty outweighed the benefits. Karnofsky and Hassenfeld were found out, damaging the reputation of GiveWell. If GiveWell had not admitted their dishonesty, this could have further harmed their reputation, meaning fewer donations in the long run. And since the organisation is affiliated with the effective altruism community, this could also have harmed the community\u2019s reputation significantly.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>In fact, GiveWell reacted in an extraordinarily honest manner. They issued a full public disclosure and apology, and directly notified all existing donors of the incident. They also have a full record of the incident on their \u2018Our Mistakes\u2019</span><span> page on their website. The dishonesty was still damaging, but somewhat mitigated by complete honesty after the fact.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Dishonesty is also \u2018contagious\u2019.</span><span> If people around you are being dishonest, then you are more likely to be dishonest. This means that communities become either predominantly honest or predominantly dishonest, since individuals joining the community adapt to the level of honesty. So people trying to do good should favour honesty, in part to encourage honesty in others.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Honesty can also be very helpful when an agent turns out to have been wrong. If I promote a cause I\u2019m very confident in, and lie, I may persuade more people to join my cause. But later, if it turns out that I am wrong in my private reasoning, then the magnitude of my mistake is multiplied by the number of people I deceived. If, on the other hand, I am open with my honest reasoning, other people are at liberty to discover my mistake and prevent a bad outcome.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Potential costs of being extraordinarily honest</span></h3>\n<p><span>Some might argue that there are significant costs to being extraordinarily honest. First, being honest opens you up to more criticism, which may damage your reputation. If you share details about what you did, people are more likely to find mistakes you make. But often this criticism helps you to work out how to improve, and this benefit outweighs costs to your reputation.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Another cost is that some forms of honesty can be perceived as unkind. For example, telling someone that they are unskilled at something is likely to upset them, even if it is objectively true. However, there are often ways of delivering honest feedback which are kinder. These might involve careful phrasing, and offers of help. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The costs of honesty can sometimes be significant. However, we believe that they are outweighed by the long-term benefits of honesty more often than most people are inclined to think.</span></p>\n<h3><span>How to be extraordinarily honest</span></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>It is difficult to be extraordinarily honest. There has been little research into concrete ways in which individuals can reduce micro-deceptions.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Write yourself a personal commitment to be exceptionally honest and sign it</span><span>. A study by Lisa Shu and colleagues found that declaring their intentions to be honest led to participants actually being more honest.</span><span> This practice is also enacted at Princeton University where the undergraduates sign an Honour Code, stating that they will not cheat in their exams. The exams are subsequently taken without any supervision.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Apply debiasing techniques to prevent unintentional intellectual dishonesty. </span><span>Debiasing can be difficult to do in practice. Just being aware of a bias doesn\u2019t solve it. To prevent confirmation bias, one valuable technique is to \u201cconsider the opposite\u201d, e.g., actively generate arguments which contradict your initial position. More information about debiasing can be found </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/7ep/practical_debiasing/\"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span>Assist others</span></h2>\n<h3><span>The value of assisting others</span></h3>\n<p><span>Suppose that one person has set up an effective altruist research group and does not think that funding the arts is high impact. Another person has set up an art restoration charity which does not align with effective altruist values. However, both people know donors who might be interested in the other person\u2019s cause. They can make mutual introductions at a very low cost which both would significantly benefit from. Thus they are both better off if both parties make relevant introductions. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>When we can, we should assist others from outside the community in this way. Besides the benefits this gives to them, helping others boosts the reputation of us individually and as a community. &nbsp;The obvious caveat to this is that we should not help organisations and individuals which cause harm. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Effective altruists have an even stronger motivation to help others </span><span>within</span><span> the community. If you help someone who has the same goal, then you both move closer to that goal.</span><span> Nick Bostrom was one of the first people to work on reducing existential risk. Kyle Scott also cared about existential risk, and chose to become Nick Bostrom\u2019s research assistant. He reasoned that if he could save Bostrom one hour spent on activities besides research, then Bostrom could spend an extra hour researching.</span><span> In this way, he could multiply his impact. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Why do we underestimate the extent to which we should assist others</span></h3>\n<p><span>O</span><span>ur own impact is often more salient to us than others\u2019 impact. We might prefer to have direct impact ourselves, since we will receive more credit that way. These factors mean that we probably don\u2019t value others\u2019 impact enough, and don\u2019t spend enough time helping them. We can help overcome this bias by assisting others to an extraordinary degree. We can also give credit where it is due, in order to make people more confident that if they are helpful, their impact as a helper will be recognized.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Potential costs of assisting others</span></h3>\n<p><span>Assisting others often takes time, money and energy</span><span>.</span><span> However, we can often help others even with little effort. Take Adam Rifkin, who is LinkedIn\u2019s best networker.</span><span> Rifkin founded numerous technology startups. As his success grew, he received more and more requests for help and advice. He therefore decided to assist others in a particular way. He pledged to make three introductions per day between people who could benefit from knowing each other. This gave him the time and energy to focus on his own projects while still managing to help others to an extraordinary extent. Some favours will be too big to grant, but you can still generate lots of value through smaller interventions.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Of course, some people will accept your assistance but not reciprocate. They will receive all the benefits of cooperation while not incurring any costs on themselves. This is known as the free-rider problem. Free-riding undermines the norm of cooperation, which makes it less likely that help is given when needed.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>One way to reduce free-riding is to increase individual identifiability.</span><span> For instance, we could publicly reward those who are perceived as being exceptionally helpful. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The costs of assisting others to an extraordinary degree may sometimes outweigh the benefits, particularly for people whose time is very valuable. So this norm should not be followed mechanically: keep an eye out for chances to help others, and confirm that the opportunities you take actually produce value.</span></p>\n<h3><span>How to assist others to an extraordinary degree</span></h3>\n<p><span>It is important to consider the best ways in which you can assist others. You should share your expertise. If you know lots about design, but not much about writing, you should probably turn down requests for help with writing, and focus on helping those who need design advice. In particular, you should probably think about your comparative advantage: what are you good at, relative to others in the community? If you are a decent programmer in a community of excellent programmers, you should perhaps focus on sharing other skills. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Some specific suggestions for ways in which you can assist others:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Share knowledge</span><span>. If you know a lot about an area, help others to learn by writing up what you\u2019ve found. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Make introductions</span><span>. Making introductions is a low cost, high benefit action. You might not be able to help someone personally, but you can introduce them to someone who can.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Provide hands-on project support. </span><span>This often has high costs in time and effort. &nbsp;You can mitigate against this by agreeing to help them in a way where you have a lot to add. For example, if you have experience with building websites, you could help someone set up a website for their project, rather than helping with many aspects of the project.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Give advice or guidance. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Concluding remarks</span></h2>\n<p><span>These norms were selected through </span><span>analysing common norms on LessWrong and the Effective Altruism Forum, and creating a long list of norms. Through extensive discussion with other effective altruists and a poll, these </span><span>norms emerged </span><span>as particularly promising. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Of course, the four norms discussed here are not the only norms which we should adhere to.</span><span> If you are trying to help others effectively, you should, for instance, generally act considerately and avoid being insulting. However, people generally adhere to those norms quite well in daily life. We selected these four because their value might be underestimated - because people have biases against following them.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>If these norms are as valuable as they appear, we should also promote them. We ought to reward adherence to these norms and punish noncompliance. For example, we could introduce an honor code to guard against dishonesty. Building systems to spread these &nbsp;norms could also help spread the norms beyond the effective altruist community and thus increase societal social capital. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>If you have found these arguments convincing, we recommend that you get involved in the effective altruism community in person (if you haven\u2019t already done so). Many of these norms are difficult to adhere to. By getting involved with a local group or attending an EAGx/ EA Global conference, you may become more motivated to follow these norms.

But I suspect a lot of people reading this conversation understand that part already, so instead I&#x2019;ll turn my attention to venture capital.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;It sounds like the &#x201C;politicians&#x201D; and the &#x201C;voters&#x201D; might be a more key issue, if the cultural translator is right about what those correspond to.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Ah! But it turns out that venture capitalists and startups can be seen as a simpler version of voters and politicians, so it&#x2019;s better to consider entrepreneurs first.</p>\n<p>Besides, at this point I imagine the Visitor is wondering, &#x201C;Why can&#x2019;t anyone <em>make any money</em> by saving those babies? Doesn&#x2019;t your society have a profit incentive that fixes this?&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Actually, I don&#x2019;t think that <em>was</em> high on my list of questions. It&#x2019;s understood among my people that not every problem is one you can make a profit by fixing&#x2014;<em>persistent</em> societal problems tend to be ones that don&#x2019;t have easily capturable profits corresponding to their solution.</p>\n<p>I mean, <em>yes</em>, if this was all happening on our world and it wasn&#x2019;t already being addressed by the Serious People, then somebody <em>would</em> just mix the bleeping nutrients and sell it to the bleeping parents for bleeping money. But at this point I&#x2019;ve already guessed that&#x2019;s going to be illegal, or saving babies using money is going to be associated with the wrong Tower and therefore unprestigious, or your parents are using a particular kind of statistical analysis that requires baby sacrifices, or whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Hey, details matter!</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;(<em>in sad reflection</em>) Do they? Do they really? Isn&#x2019;t there some point where you just admit you can&#x2019;t stop killing babies and it doesn&#x2019;t really matter why?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;No. You can <em>never</em> say that if you want to go on being a cynical economist.</p>\n<p>Now, there are several different kinds of molasses covering the world of startups and venture capital. It&#x2019;s the <em>tradition-bound</em> aspects of that ecosystem that we&#x2019;ll find especially interesting, since according to its own ideology, venture capitalists are supposed to chase strange new ideas that other venture capitalists don&#x2019;t believe in. Walking through the simpler case of venture capital will help us understand the more complex reasons why voters and politicians are nailed into their own equilibria, underpinning the ultimate reasons why nobody can change the laws that prevent change.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;(<em>gazing off into the distance</em>) &#x2026; I wonder if maybe there are some worlds that can&#x2019;t be saved.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Suppose it&#x2019;s widely believed that the most successful entrepreneurs have red hair. If you&#x2019;re an unusually smart venture capital company that realizes that, <em>a priori</em>, hair color doesn&#x2019;t seem like it should correlate to entrepreneurial ability, you might think you could make an excess profit by finding some overlooked entrepreneur with blonde hair.</p>\n<p>The key insight here is that venture capital is a <em>multi-stage</em> process. There&#x2019;s the initial or pre-seed round, the seed round, the Series A, the Series B, the middle rounds, the Series C&#x2026; and if the startup fails to raise money on any of those rounds before they become durably profitable, they&#x2019;re dead. What this means is that the seed-round investors need to consider the probability that the company can successfully raise a Series A. If the angels invest in the seed round of a company whose entrepreneurs don&#x2019;t have red hair, that company won&#x2019;t be able to raise a Series A and will go bust and the angel investment will be worthless. So the angel investors need to decide where to invest, and what price to offer, based partially on their beliefs about what most Series A investors believe.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Ah, I&#x2019;ve heard of this. It&#x2019;s called a Keynesian beauty contest, where everyone tries to pick the contestant they expect everyone else to pick. A parable illustrating the massive, pointless circularity of the paper game called the stock market, where there&#x2019;s no objective except to buy the pieces of paper you&#x2019;ll think other people will want to buy.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;No, there are real returns on stocks&#x2014;usually in the forms of buybacks and acquisitions, nowadays, since dividends are tax-disadvantaged. If the stock market has the nature of a self-fulfilling prophecy, it&#x2019;s only to the extent that high stock prices directly benefit companies, by letting the company get more capital or issue bonds at lower interest. If not for the direct effect that stock prices had on company welfare, it wouldn&#x2019;t matter at all to a 10-year investor what other investors believe today. If stock prices had zero effect on company welfare, you&#x2019;d be happy to buy the stock that nobody else believed in, and wait for that company to have real revenues and retained assets that everyone else could see 10 years later.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;But <em>nobody</em> invests on a 10-year horizon! Even pension companies invest to manage the pension manager&#x2019;s bonus this year!</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Surely the recursive argument is obvious? If most managers invest with 1-year lookahead, a smarter manager can make a profit in 1 year by investing with a 2-year lookahead, and can continue to extract value until there&#x2019;s no predictable change from 2-year prices to 1-year prices.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;In the entrepreneurial world, startups are killed outright, very quickly, by the equivalent of low stock prices. <em>And</em> for legal reasons there are no hedge funds that can adjust market prices en masse, so the recursive argument doesn&#x2019;t apply. The upshot is that seed investors have a <em>strong</em> incentive to care about what Series A investors think. If the entrepreneurs don&#x2019;t fit the stereotype of cool entrepreneurs who have red hair, you can&#x2019;t make an excess return by going against the popular misapprehension, because the startup will die in the next funding round.</p>\n<p>The key phenomenon underlying the social molasses is that there&#x2019;s a self-reinforcing equilibrium of beliefs. Maybe a <em>lot</em> of the Series A investors think the idea of entrepreneurs needing to have red hair is objectively silly. But they expect Series B investors to believe it. So the Series A investors don&#x2019;t invest in blonde-haired entrepreneurs. So the seed investors are right to believe that &#x201C;Series A investors won&#x2019;t invest in blonde-haired companies&#x201D; even if a lot of the reason why Series A investors aren&#x2019;t investing is not that they believe the stereotype but that they believe that Series B investors believe the stereotype. And from the outside, of course, all that investors can <em>see</em> is that most investors aren&#x2019;t investing in blonde-haired entrepreneurs&#x2014;which just goes to reinforce everyone&#x2019;s belief that everyone else believes that red-haired entrepreneurs do better.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10-definition\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;And you can&#x2019;t just have everyone say those exact words aloud, in unison, and simultaneously wake up from the dream?</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;I&#x2019;m afraid people don&#x2019;t understand recursion as well as that would require.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Perhaps, Simplicio, it is only that most VCs believe that most other VCs don&#x2019;t understand recursion; that would have much the same effect in practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Or maybe most people <em>are</em> too stupid to understand recursion. Is that something you&#x2019;d be able to accept, if it were true?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Regardless, on a larger scale, what we&#x2019;re seeing is an extra stickiness that results when the incentive to try an innovation requires you to believe that <em>other people will believe</em> the innovation will work. An equilibrium like that can be <em>much stickier</em> than a scenario where, if <em>you</em> believe that a project will succeed, <em>you</em> have an incentive to try it <em>even if</em> other people expect the project to fail.</p>\n<p>Stereotypically, the startup world is supposed to consist of heroes producing an excess return by pursuing ideas that nobody else believes in. In reality, the multi-stage nature of venture capital makes it very easy for the field to end up pinned to traditions about whether entrepreneurs ought to have red hair&#x2014;not because everyone believes it, but because everyone believes that everyone believes it.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>viii. First-past-the-post and wasted votes</h2>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Does this feed back into our primary question of why your society can&#x2019;t stop itself from feeding poisonous substances to babies?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;It&#x2019;s true that venture capitalists are now collectively skeptical of attempts at new drug development, but the real problem (at least for cases like this) is the enormous cost of approval and the long delays the FDA causes.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11-definition\">11</a></sup> The actual reason I went into this is that by understanding venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, we can understand the more complex case of voters and politicians. Which is the key to the <em>political</em> equilibrium that pins down the FDA, and all the other laws that prevent anyone from doing better. Not always, but quite often, the ultimate foundations of failure trace back to the molasses covering voters and politicians.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;I&#x2019;d like to offer, throughout whatever theory follows, the alternative hypothesis that voters are <em>in fact</em> just fools, sheep, and knaves. I mean, you should at least be considering that possibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;The simplest way of understanding the analogy between venture capitalists and voters is that voters have to vote for politicians that are electable.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Uh, what? When you write down your preference ordering on elected representatives, you need to put politicians that other voters prefer at the top of your preference ordering?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Yes, that&#x2019;s pretty much what it amounts to. In the US, at least, elections are run on what&#x2019;s known as a &#x201C;first-past-the-post&#x201D; voting system. Whoever gets the most votes in the contest wins. People who study voting systems widely agree that first-past-the-post is among the <em>worst</em> voting systems&#x2014;it&#x2019;s provably impossible for one voting system to have all the intuitively good properties at once, but FPTP is one of the <em>most</em> broken.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Why not vote to change the voting system, then?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;I&#x2019;ll get to that!</p>\n<p>There are several ways of explaining what&#x2019;s wrong with FPTP, but a lovely explanation I recently encountered phrases the explanation in terms of &#x201C;wasted votes&#x201D;&#x2014;the total number of votes that can be removed without changing the outcome.</p>\n<p>The two classic forms of gerrymandering are <em>cracking</em> and <em>packing</em>. Let&#x2019;s say the parties are Green and Orange, and the Green party is in charge of drawing the voting boundaries. As a Green, you want to draw up districts such that Green politicians win with 55% of the vote&#x2014;with some room for error, but not all that much&#x2014;and for Orange politicians to win with 100% of the vote.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Ah, so that the Orange politicians won&#x2019;t need to be responsive to Orange voters because their re-election is nearly guaranteed, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;No, the plot is far more diabolical than that. Consider a district of 100,000 people, where a Green politician wins with 55% of the vote. When 50,001 Green voters had cast their ballots, the election was already decided, under first-past-the-post, so the next 4,999 Green votes are &#x201C;wasted&#x201D;&#x2014;this is to be understood as a technical term, not a moral judgment&#x2014;in that they don&#x2019;t further change the outcome. Then 45,000 Orange votes are also &#x201C;wasted,&#x201D; in that they don&#x2019;t change the outcome. And also, one notes, those Orange voters don&#x2019;t get the representative they wanted.</p>\n<p>In an Orange district of 100,000 where the politician wins with 100% of the vote, there are 50,000 potent Orange votes and 50,000 wasted Orange votes. In total, there are 50,000 potent Green votes, 5,000 wasted Green votes, 50,000 potent Orange votes, and 95,000 wasted Orange votes. On a larger scale, this means that you can control a majority of a state legislature with slightly more than 1/4 of the votes&#x2014;just have 55% of the districts containing 55% Green voters, with everything else solid Orange.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;And then this quarter of the population rules cruelly over the remaining three-quarters, who in turn lack the weapons to rise up?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;No, the real damage is far subtler. Let&#x2019;s say that Alice, Bob, and Carol have taken time off from their cryptographic shenanigans to run for political office. Alice is in the lead, followed by Bob and then by Carol. Suppose Dennis prefers Carol to Bob, and Bob to Alice. But Dennis can&#x2019;t actually write &#x201C;Carol &gt; Bob &gt; Alice&#x201D; on a slip of paper that gets processed by a trivially more sophisticated voting system. Dennis is only allowed to write down one candidate&#x2019;s name, and that&#x2019;s his vote. Under a system where the candidate with the most votes wins, and there&#x2019;s uncertainty about which of the two frontrunners might win, <em>all votes for whoever is in third place will be wasted votes</em>, and this fact is predictable to the voters.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Ah, I see. That&#x2019;s why you introduced your peculiar multi-stage system of venture capital, which I assume must be held in place by laws forbidding anyone else to go off and organize their own financial system differently, and observed how it creates a sticky equilibrium in which financiers must believe that other financiers will believe in a startup.</p>\n<p>If Dennis doesn&#x2019;t believe that other &#x201C;voters&#x201D; will believe in Carol, Dennis will vote for Bob, which makes your politics stickier than a system in which &#x201C;voters&#x201D; were permitted to support the people they actually liked.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Well, you see the analogy, but I&#x2019;m not sure you appreciate the true depth of the horror.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;I&#x2019;m sure I don&#x2019;t.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;The upshot of first-past-the-post is typically a political system dominated by exactly two parties.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Parties?</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Entities that tell sheep who to vote for.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;In elections that have a single winner, votes for any candidate who isn&#x2019;t one of the top two choices are wasted. In a representative democracy where districts vote on representatives who vote on laws, the dynamics of the district vote are then influenced by the dynamics of the national vote. Even if a third-party candidate could win a district, they wouldn&#x2019;t have anyone to work with in the legislature, and so their votes would generally be wasted.</p>\n<p>In the absence of a way to solve a large coordination problem, there&#x2019;s no way for a third party to gain marginal influence over time. Each individual who considers voting for a third-party candidate knows they&#x2019;ll be wasting their vote. This also means that third parties can&#x2019;t field good candidates, since potential candidates know they&#x2019;d be running to lose, which is stressful and unrewarding for people with better life options. And that&#x2019;s a sufficient multi-factor system to prevent strong third parties from arising. When you&#x2019;re not allowed to vote for Carol, who you actually like, you&#x2019;ll vote for whichever of Alice and Bob you dislike the least.</p>\n<p>The resulting equilibrium&#x2026; well, Abramowitz and Webster found that what mainly predicted voting behavior wasn&#x2019;t how much the voter liked their preferred party, but how much they disliked the opposing party.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12-definition\">12</a></sup> Essentially, the US has two major voting factions, &#x201C;people who hate Red politicians&#x201D; and &#x201C;people who hate Blue politicians.&#x201D; When the Red politicians do something that Red-haters <em>really</em> dislike, that gives the Blue politicians more leeway to do additional things that Red-haters mildly dislike, which can give the Red politicians more leeway of their own, and so the whole thing slides sideways.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Looking at the abstract of that Abramowitz and Webster paper, isn&#x2019;t one of their major findings that this type of hate-based polarization has <em>increased</em> a great deal over the last twenty years?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Well, yes. I don&#x2019;t claim to know exactly why that happened, but I suspect the Internet had something to do with it.</p>\n<p>In the US, the current two parties froze into place in the early twentieth century&#x2014;before then, there was sometimes turnover (or threatened turnover). I suspect that the spread of radio broadcasting had something to do with the freeze. If you imagine a country in the pre-telegraph days, then it might be possible for third-party candidates to take hold in one state, then in nearby states, and so a global change starts from a local nucleus. A national radio system makes politics less local.</p>\n<p>The Internet might have pushed this phenomenon further and caused most of politics to be about the same national issues, which in turn reinforces the Red-vs.-Blue dynamic that allows each party to sustain itself on hatred for the other.</p>\n<p>But that&#x2019;s just me trying to eyeball the phenomenon using American history&#x2014;I haven&#x2019;t studied it. Other countries that also have the radio and Internet and similar electoral dynamics do manage to have more than two relevant parties, possibly because of dynamics that cause the votes of third-party politicians to be less wasted.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Isn&#x2019;t the solution here obvious, though? All of these problems are caused by voters&#x2019; willingness to compromise on their principles and accept the lesser of two evils.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Would things be better if people chose the greater of two evils? If they acted ineffectually against that greater evil? The Nash equilibrium isn&#x2019;t an illusion. Individuals would do worse by playing away from that Nash equilibrium. Wasted votes <em>are</em> wasted. The current system <em>is</em> an effective trap and the voters <em>are</em> trapped. They can&#x2019;t just wish their way out of that trap.</p>\n<p>There doesn&#x2019;t need to be any way for good to win; and if there isn&#x2019;t, the lesser evil really is the best that voters can do. Pretending otherwise may feel righteous, but it doesn&#x2019;t change the equilibrium.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Just one second. Isn&#x2019;t this all window dressing, compared to the issue of whatever true ruler imposes these rules on the &#x201C;voters&#x201D;? Like, if you put me into an elaborate cage that gives me an electric shock each time I vote for Carol, obviously the person who really controls the system is whoever put the cage in place and determines which politicians you can vote for without electric shocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;I like the way you think.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;It&#x2019;s not <em>quite</em> true to say that the system is self-reinforcing and that the voters are the sole instrument of their own destruction. But the lack of any obvious, individual tyrant who personally decides who you&#x2019;re allowed to vote for has indeed caused many voters to believe that they are in control. I mean, they don&#x2019;t <em>feel</em> like they&#x2019;re in control, but they think that &#x201C;the voters&#x201D; select politicians.</p>\n<p>They aren&#x2019;t able to personalize a complicated bad equilibrium as a tyrant&#x2014;not like they would blame a jeweled king who was standing in the polling booth, ready to give them an electric shock if they wrote down Carol&#x2019;s name.</p>\n<p>Inspired by Allan Ginsberg&#x2019;s poem <em>Moloch</em>, Scott Alexander once wrote of coordination failures:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moloch is introduced as the answer to a question&#x2014;C. S. Lewis&#x2019; question in Hierarchy Of Philosophers&#x2014;<em>what does it</em>? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and wise. Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of cement and aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their imagination?</p>\n<p>And Ginsberg answers: <em>Moloch does it.</em></p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s a passage in the <em>Principia Discordia</em> where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. &#x201C;Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Goddess answers: &#x201C;What is the matter with that, if it&#x2019;s what you want to do?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Malaclypse: &#x201C;But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Goddess: &#x201C;Oh. Well, then stop.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The implicit question is&#x2014;if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: &#x201C;Moloch.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s powerful not because it&#x2019;s correct&#x2014;nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything&#x2014;but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system <em>isn&#x2019;t</em> an agent.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-13-definition\">13</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scott Alexander saw the face of the Enemy, and he gave it a name&#x2014;thinking that perhaps that would help.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;So if you did do this to yourselves, all by yourselves with no external empire to prevent you from doing anything differently by force of arms, then <em>why can&#x2019;t you just vote to change the voting rules</em>? No, never mind &#x201C;voting&#x201D;&#x2014;why can&#x2019;t you all just <em>get together and</em> <em>change everything, period</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;It&#x2019;s true that concepts like these are nontrivial to understand.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s not obvious to me that people <em>couldn&#x2019;t possibly</em> understand them, if somebody worked for a while on creating diagrams and videos.</p>\n<p>But the bigger problem is that people wouldn&#x2019;t know they could trust the diagrams and videos. I suspect some of the dynamics in entrepreneur-land are there because many venture capitalists run into entrepreneurs that are smarter than them, but who still have bad startups. A venture capitalist who believes clever-sounding arguments will soon be talked into wasting a lot of money. So venture capitalists learn to distrust clever-sounding arguments because they can&#x2019;t distinguish lies from truth, when they&#x2019;re up against entrepreneurs who are smarter than them.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the average politician is smarter than the average voter, so by now most voters are just accustomed to a haze of plausible-sounding arguments. It&#x2019;s not that you can&#x2019;t possibly explain a Nash equilibrium. It&#x2019;s that there are too many people advocating changes in the system for their own reasons, who could also draw diagrams that sounded equally convincing to someone who didn&#x2019;t already understand Nash equilibria. Any talk of systemic change on this level would just be lost in a haze of equally plausible-sounding-to-the-average-voter blogs, talking about how quantitative easing will cause hyperinflation.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Maybe it&#x2019;s naive of me&#x2026; but I can&#x2019;t help but think&#x2026; that <em>surely</em> there must be <em>some</em> breaking point in this system you describe, of voting for the less bad of two awful people, where the candidates just get worse and worse over time. At some point, shouldn&#x2019;t this be trumped by the &#x201C;voters&#x201D; just getting completely fed up? A spontaneous equilibrium-breaking, where they just didn&#x2019;t vote for either of the standard lizards no matter what?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Perhaps so! But my own cynicism can&#x2019;t help but suspect that this &#x201C;trumping&#x201D; phenomenon of which you speak would be even worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;I have a technical objection to your ascribing all these sins to first-past-the-post voting rather than, say, the personal vices of the voters. There are numerous parliamentary democracies outside the United States that practice proportional representation, where a party getting 30% of the votes gets 30% of the seats in parliament. And <em>they</em> don&#x2019;t seem to have solved these problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Omegaven does happen to be approved in Europe, however. Like, they are not in fact killing those particular babies&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Oh, <em>come on!</em> Yes, the European equivalent of the US&#x2019;s FDA happens to be a bit less stupid. Lots of other things in European countries happen to be more stupid. Indeed, I&#x2019;d say that in Europe you have much <em>crazier</em> people getting seats in parliaments, compared to the United States. The problem isn&#x2019;t the voting system. The problem is the <em>voters</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;There are indeed some voters who want stupid things, and under the European system, their voice can be heard. There are also voters who want smart things and whose voices can be heard, like in the Pirate Party in Finland. But European parliamentary systems have <em>different</em> problems stemming from <em>different</em> systemic flaws.</p>\n<p>Proportional representation would be a good system for a legislature that needed to repeatedly vote on laws, where different legislators could form different coalitions for each vote. If instead you demand that a majority coalition &#x201C;form a government&#x201D; to appoint an executive, then you need to give concessions to some factions, while other factions get frozen out. I&#x2019;m not necessarily saying that it would be <em>easy</em> to fix all the problems simultaneously. Still, I imagine that a proportionally represented legislature, <em>combined</em> with an executive elected at-large by Condorcet voting, might possibly be less stupid&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Or maybe it would just give stupid voters a louder voice. I don&#x2019;t like the evil conspiracy of the press and political elites that governs my country from the shadows, but I <em>am</em> willing to consider the proposition that the alternative is Donald Trump. I mean, I intend to go on fighting the Conspiracy about many specific issues. But if you&#x2019;re proposing a reform that puts more power into the hands of sheep not yet awakened, the results could be even worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Well, I agree that the design of well-functioning political systems is hard. Singapore might be the best-governed country in the world, and their history is approximately, &#x201C;Lee Kuan Yew gained very strong individual power over a small country, and unlike the hundreds of times in the history of Earth when that went horribly wrong, Lee Kuan Yew happened to know some economics.&#x201D; But the Visitor asked me why we were killing babies, and I tried to answer in terms of the system that obtained in the part of the world that was actually killing those babies. <em>You</em> asked why Europe wasn&#x2019;t a paradise since it used proportional representation, and my answer is that parliamentary systems have their own design flaws that induce a different kind of dysfunction.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Then if both systems are bad, how does your hypothesis have any observable consequences?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Because different systems are bad in different ways. When you have a &#x201C;crazy&#x201D; new idea, whether it&#x2019;s good or bad, the European parliaments will be allowed to talk about it first. Whether that&#x2019;s Omegaven, basic income, gay marriage, legalized prostitution, ending the war on drugs, land value taxes, or fascist nationalism, you are more likely to find it talked about in systems of proportional representation. It also happens to be true that those governments bloat up faster because of the repeated bribes required to hold the &#x201C;governing coalition&#x201D; together, but that&#x2019;s a <em>different</em> problem.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>ix. The Overton window</h2>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;I&#x2019;m beginning to experience the same sort of confusion as the Visitor about your view of the world, Conventional Cynical Economist. If voters weren&#x2019;t stupid, the world would look very different than it does.</p>\n<p>If the ultimate source of stupidity were poorly designed governmental structures, then average voters would sound smarter than average politicians. I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s <em>actually</em> true.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;There are deeper forms of psychological molasses that generalize beyond first-past-the-post political candidates. The still greater force locking bad political systems into place is an equilibrium of silence about policies that aren&#x2019;t &#x201C;serious.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>A journalist thinks that a candidate who talks about ending the War on Drugs isn&#x2019;t a &#x201C;serious candidate.&#x201D; And the newspaper won&#x2019;t cover that candidate because the newspaper itself wants to look serious&#x2026; or they think voters won&#x2019;t be interested because everyone knows that candidate can&#x2019;t win, or something? Maybe in a US-style system, only contrarians and other people who lack the social skill of getting along with the System are voting for Carol, so Carol is uncool the same way Velcro is uncool and so are all her policies and ideas? I&#x2019;m not sure exactly what the journalists are thinking subjectively, since I&#x2019;m not a journalist. But if an existing politician talks about a policy outside of what journalists think is appealing to voters, the journalists think the politician has committed a gaffe, and they write about this sports blunder by the politician, and the actual voters take their cues from that. So no politician talks about things that a journalist believes it would be a blunder for a politician to talk about. The space of what it isn&#x2019;t a &#x201C;blunder&#x201D; for a politician to talk about is conventionally termed the &#x201C;Overton window.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;It&#x2019;s all well and good to talk about complicated clever things, Cynical Economist, but what explanatory power does all this added complexity have? Why postulate politicians who believe that journalists believe that voters won&#x2019;t take something seriously? Why not just say that people are sheep?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;To name a recent example from the United States, it explains how, one year, gay marriage is this taboo topic, and then all of a sudden there&#x2019;s a huge upswing in everyone being <em>allowed</em> to talk about it for the first time and shortly afterwards it&#x2019;s a done deal. If you suppose that a huge number of people really did hate gay marriage deep down, or that all the politicians mouthing off about the sanctity of marriage were engaged in a dark conspiracy, then why the sudden change?</p>\n<p>With my more complicated model, we can say, &#x201C;An increasing number of people over time thought that gay marriage was pretty much okay. But while that group didn&#x2019;t have a majority, journalists modeled a gay marriage endorsement as a &#x2018;gaffe&#x2019; or &#x2018;unelectable&#x2019;, something they&#x2019;d write about in the sports-coverage overtone of a blunder by the other team&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Ah, so you say it was a conspiracy by evil journalists?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;No! Those journalists weren&#x2019;t <em>consciously deciding</em> the equilibrium. The journalists were writing &#x201C;serious&#x201D; articles, i.e., articles about Alice and Bob rather than Carol. The equilibrium <em>consisted of</em> the journalists writing sports coverage of elections, where everything is viewed through the lens of a zero-sum competition for votes between Alice&#x2019;s team and Bob&#x2019;s team. Viewed through that lens, the journalists thought a gay marriage endorsement would be a blunder. And if you do something that enough journalists think is a political blunder, it <em>is</em> a political blunder. The journalists&#x2019; sports coverage will describe you as an incompetent politician, and primates instinctively want to ally with likely winners. Which meant the equilibrium could have a sharp tipover point, <em>without</em> most of the actual population changing their minds sharply about gay marriage in that particular year. The support level went over a threshold where somebody tested the waters and got away with it, and journalists began to suspect it wasn&#x2019;t a political blunder to support gay marriage, which let more politicians speak and get away with it, and then the <em>change of belief about what was inside the Overton window</em> snowballed. I think that&#x2019;s what we saw.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Forgive me for resorting to Occam&#x2019;s Razor, but is it not simpler just to say that people&#x2019;s beliefs changed slowly until it reached some level where the military-industrial complex realized they couldn&#x2019;t win the battle to suppress gay marriage outright, and so stopped fighting?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;In a sense, that&#x2019;s not far off from what happened, except without the evil conspiracy part. We might or might not be approaching a similar tipover point about ending the War on Drugs&#x2014;a long, slow, secular shift in opinion, followed by a sudden tipover point where journalists model politicians as being allowed to talk about it, which means that politicians <em>can</em> talk about it, and then a few years later everyone is acting like they always thought that way. At least, I <em>hope</em> that&#x2019;s where the current trend is leading.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Several states have already passed laws legalizing marijuana. Why hasn&#x2019;t that already broken the Overton window?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Because voter initiatives don&#x2019;t break the common belief about what it would be a &#x201C;gaffe&#x201D; for a <em>serious, national-level</em> politician to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong>&#xA0;(<em>aside</em>) What broke the silence about artificial general intelligence (AGI) in 2014 wasn&#x2019;t Stephen Hawking writing a careful, well-considered <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-hawking/artificial-intelligence_b_5174265.html\">essay</a> about how this was a real issue. The silence only broke when Elon Musk <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/3/5965099/elon-musk-compares-artificial-intelligence-to-nukes\">tweeted</a> about Nick Bostrom&#x2019;s <em>Superintelligence</em>, and then made an off-the-cuff remark about how AGI was &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/tesla-boss-elon-musk-warns-artificial-intelligence-development-is-summoning-the-demon-9819760.html\">summoning the demon</a>.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Why did that heave a rock through the Overton window, when Stephen Hawking couldn&#x2019;t? Because Stephen Hawking <em>sounded like</em> he was trying hard to appear sober and serious, which signals that this is a subject you have to be careful not to gaffe about. And then Elon Musk was like, &#x201C;<em>Whoa, look at that apocalypse over there!!</em>&#x201D; After which there was the equivalent of journalists trying to pile on, shouting, &#x201C;A gaffe! A gaffe! A&#x2026; gaffe?&#x201D; and finding out that, in light of recent news stories about AI and in light of Elon Musk&#x2019;s good reputation, people weren&#x2019;t backing them up on that gaffe thing.</p>\n<p>Similarly, to heave a rock through the Overton window on the War on Drugs, what you need is not state propositions (although those do help) or articles in <em>The Economist</em>. What you need is for some &#x201C;serious&#x201D; politician to say, &#x201C;This is dumb,&#x201D; and for the journalists to pile on shouting, &#x201C;A gaffe! A gaffe&#x2026; a gaffe?&#x201D; But it&#x2019;s a grave personal risk for a politician to test whether the public atmosphere has changed enough, and even if it worked, they&#x2019;d capture very little of the human benefit for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;So&#x2026; if this is the key meta-level problem&#x2026; then why can&#x2019;t your civilization just <em>consider and solve this entire problem on the meta level</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Oh, I&#x2019;m afraid that this entire meta-problem isn&#x2019;t the sort of thing the &#x201C;leading candidates&#x201D; Alice and Bob talk about, so the problem itself isn&#x2019;t viewed as serious. That is, journalists won&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s serious. Meta-problems in general&#x2014;even problems as simple as first-past-the-post versus instant runoff for particular electoral districts&#x2014;are issues outside the Overton window. So the leading candidates Alice and Bob won&#x2019;t talk about organizational design reform, because it would be very damaging to their careers if they visibly focused their attention on issues that journalists don&#x2019;t think of as &#x201C;serious.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Then perhaps the deeper question is, &#x201C;Why does anyone listen to these &#x2018;journalists&#x2019;?&#x201D; You keep attributing power to them, but you haven&#x2019;t yet explained why they have that power under your equilibrium.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;People believe that other people believe what&#x2019;s in the newspapers.</p>\n<p>Well, no, that&#x2019;s too optimistic. A lot of people <em>do</em> believe what&#x2019;s in the newspapers, so long as it isn&#x2019;t about a topic regarding which they have any personal knowledge or expertise. The Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect is the term for how we read the paper about subjects we know about, and it&#x2019;s talking about how wet streets cause rain; and then we turn to the story about international affairs or dieting, and for some reason assume it&#x2019;s more accurate.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s some level on which most people prefer to talk and believe within the same mental world as other people. Nowadays a lot of people believe what they read on, say, Tumblr, and hardly look at <em>The New York Times</em> at all. But even then they still believe that <em>other people</em> believe what&#x2019;s in <em>The New York Times</em>. That&#x2019;s what gives <em>The New York Times</em> its special power over the collective consciousness, far out of proportion to their dwindling readership or the vanishing real trust that individuals from various walks of life have in them&#x2014;what&#x2019;s printed in <em>The New York Times</em> determines what people believe other people believe.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Do you <em>truly</em> lay all the sins of humanity at the feet of all this weird recursion? Or is this just a sufficiently weird hypothesis that you find it more fun to think about than the alternatives?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;m pointing in exactly the right direction, but I feel that I&#x2019;m pointing in the general direction of something that&#x2019;s truly important to the Visitor&#x2019;s most basic question. The Visitor keeps asking why, in some sense, on some sufficiently general level, we can&#x2019;t <em>just snap out of it</em>. And to put it in the sort of terms you yourself might want to use, Simplicio, if we&#x2019;re looking for an explanation of why we can&#x2019;t <em>just snap out of it</em>, then it might make sense to point to a bad Nash equilibrium covering our collective consciousness and discussion. I suspect that the recursion, the dependency on what people believe other people believe, has a lot to do with making that a <em>sticky</em> equilibrium a la venture capital.</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong>&#xA0;(<em>aside</em>) Returning to my day job: As of 2017, I pretty commonly hear from AI researchers who are worried about AGI safety, but who say that they don&#x2019;t dare say anything like that aloud. You could see this as either a good sign or a very bad sign, depending on how pessimistic or optimistic you previously were about the adequacy of academic discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;But then what, on your view, is the better way?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Again, I could pontificate about various ideas, but that&#x2019;s a <em>different and harder question</em> than looking at the actual equilibrium that currently obtains and forces doctors to poison babies. There doesn&#x2019;t have to be a better way.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>x. Lower-hanging altruistic fruit and bigger problems</h2>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>(The Visitor takes a deep breath. When the Visitor speaks again, it is louder.)</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Then what about your &lt;<em>untranslatable 17</em>&gt;?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Sorry? That word didn&#x2019;t come through.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;What about everyone on your <em>entire planet</em> who could possibly care about babies dying?</p>\n<p>So your medical specialists are borked. From the magic-tower analogy, I assume your systems of learning are borked, and that means most of the parents whose responsibility it is to protect the child are borked. Your politicians are borked. Your voters are borked. Your planet has no Serious People who could be trusted to try alternative shoe designs, let alone lead the way on any more complex coordination problem. Your prediction markets, I suppose, are somehow borked in a way that prevents anyone from making a profit by correcting inaccurate policy forecasts&#x2026; maybe they forecast wrongly bad consequences to unpopular policies, which therefore never get implemented in a way that shows up the inaccurate prediction, since you don&#x2019;t have any way to test things on a smaller scale? Your economists must somehow be borked&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;It&#x2019;s more that nobody ever listens to us. They <em>pay us</em> and then they don&#x2019;t <em>listen to us</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#x2014;and your financial system is borked so that nobody can make a profit on saving those babies or doing anything else useful. I&#x2019;m not stupid. I&#x2019;ve picked up on the pattern at this point.</p>\n<p>But what about <em>everyone else?</em> There are seven <em>billion</em> people on your planet. How is it that <em>none</em> of them step up to save these babies from death and brain damage? How is your <em>entire planet</em> failing to solve this problem?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;That&#x2026; sounds like a weird question, to an Earth person.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Whatever your problems are, surely out of seven billion human beings there have to be <em>some</em> who could <em>see</em> the problems as you&#x2019;ve laid them out, who could try to rally others to the cause of saving those babies, who could do <em>whatever it took</em> to save them!</p>\n<p>Even if your system declares that saving babies is only the responsibility of &#x201C;doctors&#x201D; or &#x201C;politicians&#x201D; or whoever is the Someone Else whose Problem it is, there&#x2019;s no law of physics that <em>stops</em> someone else from walking up to the problem and accepting responsibility for it. Out of seven billion people in your world, I can&#x2019;t believe that <em>literally all</em> of them are incapable of gathering together some friends and starting things down the path to getting a little fish oil into a baby&#x2019;s nutritional mixture!</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong>&#xA0;I think I&#x2019;ll step in myself at this point. There&#x2019;s one other very general conclusion we can draw from seeing this ever-growing heap of dead babies. We might say, &#x201C;the inadequacy of the part implies the inadequacy of the whole&#x201D;&#x2014;as we&#x2019;ve defined our terms, if a part of the system is inadequate in <em>X</em> lives saved for <em>Y</em> dollars, then the whole system is inadequate in <em>X</em> lives saved for <em>Y</em> dollars. Someone who is motivated and maximizing will first go after the biggest inadequacy <em>anywhere</em> that they think they can solve, and if they succeed, it pushes forward the adequacy frontier for the whole system. Thus, we can draw one other general conclusion from the observation that babies are still being fed soybean oil. We can conclude that everyone on the planet who is smart enough to understand this problem, and who cares about strangers&#x2019; lives, and who maximizes over their opportunities, must have <em>something more important to do</em> than getting started on solving it.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;(<em>aghast</em>) More important than saving hundreds of babies per year from dying or suffering permanent brain damage?</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong>&#xA0;The observation stands: there must be, in fact, literally nobody on Earth who can read Wikipedia entries and understand that omega-6 and omega-3 fats are different micronutrients, who also cares and maximizes and can head up new projects, who thinks that saving a few&#xA0;hundred babies per year from death and permanent brain damage is the most important thing they could do with their lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;So you&#x2019;re implying&#x2026;</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong>&#xA0;Well, mostly I&#x2019;m implying that <em>maximizing</em> altruism is incredibly rare, especially when you also require sufficiently precise reasoning that you aren&#x2019;t limited to cases where the large-scale, convincing study has already been done; and then we&#x2019;re demanding the executive ability to start a new project on top of that. But yes, I&#x2019;m also saying that here on Earth we have much more horrible problems to worry about.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;We&#x2019;ve just been walking through a handful of lay economic concepts here, the kind whose structure I can explain in a few thousand words. If you truly perceived the world through the eyes of a conventional cynical economist, then the horrors, the abominations, the low-hanging fruits you saw unpicked would annihilate your very soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#x2026;</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong>&#xA0;And then some of us have much, <em>much</em> more horrible problems to worry about. Problems that take <em>more</em> than reading Wikipedia entries to understand, so that the pool of potential solvers is even smaller. But even just considering this particular heap of dead babies, we know from observation that this part must be true: If you imagine everyone on Earth who fits the qualifications for the dead-baby problem&#x2014;enough scientific literacy to understand relevant facts about metabolic pathways, <em>and</em> the caring, <em>and</em> the maximization, <em>and</em> enough scrappiness to be the first one who gets started on it, meeting in a conference room to divide up Earth&#x2019;s most important problems, with the first subgroup taking on the most neglected problems demanding the most specialized background knowledge, and the second taking on the second-most-incomprehensible set of problems, until the crowdedness of the previously most urgent problem decreases the marginal impact of further contributions to the point where the next-worst problem at that level of background knowledge and insight becomes attractive&#x2026; and so on down the ladders of urgency inside the levels of discernment&#x2026; then there must be such a long and terrible list of tasks left undone, and so few people to understand and care, that saving a few&#xA0;hundred babies per year from dying or suffering permanent brain damage didn&#x2019;t make the list. So it has been observed, and so it must be.</p>\n<p><strong>Wandering Bystander:</strong> (<em>interjecting</em>) But I just can&#x2019;t believe our planet would be that dysfunctional. Therefore, by backward chaining, I question the original observation on which you founded your inference. In particular, I&#x2019;m starting to wonder whether omega-3 and omega-6 could <em>really</em> be such significantly different micronutrients. Maybe that&#x2019;s just a crackpot diet theory that somehow made it into Wikipedia, and actually all fats <em>are</em> pretty much the same, so there&#x2019;s nothing especially terrifying about the prospect of feeding babies exclusively fat from soybean oil instead of something more closely resembling the lipid profile of breast milk?</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong>&#xA0;Ah, yes. I&#x2019;m glad you spoke up.

I shall, somewhat arbitrarily, sort these concepts into three larger categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#xA0;Decisionmakers who are not beneficiaries;</li>\n<li>&#xA0;Asymmetric information;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>and above all,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#xA0;Nash equilibria that aren&#x2019;t even the best Nash equilibrium, let alone Pareto-optimal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words:&#xA0;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#xA0;Cases where the decision lies in the hands of people who would gain little personally, or lose out personally, if they did what was necessary to help someone else;</li>\n<li>&#xA0;Cases where decision-makers can&#x2019;t reliably learn the information they need to make decisions, even though someone else has that information; and</li>\n<li>&#xA0;Systems that are broken in multiple places so that no one actor can make them better, even though, in principle, some magically <em>coordinated</em> action could move to a new stable state.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will then play fast and loose with these concepts in order to fit the entire Taxonomy of Failure inside them.</p>\n<p>For example, &#x201C;irrationality in the form of cognitive biases&#x201D; wouldn&#x2019;t <em>obviously</em> fit into any of these categories, but I&#x2019;m going to shove it inside &#x201C;asymmetric information&#x201D; via a clever sleight-of-hand. Ready? Here goes:</p>\n<p>If <em>nobody</em> can detect a cognitive bias in particular cases, then from our perspective we can&#x2019;t really call it a &#x201C;civilizational inadequacy&#x201D; or &#x201C;failure to pluck a low-hanging fruit.&#x201D; We shouldn&#x2019;t even be able to see it ourselves. So, on the contrary, let&#x2019;s suppose that you and some other people can indeed detect a cognitive bias that&#x2019;s screwing up civilizational decisionmaking.</p>\n<p>Then why don&#x2019;t you just walk up to the decision-maker and <em>tell</em> them about the bias? Because they wouldn&#x2019;t have any way of knowing to trust <em>you</em> rather than the other five hundred people trying to influence their decisions? Well, in that case, you&#x2019;re holding information that they can&#x2019;t learn from you! So that&#x2019;s an &#x201C;asymmetric information problem,&#x201D; in much the same way that it&#x2019;s an asymmetric information problem when you&#x2019;re trying to sell a used car and <em>you</em> know it doesn&#x2019;t have any mechanical problems, but you have no way of reliably conveying this knowledge to the buyer because for all they know you could be lying.</p>\n<p>That argument is a bit silly, but so is the notion of trying to fit the whole Scroll of Woe into three supercategories. And if I named more than three supercategories, you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to remember them due to computational limitations (which aren&#x2019;t on the list anywhere, and I&#x2019;m not going to add them).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>i. For want of docosahexaenoic acids, a baby was lost</h2>\n<p>My discussion of modest epistemology in <a href=\"/ea/1g4/inadequacy_and_modesty/\">Chapter 1</a> might have given the impression that I think of modesty mostly as a certain set of high-level beliefs: beliefs about how best to combat cognitive bias, about how individual competencies stack up against group-level competencies, and so on. But I predict that many of this book&#x2019;s readers have high-level beliefs similar to those I outlined in <a href=\"/ea/1gd/an_equilibrium_of_no_free_energy/\">Chapter 2</a>, while employing a reasoning style that is really a special case of modest epistemology; and I think that this reasoning style is causing them substantial harm.</p>\n<p>As reasoning styles, modest epistemology and inadequacy analysis depend on a mix of explicit principles and implicit mental habits. In inadequacy analysis, it&#x2019;s one thing to recognize in the abstract that we live in a world rife with systemic inefficiencies, and quite another to naturally&#xA0;<em>perceive</em>&#xA0;systems that way in daily life. So my goal here won&apos;t be to unkindly stick the label &#x201C;inadequate&#x201D; to a black box containing the world; it will be to say something about how the relevant systems actually operate.</p>\n<p>For our central example, we&#x2019;ll be using the United States medical system, which is, so far as I know, the most broken system <em>that still works</em> ever recorded in human history. If you were reading about something in 19th-century France which was as broken as US healthcare, you wouldn&#x2019;t expect to find that it went on working when overloaded with a sufficiently vast amount of money. You would expect it to just not work at all.</p>\n<p>In previous years, I would use the case of central-line infections as my go-to example of medical inadequacy. Central-line infections, in the US alone, killed 60,000 patients per year, and infected an additional 200,000 patients at an average treatment cost of $50,000/patient.</p>\n<p>Central-line infections were also known to decrease by 50% or more if you enforced a five-item checklist that included items like &#x201C;wash your hands before touching the line.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Robin Hanson has old <em>Overcoming Bias</em> blog posts on that untaken, low-hanging fruit. But I discovered while re-Googling in 2015 that wider adoption of hand-washing and similar precautions are now finally beginning to occur, after many years&#x2014;with an associated 43% <em>nationwide</em> decrease in central-line infections. After <em>partial</em> adoption.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1-definition\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>So my new example is infants suffering liver damage, brain damage, and death in a way that&#x2019;s even easier to solve, by changing the lipid distribution of parenteral nutrition to match the proportions in breast milk.</p>\n<p>Background: Some babies have digestion problems that require direct intravenous feeding. Long ago, somebody created a hospital formula for this intravenous feeding that matched the distribution of &#x201C;fat,&#x201D; &#x201C;protein,&#x201D; and &#x201C;carbohydrate&#x201D; in breast milk.</p>\n<p>Just like &#x201C;protein&#x201D; comes in different amino acids, some of which the body can&#x2019;t make on its own and some of which it can, what early doctors used to think of as &#x201C;fat&#x201D; actually breaks down into metabolically distinct elements like short-chain triglycerides, medium-chain triglycerides, saturated fat, and omega-6, omega-9, and the famous &#x201C;omega-3.&#x201D; &#x201C;Omega-3&#x201D; is actually several different lipids in its own right; vegetable oils with &#x201C;omega-3&#x201D; usually just contain alpha-linolenic acids, which can only be inefficiently converted to ecosapentaenoic acids, which are then even more inefficiently converted to docosahexaenoic acids, which are the actual key structural components in the body. This conversion pathway is rate-limited by a process that also converts omega-6, so too much omega-6 can prevent you from processing ALA into DHA even if you&#x2019;re getting ALA.</p>\n<p>So what happens if your infant nutrition was initially designed based on the concept of &#x201C;fat&#x201D; as a natural category, and all the &#x201C;fat&#x201D; in the mix comes from soybean oil?</p>\n<p>From a popular book by Jaminet and Jaminet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some babies are born with &#x201C;short bowel syndrome&#x201D; and need to be given parenteral nutrition, or nutrition delivered intravenously directly to the blood, until their digestive tracts grow and heal. Since 1961, parenteral nutrition has used soybean oil as its source of fat.[<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16804134?dopt=AbstractPlus\">6</a>] And for decades, babies on parenteral nutrition have suffered devastating liver and brain damage. The death rate on soybean oil is 30 percent by age four. [&#x2026;]</p>\n<p>In a clinical trial, of forty-two babies given fish oil [after they had already developed liver damage on soybean oil], three died and one required a liver transplant; of forty-nine given soybean oil, twelve died and six required a liver transplant.[<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661785?dopt=AbstractPlus\">8</a>] The death-or-liver-transplant rate was reduced from 37 percent with soybean oil to 9 percent with fish oil.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2-definition\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When Jaminet and Jaminet wrote the above, in 2012, there was a single hospital in the United States that could provide correctly formulated parenteral nutrition, namely the Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital; nowhere else. This formulation was illegal to sell across state lines.</p>\n<p>A few years <em>after</em> the Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital developed their formula&#x2014;keeping in mind the heap of dead babies continuing to pile up in the meanwhile&#x2014;there developed a shortage of &#x201C;certified lipids&#x201D; (FDA-approved &#x201C;fat&#x201D; for adding to parenteral nutrition). For a year or two, the parenteral nutrition contained <em>no fat at all</em> which is <em>worse</em> and can kill <em>adults</em>.</p>\n<p>You see, although there&#x2019;s nothing special about the soybean oil in parenteral nutrition, there was only one US manufacturer approved to add it, and that manufacturer left the market, so&#x2026;</p>\n<p>As of 2015, the state of affairs was as follows: The FDA eventually solved the problem with the shortage of US-certified lipids, by&#x2026; allowing US hospitals to import parenteral nutrition bags from Europe. And it only took them two years&#x2019; worth of dead patients to figure that out!</p>\n<p>As of 2016, if your baby has short bowel syndrome, and has <em>already</em> ended up with liver damage, and either you or your doctor is lucky enough to know what&#x2019;s wrong and how to fix it, your doctor can apply for a special permit to use a non-FDA-approved substance for your child on an emergency basis. After this, you can buy Omegaven and hope that it cures your baby and that there isn&#x2019;t too much permanent damage and that it&#x2019;s not already too late.</p>\n<p>This is an improvement over the prior situation, where the non-poisonous formulation was illegal to sell across state lines under any circumstances, but it&#x2019;s still not <em>good</em> by any stretch of the imagination.</p>\n<p>Now imagine trying to explain to a visitor from a relatively well-functioning world just why it is that your civilization has killed a bunch of babies and subjected other babies to pointless brain damage.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not that we&#x2019;re <em>evil,</em>&#x201D; you say helplessly, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s that&#x2026; well, you see, it&#x2019;s not that anyone <em>wanted</em> to kill those babies, it&#x2019;s just the way the System ended up, somehow&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>ii. Asymmetric information and lemons problems</h2>\n<p><em>Three people have gathered in a blank white space:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Visitor</strong>&#xA0;from a Better World;</li>\n<li><strong>Simplicio</strong>,&#xA0;who is attending a major university but hasn&#x2019;t taken undergraduate economics;</li>\n<li><strong>Cecie</strong>,&#xA0;the Conventional Cynical Economist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The Visitor speaks first.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;So&#xA0;I&#x2019;ve listened to you explain about babies suffering death and brain damage from parenteral nutrition built on soybean oil. I have several questions here, but I&#x2019;ll start with the most obvious one.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0; Go&#xA0;ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Why aren&#x2019;t there riots?</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;The first thing you have to understand, Visitor, is that the folk in this world are hypocrites, cowards, psychopaths, and sheep.</p>\n<p>I mean, <em>I</em>&#xA0;certainly care about the the lives of newborn children. Hearing about their plight certainly makes <em>me</em> want to do something about it. When I see the problem continuing in spite of that, I can only conclude that other people <em>don&#x2019;t</em> feel the level of moral indignation that I feel when staring at a heap of dead babies.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;I don&#x2019;t think that hypothesis is needed, Simplicio. As a start, Visitor, you have to realize that the picture I&#x2019;ve shown you is not widely known. Maybe 10% of the population, at most, is walking around with the prior belief that the FDA in general is killing people; our government runs on majority rule and the 10% can&#x2019;t unilaterally defy it.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3-definition\">3</a></sup> Maybe 0.1% of that 10% know that omega-3 ALA is converted into omega-3 DHA via a metabolic pathway that competes with omega-6. And then most of those aren&#x2019;t aware of what&#x2019;s happening to babies right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Pointing to that state of ignorance is hardly a sufficient explanation! If a theater is on fire and only one person knows it, they yell &#x201C;Fire!&#x201D; and then more people know it. People from my civilization would scream &#x201C;Babies are dying over here!&#x201D; and other people from my civilization would whip around their heads and look.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;Our world&#x2019;s cowards and sheep would hear that and think that it&#x2019;s (a) somebody else&#x2019;s problem and (b) all part of the plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;In our world, Visitor, we have an economic phenomenon sometimes called the lemons problem. Suppose you want to sell a used car, and I&#x2019;m looking for a car to buy. From my perspective, I have to worry that your car might be a &#x201C;lemon&#x201D;&#x2014;that it has a serious mechanical problem that doesn&#x2019;t appear every time you start the car, and is difficult or impossible to fix. Now, <em>you</em> know that your car isn&#x2019;t a lemon. But if I ask you, &#x201C;Hey, is this car a lemon?&#x201D; and you answer &#x201C;No,&#x201D; I can&#x2019;t trust your answer, because you&#x2019;re incentivized to answer &#x201C;No&#x201D; either way. Hearing you say &#x201C;No&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t much Bayesian evidence. <em>Asymmetric information</em> conditions can persist even in cases where, like an honest seller meeting an honest buyer, both parties have strong incentives for accurate information to be conveyed.</p>\n<p>A further problem is that if the fair value of a non-lemon car is $10,000, and the possibility that your car is a lemon causes me to only be willing to pay you $8,000, you might refuse to sell your car. So the honest sellers with reliable cars start to leave the market, which further shifts upward the probability that any given car for sale is a lemon, which makes me less willing to pay for a used car, which incentivizes more honest sellers to leave the market, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;What does the lemons problem have to do with your world&#x2019;s inability to pass around information about dead babies?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;In our world, there are a lot of people screaming, &#x201C;Pay attention to this thing I&#x2019;m indignant about over here!&#x201D; In fact, there are enough people screaming that there&#x2019;s an inexploitable market in indignation. The dead-babies problem can&#x2019;t compete in that market; there&#x2019;s no free energy left for it to eat, and it doesn&#x2019;t have an optimal indignation profile. There&#x2019;s no single individual villain. The business about competing omega-3 and omega-6 metabolic pathways is something that only a fraction of people would understand on a visceral level; and even if those people posted it to their Facebook walls, most of their readers wouldn&#x2019;t understand and repost, so the dead-babies problem has relatively little virality. Being indignant about this particular thing doesn&#x2019;t signal your moral superiority to anyone else in particular, so it&#x2019;s not viscerally enjoyable to engage in the indignation. As for adding a further scream, &#x201C;But wait, this matter <em>really is</em> important!&#x201D;, that&#x2019;s the part subject to the lemons problem. Even people who honestly know about a fixable case of dead babies can&#x2019;t emit a <em>trustworthy</em> request for attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;You&apos;re&#xA0;saying that people won&#x2019;t listen even if I sound <em>really</em> indignant about this? That&#x2019;s an outrage!</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;By this point in our civilization&#x2019;s development, many honest buyers and sellers have left the indignation market entirely; and what&#x2019;s left behind is not, on average, good.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;Your reply contains so many surprising postulates of weird civilizational dysfunction, I hardly know what to ask about next. So instead I&#x2019;ll try to explain how my world works, and you can explain to me why your world doesn&#x2019;t work that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;Sounds reasonable.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iii. Academic incentives and beneficiaries</h2>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;To start with, in my world, we have these people called &#x201C;scientists&#x201D; who verify claims experimentally, and other people trust the &#x201C;scientists.&#x201D; So if our &#x201C;scientists&#x201D; say that a certain formula seems to be killing babies, this would provoke general indignation without every single listener needing to study docohexa-whatever acids.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Alas, our so-called scientists are just pawns of the same medical-industrial complex that profits from killing babies.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m afraid, Visitor, that although there are strong prior reasons to expect too much omega-6 and no omega-3 to be very bad for an infant baby, and there are now a few dozen small-scale studies which seem to match that prediction, this matter hasn&#x2019;t had the massive study that would begin to produce confident scientific agreement&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;You&#x2019;d better not be pointing to <em>that</em> as an exogenous fact that explains your civilization&#x2019;s problem! See, on my planet, if somebody points to <em>strong prior suspicion</em> combined with <em>confirming pilot studies</em> saying that something is killing innocent babies and is fixable, and the pilot studies are not considered sufficient evidence to settle the issue, our people would <em>do more studies</em> and wouldn&#x2019;t just go on blindly feeding the babies poison in the meantime. Our scientists would all agree on <em>that</em>!</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;But people loudly agreeing on something, by itself, accomplishes nothing. It&#x2019;s all well and good for everyone to agree in principle that larger studies ought to be done; but in your world, who actually does the big study, and why do they do it?</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Two subclasses within the profession of &#x201C;scientist&#x201D; are <em>suggesters,</em> whose piloting studies provide the initial suspicions of effects, and <em>replicators</em> whose job it is to confirm the result and nail things down solidly&#x2014;the exact effect size and so on. When an important suggestive result arises, two replicators step forward to confirm it and nail down the exact conditions for producing it, being forbidden upon their honor to communicate with each other until they submit their findings. If both replicators agree on the particulars, that completes the discovery. The three funding bodies that sustained the suggester and the dual replicators would receive the three places of honor in the announcement. Do I need to explain how part of the function of any civilized society is to appropriately reward those who contribute to the public good?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Well, that&#x2019;s not how things work on Earth. Our world gives almost all the public credit and fame to the <em>discoverer</em>, as the initial suggester is called among us. Our scientists often <em>say</em> that replication is important, but our most prestigious journals won&#x2019;t publish mere replications; nor do the history books remember them. The outcome is a lot of small studies that have just enough subjects to obtain &#x201C;statistically significant&#x201D; results&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026; What? Probability is quantitative, not qualitative. There&#x2019;s no such thing as a &#x201C;significant&#x201D; or &#x201C;insignificant&#x201D; likelihood ratio&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;<em>Anyway</em>, while it might be good if larger studies were done, <em>the decisionmaker is not the beneficiary</em>&#x2014;the people who did the extra work of a larger study, and funded the extra work of a larger study, would not receive fame and fortune thereby.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I must be missing something basic here. You do have multiple studies, right? When you have multiple bodies of data, you can multiply the likelihood functions from the studies&#x2019; respective data to the hypotheses to obtain the meaning of the <em>combined</em> evidence&#x2014;the likelihood function from <em>all</em> the data to the hypotheses.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4-definition\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m afraid you can&#x2019;t do that on Earth.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026; Of course you can. It&#x2019;s a <em>mathematical theorem</em>. You can&#x2019;t possibly tell me <em>that</em> differs between our universes!</p>\n<p>Yes, there are pitfalls for the especially careless. Sometimes studies end up being conducted under different circumstances, with the result that the naively computed likelihood functions don&#x2019;t have uniform relations to the hypotheses under consideration. In that case, blindly multiplying will give you a likelihood function that&#x2019;s nearly zero everywhere. But, I mean, if you just look at all the likelihood functions, it&#x2019;s pretty obvious when some of them are pointing in different directions and then you can <em>investigate that divergence</em>.</p>\n<p>Either it makes sense to multiply all the likelihood functions and get out one massive evidential pointer, or else you <em>don&#x2019;t</em> get a sensible result when you multiply them and then you know something&#x2019;s wrong with your methods&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m afraid our scientific community doesn&#x2019;t run on your world&#x2019;s statistical methods. You see, during the first half of the twentieth century, it became conventional to measure something called &#x201C;<em>p</em>-values&#x201D; which imposed a qualitative distinction between &#x201C;successful&#x201D; and &#x201C;unsuccessful&#x201D; experiments&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;<em>That is still not an explanation.</em> Why not <em>change</em> the way you do things?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Because somebody who tried using unconventional statistical methods, even if they were better statistical methods, wouldn&#x2019;t be able to publish their papers in the most prestigious journals. And then they wouldn&#x2019;t get hired. It&#x2019;s similar to the way that the most prestigious journals don&#x2019;t publish mere replications, only discoveries, so people focus on making discoveries instead of replications.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Why would anyone <em>pay attention</em> to journals like that?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Because university hiring departments care a lot about whether you&#x2019;ve published in prestigious journals.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;No, I mean&#x2026; how did these journals end up prestigious in the first place? <em>Why</em> do university hiring departments pay attention to them?</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Why <em>would</em> university hiring departments care about real science? Shouldn&#x2019;t it be you who has to explain why some lifeless cog of the military-industrial complex would care about anything except grant money?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Okay&#x2026; you&#x2019;re digging pretty deep here. I think I need to back up and try to explain things on a more basic level.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Indeed, I think you should. So far, every time I&#x2019;ve asked you why someone is acting insane, you&#x2019;ve claimed that it&#x2019;s secretly a sane response to someone else acting insane. Where does this process bottom out?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iv. Two-factor markets and signaling equilibria</h2>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Let me try to identify a first step on which insanity can emerge from non-insanity. Universities pay attention to prestigious journals because of a <em>signaling equilibrium,</em> which, in our taxonomy, is a kind of bad Nash equilibrium that no single actor can defy unilaterally.</p>\n<p>In your terms, it involves a sticky, stable equilibrium of <em>everyone</em> acting insane in a way that&#x2019;s secretly a sane response to everyone else acting insane.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Go on.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;First, let me explain the idea of what Eliezer has nicknamed a &#x201C;two-factor market.&#x201D; Two-factor markets are a conceptually simpler case that will help us later understand signaling equilibria.</p>\n<p>In our world there&#x2019;s a crude site for classified ads, called Craigslist. Craigslist doesn&#x2019;t contain any way of rating users, the way that eBay lets buyers and sellers rate each other, or that Airbnb lets renters and landlords rate each other.</p>\n<p>Suppose you wanted to set up a version of Craigslist that let people rate each other. Would you be able to compete with Craigslist?</p>\n<p>The answer is that even if this innovation is in fact a good one, competing with Craigslist would be far more difficult than it sounds, because Craigslist is sustained by a two-factor market. The sellers go where there are the most buyers; the buyers go where they expect to find sellers. When you launch your new site, no buyers will want to go there because there are no sellers, and no sellers will want to go there because there are no buyers. Craigslist initially broke into this market by targeting San Francisco particularly, and spending marketing effort to assemble the San Francisco buyers and sellers into the same place. But that would be harder to do for a later startup, because now the people it&#x2019;s targeting are already using Craigslist.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Those sheep! Just mindlessly doing whatever their incentives tell them to!</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;We can imagine that there&#x2019;s a better technology than Craigslist, called Danslist, such that everyone using Craigslist would be better off if they all switched to Danslist simultaneously. But if just one buyer or just one seller is the first to go to Danslist, they find an empty parking lot. In conventional cynical economics, we&#x2019;d say that this is a <em>coordination problem</em>&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;A coordination problem? What do you mean by that?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Backing up a bit: A &#x201C;Nash equilibrium&#x201D; is what happens when everyone makes their best move, given that all the other players are making their best moves from that Nash equilibrium&#x2014;everyone goes to Craigslist, because that&#x2019;s their individually best move <em>given</em> that everyone else is going to Craigslist. A &#x201C;Pareto optimum&#x201D; is any situation where it&#x2019;s impossible to make every actor better off simultaneously, like &#x201C;Cooperate/Cooperate&#x201D; in the Prisoner&#x2019;s Dilemma&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no alternative outcome to Cooperate/Cooperate that makes <em>both</em> agents better off. The Prisoner&#x2019;s Dilemma is a coordination problem because the sole Nash equilibrium of Defect/Defect isn&#x2019;t Pareto-optimal; there&#x2019;s an outcome, Cooperate/Cooperate, that both players prefer, but aren&#x2019;t reaching.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;How stupid of them!</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;No, it&#x2019;s&#x2026; ah, never mind. Anyway, the <em>frustrating</em> parts of civilization are the times when you&#x2019;re stuck in a Nash equilibrium that&#x2019;s Pareto-inferior <em>to other Nash equilibria</em>. I mean, it&#x2019;s not surprising that humans have trouble getting to non-Nash optima like &#x201C;both sides cooperate in the Prisoner&#x2019;s Dilemma without any other means of enforcement or verification.&#x201D; What makes an equilibrium <em>inadequate,</em> a fruit that seems to hang tantalizingly low and yet somehow our civilization isn&#x2019;t plucking, is when there&#x2019;s a better <em>stable</em> state and we haven&#x2019;t reached it.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Indeed. Moving from bad equilibria to better equilibria is the whole point of having a civilization in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Being stuck in an inferior Nash equilibrium is how I&#x2019;d describe the frustrating aspect of the two-factor market of buyers and sellers that can&#x2019;t switch from Craigslist to Danslist. The scenario where everyone is using Danslist <em>would</em> be a stable Nash equilibrium, and a <em>better</em> Nash equilibrium. We just can&#x2019;t get there from here. There&#x2019;s no one actor who is behaving foolishly; all the individuals are responding strategically to their incentives. It&#x2019;s only the larger system that behaves &#x201C;foolishly.&#x201D; I&#x2019;m not aware of a standard term for this situation, so I&#x2019;ll call it an &#x201C;inferior equilibrium.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Why do you care what academics call it? Why not just use the <em>best</em> phrase?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;The terminology &#x201C;inferior equilibrium&#x201D; would be fine if everyone else were already using that terminology. Mostly I want to use the same phrase that everyone else uses, even if it&#x2019;s not the best phrase.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Regardless, I&#x2019;m not seeing what the grand obstacle is to people solving these problems by, you know, <em>coordinating</em>. If people would just act in unity, so much could be done!</p>\n<p>I feel like you&#x2019;re placing too much blame on system-level issues, Cecie, when the simpler hypothesis is just that the people <em>in</em> the system are terrible: bad at thinking, bad at caring, bad at coordinating. You claim to be a &#x201C;cynic,&#x201D; but your whole world-view sounds rose-tinted to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Even in my world, Simplicio, coordination isn&#x2019;t as simple as everyone jumping simultaneously every time one person shouts &#x201C;Jump!&#x201D; For coordinated action to be successful, you need to trust the institution that says what the action should be, and a <em>majority</em> of people have to trust that institution, and they have to <em>know</em> that other people trust the institution, so that everyone <em>expects</em> the coordinated action to occur at the critical time, so that it makes sense for them to act too.</p>\n<p>That&#x2019;s why we have policy prediction markets and&#x2026; there doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a word in your language for the <em>timed-collective-action-threshold-conditional-commitment&#x2026;</em> hold on, this cultural translator isn&#x2019;t making any sense. &#x201C;Kickstarter&#x201D;? You have the key concept, but you use it mainly for making video games?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;ll now introduce the concept of a <em>signaling equilibrium</em>.</p>\n<p>To paraphrase a commenter on <em>Slate Star Codex</em>: suppose that there&#x2019;s a magical tower that only people with IQs of at least 100 and some amount of conscientiousness can enter, and this magical tower slices four years off your lifespan. The natural next thing that happens is that employers start to prefer prospective employees who have proved they can enter the tower, and employers offer these employees higher salaries, or even make entering the tower a condition of being employed at all.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5-definition\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Hold on. There <em>must</em> be less expensive ways of testing intelligence and conscientiousness than sacrificing four years of your lifespan to a magical tower.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Let&#x2019;s not go into that right now. For now, just take as an exogenous fact that employers can&#x2019;t get all of the information they want by other channels.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;But&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Anyway: the natural next thing that happens is that employers start to demand that prospective employees show a certificate saying that they&#x2019;ve been inside the tower. This makes <em>everyone</em> want to go to the tower, which enables somebody to set up a fence around the tower and charge hundreds of thousands of dollars to let people in.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6-definition\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;But&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Now, fortunately, after Tower One is established and has been running for a while, somebody tries to set up a competing magical tower, Tower Two, that also drains four years of life but charges less money to enter.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026; You&#x2019;re <em>solving the wrong problem.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Unfortunately, there&#x2019;s a subtle way in which this competing Tower Two is hampered by the same kind of lock-in that prevents a jump from Craigslist to Danslist. Initially, all of the smartest people headed to Tower One. Since Tower One had limited room, it started discriminating further among its entrants, only taking the ones that have IQs above the minimum, or who are good at athletics or have rich parents or something. So when Tower Two comes along, the employers still <em>prefer</em> employees from Tower One, which has a more famous reputation. So the smartest people still prefer to apply to Tower One, even though it costs more money. This stabilizes Tower One&#x2019;s reputation as being the place where the smartest people go.</p>\n<p>In other words, the signaling equilibrium is a two-factor market in which the stable point, Tower One, is cemented in place by the individually best choices of two different parts of the system. Employers prefer Tower One because it&#x2019;s where the smartest people go. Smart employees prefer Tower One because employers will pay them more for going there. If you try dissenting from the system unilaterally, without everyone switching at the same time, then as an employer you end up hiring the less-qualified people from Tower Two, or as an employee, you end up with lower salary offers after you go to Tower Two. So the system is stable as a matter of individual incentives, and stays in place. If you try to set up a cheaper alternative to the whole Tower system, the <em>default</em> thing that happens to you is that people who couldn&#x2019;t handle the Towers try to go through your new system, and it acquires a reputation for non-prestigious weirdness and incompetence.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;This all just seems so weird and complicated. I&#x2019;m skeptical that this scenario with the magical towers could happen in real life.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I agree that trying to build a cheaper Tower Two is solving the wrong problem. The interior of Tower One boasts some truly exquisite architecture and decor. It just makes sense that <em>someone</em> should pay a lot to allow people entry to Tower One. What we really need is for the government to subsidize the entry fees on Tower One, so that more people can fit inside.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Consider a simpler example: Velcro is a system for fastening shoes that is, for at least some people and circumstances, better than shoelaces. It&#x2019;s easier to adjust three separate Velcro straps then it is to keep your shoelaces perfectly adjusted at all loops, it&#x2019;s faster to do and undo, et cetera, and not everyone is running at high speeds that call for perfectly adjusted running shoes. But when Velcro was introduced, the earliest people to adopt Velcro were those who had the most trouble tying their shoelaces&#x2014;very young children and the elderly. So Velcro became associated with kids and old people, and thus unforgivably <em>unfashionable</em>, regardless of whether it would have been better than shoelaces in some adult applications as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I take it you didn&#x2019;t have the stern and upright leaders, what we call the Serious People, who could set an example by donning Velcro shoes themselves?</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio &amp; Cecie:</strong><span>&#xA0;&#xA0;</span>(<em>in unison</em>)&#xA0; No.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I see.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Now consider the system of scientific journals that we were originally talking about. Some journals are prestigious. So university hiring committees pay the most attention to publications in that journal. So people with the best, most interesting-looking publications try to send them to that journal. So if a university hiring committee paid an equal amount of attention to publications in lower-prestige journals, they&#x2019;d end up granting tenure to less prestigious people. Thus, the whole system is a stable equilibrium that nobody can unilaterally defy except at cost to themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m still skeptical. Doesn&#x2019;t your parable of the magical tower suggest that, if that&#x2019;s actually true, somebody ought to rope off the journals too and charge insane amounts of money?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Yes, and that&#x2019;s exactly what happened. Elsevier and a few other profiteers grabbed the most prestigious journals and started jacking up the access costs. They contributed almost nothing&#x2014;even the peer review and editing was done by unpaid volunteers. Elsevier just charged more and more money and sat back. This is standardly called <em>rent-seeking</em>. In a few cases, the scientists were able to kickstart a coordinated move where the entire editing board would resign, start a new journal, and everybody in the field would submit to the new journal instead. But since our scientists don&#x2019;t have recognized kickstarting customs, or any software support for them, it isn&#x2019;t easy to pull that off. Most of the big-name journals that Elsevier has captured are still big names, still getting prestigious submissions, and still capturing big-money rents.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Well, I guess I understand why my cultural translator keeps putting air quotes around Earth&#x2019;s version of &#x201C;science.&#x201D; The whole idea of science, as I understand the concept, is that everything has to be in the open for anyone to verify. Science is the part of humanity&#x2019;s knowledge that everyone can potentially learn about and reproduce themselves. You can&#x2019;t <em>charge money</em> in order for people to read your experimental results, or you lose the &#x201C;everyone can access and verify your claims&#x201D; property that distinguishes science from other kinds of information.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Oh, rest assured that scientists aren&#x2019;t seeing any of this money. It all goes to the third-party journal owners.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;And this isn&#x2019;t just scientists being stupid?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;No stupider than you are for going to college. It&#x2019;s hard to beat <em>signaling equilibria</em>&#x2014;because they&#x2019;re &#x201C;multi-factor markets&#x201D;&#x2014;which are special cases of <em>coordination problems</em> that create &#x201C;inferior Nash equilibria&#x201D;&#x2014;which are so stuck in place that market controllers can <em>seek rent</em> on the value generated by captive participants.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Weren&#x2019;t we talking about dead babies at some point?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Yes, we were. I was explaining how our system allocated too much credit to discoverers and not enough credit to replicators, and the only socially acceptable statistics couldn&#x2019;t aggregate small-scale trials in a way regarded as reliable. The Visitor asked me why the system was like that. I pointed to journals that published a particular kind of paper. The Visitor asked me why anyone paid attention to those journals in the first place. I explained about signaling equilibria, and that&#x2019;s where we are now.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I can&#x2019;t say that I feel enlightened at the end of walking through all that. There must be <em>particular</em> scientists on the editorial boards who choose not to demand replications and who forbid multiplying likelihood ratios. Why are those particular scientists doing the non-sensible thing?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Because people in the general field wouldn&#x2019;t cite nonstandard papers, so if the editors demanded nonstandard papers, the journal&#x2019;s publication factor would decrease.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Why don&#x2019;t the journal editors start by demanding that paper submitters <em>cite</em> dual replications as well as initial suggestions?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Because that would be a weird unconventional demand, which might lead people with high-prestige results to submit those results to other journals instead. Fundamentally, you&#x2019;re asking why scientists on Earth don&#x2019;t adopt certain new customs that you think would be for the good of everyone. And the answer is that there&#x2019;s this big, multi-factor system that nobody can dissent from unilaterally, and that people have a <em>lot</em> of trouble coordinating to change. That&#x2019;s true even when there are forces like Elsevier that are being <em>blatant</em> about ripping everyone off. Implementing your proposed cultural shift to &#x201C;suggesters&#x201D; and &#x201C;replicators,&#x201D; or using likelihood functions, would be significantly <em>harder</em> than everyone just simultaneously ceasing to deal with Elsevier, since the case for it would be less obvious and would provoke more disagreement. All that we can manage is to make incremental shifts toward funding more replication and asking more for study preregistration.</p>\n<p>To sum up, academic science is embedded in a big enough system with enough separate decisionmakers creating incentives for other decisionmakers that it almost always takes the path of least resistance. The system isn&#x2019;t in the <em>best</em> Nash equilibrium because nobody has the power to look over the system and choose <em>good</em> Nash equilibria. It&#x2019;s just in <em>a</em> Nash equilibrium that it wandered into, which includes statistical methods that were invented in the first half of the 20th century and editors not demanding that people cite replications.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I see. And that&#x2019;s why nobody in your world has multiplied the likelihood functions, or done a large-enough single study, or otherwise done <em>whatever it would take</em> to convince whoever needs to be convinced about the effects of feeding infants soybean oil.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;It&#x2019;s one of the reasons. A large study would also be very <em>expensive</em> because of extreme paperwork requirements, generated by other systemic failures I haven&#x2019;t gotten around to talking about yet&#x2014;<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7-definition\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;How does anything get done <em>ever</em>, in your world?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2014;and when it comes to funding or carrying out that bigger study, <em>the decisionmaker would not significantly benefit</em> under the current system, which is held in place by <em>coordination problems</em>. And that&#x2019;s why people who already have a background grasp of lipid metabolic pathways have <em>asymmetric information</em> about what is worth becoming indignant about.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>v. Total market failures</h2>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Even granting the things you&#x2019;ve said already, I don&#x2019;t feel like I&#x2019;ve been told enough to understand why your society is killing babies.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Well, <em>no</em>. Not yet. The lack of incentive to do a large-scale convincing study is only <em>one</em> thing that went wrong inside <em>one</em> part of the system. There&#x2019;s a lot <em>more</em> broken than just that&#x2014;which is why effective altruists shouldn&#x2019;t be running out and trying to fund a big replication study for Omegaven, because that by itself wouldn&#x2019;t fix things.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Okay, suppose there <em>had</em> been a large enough study to satisfy your world&#x2019;s take on &#x201C;scientists.&#x201D; What <em>else</em> would likely go wrong after that?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Several things. For example, doctors wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily be aware of the experimental results.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Hold on, I think my cultural translator is broken. You used that word &#x201C;doctor&#x201D; and my translator spit out a long sequence of words for Examiner plus Diagnostician plus Treatment Planner plus Surgeon plus Outcome Evaluator plus Student Trainer plus Business Manager. Maybe it&#x2019;s stuck and spitting out the names of all the professions associated with medicine.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;So, in your world, if there is a dual replication of results on Omegaven versus soybean oil, how does that end up changing the actual patient treatments?</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;By informing the Treatment Planners who specialize in infant ailments that required parenteral nutrition, of course. The discovery would appear inside the &#x201C;parenteral nutrition&#x201D; pages in the Earthweb and show up in the feeds of everyone subscribed to that page. The statistics would appear inside the Treatment Planner&#x2019;s decision-support software. And if all of those broke for some reason, every Treatment Planner for infant ailments that required parenteral nutrition would just use chatrooms. And anyone who ignored the chatrooms would have worse patient outcome ratings, and would lose status relative to Treatment Planners who were more attentive.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;It sounds like &#x201C;Treatment Planners&#x201D; in your world are much more specialized than doctors in this world. I suppose they&#x2019;re also selected specifically for talent at&#x2026; cost-benefit analysis and decision theory, or something along those lines? And then they focus their learning on particular diseases for which they are Treatment Planners? And somebody else tracks their outcomes?</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Of course. I&#x2019;m&#x2026; almost afraid to ask, but how do they do it in your world?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Your translator wasn&#x2019;t broken. In our world, &#x201C;doctors&#x201D; are supposed to examine patients for symptoms, diagnose especially complicated or obscure ailments using their encyclopedic knowledge and their keen grasp of Bayesian inference, plan the patient&#x2019;s treatment by weighing the costs and benefits of the latest treatments, execute the treatments using their keen dexterity and reliable stamina, evaluate for themselves how well that went, train students to do it too, and in many cases, <em>also</em> oversee the small business that bills the patients and markets itself. So &#x201C;doctors&#x201D; have to be selected for all of those talents simultaneously, and then split their training, experience, and attention between them.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;<em>Why</em> in the name of&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Oh, and before they go to medical school, we usually send them off to get a four-year degree in philosophy first or something, just because.</p>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t know if there&#x2019;s a standard name for this phenomenon, but we can call it &#x201C;failure of professional specialization.&#x201D; It also appears when, for example, a lawyer has to learn calculus in order to graduate college, even though their job doesn&#x2019;t require any calculus.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Why. Why. Why why why&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m not sure. I suspect the origin has something to do with status&#x2014;like, a high-status person can do all things at once, so it&#x2019;s insulting and lowers status to suggest that an esteemed and respectable Doctor should only practice one surgical operation and get very good at it. And once you yourself have spent twelve years being trained under the current system, you won&#x2019;t be happy about the proposal to replace it with two years of much more specialized training. Once you&#x2019;ve been through a painful initiation ritual and rationalized its necessity, you&#x2019;ll hate to see anyone else going through a less painful one. Not to mention that you won&#x2019;t be happy about the competition against your own human capital, by a cheaper and better form of human capital&#x2014;and after the sunk cost in pain and time that you endured to build human capital under the old system&#x2026;</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Do they not have markets on your planet? Because on my planet, when you manufacture your product in a crazy, elaborate, expensive way that produces an inferior product, someone else will come along and rationalize the process and take away your customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;We have markets, but there&#x2019;s this unfortunate thing called &#x201C;regulatory capture,&#x201D; of which one kind is &#x201C;occupational licensing.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>As an example, it used to be that chairs were carefully hand-crafted one at the time by carpenters who had to undergo a lengthy apprenticeship, and indeed, they didn&#x2019;t like it when factories came along staffed by people who specialized in just carving a single kind of arm. But the factory-made chairs were vastly cheaper and most of the people who insisted on sticking to handcrafts soon went out of business.</p>\n<p>Now imagine: What if the chair-makers had been extremely respectable&#x2014;had already possessed very high status? What if their profession had an element of danger? What if they&#x2019;d managed to frighten everyone about the dangers of improperly made chairs that might dump people on the ground and snap their necks?</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Okay, yes, we used to have Serious People who would go around and certify the making of some medicines where somebody might be tempted to cheat and use inferior ingredients. But that was before <em>computers</em> and <em>outcome statistics</em> and <em>online ratings.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;And on our planet, Uber and Lyft are currently fighting it out with taxi companies and their pet regulators after exactly that development. But suppose the whole system was set up before the existence of online ratings. Then the carpenters might have managed to introduce occupational licensing on who could be a carpenter. So if you tried to set up a factory, your factory workers would have needed to go through the traditional carpentry apprenticeship that covered every part of every kind of furniture, before they were legally allowed to come to your factory and specialize in carving just one kind of chair-arm. And then your factory would also need a ton of permits to sell its furniture, and would need to inveigle orders from a handful of resellers who were licensed to buy and resell furniture at a fixed margin. That small, insular group of resellers might not benefit <em>literally personally</em>&#x2014;in their own personal salary&#x2014;from buying from your cheaper factory system. And so it would go.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;But why would the legislators go along with that?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Because the carpenters would have a big, concentrated incentive to figure out how to make legislators do it&#x2014;maybe by hiring very persuasive people, or by subtle bribery, or by not-so-subtle bribery.</p>\n<p>Insofar as occupational licensing works to the benefit of professionals at the expense of consumers, occupational licensing represents a kind of regulatory capture, which happens when a few regulatees have a much more concentrated incentive to affect the regulation process. Regulatory capture in turn is a kind of commons problem, since every citizen shares the benefits of non-captured regulation, but no individual citizen has a sufficient incentive to unilaterally spend their life attending to that particular regulatory problem. So occupational licensing is regulatory capture is a commons problem is a coordination problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Then&#x2026; the upshot is that it&#x2019;s impossible for your country to <em>test</em> a functional hospital design <em>in the first place?</em> The reformers can&#x2019;t win the competition because they&#x2019;re not legally allowed to try?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;But of course. Though in this case, if you did manage to set up a test hospital working along more reasonable lines, you still wouldn&#x2019;t be able to advertise your better results relative to any other hospitals. With just a few isolated exceptions, all of the other hospitals on Earth don&#x2019;t publish patient outcome statistics in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026; But&#x2026; then&#x2014;<em>what are they even selling?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Hold on. If you reward the doctors with the highest patient survival rates, won&#x2019;t they just reject all the patients with poor prognoses?</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Obviously you don&#x2019;t evaluate raw survival rates. You have Diagnosticians who estimate prognosis categories and are rated on their predictive accuracy, and Treatment Planners and Surgeons who are rated on their <em>relative</em> outcomes, and you have the outcomes evaluated by a third party, and&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;In our world, there&#x2019;s no separation of powers where one person assigns patients a prognosis category and has their prediction record tracked, and another person does their best to treat them and has their treatment record tracked. So hospitals don&#x2019;t publish any performance statistics, and patients choose the hospital closest to their house that takes their workplace&#x2019;s insurance, and nobody has any financial incentive to decrease the number of patient deaths from sloppy surgeons or central line infections. When anesthesiologists in particular did happen to start tracking patient outcomes, they adopted some simple monitoring standards and subsequently decreased their fatality rates by a factor of <em>one hundred</em>.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8-definition\">8</a></sup> But that&#x2019;s just anesthesiologists, not, say, cardiac surgeons.</p>\n<p>With cardiac surgeons, a group of researchers recently figured out how to detect when the most senior cardiac surgeons were at conferences, and found that the death rates went down while the most senior cardiac surgeons were away.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9-definition\">9</a></sup> But our scientists have to use special tricks if they want to find out any facts like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Do your <em>patients</em> not care if they live or die?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Robin Hanson has a further thesis about how what people really want from medicine is reassurance rather than statistics. But I&#x2019;m not sure that hypothesis is necessary to explain this particular aspect of the problem. If no hospital offers statistics, then you have no baseline to compare to if one hospital <em>does</em> start offering statistics. You&#x2019;d just be looking at an alarming-looking percentage for how many patients die, with no idea of whether that&#x2019;s a better percentage or a worse percentage. Terrible marketing! Especially compared to that other hospital across town that just smiles at you reassuringly.</p>\n<p>No hospital would benefit from being the <em>first</em> to publish statistics, so none of them do.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Your world has literally zero market demand for empirical evidence?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Not zero, no. But since publishing scary numbers would be bad marketing for <em>most</em> patients, and hospitals are heavily regional, they all go by the majority preference to not hear about the statistics.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I confess I&#x2019;m having some trouble grasping the concept of a market consisting of opaque boxes allegedly containing goods, in which nobody publishes what is inside the boxes.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Hospitals don&#x2019;t publish prices either, in most cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Yeah, it&#x2019;s pretty bad even by Earth standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;You literally don&#x2019;t <em>have</em> a healthcare market. Nobody knows what outcomes are being sold. Nobody knows what the prices are.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I guess we could call that Total Market Failure? As in, things have gone so wrong that there&#x2019;s literally no supply-demand matching or price-equilibrating mechanism remaining, even though money is still changing hands.</p>\n<p>And while I wish that this phenomenon of &#x201C;you simply don&#x2019;t have a market&#x201D; were only relevant to healthcare and not to other facets of our civilization&#x2026; well, it&#x2019;s not.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>vi. Absence of (meta-)competition</h2>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I suppose I can imagine imagine a hypothetical world in which <em>one</em> country screws things up as badly as you describe. But your planet has multiple governments, I thought. Or did I misunderstand that? Why wouldn&#x2019;t patients emigrate to&#x2014;or just <em>visit</em>&#x2014;countries that made better hospitals legal?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;The forces acting on governments with high technology levels are mostly the same between countries, so all the governments of those countries tend to have their medical system screwed up in mostly the same way (not least because they&#x2019;re imitating each other). Some aspects of dysfunctional insurance and payment policies are special to the US, but even the relatively functional National Health System in Britain still has failure of professional specialization. (Though they at least don&#x2019;t require doctors to have philosophy degrees.)</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Is there not <em>one</em> government that would allow a reasonably designed hospital staffed by specialists instead of generalists?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t be enough to just have one government&#x2019;s okay. You&#x2019;d need some way to initially train your workers, despite none of our world&#x2019;s medical schools being set up to train them. A majority of legislators won&#x2019;t benefit <em>personally</em> from deciding to let you try your new hospital in their country. Furthermore, you couldn&#x2019;t just go around raising money from rich countries for a venture in a poor country, because rich countries have elaborate regulations on who&#x2019;s allowed to raise money for business ventures through equity sales. The fundamental story is that everything, everywhere, is covered with varying degrees of molasses, and to do any novel thing you have to get around all of the molasses streams <em>simultaneously</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;So it&#x2019;s impossible to test a functional hospital design <em>anywhere on the planet</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;But of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I must still be missing something. I just don&#x2019;t understand why all of the people with economics training on your planet can&#x2019;t go off by themselves and establish their own hospitals. Do you literally have people occupying every square mile of land?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026; How do I phrase this&#x2026;</p>\n<p>All useful land is already claimed by some national government, in a way that the international order recognizes, whether or not that land is inhabited. No relevant decisionmaker has a personal incentive to allow there to be unclaimed land. Those countries will defend even a very small patch of that claimed land using all of the military force their country has available, and the international order will see you as the aggressor in that case.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Can you <em>buy</em> land?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;You can&#x2019;t buy the sovereignty on the land. Even if you had a <em>lot</em> of money, any country poor enough and desperate enough to consider your offer might just steal your stuff after you moved in.</p>\n<p>Negotiating the right to bring in weapons to defend yourself in this kind of scenario would be even more unthinkable, and would spark international outrage that could prevent you from trading with other countries.</p>\n<p>To be clear, it&#x2019;s not that there&#x2019;s a global dictator who prevents new countries from popping up; but every potentially useful part of every land is under <em>some</em> system&#x2019;s control, and all of those systems would refuse you the chance to set up your own alternative system, for very similar reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;So there&#x2019;s no way for your planet to <em>try</em> different ways of doing things, <em>anywhere</em>. You literally cannot run experiments about things like this.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Why would there be? Who would decide that, and how would they personally benefit?</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;That sounds <em>extremely</em> alarming. I mean, difficulties of adoption are one thing, but not even being able to <em>try</em> new things and see what happens&#x2026; Shouldn&#x2019;t everyone on your planet be able to detect at a glance how horrible things have become? Can this type of disaster really stand up to <em>universal</em> agreement that something is wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m afraid that our civilization doesn&#x2019;t have a sufficiently stirring and narratively satisfying conception of the valor of &#x201C;testing things&#x201D; that our people would be massively alarmed by its impossibility. And now, Visitor, I hope we&#x2019;ve bottomed out the general concept of why people can&#x2019;t do things differently&#x2014;the local system&#x2019;s equilibrium is broken, <em>and</em> the larger system&#x2019;s equilibrium makes it impossible to flee the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Okay, look&#x2026; despite everything you&#x2019;ve said so far, I still have some trouble understanding why doctors and parents can&#x2019;t just <em>not</em> kill the babies. I manage to get up every single morning and successfully not kill any babies. It&#x2019;s not as hard as it sounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I worry you&#x2019;re starting to think like Simplicio. You can&#x2019;t just <em>not</em> kill babies and expect to get away with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicio:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;I actually agree with Cecie here. The evil people behind the system hate those who defy them by behaving differently; there&#x2019;s no way they&#x2019;d countenance anyone departing from the norm. What we really need is a revolution, so we can depose our corrupt overlords, and finally be free to coordinate, and&#x2026;!</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;There&#x2019;s no need to add in any evil conspiracy hypotheses here.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s sufficient to note that the system is <em>in equilibrium</em> and it has <em>causes</em> for the equilibrium settling there&#x2014;causes, if not justifications. You can&#x2019;t go against the system&#x2019;s default without going against the forces that underpin that default. A doctor who gives a baby a nutrition formula that isn&#x2019;t FDA-approved will lose their job. A hospital that doesn&#x2019;t fire that kind of doctor will be sued. A scientist that writes proposals for a big, expensive, definitive study won&#x2019;t get a grant, and while they were busy writing those failed grant proposals, they&#x2019;ll have lost their momentum toward tenure. So no, you can&#x2019;t just try out a competing policy of not killing babies. Not more than once.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;<em>Have</em> you tried?</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;No.</p>\n<p><strong>Visitor:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;But&#x2014;</p>\n<p><strong>Cecie:</strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;Anyway, from my perspective, it&#x2019;s no surprise if you don&#x2019;t yet feel like you understand. We&#x2019;ve only <em>begun</em> to survey the malfunctions of the whole system, which would further include the FDA, and the clinical trials, and the <em>p</em>-hacking. And the way venture capital is structured, and equity-market regulations. And the insurance companies, and the tax code. And the corporations who contract with the insurance companies. And the corporations&#x2019; employees. And the politicians.

In Ireland, aspiring doctors go straight from high school to medical school and finish after five years. I&#x2019;ve done medicine in both America and Ireland. The doctors in both countries are about equally good. When Irish doctors take the American standardized tests, they usually do pretty well. Ireland is one of the approximately 100% of First World countries that gets better health outcomes than the United States. There&#x2019;s no evidence whatsoever that American doctors gain anything from those three extra years of undergrad. And why would they? Why is having a philosophy degree under my belt supposed to make me any better at medicine? [&#x2026;]</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll make another confession. Ireland&#x2019;s medical school is five years as opposed to America&#x2019;s four because the Irish spend their first year teaching the basic sciences&#x2014;biology, organic chemistry, physics, calculus. When I applied to medical school in Ireland, they offered me an accelerated four year program on the grounds that I had surely gotten all of those in my American undergraduate work. I hadn&#x2019;t. I read some books about them over the summer and did just fine.</p>\n<p>Americans take eight years to become doctors. Irishmen can do it in four, and achieve the same result. Each year of higher education at a good school&#x2014;let&#x2019;s say an Ivy, doctors don&#x2019;t study at Podunk Community College&#x2014;costs about $50,000. So American medical students are paying an extra $200,000 for&#x2026;what?</p>\n<p>Remember, a modest amount of the current health care crisis is caused by doctors&#x2019; crippling level of debt. Socially responsible doctors often consider less lucrative careers helping the needy, right up until the bill comes due from their education and they realize they have to make a lot of money right now. We took one look at that problem and said &#x201C;You know, let&#x2019;s make doctors pay an extra $200,000 for no reason.&#x201D;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a more general discussion of the evidence that college is chiefly a costly signal of pre-existing ability, rather than a mechanism for building skills and improving productivity, see Bryan Caplan&#x2019;s argument in &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.cato.org/events/college-worth-it\">Is College Worth It?</a>&#x201D;, also summarized <a href=\"http://www.economicmanblog.com/2017/02/25/college-capital-or-signal/\">by Roger Barris</a>.&#xA0;<a href=\"#footnote-6-return\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>See, e.g., Scott Alexander&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/29/my-irb-nightmare/\">My IRB Nightmare</a>.&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href=\"#footnote-7-return\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From Hyman and Silver, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1469&amp;context=wlulr\">You Get What You Pay For</a>&#x201D;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the 1950s, death rates ranged between 1 and 10 per 10,000 encounters. Anesthesia mortality stabilized at this rate for more than two decades. Mortality and morbidity rates fell again after a 1978 article reframed the issue of anesthesia safety as one of human factor analysis. In the mid-1980s, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) promulgated standards of optimal anesthesia practice that relied heavily on systems-based approaches for preventing errors. Because patients frequently sued anesthetists when bad outcomes occurred and because deviations from the ASA guidelines made the imposition of liability much more likely, anesthetists had substantial incentives to comply.</p>\n<p>[&#x2026; W]e should consider why anesthesia mortality stabilized at a rate more than one hundred times higher than its current level for more than two decades. The problem was not lack of information. To the contrary, anesthesia safety was studied extensively during the period. A better hypothesis is that anesthetists grew accustomed to a mortality rate that was exemplary by health care standards, but that was still higher than it should have been. From a psychological perspective, this low frequency encouraged anesthetists to treat each bad outcome as a tragic but unforeseen and unpreventable event. Indeed, anesthetists likely viewed each individual bad outcome as the manifestation of an irreducible baseline rate of medical mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hyman and Silver note other possible factors behind the large change, e.g., the fact that the person responsible for mishaps was often easy to identify since there tended to be only one anesthetist per procedure, and that &#x201C;because surgical patients had no on-going relationships with their anesthetist, victims were particularly likely to sue.&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href=\"#footnote-8-return\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>See Jena, Prasad, Goldman, and Romley, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2038979\">Mortality and Treatment Patterns Among Patients Hospitalized With Acute Cardiovascular Conditions During Dates of National Cardiology Meetings</a>.&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href=\"#footnote-9-return\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol></body></html>", "user": {"username": "EliezerYudkowsky"}}, {"_id": "SJFDMsTQHDMbzxBLW", "title": "Survey of leaders in the EA community on a range of important topics, like what skills they need and what causes are most effective", "postedAt": "2017-11-03T23:35:32.079Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>80,000 Hours just released an analysis of a survey we conducted at the EA Leaders Forum in August 2017.

This trend is great and one I am really excited about as the founder of a talent limited organization. However, I feel there is a bit of a disparity between the specific talent organizations are looking for compared to what talent creation groups are often focused on. I do not think this is true for 100% of organizations working on talent or looking for talent, but from conversations I have had with others, I expect the trends below to be broadly true rather than just true for my organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus on talent quality over quantity</strong></p>\n<p>The first biggest difference that I noticed and the one I have heard talked about by other organizations the most is the different focus on quality vs quantity. From the perspective of running an organization (both in meta and direct poverty) what I really need are top hires, mostly in senior positions. This is the main talent that is really hard to find in the EA movement and will have a much higher impact on my organizations running (or new organizations getting founded) than any number of 10% donors or solid volunteers. To give a really concrete example, this <a href=\"/ea/1g1/introducing_fortify_health_an_eaaligned_charity/\">recent EA project</a> launched was only made possible because there was enough highly talented and dedicated people who applied, but there are still other ideas that could be founded if there were more people in this camp being generated from talent pipelines.<br><br>However the focus in many community-building organizations often seems to be more focused on number of people (at events, in the program, taking pledges, etc) with few examples of senior hires for EA organizations (or equivalent) coming out of these programs.<br><br>I know that organizationally it can be harder and quite a different mindset to aim for fewer but high impact people. Some of my points below tie a bit tighter into ways to change organizational focuses more in this direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus on endline specific metrics </strong></p>\n<p>The second big difference I notice between movement-building organizations and talent-short organizations is how much they are concerned with and value intermediate metrics. If I am looking to start a project like the one I mentioned above (a new possible GiveWell recommended charity), it matters very little to me how many people hit intermediate or more general metrics such as taking the 10% pledge, and although it can be in theory used as a correlative metric, there are plenty of reasons how you can imagine an organization very good at maximizing these intermediate metrics without many of the endline specific metrics being maximized. <br><br>Very few talent pipe widening organizations seem to focus on specific gaps instead of just broadly &#x201C;creating more EAs&#x201D;. This is on top of the concerns that the term &#x201C;EA&#x201D; leaves a lot of room for moving the goalposts. I think by narrowing down to specific areas of focus organizations can a) avoid stepping on each other&#x2019;s toes/impact and b) focus on fewer but more specifically needed skills.<br><br>To give a more specific example of how I could see this being applied would be an organization set up exclusively to find people good at founding high quality organizations in a single specific high impact EA area (poverty, AI, animal rights).<br><br><strong>Current trajectory and positive examples</strong></p>\n<p>Overall I think the EA movement is moving more in this direction, but I think there is still space to speed up progress on this front. Some positive examples of things I think have had large impact and moved more in the focused/quality direction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>EA jobs Facebook group - very focused and very low time cost but has allowed many more applicants to apply to a given specific job than otherwise would without having to contact many different mailing lists/delivery systems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>80,000 Hours narrowing down focus on top cause areas. Being cause neutral is not the same as being cause indifferent and over time 80,000 Hours has clarified and published their list of priorities as well as moved their focus to their assessed higher impact areas. Even if I disagree with their list of which causes are most important, I think this focus is a very important way to greatly improve impact from their perspective.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Targeted internships - <a href=\"http://www.charitysciencehealth.com/blog/internship-opportunity-build-charity-startup-skills\">this program</a> run by Charity Science (my organization) giving specific internships aimed at building capacity for a specific later job seems like a good way of aiming at both quality and specificness that could be replicated in other areas.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "HFa28vs5tMg9mmMcs", "title": "Reflections on community building in the Netherlands", "postedAt": "2017-11-02T22:01:17.922Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>Authors</span><span>:</span><em><span> Remmelt Ellen and Sjir Hoeijmakers<br><br></span></em><span>Here, we share our key lessons since launching the community-building organisation Effective Altruism Netherlands this year, as well as our plans for 2018.

We also continued our website development and one-on-one community outreach as projects with our volunteer team. </span></p>\n<p><span>We started two outreach projects &#x2014; a crowd-acting campaign and a page listing in an info booklet for freshers&#x2019; fairs &#x2014; and found enterprising people to lead those. There, we ran into problems: we were acting on short-term opportunities, so it was difficult to find volunteers deeply involved with EA who had the prerequisite marketing skills, and therefore for us to avoid micromanaging their execution. </span></p>\n<p><span>At this point, EAN was mostly working with groups of students. Although several group organisers decided to organise monthly pub socials, we noticed that most of them lacked the time and/or motivation to use learned outcomes from meetings to develop their groups further. </span></p>\n<p><span>This highlighted the need to collaborate more with people who actively shared our goals and had more professional experience. Sjir came into contact with two </span><a href=\"http://om/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ftalent2gather.nl%2Fwie-zijn-wij%2F&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url\"><span>experienced workshop facilitators</span></a><span> and gave them the idea to start giving career workshops at universities based on the research of 80,000 Hours, starting with trials at student organisations in April.</span></p>\n<p><span>To officially launch EAN, we organised an event on 28 May introduced by Peter Singer (in the same period, we arranged for him to attend a dinner discussion for large philanthropists for Effective Giving and oversaw the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgNTzUthzI5m5uRAj8zWLxGCTqrKi5Tf0BJEje4J5Ts/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>media publicity</span></a><span> around a new translated version of The Most Good You Can Do). The event had 139 participants registered &#x2013; either through online applications or through personal invitations by us because of their position in a certain sector and potential for EA-alignedness. We combined Peter Singer&#x2019;s talk with parallel sessions catering to people working in different sectors and cause areas. This resulted in fruitful discussions and an excited atmosphere (with an average feedback score of 6.5/8 on </span><span>Has this made you more or less enthusiastic about EA?</span><span>). We oversaw a brainstorm session on EA projects, but we saw few concrete results come out of that, probably because of the loose session structure as well as participants diverging in their aims. In another session, we invited participants interested in AI safety. One of them shared a recent idea to create an online course about AI safety (now called </span><a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Accelerating_AI_Safety_Adoption_in_Academia\"><span>RAISE: Road to AI-Safety Excellence</span></a><span>) and was able to involve capable volunteers to start working on that.</span></p>\n<p><span>The productive interactions we noticed with the forming of cause-area/talent-area subgroups at the event, as well as the lack of &#x2018;spontaneously-generated&#x2019; volunteer projects led us to conclude that we needed to approach building our community more as facilitating specialised networks of people.</span><span><br></span><span>&#x2192;</span> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-RZxEpc_3gifqWzcCg28q1sb_pxe6ExKg2ICRWspwcA/\"><span>See our review of our project phase</span></a><span>. </span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>July</span><span>: Building networks</span><span><br></span><span>We decided to </span><a href=\"/ea/1c8/testing_an_ea_networkbuilding_strategy_in_the/\"><span>test a novel strategy</span></a><span> that involved supporting organisers in creating specialised networks of EAs to work on the most pressing problems. We would arrange one-on-one problem-solving sessions with the organisers, help connect suitable people with their networks and deeply engage their members by facilitating interactions between them and the wider EA community. </span></p>\n<p><span>We had the hypothesis that we would be able to collaborate with five networks by October, with each having clear goals and metrics, but this didn&#x2019;t happen for several reasons:</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition to collaborating with the career workshops facilitators, Effective Giving and RAISE, we explored a number of potential collaborations with individuals: a professional-services network, a corporate-entrepreneurs network, a policy network, the LessWrong Amsterdam community, an effective animal advocacy network and several local groups. </span><span><br></span><span>Although we helped a number of these initiatives grow, this did not result in any significant collaborations. We experienced difficulty finding capable and aligned organisers who had the time to form networks, as well as communicating a clear value proposal to existing organisers. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Our execution of this strategy was further hampered by Sjir and Remmelt taking leave during this time and generally spending too much time on reaching consensus in decisions. Finally, both Sjir and Remmelt were still working on a voluntary basis, making it difficult for them to perform deep, undistracted work.</span></p>\n<p><span>EAN applied for funding from EA Grants at the end of June. The staff at the Centre for Effective Altruism decided to connect us to Open Philanthropy Project at the end of August, who then deferred their decision back to CEA, who in the end decided not to fund us. </span></p>\n<p><span>CEA staff expressed doubts about two areas: strategy synchronisation and our ability to execute strategy. Here, strategy synchronisation was about the risks in expanding the number of large organisations for them to coordinate with, given how easy it is to make mistakes in promoting effective altruism (e.g. </span><a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas/\"><span>dilution of ideas</span></a><span> and, relatedly, the </span><a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/unilateralist.pdf\"><span>Unilateralist&#x2019;s Curse</span></a><span>). Given that our strategy was rather vague, it was difficult for them to gauge these risks. Also, we were exploring uncharted territory by trying an approach that relied on trusting other individuals to build networks without diluting the complexity inherent in striving to do effective altruism. In terms of execution, CEA staff were unsure whether Sjir and Remmelt were at least as capable as a recruit they would hire to work for them.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the meantime, we helped RAISE record their first lecture videos as well as narrow their target audience to those that seemed most committed to and capable of becoming AI-safety researchers.</span><span><br></span><span>For the career workshop facilitators, we contacted and found several university colleges to do paid workshops at.</span><span><br></span><span>&#x2192; </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-RZxEpc_3gifqWzcCg28q1sb_pxe6ExKg2ICRWspwcA/edit#heading=h.80mcw0ebmm3\"><span>See our review of our network-building phase</span></a><span>.<br></span>\f<br><br></p>\n<p><span>October</span><span>: a shift to outreach &amp; events</span><span><br></span><span>Our biggest lesson in testing our network-building strategy has been that the Dutch EA community still lacks highly-engaged and skilled individuals &#x2013;&#xA0;those who could potentially join the specialised networks we had in mind.

However, we now think that we should make the pipeline to these more gradual &#x2013; by targeting and getting to know potential collaborators, and designing a social environment that repeatedly exposes them to the nuanced ideas of EA. In other words, we&#x2019;ll be more of an &#x2018;incubator&#x2019; than a &#x2018;connector&#x2019; of initiatives.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Other meta-organisations have shown success in incubating projects in the past, notable examples being the Centre for Effective Altruism (with 80,000 Hours &amp; Giving What We Can), and Effective Altruism Foundation (with Sentience Politics &amp; Raising for Effective Giving). We will therefore continue to have one-on-one conversations with organisers we trust, including from Effective Giving, the career workshops facilitators, RAISE and </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EffectiefAltruismeGroningen/\"><span>EA Groningen</span></a><span>, and support them in solving any bottlenecks to building out their networks.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Sjir has experience in Dutch public policy and Remmelt is making forays into machine learning right now.

We want to avoid our personal incomes being dependent on external funding. In our experience, it has been highly distracting to engage potential donors on a complicated meta-charity to extend our shrinking financial runways. We want to prevent being forced to prematurely reduce the time we can spend on community building based on this alone (though we </span><span>will</span><span> actively seek out feedback from informed donors on our potential relative to other community-builders). </span></p>\n<p><span>Sjir and Remmelt can cover their basic living costs until the end of January 2018. We plan to transition to other income sources before that deadline:</span><span><br></span><span><span>&#x2022;</span> Sjir will receive a one-time compensation from EAN to cover his living costs from November to January. He plans to earn his living after that as a consultant, speaker and writer on doing good effectively/having a positive impact more generally. In this way, his work can naturally extend into his activities for EAN, and he can build a reputation and network that adds value to EAN as well. Since some of his work will be personalised to client needs, it is difficult to pin down how much of his time will go directly to EAN&#x2019;s activities, but he expects to be able to dedicate a minimum of 10 hours/week to this in 2018.</span><span><br></span><span><span>&#x2022;</span> Remmelt is completing a graduation project on </span><a href=\"https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/intelligent-and-autonomous-systems\"><span>multi-agent systems</span></a><span> for his degree right now and, as such, can live off study loans until February. Remmelt is used to living frugally. For any work that he will take on in 2018, he has a strong preference for it to accelerate the rate at which he can build specialised skills in the areas of AI safety research and EA community-building. He&#x2019;s looking for part-time work to earn at least &#x20AC;800/month in the meantime (please email any suggestions to </span><a href=\"mailto:remmelt@effectiefaltruisme.nl\"><span>remmelt@effectiefaltruisme.nl</span></a><span>). This may include taking on remote research jobs or receiving supplementary ticket income from organising EA events.

For this, we are still looking for funding of &#x20AC;5,900 for 2018 (after subtracting a recent donation of &#x20AC;1,000).

These concern the core ethical and epistemological </span><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/the-importance-of-crucial-considerations/\"><span>considerations</span></a><span> that a person makes, the </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/\"><span>cause areas</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/the-unintuitive-power-laws-of-giving\"><span>interventions</span></a><span> (s)he chooses to work on, the success of their work as a </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TH4_ikhAGz0?t=10m38s\"><span>combined result</span></a><span> of their skills and inclinations, and each of these effects being amplified by the </span><a href=\"http://barabasi.com/networksciencebook/\"><span>spread</span></a><span> of information and (dis)trust throughout the </span><a href=\"/ea/10x/improving_the_effective_altruism_network/\"><span>social networks</span></a><span> within which the person is connected. Having said this, any attempt to estimate the future impact of a supposed &#x2018;top 1%&#x2019; on such a distribution will likely be overconfident because of </span><a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/why-charities-dont-differ-astronomically-in-cost-effectiveness/#Argument_1_Many_types_of_flow-through_effects\"><span>the dimensions missed</span></a><span> (and risks reinforcing </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lv/every_cause_wants_to_be_a_cult/\"><span>accepted wisdom</span></a><span> on what traits make for an impactful EA).</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Although the process of estimating an individual&#x2019;s capacity to do good is extremely complex and laden with assumptions, 80,000 Hours seems to have acquired the most expertise in doing this amongst the organisations we&#x2019;re aware of. </span></p>\n<p><span>To evaluate our own performance in engaging people to do good, we therefore plan to count those we refer to 80,000 Hours whom are subsequently selected for one-on-one coaching (and, preferably, the resulting </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2016/07/update-on-number-of-significant-plan-changes/#impact-adjustment-of-significant-plan-changes\"><span>IASPCs</span></a><span>) for our </span><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/why-nonprofits-should-apply-to-y-combinator/#relevance-of-advice\"><span>key metric</span></a><span>. By setting 80,000 coaching referrals as our &apos;</span><a href=\"http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec06/\"><span>North Star</span></a><span>&apos;, we incentivise ourselves to selectively target and support the development of the most promising individuals instead of pursuing raw &#x2018;member&#x2019; growth, while allowing ourselves to build trust with the international community in our ability to execute. </span><span><br></span><span>A straightforward solution to tracking this is a referral link to their </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/coaching/#how-to-apply\"><span>coaching webpage</span></a><span>, but we&#x2019;re concerned that this method would miss many of the people we advise to apply to 80,000 Hours. We will consult with them and CEA Groups on what processes we can adopt here. </span></p>\n<p><span>Next to this, we&#x2019;re tracking the number of people we are in touch with</span> <span>who are dedicating at least 10% of their time/money to EA (&#x2018;Practising EAs&#x2019;). Our aim is to better help the most promising amongst these individuals achieve shared altruistic goals. For this, we&#x2019;ve created an internal database of people in our community (currently: 234 people) in which we keep track of the skills, time and connections that they are willing to contribute. Finally, to evaluate our individual performance, Sjir and Remmelt will each build in metrics and feedback mechanisms for the targeted outreach, capacity-building events and one-on-one conversations with organisers that they will be taking on. </span></p>\n<p><span>We also seek to more closely collaborate with CEA&#x2019;s Community and Research Teams as well as the management of Effective Altruism Foundation. We take any advice by them on reducing the long-term risks that come with promoting EA seriously. At the same time, a system that relies on a few small circles of individuals determining the international agenda for EA community building would be fragile. In our view, EAN can add to the body of knowledge and the level of discussion on this subject.</span><span><br></span><span>&#x2192;</span> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/194Bmtp-OlnkX5gZwVqSkalloia-WBxq2S8P5z5ncAm4/edit\"><span>See more of our views on this</span></a><span>.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Next: </span><span>share your feedback</span><span><br></span><span><span>&#x2022;</span> We welcome your comments and questions below, especially of the critical, insightful kind.</span><span><br></span><span><span>&#x2022;</span> If you&#x2019;re going to EAG London, feel free to approach </span><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/eaglondon/person/1174022\"><span>Sjir</span></a><span> or </span><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/eaglondon/person/1166205\"><span>Remmelt</span></a><span> for a chat.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "remmelt"}}, {"_id": "7MdLurJGhGmqRv25c", "title": "Multiverse-wide cooperation in a nutshell", "postedAt": "2017-11-02T10:17:14.386Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>(Crossposted from the <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/blog/\">FRI blog</a>.) <br><br>This is a post I wrote about Caspar Oesterheld&#x2019;s long paper <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\"><em>Multiverse-wide cooperation via correlated decision-making</em></a>. Because I have found the idea tricky to explain &#x2013; which unfortunately makes it difficult to get feedback from others on whether the thinking behind it makes sense &#x2013; I decided to write a shorter summary. While I am hoping that my text can serve as a standalone piece, for additional introductory content I also recommend reading the beginning of Caspar&#x2019;s paper, or watching the short video introduction <a href=\"https://casparoesterheld.com/2017/05/16/talk-on-multiverse-wide-cooperation-via-correlated-decision-making/\">here</a> (requires basic knowledge of the &#x201C;CDT, EDT or something else&#x201D; debate in decision theory). &#xA0;</p>\n<h1>0. Elevator pitch</h1>\n<p>(<em>Disclaimer</em>: Especially for the elevator pitch section here, I am sacrificing accuracy and precision for brevity. References can be found in Caspar&#x2019;s paper.) <br><br>It would be an uncanny coincidence if the observable universe made up everything that exists. The reason we cannot find any evidence for there being stuff beyond the edges of our universe is not because it is likely that there is nothingness, but because photons from further away simply would not have had sufficient time after the big bang to reach us. This means that the universe we find ourselves in may well be vastly larger than what we can observe, in fact even<em> infinitely</em> larger. The theory of inflationary cosmology in addition hints at the existence of other universe bubbles with different fundamental constants forming or disappearing under certain conditions, somehow co-existing with our universe in parallel. The umbrella term <em>multiverse</em> captures the idea that the observable universe is just a tiny portion of everything that exists. The multiverse may contain myriads of worlds like ours, including other worlds with intelligent life and civilization. An infinite multiverse (of one sort or another) is actually amongst the most popular cosmological hypotheses, arguably even favored by the majority of experts. <br><br>Many ethical theories (in particular most versions of consequentialism) do not consider geographical distance of relevance to moral value. After all, suffering and the frustration of one&#x2019;s preferences is bad for someone regardless of where (or when) it happens. This principle should apply even when we consider worlds so far away from us that we can never receive any information from there. Moral concern over what happens elsewhere in the multiverse is one requirement for the idea I am now going to discuss. <br><br>Multiverse-wide cooperation via superrationality (abbreviation: MSR) is the idea that, if I think about different value systems and their respective priorities in the world, I should not work on the highest priority according to my own values, but on whatever my comparative advantage is amongst all the interventions favored by the value systems of agents interested in multiverse-wide cooperation. (Another route to gains from trade is to focus on convergent interests, pursuing interventions that may not be the top priority for any particular value system, but are valuable from a maximally broad range of perspectives.) For simplicity reasons, I will refer to this as simply &#x201C;cooperating&#x201D; from now on. <br><br>A decision to cooperate, according to some views on decision theory, gives me rational reason to believe that agents in similar decision situations elsewhere in the multiverse, especially the ones who are most similar to myself in how they reason about decision problems, are likely to cooperate as well. After all, if two very similar reasoners think about the same decision problem, they are likely to reach identical answers. This suggests that they will end up either both cooperating, or both defecting. Assuming that the way agents find decisions is not strongly constrained or otherwise affected by their values, we can expect there to be agents with different values who reason about decision problems the same way we do, who come to identical conclusions. Cooperation then produces gains from trade between value systems. <br><br>While each party would want to be the sole defector, the mechanism behind multiverse-wide cooperation &#x2013;&#xA0;namely that we have to think of ourselves as being coupled with those agents in the multiverse who are most similar to us in their reasoning &#x2013; ensures that defection is disincentivized: Any party that defects would now have to expect that their highly similar counterparts would also defect. <br><br>The closest way to approximate the value systems of agents in other parts of the multiverse, given our ignorance about how the multiverse looks like, is to assume that substantial parts of it at least are going to be similar to how things are here, where we can study them. A minimally viable version of multiverse-wide cooperation can therefore be thought of as all-out &#x201C;ordinary&#x201D; cooperation with value systems we know well (and especially ones that include proponents sympathetic to MSR reasoning). This suggests that, while MSR combines speculative-sounding ideas such as non-standard&#xA0;causation and the existence of a multiverse, its implications may not be all that strange and largely boil down to the proposal that we should be &#x201C;maximally&#x201D; cooperative towards other value systems.</p>\n<h1>1. A primer on non-causal decision theory</h1>\n<p>Leaving aside for the moment the whole part about the multiverse, MSR is fundamentally about cooperating in a prisoner&#x2019;s-dilemma-like situation with agents who are very similar to ourselves in the way they reason about decision problems. Douglas Hofstadter coined the term <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/1985-hofstadter#dilemmas-for-superrational-thinkers-leading-up-to-a-luring-lottery\"><em>superrationality</em></a> for the idea that one should cooperate in a prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma if one expects the other party to follow the same style of reasoning. If they reason the same way I do, and the problem they are facing is the same kind of problem I am facing, then I must expect that they will likely come to the same conclusion I will come to. This suggests that the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma in question is unlikely to end with an asymmetric outcome ((cooperate I defect) or (defect I cooperate)), but likely to end with a symmetric outcome ((cooperate I cooperate) or (defect I defect)). Because (cooperate I cooperate) is the best outcome for both parties amongst the symmetric outcomes, superrationality suggests one is best served by cooperating. <br><br>At this point, readers may be skeptical whether this reasoning works. There seems to be some kind of shady action at a distance involved, where my choice to cooperate is somehow supposed to affect the other party&#x2019;s choice, even though we are assuming that no information about my decision reaches said other party. But we can think of it this way: If reasoners are deterministic systems, and two reasoners follow the exact same decision algorithm in a highly similar decision situation, it at some point becomes logically contradictory to assume that the two reasoners will end up with diametrically opposed conclusions. <br><br>Side note: By decision situations having to be &#x201C;highly similar,&#x201D; I do not mean that the situations agents find themselves in have to be particularly similar with respect to little details in the background. What I mean is that they should be highly similar in terms of all <em>decision-relevant variables</em>, the variables that are likely to make a difference to an agent&#x2019;s decision. If we imagine a simplified decision situation where agents have to choose between two options, either press a button or not (and then something happens or not), it probably matters little whether one agent has the choice to press a red button and another agent is faced with pressing a blue button. As long as both buttons do the same thing, and as long as the agents are not (emotionally or otherwise) affected by the color differences, we can safely assume that the color of the button is highly unlikely to play a decision-relevant role. What is more likely relevant are things such as the <em>payoffs</em> (value according what an agent cares about) the agents expect from the available options. If one agent believes they stand to receive positive utility from pressing the button, and the other stands to receive negative utility, then that is guaranteed to make a relevant difference as to whether the agents will want to press their buttons. Maybe the payoff differentials are also relevant sometimes, or are at least <em>probabilistically</em> relevant with some probability: If one agent only gains a tiny bit of utility, whereas the other agent has an enormous amount of utility to win, the latter agent might be much more motivated to avoid taking a suboptimal decision. While payoffs and payoff structures certainly matter, it is unlikely that it matters what qualifies as a payoff for a given agent: If an agent who happens to really like apples will be rewarded with tasty apples after pressing a button, and another agent who really likes money is rewarded with money, their decision situations seem the same provided that they each care equally strongly about receiving the desired reward. (This is the intuition behind the irrelevance of specific value systems for whether two decision algorithms or decision situations are relevantly similar or not. Whether one prefers apples, money, carrots or whatever, math is still math and decision theory is still decision theory.) <br><br>A different objection that readers may have at this point concerns the idea of superrationally &#x201C;fixing&#x201D; other agents&#x2019; decisions. Namely, critics may point out that we are thereby only ever talking about updating our own <em>models</em>, our prediction of what happens elsewhere, and that this does not <em>actually</em> change what was going to happen elsewhere. While this sounds like an accurate observation, the force of the statement rests on a loaded definition of &#x201C;actually changing things elsewhere&#x201D; (or anywhere for that matter). If we applied the same rigor to a straightforward instance of causally or directly changing the position of a light switch in our room, a critic may in the same vain object that we only changed our expectation of what was going to happen, not what <em>actually</em> was going to happen. The universe is lawful: nothing ever happens that was not going to happen. What we do when we want to have an impact and accomplish something with our actions is never to actually change what was going to happen; instead, it is to act in the way that best shifts our predictions favorably towards our goals. (This is not to be confused with cheating at prediction: We don&#x2019;t want to make ourselves optimistic for no good reason, because the decision to bias oneself towards optimism does not actually correlate with our goals getting accomplished &#x2013; it only correlates with a deluded future self <em>believing </em>that we will be accomplishing our goals.) <br><br>For more reading on this topic, I recommend <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf\">this paper</a> on functional decision theory, the book <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/evidence-decision-and-causality/7077949D2CD42E99C08D4FBFE5321148\">Evidence, Decision and Causality</a> or the article <a href=\"https://casparoesterheld.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/almond_edt_1.pdf\">On Correlation and Causation Part 1: Evidential decision theory is correct</a>. For an overview on different decision theories, see also <a href=\"https://casparoesterheld.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-decision-theories/\">this summary</a>. To keep things simple and as uncontroversial as possible, I will follow Caspar&#x2019;s terminology for the rest of my post here and use the term <em>superrationality</em> in a very broad sense that is independent of any specific flavor of decision theory, referring to a fuzzy category of arguments from similarity of decision algorithms that favor cooperating in certain prisoner&#x2019;s-dilemma-like situations.</p>\n<h1>2. A multiverse ensures the existence of agents with decision algorithms extremely similar to ours</h1>\n<p>The existence of a multiverse would virtually guarantee that there are many agents out there who fulfill the criteria of &#x201C;relevant similarity&#x201D; compared to us with regard to their decision algorithm and decision situations &#x2013; whatever these criteria may boil down to in detail. <br><br>Side note: Technically, if the multiverse is indeed infinite, there will likely be <em>infinitely</em> many such agents, and infinite amounts of everything in general, which admittedly poses some serious difficulties for formalizing decisions: If there is already an infinite amount of value or disvalue, it seems like all our actions should be ranked the same in terms of the value of the outcome they result in. This leads to so-called <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf\"><strong>infinitarian paralysis</strong></a>, where all actions are rated as equally good or bad. Perhaps infinitarian paralysis is a strong counterargument to MSR. But in that case, we should be consistent: Infinitarian paralysis would then also be a strong counterargument to aggregative consequentialism in general. Because it affects nearly everything (for consequentialists), and because of how drastic its implications would be if there was no convenient solution, I am basically hoping that someone will find a solution that makes everything work again in the face of infinities. For this reason, I think we should not think of MSR as being <em>particularly</em> in danger of failing for reasons of infinitarian paralysis. <br><br>Back to object-level MSR: We noted that the multiverse guarantees that there are agents out there very similar to us who are likely to tackle decision problems the same way we do. To prevent confusion, note that MSR is not based on the naive assumption that all humans who find the concept of superrationality convincing are therefore strongly correlated with each other across all possible decision situations. Superrationality only motivates cooperation if one has good reason to believe that another party&#x2019;s decision algorithm is indeed extremely similar to one&#x2019;s own. Human reasoning processes differ in many ways, and sympathy towards superrationality represents only one small dimension of one&#x2019;s reasoning process. It may very well be extremely rare that two people&#x2019;s reasoning is sufficiently similar that, having common knowledge of this similarity, they should rationally cooperate in a prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma. <br><br>But out there <em>somewhere</em>, maybe on Earth already in a few instances among our eight-or-so billion inhabitants, but certainly somewhere in the multiverse if a multiverse indeed exists, there must be evolved intelligent beings who are sympathetic towards superrationality in the same way we are, who in addition also share a whole bunch of other structural similarities with us in the way they reason about decision problems. These agents would construe decision problems related to cooperating with other value systems in the same way we do, and pay attention to the same factors weighted according to the same decision-normative criteria. When these agents think about MSR, they would be reasonably likely to reach similar conclusions with regard to the idea&#x2019;s practical implications. These are our potential cooperation partners.<br><br> I have to admit that it seems very difficult to tell which aspects of one&#x2019;s reasoning are more or less important for the kind of decision-relevant similarity we are looking for. There are many things left to be figured out, and it is far from clear whether MSR works at all in the sense of having action-guiding implications for how we should pursue our goals. But the underlying idea here is that once we pile up enough similarities of the relevant kind in one&#x2019;s reasoning processes (and a multiverse would ensure that there are agents out there who do indeed fulfill these criteria), at some point it becomes <em>logically contradictory</em> to treat the output of our decisions as independent from the decisional outputs of these other agents. This insight seems hard to avoid, and it seems quite plausible that it has implications for our actions. <br><br>If I were to decide to cooperate in the sense implied by MSR, I would have to then update my model of what is likely to happen in other parts of the multiverse where decision algorithms highly similar to my own are at play. Superrationality says that this update in my model, assuming it is positive for my goal achievement because I now predict more agents to be cooperative towards other value systems (including my own), <em>in itself</em> gives me reason to go ahead and act cooperatively. If we manage to form even a crude model of some of the likely goals of these other agents and how we can benefit them in our own part of the multiverse, then cooperation can already get off the ground and we might be able to reap gains from trade. <br><br>Alternatively, if we decided against becoming more cooperative, we learn that we must be suffering costs from mutual defection.This includes both opportunity costs and direct costs from cases where other parties&#x2019; favored interventions may hurt our values. &#xA0;</p>\n<h1>3. We are playing a multiverse-wide prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma against (close) copies of our decision algorithm</h1>\n<p>We are assuming that we care about what happens in other parts of the multiverse. For instance, we might care about increasing total happiness. If we further assume that decision algorithms and the values/goals of agents are distributed orthogonally &#x2013; meaning that one cannot infer someone&#x2019;s values simply by seeing how they reason practically about epistemic matters &#x2013; then we arrive at the conceptualization of a multiverse-wide prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma. <br><br>(Note that we can already observe empirically that effective altruists who share the same values sometimes disagree strongly about decision theory (or more generally reasoning styles/epistemics), and effective altruists who agree on decision theory sometimes disagree strongly about values. In addition, as pointed out in section one, there appears to be no <em>logical</em> reason as to why agents with different values would necessarily have different decision algorithms.) <br><br>The cooperative action in our prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma would now be to take other value systems into account in proportion to how prevalent they are in the multiverse-wide compromise. We would thus try to benefit them whenever we encounter opportunities to do so efficiently, that is, whenever we find ourselves with a comparative advantage to strongly benefit a particular value system. By contrast, the action that corresponds to defecting in the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma would be to pursue one&#x2019;s personal values with zero regard for other value systems. The payoff structure is such that an outcome where everyone cooperates is better for everyone than an outcome where everyone defects, but each party would prefer to be a sole defector. <br><br>Consider for example someone who is in an influential position to give advice to others. This person can either tailor their advice to their own specific values, discouraging others from working on things that are unimportant according to their personal value system, or she can give advice that is tailored towards producing an outcome that is maximally positive for the value systems of all superrationalists, perhaps even investing substantial effort researching the implications of value systems different from their own. MSR provides a strong argument for maximally cooperative behavior, because by cooperating, the person in question ensures that there is more such cooperation in other parts of the multiverse, which in expectation also strongly benefits their own values. <br><br>Of course there are many <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/\">other reasons</a> to be nice to other value systems (in particular reasons that do not involve aliens and infinite worlds). What is special about MSR is mostly that it gives an argument for taking the value systems of other superrationalists into account <em>maximally</em> and without worries of getting exploited for being too forthcoming. With MSR, mutual cooperation is achieved by treating one&#x2019;s own decision as a simulation/prediction for agents relevantly similar to oneself. Beyond this, there is no need to guess the reasoning of agents who are different. The updates one has to make based on MSR considerations are always symmetrical for one&#x2019;s own actions and the actions of other parties. This mechanism makes it impossible to enter asymmetrical (cooperate-defect or defect-cooperate) outcomes. <br><br>(Note that the way MSR works does not guarantee direct reciprocity in terms of who benefits whom: I should not choose to benefit value system X in my part of the multiverse in the hope that advocates of value system X<em> in particular</em> will, in reverse, be nice to my values here or in other parts of the multiverse. Instead, I should simply benefit whichever value system I can benefit <em>most, </em>in the expectation that whichever agents can benefit my values the most &#x2013; and <em>possibly</em> that turns out to be someone with value system X &#x2013; will actually cooperate and benefit my values. To summarize, hoping to be helped by value system X for MSR-reasons does not necessarily mean that I should help value system X myself &#x2013; it only implies that I should conscientiously follow MSR and help whoever benefits most from my resources.)</p>\n<h1>4. Interlude for preventing misunderstandings: Multiverse-wide cooperation is different from acausal trade!</h1>\n<p>Before we can continue with the main body of explanation, I want to proactively point out that MSR is different from <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Acausal_trade\">acausal trade</a>, which has been discussed in the context of artificial superintelligences reasoning about each others&#x2019; decision procedures. There is a danger that people lump the two ideas together, because MSR does share some similarities with acausal trade (and can arguably be seen as a <em>special case</em> of it).<br><br> Namely, both MSR and acausal trade are standardly being discussed in a multiverse context and rely crucially on acausal decision theories. There are, however, several important differences: In the acausal trade scenario, two parties simulate each other&#x2019;s decision procedures to prove that one&#x2019;s own cooperation ensures cooperation in the other party. MSR, by contrast, does not involve reasoning about the decision procedures of parties different from oneself. In particular, MSR does not involve reasoning about whether a <em>specific </em>party&#x2019;s decisions have a logical connection with one&#x2019;s own decisions or not, i.e., whether the choices in a prisoner&#x2019;s-dilemma-like situation can only result in symmetrical outcomes or not. MSR works through the simple mechanism that one&#x2019;s own decision is assumed to <em>already</em> serve as the simulation/prediction for the reference class of agents with relevantly similar decision procedures. <br><br>So MSR is based mostly on <em>looser assumptions</em> than acausal trade, because it does not require having the technological capability to accurately simulate another party&#x2019;s decision algorithm. Although there is one<em>&#xA0;</em>aspect in which MSR is based on stronger assumptions than acausal trade. Namely, MSR is based on the assumption that one&#x2019;s own decision can function as a prediction/simulation for not just identical copies of oneself in a boring twin universe where everything plays out exactly the same way as in our universe, but also for an interesting spectrum of similar-but-not-completely-identical parts of the multiverse that include agents who reason the same way about their decisions as we do, but <em>may not share our goals.</em> This is far from a trivial assumption, and I strongly recommend doing some further thinking about this assumption. But if the assumption does go through, it has vast implications for not (just) the possibility of superintelligences trading with each other, but for a form of multiverse-wide cooperation that current-day humans could already engage in.</p>\n<h1>5. MSR represents a shift in one&#x2019;s ontology; it is not just some &#x201C;trick&#x201D; we can attempt for extra credit</h1>\n<p>The line of reasoning employed in MSR is very similar to the reasoning employed in anthropic decision problems. For comparison, take the idea that there are numerous <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/how-the-simulation-argument-dampens-future-fanaticism#Calculation_based_on_all_your_copies\">copies of ourselves across many ancestor simulations</a>. If we thought this was the case, reasoning anthropically as though we control all our copies at once could, for certain decisions, change our prioritization: If my decision to reduce short-term suffering plays out the same way in millions of short-lived, simulated versions of earth where focusing on the far future is impossible to pay out, I have more reason to focus on short-term suffering than I thought. <br><br>MSR applies a similar kind of reasoning where we shift our thinking from being a single instance of something to thinking in terms of deciding for an entire class of agents. MSR is what follows when one extends/generalizes the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGOGkBiWEo\">anthropic</a>/<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/334/another_attempt_to_explain_udt/\">UDT</a> slogan&#xA0;&#x201C;Acting as though you are all your (subjectively identical) copies at once&#x201D; to &#x201C;Acting as though you are all copies of your (subjective probability distribution over your) decision algorithm at once.&#x201D;<strong> <br><br></strong> Rather than identifying solely with one&#x2019;s subjective experiences and one&#x2019;s goals/values, MSR also involves &#x201C;identifying with&#x201D; &#xA0;&#x2013; on the level of <em>predicting consequences relevant to one&#x2019;s decision &#x2013;</em> one&#x2019;s general decision algorithm. If the assumptions behind MSR are sound, then deciding not to change one&#x2019;s actions based on MSR has to cause an update in one&#x2019;s world model, an update about other agents in one&#x2019;s reference class <em>also</em> not cooperating. So the underlying reasoning that motivates MSR is something that has to permeate our thinking about how to have an impact on the world, whether we decide to let it affect our decisions or not. MSR is a claim about what is rational to do given that our actions have an impact in a broader sense than we may initially think, spanning across all instances of one&#x2019;s decision algorithm. It changes our EV calculations and may in some instances even flip the sign &#x2013; net positive/negative &#x2013; of certain interventions. Ignoring MSR is therefore not necessarily the default, &#x201C;safe&#x201D; option.</p>\n<h1>6. Lack of knowledge about aliens is no obstacle because a minimally viable version of MSR can be based on what we observe on earth</h1>\n<p>Once we start deliberating whether to account for the goals of other agents in the multiverse, we run into the problem that we have a very poor idea of what the multiverse looks like. The multiverse may contain all kinds of strange things, including worlds where physical constants are different from the ones in our universe, or worlds where highly improbable things keep happening for the same reason that, if you keep throwing an infinite number of fair coins, some of them somewhere will produce uncanny sequences like &#x201C;always heads&#x201D; or &#x201C;always tails.&#x201D;<br><br> Because it seems difficult and intractable to envision all the possible landscapes in different parts of the multiverse, what kind of agents we might find there, and how we can benefit the goals of these agents with our resources here, one might be tempted to dismiss MSR for being too impractical a consideration. However, I think this would be a premature dismissal. We may not know anything about strange corners of the multiverse, but we know at the very least how things are in our observable universe. As long as we feel like we cannot say anything substantial about <em>how</em>, specifically, the parts of the multiverse that are completely different from the things we know differ from our environment, then we may as well ignore these others parts. For practical purposes, we do not have to speculate about parts of the multiverse that would be completely alien to us (yay!), and can instead focus on what we already know from direct experience. After all, our world is likely to be representative for <em>some</em> other worlds in the multiverse. (This holds for the same reason that a randomly chosen television channel is more likely than not to be <em>somewhat</em> representative of some other television channels, rather than being completely unlike any other channel.) Therefore, we can be reasonably confident that out there somewhere, there are planets with an evolutionary history that, although different from ours in some ways, also produced intelligent observers who built a technologically advanced civilization. And while many of these civilizations may contain agents with value systems we have never thought about, some of these civilizations will also contain earth-like value systems. <br><br>It anyway seems plausible that our comparative advantage lies in helping those value systems about whom we can attain the most information. If we survey the values of people on earth, and perhaps also how much these values correlate with sympathies for the concept of superrationality and taking weird arguments to their logical conclusion, this already gives us highly useful information about the values of potential cooperators in the multiverse. MSR then implies&#xA0;strong cooperation with value systems that we already know (perhaps adjusted by the degree their proponents are receptive to MSR ideas). <br><br>By &#x201C;strong cooperation,&#x201D; I mean that one should ideally pick interventions based on considerations of personal comparative advantages: If there is a value system for which I could create an extraordinary amount of (variance-adjusted; see chapter 3 of <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf\">this dissertation</a> for an introduction) value given my talents and position in the world, I should perhaps exclusively focus on benefitting specifically that value system. Meta interventions that are positive for many value systems at once also receive a strong boost by MSR considerations and should plausibly be pursued at high effort even in case they do not come out as the top priority absent MSR considerations. (Examples for such interventions are e.g. making sure that any superintelligent AIs that are built can cooperate with other AIs, or that people who are uncertain about their values should not waste time with philosophy and instead try to benefit existing value systems MSR-style.) Finally, one should also look for more cooperative alternatives when considering interventions that, although positive for one&#x2019;s own value system, may in expectation cause harm to other value systems. <br><br>---<br><br><strong>Related announcement 1:</strong> Caspar Oesterheld, who has thought about MSR much more than I have, will be giving a talk on the topic at EAG London.

This essay is intended as a constructive exploration of the latter, to wit their definitions of solvability and neglectedness, and why I think they overweigh the importance of the latter.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>80K&#x2019;s framework</h1>\n<p>80K offer three factors which they think multiplied together give the value of contributing to an area. Here&#x2019;s the factors along with their definition of each:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scale (of the problem we&apos;re trying to solve) = Good done / % of the problem solved</p>\n<p>Solvability = % of the problem solved / % increase in resources</p>\n<p>Neglectedness = % increase in resources / extra person or $</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let&#x2019;s look at them in turn.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Scale</h1>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll skim over this one - for most problems the definition seems to capture decently what we think of as scale. That said, there is a class of issues to which - depending on how you interpret it - it&#x2019;s misleading or inapplicable. These are what I&#x2019;ll call &#x2018;clustered value problems&#x2019;: those where progress yields comparatively little or no &#x2018;good done&#x2019; until everything is tied together at the end.<sup><a href=\"#note-1\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Examples of this might be getting friendly AI research right, if any deviation from perfect programming might still generate a <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer\">paperclipper</a>, eliminating an infectious disease, or developing any important breakthrough technology (vaccines, cold fusion, mass produceable in vitro meat, a space elevator etc).</p>\n<p>In such cases it wouldn&#x2019;t make much sense to look only at the value of a &#x2018;% of the problem solved&#x2019; unless it was the <em>last</em> percentage (and then that would make it look disproportionately good).</p>\n<p>In such cases we should treat scale as &apos;good done / <em>average</em> % of the problem solved&apos;, distinguishing them from what I&#x2019;ll call &#x2018;distributed value problems&#x2019; (ie any that aren&#x2019;t clustered), where &#x2018;(marginal) % of the problem solved&#x2019; is the better metric (while noting that distributedness/clusteredness is really a spectrum).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>&#x2018;Solvability&#x2019; and Neglectedness</h1>\n<p>Solvability is clearly crucial in thinking about prioritising problems. Here&#x2019;s 80K&#x2019;s definition of it again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>% of the problem solved / % increase in resources</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And of neglectedness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>% increase in resources / extra person or $</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are, I think, three independently fatal problems that make these factors useless:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>As presented, &#x2018;solvability&#x2019; would imply that any problem that no-one has worked on is unsolvable, since it would require an infinite % increase in resources to make any progress (or rather, the value would just be undefined, since it&#x2019;s equivalent to a division by 0).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By making this all a nice cancellable equation, it makes the actual values of all but the first numerator (&#x2018;good done&#x2019;) and the last denominator (&#x2018;extra person or $&#x2019;) irrelevant (unless they happen to be 0/infinity, per above). This is really just the equation &#x2018;good done/extra person or $&#x2019; in fancy clothing, so the real world values of &#x2018;% of the problem solved&#x2019; and &#x2018;% increase in resources&#x2019; are no more pertinent to how much good per $ we&#x2019;ll do than the interloping factor would be in &#x2018;good done/dragons in Westeros * dragons in Westeros / extra person of $&#x2019;.</p>\n<p>Perhaps 80K didn&#x2019;t intend the framework to be taken too literally, but inasmuch as they use it at all, it seems reasonable to criticise it on its own terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intuitively, we can see how the real world value of the &#x2018;% of the problem solved&#x2019; factor might have a place in a revised equation - eg &#x2018;% of the problem solved/extra person or $&#x2019; (higher would obviously indicate more value from working on the problem, all else being equal). But &#x2018;&#x2018;% increase in resources&#x2019; has no such use, because it&#x2019;s a combination of two factors, (100 ) absolute contribution / resources already contributed to the problem, the latter of which is<em>&#xA0;totally irrelevant</em> to what we mean by &#x2018;solving a problem&#x2019; (and is also the source of the potential division by 0). Because it accounts for contributions of people before me, this factor can increase even if my actual contribution shrinks, and vice versa.<sup><a href=\"#note-2\">2</a></sup> So it can&#x2019;t be a reliable multiplier in any list of desirable traits for a high priority cause.</p>\n<p>By using &#x2018;% increase in resources&#x2019; as the denominator instead of &#x2018;absolute increase in resources&#x2019; I think 80K mean to capture the notion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns\">diminishing returns</a>. But diminishing returns in this regard is the hypothesis that the multiple people working on related areas of a potentially multifarious problem, often in competition with each other, will tend to achieve less than the people who worked on it before them. It&#x2019;s not a clear example of the economic notion since multiple factors are constantly changing within most cause areas (and the economic notion is about increasing a single variable), and even if it were it shouldn&#x2019;t be hard-coded into our very definition of problem-solving.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So although it doesn&#x2019;t fit into a nice cancellable equation, I think we need to model diminishing returns separately - and then check the plausibility of our model for our purposes. Before we think about that, let&#x2019;s quickly revisit clustered value problems.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><a></a>Clustered value problems</h2>\n<p>Because work on clustered value problems (by definition) yields the hypermajority of its value at the point where the last piece is placed in the jigsaw, diminishing returns are largely irrelevant. People might work on the easiest parts of the solution first, but assuming that a fixed number of work-hours - or at least a fixed amount of ingenuity - is necessary to reach the breakthrough, <em>someone</em> will have to plough through the hard stuff to the end, and the value of every resource contributed is equal throughout.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><a></a>Diminishing returns</h2>\n<p>So distributed value problems are the important case for diminishing returns, and I assume they are what the 80K piece is addressing.</p>\n<p>For them, a more plausible approach to marginal solvability, that captures diminishing marginal returns, follows from the following pair of claims: a) we can estimate the rate of diminishing returns D by looking at multiple points in the history of the project, comparing (% of problem problem solved / absolute resources spent) and selecting an appropriate function.<sup><a href=\"#note-3\">3</a></sup> Therefore... b) we&#xA0;could apply that function to the number of resources that have been used R to figure out the contribution of adding a marginal resource:</p>\n<p><em>Marginal contribution per resource</em> = ((R + 1)<sup>D</sup> &#x2013; R<sup>D</sup>)</p>\n<p>And we could now define marginal solvability per resource:</p>\n<p><em>Marginal solvability</em> = % of the problem solved / ((R + 1)<sup>D</sup> &#x2013; R<sup>D</sup>)</p>\n<p>On this definition, &#x2018;neglectedness&#x2019; (or rather, its inverse - heededness?) is just the value of R. And all else being equal, if these claims are true, then we can expect to solve a smaller % of a problem the higher the value of R.</p>\n<p>But these claims make two assumptions that we shouldn&#x2019;t take for granted:</p>\n<p>Diminishing returns will apply due to problem prioritisation: if each new resource added (approximately aka each new hire<sup><a href=\"#note-4\">4</a></sup>) within a cause has equivalent competence to those before them (where &apos;competence&apos; is a measure of &apos;ability to solve the problem to which the organisation applies itself, directly or indirectly), they will tend to achieve less than those recruited before them. Resources will be at best fungible: each new hire within a cause tends to have equivalent or lesser competence than those before them. More precisely, each dollar spent on a marginal hire tends to have equivalent or lesser value than the dollars spent on previous hires. That is, in the new marginal solvability equation, each individual would approximately contribute M marginal resources, where M is a constant.</p>\n<p>Looking at these in turn...</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a>Diminishing returns due to problem prioritisation</h3>\n</article>\n<article>\n<p>This seems like a workable approximation in many cases, but the extent to which it applies could vary enormously from cause to cause - sometimes it might even reverse. To the extent that an organisation is perfectly rational, its staff will be picking the lowest hanging fruit to work on, but here are possible caveats, eg (in very roughly ascending order of importance):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Economies of scale, which mean that even if a hire can&apos;t achieve as much as the hire before them, they might be sufficiently cheaper as to be equal or better value.</p>\n<p>Anticipating the value of economies of scale seems sufficiently difficult even from month to month that it&apos;s unlikely to be worth making life plans based on them. However, they might be relevant to someone investigating a new job rather than a new career &#x2013; or to someone investigating where to donate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>High risk roles. A new organisation might need to reliably produce results early on to justify its existence, but once established might be able to take on projects less likely to succeed, but with higher expectation. This could potentially happen in medium or even very large organisations, depending on the cost and risk of the new projects (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Philanthropy_Project\">Open Philanthropy Project</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_(company)\">Google X</a> are real-life examples of this).</p>\n<p>High-risk roles (distinct from individuals with high-risk strategies, who we&apos;ll come to shortly), are by their nature substantially rarer than normal-risk roles. They also might not require any particularly different skills from other direct work, so again they seem more relevant to people considering donating or changing jobs rather than deciding career paths.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Diminishing returns assumes that all factors except the number of resources you&#x2019;re adding stay constant. But the bigger the cause, the more variables within it will constantly be changing, so the less this will be the case. For example, new technologies are constantly emerging, many of which require specialist skills to use effectively, if only to see their potential - eg cheap satellites (and cheap orbital access for them) that allow rapid <a href=\"https://www.coolearth.org/forest-health/\">responses to deforestation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some groundwork - possibly a great deal of groundwork - might be required to determine what the low-hanging fruit are, or to make them pickable when they&#x2019;re identified. In such cases the actual value of working in a field might <em>increase</em> as such work is done.</p>\n<p>This could be a huge factor, especially given the relative novelty of RCTs and cost-benefit analysis. Even many purportedly saturated fields still have huge uncertainty around the best interventions. Also, as our social scientific tools improve we can reasonably hope to uncover high value interventions (ie low hanging fruit) we&#x2019;ve hitherto missed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most people aren&#x2019;t particularly perfectly rational altruists - and many of the incentives they face within their field won&#x2019;t be perfectly altruistic.</p>\n<p>Bizarrely, the nonrationality of people and organisations didn&#x2019;t even occur to me until draft 2 of this essay - and I suspect in many cases this is a very strong effect. If it weren&#x2019;t, there would be no need for an EA movement. Looking at Wikipedia&#x2019;s list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Animal_charities_based_in_the_United_Kingdom\">animal charities based in the UK</a>, for eg, I count 4 of 76 who appear to have a focus on factory farming, which most of us would consider by far the most important near-term cause within the area. I won&#x2019;t single out others for negative comment, and no doubt our specific views will vary widely, but I imagine most EAs would agree with me that the list bears little to no resemblance to an optimal allocation of animal-welfare-oriented resources. In some causes people are provably acting irrationally, since they&#x2019;re at directly crossing purposes - the climate change activists advocating nuclear power or geoengineering and those arguing against them can&#x2019;t all be acting rationally, for example.<sup><a href=\"#note-5\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>In some cases irrationality could increase the value of more rational people entering the field - eg by creating another RCT in a field that has plenty, or simply by creating the option for project managing or otherwise directing someone toward a more valuable area (this essentially seems to have been the situation which Givewell and Giving What We Can&#x2019;s founders walked into when they first founded the orgs). It might even <em>tend</em> to do so, if the latter interaction turned out to be a major factor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The more work fully solving the problem requires, the slower we would expect returns to diminish. The density of sub-problems of any given tractability will be thicker, so it will take more resources to get through the low-hanging fruit. There&#x2019;s just orders of magnitude more to do in eg creating a robust system of global governance than in eliminating schistosomiasis, so we would expect returns to diminish at a correspondingly fractional rate in the former.<sup><a href=\"#note-6\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>We should expect <em>a priori</em> that problem areas will tend to be larger the more people they have working on them. Smaller areas with several people working on them quickly cease to be problem areas, and recruitment for an area would probably slow &#x2013; if not reverse &#x2013; as less effective work there is left to be done within it diminishes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The hypothesis of diminishing returns due to problem prioritisation is ultimately an empirical claim, so shouldn&#x2019;t be assumed to hold within any given field without at least some checking against some plausible metrics.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a>Fungible marginal resources</h3>\n<p>As a sufficiently broad tendency, this is surely true. Just as a rational organisation would pick the lowest hanging fruit to work on, so they would aim to pick the lowest hanging fruit when considering each new staff hire. Nonetheless, there&#x2019;s one big problem with this assumption.</p>\n<p>Problems are disproportionately solved by small numbers of people doing abnormal things, rather than by throwing sufficient fungible resources at them &#x2013; ie the value of individual contributions follows a power law distribution.</p>\n<p>This can be due to a number of reasons both personal and circumstantial, that might not transfer across causes, thus an individual could offer far more to one cause area than another. This is a grandiose way of saying &#x2018;personal fit is very important&#x2019;, but I think this is a potentially massive factor, that can dwarf any diminishing returns, and means that - at least for direct work - we should think of cause-person pairings, rather than individual causes as our unit of investigation.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>The consequences of devaluing neglectedness</h1>\n<p>When I&#x2019;ve discussed whether the EA movement overemphasises neglectedness, one response I&#x2019;ve often heard is that it&#x2019;s really just a heuristic to help decide which causes to look into in the first place. I think there&#x2019;s some truth to that, especially for &#x2018;top&#x2019; EA areas - I certainly don&#x2019;t think, for example, that Givewell&#x2019;s recommendations for combating various neglected tropical diseases are based (even in significant fraction) on them being neglected, that ACE recommend factory farming campaigns because so few animal welfare charities address them, or that FHI are so concerned about AI because other academics weren&#x2019;t. These areas all seem to have reasonable independent arguments to recommend them.</p>\n<p>That said, this essay is partly a response to 80K&#x2019;s priorities framework, which explicitly describes neglectedness as a <em>core</em> part of their cause assessment. If they were ultimately just using it as a top-level heuristic, I would expect them to say as much, rather than rating it as a multiplier with equal weighting to scale and solvability.</p>\n<p>And, what worries me more is we can see neglectedness invoked explicitly to deter EAs from getting involved in causes that would otherwise seem very promising. This is clearest in 80K&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/\">climate change profile</a>, for example. In the &#x2018;overall view&#x2019;, they present the three components - &#x2018;scale&#x2019;, &#x2018;solvability&#x2019; and &#x2018;neglectedness&#x2019; as visual equals. And in the &#x2018;major arguments against working on it&#x2019; section they present info like &#x2018;the US government spends about $8 billion per year on direct climate change efforts&#x2019; as a negative <em>in itself</em>.</p>\n<p>It seems very strange to me to imagine this as a strong deterrent. Effective altruists often compare commercial thinking favourably with the ways we think about doing good<sup><a href=\"#note-7\">7</a></sup> - but it would be very strange to imagine an entrepreneur thinking that a large injection of cash into an area was a reason <em>not</em> to go into it.</p>\n<p>80K&#x2019;s profile on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/\">nuclear security</a> similarly discounts its value in part due to it being &#x2018;likely less neglected than other problems&#x2019;. And so on in their <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/biosecurity/\">biosecurity</a>, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/health-in-poor-countries/\">global health</a> and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/tobacco/\">anti-smoking</a> profiles.</p>\n<p>And anecdata-ly, as someone concerned that climate change might be a much more pressing issue than EAs typically credit, I&#x2019;ve repeatedly had conversations with people who dismiss it as a cause with only some variation of the phrase &#x2018;well, it&#x2019;s not very neglected&#x2019;.</p>\n<p>We should change this type of thinking.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"#ref-1\">1</a>. Throughout this essay, you should take it as read that by any change to a value I mean &#x2018;counterfactually adjusted expected change, all else being equal&#x2019;. <a href=\"#ref-1\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#ref-2\">2</a>. For example, if I give $100 to AMF and $100 000 had been given before mine, my % increase in resources would be 0.1 - but if I gave $200 and $1 000 000 had been given before mine, it would be only 0.02.</p>\n<p>When I showed 80K an early draft of this essay, they pointed out that the original solvability factor, &#x2018;% of the problem solved / % increase in resources&#x2019; is really <a href=\"http://www.sparknotes.com/economics/micro/elasticity/section1.rhtml\">elasticity</a> of solvability, and thought that anyone who noticed the problem above would have recognised that. But since my criticisms are of the components of the factor, I don&#x2019;t see how relabelling it would matter. <a href=\"#ref-2\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#ref-3\">3</a>. This is easier said than done, and I won&#x2019;t attempt it here. In <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/defining-returns-functions-and-funding-gaps/\">Defining Returns Functions and Funding Gaps</a>, Max Dalton looks at a few possible categories of model for the slope of diminishing returns, and in the <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/selecting-the-appropriate-model-for-diminishing-returns/\">follow up</a> he and Owen Cotton-Barrett give some reasons for choosing between them. I suspect in some fields someone clever enough could throw the huge amounts of data on resources spent and outcomes generated at a machine learnination program and get some surprisingly cogent output. If it were possible to do so for whole cause areas, it could yield huge insights into cause prioritisation. <a href=\"#ref-3\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#ref-4\">4</a>. In general this essay discusses individuals working for organisations (which we can extrapolate to individuals working on cause areas), but virtually identical reasoning could extend to organisations if there were any particularly irreplaceable/irreducible ones. Ie if you replaced all phrases like &#x2018;person hired at an organisation&#x2019; with &#x2018;organisation founded to work on a cause&#x2019;, the argument would be essentially the same.</p>\n<p>Throughout the essay I tend to treat individuals as unitary, to be either added to or subtracted from a cause as a whole, but this is for convenience and not strictly accurate. For people it&#x2019;s a decent approximation: people&#x2019;s work hours (especially effective altruists&#x2019;) will rarely diverge by more than a factor of two.</p>\n<p>For organisations, it would be more important to account for the difference, since one can be orders of magnitude larger than another. <a href=\"#ref-4\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#ref-5\">5</a>. HT Goodwin Gibbins for these examples. There has been political advocacy both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2\">to promote it</a>, in it order to mitigate the effects, and <a href=\"http://www.geoengineeringmonitor.org/reasons-to-oppose/\">to prevent it</a> because of fears that it will reduce the political will to solve climate change or risk even worse harm. Nuclear power clashes are so ubiquitous they have their own Wikipedia pages: in the red corner, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement</a>, in the blue corner, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-nuclear_movement\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-nuclear_movement</a>.</p>\n<p>On 80K&#x2019;s current definition, even if all this adverse advocacy had perfectly cancelled itself it out, the problem of climate change would have become more solvable and, in broader EA parlance, less neglected. <a href=\"#ref-5\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#ref-6\">6</a>. This is closely related to Givewell&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria/room-for-more-funding\">room for more funding</a> metric, which I&#x2019;ve heard people equate with the idea of neglectedness, but which is functionally quite different. <a href=\"#ref-6\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#ref-7\">7</a>.

If they&#x2019;ve dealt generously with you in the past, perhaps you ought to offer them more. This is the only instinctive notion people start with for what a price could mean: a personal interaction between Alice and Bob reflecting past friendships and a balance of social judgments.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the economic notion of a market price is that for every loaf of bread bought, there is a loaf of bread sold; and therefore actual demand and actual supply are always equal. The market price is the input that makes the decreasing curve for demand as a function of price meet the increasing curve for supply as a function of price. This price is an &#x201C;is&#x201D; statement rather than an &#x201C;ought&#x201D; statement, an observation and not a wish.</p>\n<p>In particular, an efficient market, from an economist&#x2019;s perspective, is just one whose average price movement can&#x2019;t be predicted by you.</p>\n<p>If that way of putting it sounds odd, consider an analogy. Suppose you asked a well-designed superintelligent AI system to estimate how many hydrogen atoms are in the Sun. You don&#x2019;t expect the superintelligence to produce an answer that is <em>exactly right</em> down to the last atom, because this would require measuring the mass of the Sun more finely than any measuring instrument you expect it to possess. At the same time, it would be very odd for you to say, &#x201C;Well, I think the superintelligence will underestimate the number of atoms in the Sun by 10%, because hydrogen atoms are very light and the AI system might not take that into account.&#x201D; Yes, hydrogen atoms are light, but the AI system knows that too. Any reason you can devise for how a superintelligence could underestimate the amount of hydrogen in the Sun is a possibility that the superintelligence can also see and take into account. So while you don&#x2019;t expect the system to get the answer exactly right, you don&#x2019;t expect that you <em>yourself</em> will be able to predict the <em>average value</em> of the error&#x2014;to predict that the system will underestimate the amount by 10%, for example.</p>\n<p>This is the property that an economist thinks an &#x201C;efficient&#x201D; price has. An efficient price can update sharply: the company can do worse or better than expected, and the stock can move sharply up or down on the news. In some cases, you can rationally expect volatility; you can predict that good news might arrive tomorrow and make the stock go up, balanced by a counter-possibility that the news will fail to arrive and the stock will go down. You could think the stock is 30% likely to rise by $10 and 20% likely to drop by $15 and 50% likely to stay the same. But you can&#x2019;t predict in advance the <em>average value</em> by which the price will change, which is what it would take to make an expected profit by buying the stock or short-selling it.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2-definition\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>When an economist says that a market price is efficient over a two-year time horizon, they mean: &#x201C;The current price that balances the supply and demand of this financial instrument well reflects all public information affecting a boundedly rational estimate of the future supply-demand balancing point of this financial instrument in two years.&#x201D; They&#x2019;re relating the present intersection of these two curves to an idealized cognitive estimate of the curves&#x2019; future intersection.</p>\n<p>But this is a long sentence in the language of a hunter-gatherer. If somebody doesn&#x2019;t have all the terms of that sentence precompiled in their head, then they&#x2019;re likely to interpret the sentence in the idiom of ordinary human life and ordinary human relationships.</p>\n<p>People have an innate understanding of &#x201C;true&#x201D; in the sense of a map that reflects the territory, and they can imagine processes that produce good maps; but probability and microeconomics are less intuitive.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3-definition\">3</a></sup> What people hear when you talk about &#x201C;efficient prices&#x201D; is that a cold-blooded machine has determined that some people ought to be paid $9/hour. And they hear the economist saying nice things about the machine, praising it as &#x201C;efficient,&#x201D; implying that the machine is <em>right</em> about this $9/hour price being good for society, that this price well reflects what someone&#x2019;s efforts are justly worth. They hear you agreeing with this pitiless machine&#x2019;s judgment about how the intuitive web of obligations and incentives and reputation ought properly to cash out for a human interaction.</p>\n<p>And in the domain of stocks, when stock prices are observed to swing widely, this intuitive view says that the market can&#x2019;t be that smart after all. For if it were smart, would it keep turning out to be &#x201C;wrong&#x201D; and need to change its mind?</p>\n<p>I once read a rather clueless magazine article that made fun of a political prediction market on the basis that when a new poll came out, the price of the prediction market moved. &#x201C;It just tracks the polls!&#x201D; the author proclaimed. But the point of the prediction market is not that it knows some fixed, objective chance with high accuracy. The point of a prediction market is that it summarizes all the information available to the market participants. If the poll moved prices, then the poll was new information that the market thought was important, and the market updated its belief, and this is just the way things should be.</p>\n<p>In a liquid market, &#x201C;price moves whose average direction you can predict in advance&#x201D; correspond to both &#x201C;places you can make a profit&#x201D; and &#x201C;places where you know better than the market.&#x201D; A market that knows everything you know is a market where prices are &#x201C;efficient&#x201D; in the conventional economic sense&#x2014;one where you can&#x2019;t predict the net direction in which the price will change.</p>\n<p>This means that the efficiency of a market is assessed relative to your own intelligence, which is fine. Indeed, it&#x2019;s possible that the concept should be called &#x201C;relative efficiency.&#x201D; Yes, a superintelligence might be able to predict price trends that no modern human hedge fund manager could; but economists don&#x2019;t think that today&#x2019;s markets are efficient relative to a superintelligence.</p>\n<p>Today&#x2019;s markets may not be efficient relative to the smartest hedge fund managers, or efficient relative to corporate insiders with secret knowledge that hasn&#x2019;t yet leaked. But the stock markets are efficient relative to you, and to me, and to your Uncle Albert who thinks he tripled his money through his incredible acumen in buying NetBet.com.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>ii.</h2>\n<p>Not everything that involves a financial price is efficient. There was recently a startup called Color Labs, aka Color.com, whose putative purpose was to let people share photos with their friends and see other photos that had been taken nearby. They closed $41 million in funding, including $20 million from the prestigious Sequoia Capital.</p>\n<p>When the news of their funding broke, practically everyone on the online Hacker News forum was rolling their eyes and predicting failure. It seemed like a nitwit me-too idea to me too. And then, yes, Color Labs failed and the 20-person team sold themselves to Apple for $7 million and the venture capitalists didn&#x2019;t make back their money. And yes, it sounds to me like the prestigious Sequoia Capital bought into the wrong startup.</p>\n<p>If that&#x2019;s all true, it&#x2019;s not a coincidence that neither I nor any of the other onlookers could make money on our advance prediction. The startup equity market was <em>inefficient</em> (a price underwent a predictable decline), but it wasn&#x2019;t <em>exploitable</em>.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4-definition\">4</a></sup> There was no way to make a profit just by predicting that Sequoia had overpaid for the stock it bought. Because, at least as of 2017, the market lacks a certain type and direction of liquidity: you can&#x2019;t short-sell startup equity.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5-definition\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>What about houses? Millions of residential houses change hands every year, and they cost more than stock shares. If we expect the stock market to be well-priced, shouldn&#x2019;t we expect the same of houses?</p>\n<p>The answer is &#x201C;no,&#x201D; because you can&#x2019;t short-sell a house. Sure, there are some ways to bet against aggregate housing markets, like shorting real estate investment trusts or home manufacturers. But in the end, hedge fund managers can&#x2019;t make a synthetic financial instrument that behaves just like the house on 6702 West St. and sell it into the same housing market frequented by consumers like you. Which is why you might do very well to think for yourself about whether the price seems sensible to you before buying a house: because you might know better than the market price, even as a non-specialist relying only on publicly available information.</p>\n<p>Let&#x2019;s imagine there are 100,000 houses in Boomville, of which 10,000 have been for sale in the last year or so. Suppose there are 20,000 fools who think that housing prices in Boomville can only go up, and 10,000 rational hedge fund managers who think that the shale-oil business may collapse and lead to a predictable decline in Boomville house prices. There&#x2019;s no way for the hedge fund managers to short Boomville house prices&#x2014;not in a way that satisfies the optimistic demand of 20,000 fools for Boomville houses, not in a way that causes house prices to actually decline. The 20,000 fools just bid on the 10,000 available houses until the skyrocketing price of the houses makes 10,000 of the fools give up.</p>\n<p>Some smarter agents might decline to buy, and so somewhat reduce demand. But the smarter agents can&#x2019;t actually visit Boomville and make hundreds of thousands of dollars off of the overpriced houses. The price <em>is</em> too high and <em>will</em> predictably decline, relative to public information, but there&#x2019;s no way you can make a profit on knowing that. An individual who owns an existing house can exploit the inefficiency by selling that house, but rational market actors can&#x2019;t crowd around the inefficiency and exploit it until it&#x2019;s all gone.</p>\n<p>Whereas a predictably <em>underpriced</em> house, put on the market for predictably much less than its future price, would be an asset that any of a hundred thousand rational investors could come in and snap up.</p>\n<p>So a frothy housing market may see many overpriced houses, but few underpriced ones.</p>\n<p>Thus it will be easy to lose money in this market by buying stupidly, and much harder to make money by buying cleverly. The market prices will be <em>inefficient</em>&#x2014;in a certain sense stupid&#x2014;but they will not be <em>exploitable</em>.</p>\n<p>In contrast, in a thickly traded market where it is easy to short an overpriced asset, prices will be efficient in both directions, and any day is as good a day to buy as any other. You may end up exposed to excess <em>volatility</em> (an asset with a 50% chance of doubling and a 50% chance of going bankrupt, for example), but you won&#x2019;t actually have bought anything overpriced&#x2014;if it were predictably overpriced, it would have been short-sold.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6-definition\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>We can see the notion of an inexploitable market as generalizing the notion of an efficient market as follows: in both cases, <em>there&#x2019;s no free energy inside the system</em>. In both markets, there&#x2019;s a horde of hungry organisms moving around trying to eat up all the free energy. In the efficient market, <em>every predictable price change corresponds to free energy</em> (easy money) and so the equilibrium where hungry organisms have eaten all the free energy corresponds to an equilibrium of no predictable price changes. In a merely inexploitable market, there are predictable price changes that don&#x2019;t correspond to free energy, like an overpriced house that will decline later, and so the no-free-energy equilibrium can still involve predictable price changes.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7-definition\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>Our ability to say, within the context of the general theory of &#x201C;efficient markets,&#x201D; that houses in Boomville may still be overpriced&#x2014;and, additionally, to say that they are much less likely to be underpriced&#x2014;is what makes this style of reasoning powerful. It doesn&#x2019;t just say, &#x201C;Prices are usually right when lots of money is flowing.&#x201D; It gives us detailed conditions for when we should and shouldn&#x2019;t expect efficiency. There&#x2019;s an underlying logic about powerfully smart organisms, any single one of which can consume free energy if it is available in worthwhile quantities, in a way that produces a global equilibrium of no free energy; and if one of the premises is invalidated, we get a different prediction.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iii.</h2>\n<p>At one point during the 2016 presidential election, the PredictIt prediction market&#x2014;the only one legally open to US citizens (and only US citizens)&#x2014;had Hillary Clinton at a 60% probability of winning the general election. The bigger, international prediction market BetFair had Clinton at 80% at that time.</p>\n<p>So I looked into buying Clinton shares on PredictIt&#x2014;but discovered, alas, that PredictIt charged a 10% fee on profits, a 5% fee on withdrawals, had an $850 limit per contract bet&#x2026; and on top of all that, I&#x2019;d also have to pay 28% federal and 9.3% state income taxes on any gains. Which, in sum, meant I wouldn&#x2019;t be getting much more than $30 in expected return for the time and hassle of buying the contracts.</p>\n<p>Oh, if only PredictIt didn&#x2019;t charge that 10% fee on profits, that 5% fee on withdrawals! If only they didn&#x2019;t have the $850 limit! If only the US didn&#x2019;t have such high income taxes, and didn&apos;t limit participation in overseas prediction markets! I could have bought Clinton shares at 60 cents on PredictIt and Trump shares at 20 cents on Betfair, winning a dollar either way and getting a near-guaranteed 25% return until the prices were in line! Curse those silly rules, preventing me from picking up that free money!</p>\n<p>Does that complaint sound reasonable to you?</p>\n<p>If so, then you haven&#x2019;t yet fully internalized the notion of an inefficient-but-inexploitable market.</p>\n<p>If the taxes, fees, and betting limits hadn&#x2019;t been there, the PredictIt and BetFair prices would have been the same.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iv.</h2>\n<p>Suppose it were the case that some cases of Seasonal Affective Disorder proved resistant to sitting in front of a 10,000-lux lightbox for 30 minutes (the standard treatment), but would nonetheless respond if you bought 130 or so 60-watt-equivalent high-CRI LED bulbs, in a mix of 5000K and 2700K color temperatures, and strung them up over your two-bedroom apartment.</p>\n<p>Would you expect that, supposing this were true, there would already exist a journal report somewhere on it?</p>\n<p>Would you expect that, supposing this were true, it would already be widely discussed (or at least rumored) on the Internet?</p>\n<p>Would you expect that, supposing this were true, doctors would already know about it and it would be on standard medical pages about Seasonal Affective Disorder?</p>\n<p>And would you, failing to observe anything on the subject after a couple of hours of Googling, conclude that your civilization must have some unknown good reason why not everyone was doing this already?</p>\n<p>To answer a question like this, we need an analysis not of the world&#x2019;s efficiency or inexploitability but rather of its <em>adequacy</em>&#x2014;whether all the low-hanging fruit have been plucked.</p>\n<p>A duly modest skepticism, translated into the terms we&#x2019;ve been using so far, might say something like this: &#x201C;Around 7% of the population has severe Seasonal Affective Disorder, and another 20% or so has weak Seasonal Affective Disorder. Around 50% of tested cases respond to standard lightboxes. So if the intervention of stringing up a hundred LED bulbs actually worked, it could provide a major improvement to the lives of 3% of the US population, costing on the order of $1000 each (without economies of scale). Many of those 9 million US citizens would be rich enough to afford that as a treatment for major winter depression. If you could prove that your system worked, you could create a company to sell SAD-grade lighting systems and have a large market. So by postulating that you can cure SAD this way, you&#x2019;re postulating a world in which there&#x2019;s a huge quantity of metaphorical free energy&#x2014;a big energy gradient that society hasn&#x2019;t traversed. Therefore, I&#x2019;m skeptical of this medical theory for more or less the same reason that I&#x2019;m skeptical you can make money on the stock market: it postulates a $20 bill lying around that nobody has already picked up.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>So the distinction is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: &#x201C;Microsoft&#x2019;s stock price is neither too low nor too high, relative to anything <em>you</em> can possibly know about Microsoft&#x2019;s stock price.&#x201D;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inexploitability</strong>: &#x201C;Some houses and housing markets are overpriced, but you can&#x2019;t make a profit by short-selling them, and you&#x2019;re unlikely to find any substantially <em>underpriced</em> houses&#x2014;the market as a whole isn&#x2019;t rational, but it contains participants who have money and understand housing markets as well as you do.&#x201D;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Adequacy</strong>: &#x201C;Okay, the medical sector is a wildly crazy place where different interventions have orders-of-magnitude differences in cost-effectiveness, but at least there&#x2019;s no well-known but unused way to save <em>ten thousand lives for just ten dollars each</em>, right? <em>Somebody</em> would have picked up on it! Right?!&#x201D;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#x2019;s say that within some slice through society, the obvious low-hanging fruit that save <em>more</em> than ten thousand lives for less than a hundred thousand dollars total have, in fact, been picked up. Then I propose the following terminology: let us say that that part of society is <em>adequate</em> at saving 10,000 lives for $100,000.</p>\n<p>And if there&#x2019;s a convincing case that this property does not hold, we&#x2019;ll say this subsector is <em>inadequate</em> (at saving 10,000 lives for $100,000).</p>\n<p>To see how an inadequate equilibrium might arise, let&#x2019;s start by focusing on one tiny subfactor of the human system, namely academic research.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ll even further oversimplify our model of academia and pretend that research is a two-factor system containing <em>academics</em> and <em>grantmakers</em>, and that a project can only happen if there&#x2019;s both a participating academic and a participating grantmaker.</p>\n<p>We next suppose that in some academic field, there exists a population of researchers who are individually eager and collectively opportunistic for publications&#x2014;papers accepted to journals, especially high-impact journal publications that constitute strong progress toward tenure. For any clearly visible opportunity to get a sufficiently large number of citations with a small enough amount of work, there are collectively enough academics in this field that somebody will snap up the opportunity. We could say, to make the example more precise, that the field is collectively opportunistic in 2 citations per workday&#x2014;if there&#x2019;s any clearly visible opportunity to do 40 days of work and get 80 citations, somebody in the field will go for it.</p>\n<p>This level of opportunism might be much more than the average paper gets in citations per day of work. Maybe the average is more like 10 citations per year of work, and lots of researchers work for a year on a paper that ends up garnering only 3 citations. We&#x2019;re not trying to ask about the <em>average</em> price of a citation; we&#x2019;re trying to ask how cheap a citation has to be before <em>somebody somewhere</em> is virtually <em>guaranteed</em> to try for it.</p>\n<p>But academic paper-writers are only half the equation; the other half is a population of grantmakers.</p>\n<p>In this model, can we suppose for argument&#x2019;s sake that grantmakers are motivated by the pure love of all sentient life, and yet we still end up with an academic system that is <em>inadequate</em>?</p>\n<p>I might naively reply: &#x201C;Sure. Let&#x2019;s say that those selfish academics are collectively opportunistic at two citations per workday, and the blameless and benevolent grantmakers are collectively opportunistic at one quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) per $100.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-8-definition\">8</a></sup> Then everything which produces one QALY per $100 <em>and</em> two citations per workday gets funded. Which means there could be an obvious, clearly visible project that would produce a thousand QALYs per dollar, and so long as it doesn&#x2019;t produce enough citations, nobody will work on it. That&#x2019;s what the model says, right?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Ah, but this model has a <em>fragile</em> equilibrium of inadequacy. It only takes one researcher who is opportunistic in QALYs and willing to take a hit in citations to snatch up the biggest, lowest-hanging altruistic fruit if there&#x2019;s a population of grantmakers eager to fund projects like that.</p>\n<p>Assume the most altruistically neglected project produces 1,000 QALYs per dollar. If we add a single rational and altruistic researcher to this model, then they will work on that project, whereupon the equilibrium will be adequate at 1,000 QALYs per dollar. If there are two rational and altruistic researchers, the second one to arrive will start work on the next-most-neglected project&#x2014;say, a project that has 500 QALYs/$ but wouldn&#x2019;t garner enough citations for whatever reason&#x2014;and then the field will be adequate at 500 QALYs/$. As this free energy gets eaten up (it&#x2019;s tasty energy from the perspective of an altruist eager for QALYs), the whole field becomes less inadequate in the relevant respect.</p>\n<p>But this assumes the grantmakers are eager to fund highly efficient QALY-increasing projects.</p>\n<p>Suppose instead that the grantmakers are <em>not</em> cause-neutral scope-sensitive effective altruists assessing QALYs/$. Suppose that most grantmakers pursue, say, <em>prestige per dollar</em>. (Robin Hanson offers an elementary argument that most grantmaking to academia is about prestige.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-9-definition\">9</a></sup> In any case, we can provisionally assume the prestige model for purposes of this toy example.)</p>\n<p>From the perspective of most grantmakers, the ideal grant is one that gets their individual name, or their boss&#x2019;s name, or their organization&#x2019;s name, in newspapers around the world in close vicinity to phrases like &#x201C;Stephen Hawking&#x201D; or &#x201C;Harvard professor.&#x201D; Let&#x2019;s say for the purpose of this thought experiment that the population of grantmakers is collectively opportunistic in 20 microHawkings per dollar, such that at least one of them will definitely jump on any clearly visible opportunity to affiliate themselves with Stephen Hawking for $50,000. Then at equilibrium, everything that provides at least 2 citations per workday <em>and</em> 20 microHawkings per dollar will get done.</p>\n<p>This doesn&#x2019;t quite follow logically, because the stock market is far more efficient at matching bids between buyers and sellers than academia is at matching researchers to grantmakers. (It&#x2019;s not like anyone in our civilization has put as much effort into rationalizing the academic matching process as, say, OkCupid has put into their software for hooking up dates. It&#x2019;s not like anyone who did produce this public good would get paid more than they could have made as a Google programmer.)</p>\n<p>But even if the argument is still missing some pieces, you can see the general shape of this style of analysis. If a piece of research will clearly visibly yield lots of citations with a reasonable amount of labor, and make the grantmakers on the committee look good for not too much money committed, then a researcher eager to do it can probably find a grantmaker eager to fund it.</p>\n<p>But what if there&#x2019;s some intervention which could save 100 QALYs/$, yet produces neither great citations nor great prestige? Then if we add a few altruistic researchers to the model, they probably won&#x2019;t be able to find a grantmaker to fund it; and if we add a few altruistic grantmakers to the model, they probably won&#x2019;t be able to find a qualified researcher to work on it.</p>\n<p>One systemic problem can often be overcome by one altruist in the right place. <em>Two</em> systemic problems are another matter entirely.</p>\n<p>Usually when we find trillion-dollar bills lying on the ground in real life, it&#x2019;s a symptom of (1) a central-command bottleneck that nobody else is allowed to fix, as with the European Central Bank wrecking Europe, or (2) a system with enough moving parts that <em>at least two parts are simultaneously broken</em>, meaning that <em>single actors cannot defy the system</em>. To modify an old aphorism: usually, when things suck, it&#x2019;s because they suck in a way that&#x2019;s a Nash equilibrium.</p>\n<p>In the same way that <em>inefficient</em> markets tend systematically to be <em>inexploitable</em>, grossly <em>inadequate</em> systems tend systematically to be <em>unfixable</em> by individual non-billionaires.</p>\n<p>But then you can sometimes still insert a wedge for yourself, even if you can&#x2019;t save the whole system. Something that&#x2019;s systemically hard to fix for the whole planet is sometimes possible to fix in your own two-bedroom apartment. So inadequacy is even more important than exploitability on a day-to-day basis, because it&#x2019;s inadequacy-generating situations that lead to low-hanging fruits large enough to be worthwhile at the individual level.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>v.</h2>\n<p>A critical analogy between an inadequate system and an efficient market is this: even systems that are horribly inadequate from our own perspective <em>are still in a competitive equilibrium</em>. There&#x2019;s still an equilibrium of incentives, an equilibrium of supply and demand, an equilibrium where (in the central example above) all the researchers are vigorously competing for prestigious publications and using up all available grant money in the course of doing so. There&#x2019;s no free energy anywhere in the system.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve seen a number of novice rationalists committing what I shall term the Free Energy Fallacy, which is something along the lines of, &#x201C;This system&#x2019;s purpose is supposed to be to cook omelettes, and yet it produces terrible omelettes. So why don&#x2019;t I use my amazing skills to cook some better omelettes and take over?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>And generally the answer is that maybe the system from <em>your</em> perspective is broken, but everyone within the system is intensely competing along <em>other</em> dimensions and you can&#x2019;t keep up with that competition. They&#x2019;re all chasing whatever things people in that system actually pursue&#x2014;instead of the lost purposes they wistfully remember, but don&#x2019;t have a chance to pursue because it would be career suicide. You won&#x2019;t become competitive along those dimensions just by cooking better omelettes.</p>\n<p>No researcher has any spare attention to give your improved omelette-cooking idea because they are already using all of their labor to try to get publications into high-impact journals; they have no free work hours.</p>\n<p>The journals won&#x2019;t take your omelette-cooking paper because they get <em>lots</em> of attempted submissions that they screen, for example, by looking for whether the researcher is from a high-prestige institution or whether the paper is written in a style that makes it look technically difficult. Being good at cooking omelettes doesn&#x2019;t make you the <em>best</em> competitor at writing papers to appeal to prestigious journals&#x2014;any publication slot would have to be given to you rather than someone else who is intensely trying to get it. Your good omelette technique might be a <em>bonus</em>, but only if you were already doing everything else right (which you&#x2019;re not).</p>\n<p>The grantmakers have no free money to give you to run your omelette-cooking experiment, because there are thousands of researchers competing for their money, and you are not competitive at convincing grantmaking committees that you&#x2019;re a safe, reputable, prestigious option. Maybe they feel wistfully fond of the ideal of better omelettes, but it would be career suicide for them to give money to the wrong person because of that.</p>\n<p>What inadequate systems and efficient markets have in common is the lack of any free energy in the equilibrium. We can see the equilibrium in both cases as <em>defined</em> by an absence of free energy. In an efficient market, any predictable price change corresponds to free energy, so thousands of hungry organisms trying to eat the free energy produce a lack of predictable price changes. In a system like academia, the competition for free energy may not correspond to anything good from your own standpoint, and as a result you may label the outcome &#x201C;inadequate&#x201D;; but there is still no free energy. Trying to feed <em>within</em> the system, or do anything within the system that uses a resource the other competing organisms want&#x2014;money, publication space, prestige, attention&#x2014;will generally be as hard for you as it is for any other organism.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if the system gave priority to rewarding better performance along the most useful or socially beneficial dimensions over all competing ways of feeding, the system wouldn&#x2019;t be inadequate in the first place. It&#x2019;s like wishing PredictIt didn&#x2019;t have fees and betting limits so that you could snap up those mispriced contracts.</p>\n<p>In a way, it&#x2019;s this very lack of free energy, this intense competition without space to draw a breath, that keeps the inadequacy around and makes it non-fragile. In the case of US science, there was a brief period after World War II where there was new funding coming in faster than universities could create new grad students, and scientists had a chance to pursue ideas that they liked. Today Malthus has reasserted himself, and it&#x2019;s no longer generally feasible for people to achieve career success while going off and just pursuing the research they most enjoy, or just going off and pursuing the research with the largest altruistic benefits. For any actor to do the best thing from an altruistic standpoint, they&#x2019;d need to ignore all of the system&#x2019;s internal incentives pointing somewhere else, and there&#x2019;s no free energy in the system to feed someone who does that.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-10-definition\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>vi.</h2>\n<p>Since the idea of civilizational adequacy seems fairly useful and general, I initially wondered whether it might be a known idea (under some other name) in economics textbooks. But my friend Robin Hanson, a professional economist at an academic institution well-known for its economists, has written a lot of material that I see (from this theoretical perspective) as doing backwards reasoning from inadequacy to incentives.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-11-definition\">11</a></sup> If there were a widespread economic notion of adequacy that he were invoking, or standard models of academic incentives and academic inadequacy, I would expect him to cite them.</p>\n<p>Now look at the above paragraph. Can you spot the two <em>implicit</em> arguments from adequacy?</p>\n<p>The first sentence says, &#x201C;To the extent that this way of generalizing the notion of an efficient market is conceptually useful, we should expect the field of economics to have been <em>adequate</em> to have already explored it in papers, and adequate at the task of disseminating the resulting knowledge to the point where my economist friends would be familiar with it.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The second and third sentences say, &#x201C;If something like inadequacy analysis were already a well-known idea in economics, then I would expect my smart economist friend Robin Hanson to cite it. Even if Robin started out not knowing, I expect his other economist friends would tell him, or that one of the many economists reading his blog would comment on it. I expect the population of economists reading Robin&#x2019;s blog and papers to be <em>adequate</em> to the task of telling Robin about an existing field here, if one already existed.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Adequacy arguments are <em>ubiquitous</em>, and they&#x2019;re much more common in everyday reasoning than arguments about efficiency or exploitability.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>vii.</h2>\n<p>Returning to that business of stringing up 130 light bulbs around the house to treat my wife&#x2019;s Seasonal Affective Disorder:</p>\n<p>Before I started, I tried to Google whether anyone had given &#x201C;put up a ton of high-quality lights&#x201D; a shot as a treatment for resistant SAD, and didn&#x2019;t find anything. Whereupon I shrugged, and started putting up LED bulbs.</p>\n<p>Observing these choices of mine, we can infer that my inadequacy analysis was something like this: First, I did spend a fair amount of time Googling, and tried harder after the first search terms failed. This implies I started out thinking my civilization might have been adequate to think of the <em>more light</em> treatment and test it.</p>\n<p>Then when I didn&#x2019;t find anything on Google, I went ahead and tested the idea myself, at considerable expense. I <em>didn&#x2019;t</em> assign such a high probability to &#x201C;if this is a good idea, people will have tested it and propagated it to the point where I could find it&#x201D; that in the absence of Google results, I could infer that the idea was bad.</p>\n<p>I initially tried ordering the cheapest LED lights from Hong Kong that I could find on eBay. I didn&#x2019;t feel like I could rely on the US lighting market to equalize prices with Hong Kong, and so I wasn&#x2019;t confident that the premium price for US LED bulbs represented a quality difference. But when the cheap lights finally arrived from Hong Kong, they were dim, inefficient, and of visibly low color quality. So I decided to buy the more expensive US light bulbs for my next design iteration.</p>\n<p>That is: I tried to save money based on a possible local inefficiency, but it turned out not to be inefficient, or at least not inefficient enough to be easily exploited by me. So I updated on that observation, discarded my previous belief, and changed my behavior.</p>\n<p>Sometime after putting up the first 100 light bulbs or so, I was working on an earlier draft of this chapter and therefore reflecting more intensively on my process than I usually do. It occurred to me that sometimes the best academic content isn&#x2019;t online <em>and</em> that it might not be expensive to test that. So I ordered a used $6 edited volume on Seasonal Affective Disorder, in case my Google-fu had failed me, hoping that a standard collection of papers would mention a light-intensity response curve that went past &#x201C;standard lightbox.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Well, I&#x2019;ve flipped through that volume, and so far it doesn&#x2019;t seem to contain any account of anyone having ever tried to cure resistant SAD using <em>more light</em>, either substantially higher-intensity or substantially higher-duration. I didn&#x2019;t find any table of response curves to light levels above 10,000 lux, or any experiments with all-day artificial light levels comparable to my apartment&#x2019;s roughly 2,000-lux luminance.</p>\n<p>I say this to emphasize that I didn&#x2019;t lock myself into my attempted reasoning about adequacy when I realized it would cost $6 to perform a further observational check. And to be clear, ordering one book still isn&#x2019;t a strong check. It wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me in the least to learn that at least one researcher somewhere on Earth had tested the obvious thought of <em>more light</em> and published the response curve. But I&#x2019;d also hesitate to bet at odds very far from 1:1 in either direction.</p>\n<p>And the higher-intensity light therapy does seems to have mostly cured Brienne&#x2019;s SAD. It wasn&#x2019;t cheap, but it was cheaper than sending her to Chile for 4 months.</p>\n<p>If <em>more light</em> really is a simple and effective treatment for a large percentage of otherwise resistant patients, is it truly plausible that no academic researcher out there has ever conducted the first investigation to cross my own mind? &#x201C;Well, since the Sun itself clearly does work, let&#x2019;s try <em>more light</em> throughout the <em>whole house</em>&#x2014;never mind these dinky lightboxes or 30-minute exposure times&#x2014;and then just keep adding more light until it frickin&#x2019; works.&#x201D; Is that really so non-obvious? With so many people around the world suffering from severe or subclinical SAD that resists lightboxes, with whole <em>countries</em> in the far North or South where the syndrome is common, could that experiment really have never been tried in a formal research setting?</p>\n<p>On my model of the world? Sure.</p>\n<p>Am I running out and trying to get a SAD researcher interested in my anecdotal data? No, because when something like this doesn&#x2019;t get done, there&#x2019;s usually a deeper reason than &#x201C;nobody thought of it.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Even if nobody <em>did</em> think of it, that says something about a lack of incentives to be creative. If academics expected working solutions to SAD to be rewarded, there would already be a much larger body of literature on weird things researchers had tried, not just lightbox variant after lightbox variant. Inadequate systems tend systematically to be systemically unfixable; I don&#x2019;t know the exact details in this case, but there&#x2019;s probably something somewhere.</p>\n<p>So I don&#x2019;t expect to get rich or famous, because I don&#x2019;t expect the system to be that exploitable in dollars or esteem, even though it <em>is</em> exploitable in personalized SAD treatments. Empirically, lots of people want money and acclaim, and base their short- and long-term career decisions around its pursuit; so achieving it in unusually large quantities shouldn&#x2019;t be as simple as having one bright idea. But there aren&#x2019;t large groups of competent people visibly organizing their day-to-day lives around producing outside-the-box new lightbox alternatives with the same intensity we can observe people organizing their lives around paying the bills, winning prestige or the acclaim of peers, etc.</p>\n<p>People presumably <em>care</em> about curing SAD&#x2014;if they could effortlessly push a button to instantly cure SAD, they would do so&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s a big difference between &#x201C;caring&#x201D; and &#x201C;caring enough to prioritize this over nearly everything else I care about,&#x201D; and it&#x2019;s the latter that would be needed for researchers to be willing to personally trade away non-small amounts of expected money or esteem for new treatment ideas.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-12-definition\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the case of Japan&#x2019;s monetary policy, it wasn&#x2019;t a coincidence that I couldn&#x2019;t get rich by understanding macroeconomics better than the Bank of Japan. Japanese asset markets shot up as soon as it became known that the Bank of Japan would create more money, without any need to wait and see&#x2014;so it turns out that the markets also understood macroeconomics better than the Bank of Japan. Part of our civilization was being, in a certain sense, stupid: there were trillion-dollar bills lying around for the taking. But they weren&#x2019;t trillion-dollar bills that just anyone could walk over and pick up.</p>\n<p>From the standpoint of a single agent like myself, that ecology didn&#x2019;t contain the particular kind of free energy that lots of other agents were competing to eat. I could be unusually right about macroeconomics compared to the PhD-bearing professionals at the Bank of Japan, but that weirdly low-hanging epistemic fruit wasn&#x2019;t a low-hanging financial fruit; I couldn&#x2019;t use the excess knowledge to easily get excess money deliverable the next day.</p>\n<p>Where reward doesn&#x2019;t follow success, or where not everyone can individually pick up the reward, institutions and countries and whole civilizations can fail at what is usually imagined to be their tasks. And then it is very much easier to do better in some dimensions than to profit in others.</p>\n<p>To state all of this more precisely: Suppose there is some space of strategies that you&#x2019;re competent enough to think up and execute on. <em>Inexploitability</em> has a single unit attached, like &#x201C;$&#x201D; or &#x201C;effective SAD treatments,&#x201D; and says that you can&#x2019;t find a strategy in this space that knowably gets you much more of the resource in question than other agents. The kind of inexploitability I&#x2019;m interested in typically arises when a large ecosystem of competing agents is genuinely trying to get the resource in question, and has access to strategies at least as good (for acquiring that resource) as the best options in your strategy space.</p>\n<p><em>Inadequacy</em> with respect to a strategy space has two units attached, like &#x201C;effective SAD treatments / research hours&#x201D; or &#x201C;QALYs / $,&#x201D; and says that there is some set of strategies a large ecosystem of agents could pursue that would convert the denominator unit into the numerator unit at some desired rate, but the agents are pursuing strategies that in fact result in a lower conversion rate. The kind of inadequacy I&#x2019;m most interested in arises when many of the agents in the ecosystem would prefer that the conversion occur at the rate in question, but there&#x2019;s some systemic blockage preventing this from happening.</p>\n<p>Systems tend to be inexploitable with respect to the resources that large ecosystems of competent agents are trying their hardest to pursue, like fame and money, regardless of how adequate or inadequate they are. And if there are other resources the agents aren&#x2019;t adequate at converting fame, money, etc. into at a widely desired rate, it will often be due to some systemic blockage. Insofar as agents have overlapping goals, it will therefore often be harder than it looks to find real instances of exploitability, and harder than it looks to outperform an inadequate equilibrium. But more local goals tend to overlap less: there isn&#x2019;t a large community of specialists specifically trying to improve my wife&#x2019;s well-being.</p>\n<p>The academic and medical system probably isn&#x2019;t that easy to exploit in dollars or esteem, but so far it does look like maybe the system is exploitable in SAD innovations, due to being <em>inadequate</em> to the task of converting dollars, esteem, researcher hours, etc. into new SAD cures at a reasonable rate&#x2014;inadequate, for example, at investigating some SAD cures that Randall Munroe would have considered obvious,<sup><a href=\"#footnote-13-definition\">13</a></sup> or at doing the basic investigative experiments that I would have considered obvious. And when the world is like that, it&#x2019;s possible to cure someone&#x2019;s crippling SAD by thinking carefully about the problem yourself, even if your civilization doesn&#x2019;t have a mainstream answer.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>viii.</h2>\n<p>There&#x2019;s a whole lot more to be said about how to think about inadequate systems: common conceptual tools include Nash equilibria, commons problems, asymmetrical information, principal-agent problems, and more. There&#x2019;s also a whole lot more to be said about how <em>not</em> to think about inadequate systems.</p>\n<p>In particular, if you relax your self-skepticism even slightly, it&#x2019;s trivial to come up with an <em>a priori</em> inadequacy argument for just about anything. Talk about &#x201C;efficient markets&#x201D; in any less than stellar forum, and you&#x2019;ll soon get half a dozen comments from people deriding the stupidity of hedge fund managers. And, yes, the financial system is broken in a lot of ways, but you still can&#x2019;t double your money trading S&amp;P 500 stocks. &#x201C;Find one thing to deride, conclude inadequacy&#x201D; is not a good rule.</p>\n<p>At the same time, lots of real-world social systems <em>do</em> have inadequate equilibria and it <em>is</em> important to be able to understand that, especially when we have clear observational evidence that this is the case. A blanket distrust of inadequacy arguments won&#x2019;t get us very far either.</p>\n<p>This is one of those ideas where other cognitive skills are required to use it correctly, and you can shoot off your own foot by thinking wrongly. So if you&#x2019;ve read this far, it&#x2019;s probably a good idea to keep reading.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Cross-posted to&#xA0;<a href=\"https://equilibriabook.com/an-equilibrium-of-no-free-energy\">equilibriabook.com</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/yPLr2tnXbiFXkMWvk/an-equilibrium-of-no-free-energy\">Less Wrong</a>.

The organizational reshuffling and insight from 2016 prompted us to reconsider our program objectives and outreach methods for making the largest impact with students. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The program&#x2019;s overall objectives are to inform students about the greatest problems facing humanity, equip them with the cognitive tools for thinking about how to address these problems, and then suggest possible solutions and avenues for taking effective action.</span></p>\n<h3>II - Initial Strategy</h3>\n<p><span>Our initial outreach strategy prioritized making SHIC accessible, hoping to reach the largest number of students possible in order to produce broad-scale shifts in perspective and behavior (e.g. survey results across all participants), and perhaps even a significant inflection point for a small fraction. Since mid-2016, we&#x2019;ve relied solely on volunteer student leaders and teachers to run the program with student participants. The </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q-5Rl-0Mkm9aYwnqcnZ10QtBsEkTLmbpQAQesxuskvI/edit#heading=h.grxvsk4niq6f\"><span>interim report</span></a><span> expands on how we found this implementation model rather unstable. We found difficulties in data collection most problematic. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Gathering feedback on the curriculum, testing program efficacy, and achieving scale, were largely rolled into a single process. By running the </span><a href=\"http://shicschools.org/shic-introductory-program\"><span>introductory program</span></a><span> with as many students as possible, we expected to collect actionable data while simultaneously scaling our presence around the world. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>SHIC confronted several practical questions that affected how we interpreted our success metrics. As an example, we&#x2019;d </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VLA9-twZzxq8DNENpsK9eeOmQv4ucFlGa0kbEjyjxSY/edit#heading=h.3i9hodqb10zz\"><span>initially intended</span></a><span> to inspire dozens of SHIC groups around the world to fundraise for effective charity as a broad indicator of program effectiveness. We reasoned that fundraising participation and performance could serve as a proxy for student engagement. Fundraising also served to hedge uncertainty regarding the overall value of SHIC by prompting donations to high-impact charities, possibly enough to </span><a href=\"/ea/128/students_for_high_impact_charity_review_and_10k/\"><span>offset the cost</span></a><span> of the project. After observing very inconsistent and underwhelming student fundraising </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q-5Rl-0Mkm9aYwnqcnZ10QtBsEkTLmbpQAQesxuskvI/edit#heading=h.4b23oggn97hh\"><span>numbers</span></a><span>, it became clear that using dollars donated as a central goal of program success warranted revisiting. </span></p>\n<p><span> &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>More importantly, we questioned the underlying assumptions of our success metrics. As a program dedicated to helping students achieve the largest prosocial impact, it wasn&#x2019;t clear that high fundraising numbers or broad shifts in survey results would necessarily be indicative of lasting impact. We increasingly felt that inspiring meaningful value shifts and shaping long-term plans for a smaller proportion of participants would be more impactful. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>For instance, we had serious reservations that program objectives appeared to privilege present-day action over longer-term skill building. Our previous model did not consider the opportunity-cost of fundraising comparatively nominal amounts for charity, versus skill building in order to have a larger impact in the future. In fact, optimizing SHIC too much in either direction (towards long-term career building or towards short-term action) could be detrimental. Put too much present-day focus in the program, and students likely achieve relatively little good and neglect skill building for the future. Put too much emphasis in skill building for the future, and risk squelching a natural passion for helping others.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>III -&#xA0;SHIC Workshop Experiment</h3>\n<p><span>After reevaluating the program as a whole, we&#x2019;ve decided on an implementation model that better reflects our revised objectives. By early 2018, SHIC will conduct the most ambitious experiment on the program to date, training in-house instructors to bring SHIC workshops to schools across Vancouver. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We gauge interest in the program by opening with mass Giving Game events conducted by SHIC. Provided that a large enough group of students are interested in moving on to the introductory program in a given school, SHIC instructors will return to conduct the full workshop in two additional 1.5-hour installments. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>An additional component to this experiment will involve collecting longitudinal data on the medium- to long-term effects of our program on student giving behavior. Thanks to our collaboration with Charitable Impact Foundation (</span><a href=\"https://chimp.net/\"><span>CHIMP</span></a><span>), a Vancouver-based donation platform that uses a donor-advised fund to facilitate gifts to other registered charities. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We will be able to track the giving behavior of workshop participants by individually assigning online Chimp accounts. On a monthly basis, each participant account will be credited with a set amount of money that can be disbursed to any charity in Canada, and also effective charities across the border thanks to our partnership with the Priority Foundation. We hypothesize the SHIC program will at least moderately influence the giving preferences of students. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In addition to the longitudinal giving data, surveys administered throughout the subsequent year, qualitative interviews, and classroom-level scouting will help SHIC identify a select cohort of high-potential students eligible for additional programming and mentorship opportunities.</span></p>\n<h3>IV -&#xA0;Our Revised Approach</h3>\n<p><span>Compared to the inconsistency we experienced with a volunteer implementation model, an instructor approach allows for more rapid feedback and adjustment, reliable data collection, tighter quality control over messaging, and may motivate students to become generally more engaged. By late 2018, we expect to have several vantage points from which to assess the impact of SHIC. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>More importantly, the instructor model is our best attempt at taking a more targeted approach at influencing students. SHIC will remain committed to keeping our message accessible &#x2013; students around the world can still download our entire curriculum for free and run their own student clubs, for example &#x2013;&#xA0;but the majority of our resources and effort will pursue meaningful impact on an individual level. We&#x2019;ve updated our program to achieve this in the following ways: </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Using data to identify high-potential students </span><span>- &#xA0;SHIC will collect a variety of metrics to find students most inclined to engage with effective charity in the long-term. Primarily through periodic surveying, qualitative interviews and classroom-level scouting, we will identify a select cohort of students eligible for additional programming, mentorship, and career opportunities. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Action oriented toward future impact </span><span>- Our program incorporates more informed insight on balancing long-term skill-building and present-day action. As an example, rather than exclusively recommending raising money for effective charities, we may instead attempt to connect students with high-impact internship opportunities. This new approach empowers students in the present day, facilitates skill-building, and helps build experience and career capital that could reap long-term benefits. The career path carved out by Owen Shen provides a real-world example of this approach. Owen became involved with the rationalism and effective altruism community at the age of 16, eventually volunteering with the SHIC curriculum and outreach teams for a number of months. Owen created his own rationality-focused </span><a href=\"https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/about/\"><span>blog</span></a><span>, and subsequently earned a contractor position with the Center for Applied Rationality (</span><a href=\"http://www.rationality.org/\"><span>CFAR</span></a><span>). Our overarching objective is to orient students toward a future with the highest potential for prosocial impact in a way similar to Owen. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Optimizing curriculum for critical thinking</span><span> - SHIC goes far beyond philanthropic education. Our application of logic, ethics, epistemology, and metacognition to complex social problems provide transferable skills students can utilize in other educational domains. Students and teachers will explore the scientific method, thematic learning, lateral thinking, and the formulation of an alternative outlook on conventional problem solving. See &#x2018;</span><a href=\"https://shicschools.org/shic-advanced-program/\"><span>Level 6 - Cognitive Quirks</span></a><span>&#x2019; for the sort of thematic principles we will incorporate more of moving forward. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>More information on the SHIC workshop experiment will be made public in the coming months.

This largely involves planning and research and development of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What\"><span>alternate foods</span></a><span> (roughly those not dependent on sunlight such as mushrooms, </span><a href=\"http://www.unibio.dk/\"><span>natural gas digesting bacteria</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=\"http://leafforlife.org/PAGES/INDUSTRI.HTM\"><span>extracting food from leaves</span></a><span>). Sun-blocking catastrophes could cause the collapse of civilization, and there are a number of reasons why humanity might not recover. </span><a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html\"><span>Not recovering from the collapse of civilization is one form of existential (X) risk</span></a><span> because humanity would not fulfill its potential. I have developed a model that uses Monte Carlo (probabilistic) sampling to estimate uncertain results using open source software (</span><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9782\"><span>Guesstimate</span></a><span>) that incorporates an earlier model of artificial general intelligence safety (hereafter AI) cost-effectiveness. With a number of assumptions unfavorable to alternate foods, spending approximately $100 million on alternate foods has a similar cost effectiveness to AI safety. Because the agricultural catastrophes could happen immediately and because existing expertise relevant to alternate foods could be co-opted by charitable giving, it is likely optimal to spend most of this money in the next few years. I continue to believe that AI is extremely important, and do not advocate a reduction in AI funding. I think that this alternate foods funding gap could be filled by large and small EA donors with additional capacity, and possibly donors who are concerned about X risk but find claims about AI implausible. The bigger picture is that even more funding is justified for both AI and alternate foods even from the perspective of the present generation, let alone future generations. Having alternate foods as a top priority would be a significant realignment of focus in the X risk community, so I invite more feedback and discussion (including playing with the </span><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9782\"><span>model</span></a><span>).<sup>1</sup></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Disclaimer/Acknowledgements:</span><span> I would like to acknowledge CEA for funding the EA </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iBy--zMyIiTgybYRUQZIm11WKGQZcixaCmIaysRmGvk/edit#gid=0\"><span>grant </span></a><span>to perform research on solutions to agricultural catastrophes, Ozzie Gooen for developing Guesstimate, Oxford Prioritisation Project for the AI model, and Joshua Pearce, Alexey Turchin, Michael Dickens, Owen Cotton-Barratt, Finan Adamson, Anders Sandberg, Allen Hundley, and Anthony Barrett for reviewing content.

The obvious intervention is prevention of nuclear war, which would be the best outcome. However, it is not neglected, as it has been worked on for many decades and is currently funded at</span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/#fn-2\"><span> billions of dollars per year quality adjusted</span></a><span>. The next most obvious solution is storing food, which is far too expensive (~tens of trillions of dollars) to have competitive cost effectiveness (and it would take many years so it would not protect us right away, and it would exacerbate current malnutrition). I have </span><a href=\"/ea/14y/saving_expected_lives_at_10_apiece/\"><span>posted </span></a><span>before about getting prepared for </span><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxkYXZpZGRlbmtlbmJlcmdlcnxneDo1MTg1ZDQ4NGI1MDMxN2Q0\"><span>alternate foods</span></a><span> (roughly those not dependent on sunlight that exploit biomass or fossil fuels). This could save expected lives in the present generation for $0.20 to $400 for only 10% global agricultural shortfalls like the year without a summer in 1816 caused by a volcanic eruption, and would be even more cost effective if sun blocking scenarios were considered. Of course alternate foods would not save the lives of those people directly impacted by the nuclear weapons, which is potentially hundreds of millions. But since about 6 billion people would die with our current ~half a year of food storage if the sun were blocked for 5 years, alternate foods would solve ~90% of the problem. Current awareness of alternate foods is relatively low: about 700,000 people globally have heard about the concept based on impression counters for the ~10 articles, podcasts, and presentations for which there were data including </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/here-s-how-world-could-end-and-what-we-can-do-about-it\"><span>Science</span> </a><span>(out of more than 100 media </span><a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What\"><span>mentions</span></a><span>). Also, many of the technologies need to be better developed. Planning, research and development are three interventions, which could dramatically increase the probability of success of feeding everyone, each costing in the tens of millions of dollars. This post analyzes the cost effectiveness of alternate foods from an X risk perspective. It is generally thought to be very unlikely that the agricultural catastrophes such as nuclear war with the burning of cities (nuclear winter), super volcanic eruption, or a large asteroid/comet impact would directly cause human extinction.<sup>2</sup></span><span> However, there is significant probability that by blocking the sun for about 5 years, these catastrophes could cause the collapse of civilization. One definition of the collapse of civilization involves short-term focus, collapse of long distance trade, widespread conflict, and loss of government (</span><a href=\"https://lifeboat.com/papers2/joseph.coates.doc\"><span>Coates, 2009</span></a><span>). </span><a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html\"><span>Not recovering from the collapse of civilization is one form of X risk</span></a><span> because humanity would not fulfill its potential. Reasons that civilization might not recover include: Easily accessible fossil fuels and minerals are exhausted, we might not have the stable climate of last 10,000 years, we might lose trust or IQ permanently because of the trauma and genetic selection of the catastrophe, an endemic disease could prevent high human population density, and a permanent loss of grains (e.g. from an engineered crop disease that affects the entire grass family) could preclude high human population density. If the loss of civilization persists long enough, a natural catastrophe could cause the extinction of humanity, such as a super volcanic eruption or an asteroid/comet impact.</span></p>\n<p><span>AI has been a top priority in the X risk community. EAs have been very important in raising awareness and funding for this cause. I seek to compare the cost effectiveness of alternate foods with AI to see if alternate foods should also be a top priority. The Guesstimate </span><a href=\"/ea/1ae/a_model_of_the_machine_intelligence_research/\"><span>model </span></a><span>for AI cost-effectiveness was developed by the Oxford Prioritisation Project (which uses input from Owen Cotton-Barrett&#x2019;s and Daniel Dewey&#x2019;s </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/08/quantifyingaisafety/\"><span>model</span></a><span>). I use a subset of this model, because I do not try to quantify the value of the far future. I do not discuss the assumptions in the AI model here. Another possible AI </span><a href=\"http://mdickens.me/causepri-app/\"><span>model </span></a><span>to compare to would be Michael Dickens&#x2019;, but this is future work.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Model of alternate foods</span></p>\n<p><span>I implemented the model in Guesstimate </span><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9782\"><span>here</span></a><span>. Be aware that with the large uncertainties, when you load the model, some values could be different by a factor of two (which I have noted in the model and shown as grey in the tables). Ozzie Gooen (the developer of Guesstimate) is concerned about runtime and Chrome compatibility with increasing the sample size, so I may need to move back to Analytica for publication repeatability. But for now, getting the order of magnitude right is all that is needed. </span></p>\n<p><span>I am interested in further feedback on the assumptions. Most of the numbers are closely analogous to numbers in the published literature. Therefore, I will focus here on the numbers with less support here.

Many fear that with the current leaders of Russia and the United States, an intentional strike has a significant probability, so I am being conservative (unfavorable to alternate foods) by ignoring this. Also, this does not include super volcano or asteroid/comet risk, but they are relatively small. For the probability of agricultural collapse given full-scale nuclear war, many have assumed this is near 100%. I have done some conservative modeling in (</span><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/34953571/Cost-effectiveness_of_interventions_for_alternate_food_in_the_United_States_to_address_agricultural_catastrophes\"><span>Denkenberger 2017</span></a><span>) that produced roughly 20% probability. I have added some variance around this. For the probability of collapse of civilization given the collapse of agriculture, this is based on ~10 workshop participants at EA Global 2016 in San Francisco, and ~10 at the International Disaster Risk Reduction conference in Davos, Switzerland in 2016. Most thought civilization would not survive the loss of agriculture for ~5 years. </span><span>For the probability of not recovering civilization, this is based on an estimate of an oral poll of ~20 participants taken at &quot;Existential Risk to Humanity&quot; in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2017. I have reduced the median somewhat and increased the variation. I used the same source for the probability of loss of civilization given 10% agricultural shortfall in Table 2. </span><span>For the probability of saving civilization, I use the probability from the papers of feeding everyone.<sup>4</sup></span><span> It is much easier to save civilization than feed everyone, so this is quite conservative.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>A number of catastrophic events could cause a roughly 10% global agricultural shortfall, including a medium-sized asteroid/comet impact, a large but not super volcanic eruption (like the one that caused the year without a summer in 1816), regional nuclear war (for example, India-Pakistan), abrupt regional climate change (10&#xB0;C in a decade, which has happened in the past multiple times), complete global loss of bees as pollinators, a super crop pest or pathogen, and coincident extreme weather, resulting in multiple breadbasket failures. Though it would be technically straightforward to reduce food consumption by 10% by making less food go to waste, animals, and biofuels, the prices would go so high that the poor may not be able to afford food. We found an expected </span><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13753-016-0097-2\"><span>500 million lives lost</span></a><span> in such a catastrophe. There could also be extreme global climate change of &gt;5&#xB0;C that happens over a century (so slow in comparison to &#x201C;abrupt&#x201D; climate change). This could make conventional agriculture impossible in the tropics, which would be a larger than 10% agricultural impact, but it would occur over ~1 century, so the impact might be similar to the abrupt 10% shortfalls. Other events would not directly affect food production, but still could have similar impacts on human nutrition. Some of these include a conventional world war or pandemic that disrupts global food trade, and causes famine in food-importing countries. Though significantly less likely, it is possible that these catastrophes could result in instability and full scale nuclear war, possibly collapsing civilization. The preparation for 10% agricultural shortfalls would be very similar as to agricultural collapse, especially because the former could lead to the latter. In the Table 2, I list the variables for this scenario. </span><span>The probability per year of 10% agricultural shortfall leaves many risks unquantified, so it is conservative. </span><span>The other variables are the same as the sun blocking case. </span></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><span>Table 2.

This is significantly smaller variance than alternate foods, which was the opposite of what I expected. It could be that the general population would estimate AI as more uncertain than nuclear war (e.g. by giving significant weight to the impossibility of AGI) or that even with experts, the AI model should have greater uncertainty (I am not modifying the AI model). The expected cost effectivenesses of alternate foods and AI are similar.

Being prepared for agricultural catastrophes might protect against unknown risks, meaning the cost-effectiveness would be even higher. Also, 80,000 Hours estimates that global climate change of &gt;5&#x2103; would reduce the future potential of humanity by </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/\"><span>~20%</span></a><span> through a risk of extinction, worse values, international conflict or social breakdown and a failure to recover. My model currently has the reduction in future human potential at only ~0.13% given these types of &quot;10%&quot; global agricultural shortfalls (losing civilization and not recovering). Using their numbers would increase overall cost effectiveness of alternate foods by an order of magnitude just from changing the 10% shortfall numbers. Adding 80,000 Hours estimate of the possibility of </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/#fn-1\"><span>worse values to the sun blocking scenarios</span></a><span> meaning a 30% reduction in future potential of humanity would ~triple overall cost effectiveness again, meaning <strong>~40 times as cost effective as my model</strong>. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning\"><span>Steelmanning</span></a><span> the opposition to funding alternate foods:</span></p>\n<p><span>The Open Philanthropy Project (OPP) is funding a detailed </span><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/miscellaneous/rutgers-university-nuclear-conflict-climate-modeling\"><span>investigation </span></a><span>of the impact of nuclear war. Shouldn&apos;t we wait until those results before funding alternate foods? The biggest source of uncertainty in the model here is the chance of nuclear war. The OPP investigation will examine which nuclear detonation scenarios are plausible, but they are not planning on assigning quantitative probabilities to these scenarios. Furthermore, every year we wait to get prepared with alternate foods, we expose ourselves to an ~0.01% additional chance of existential catastrophe. In addition, even if the probability of losing civilization turns out to be zero from nuclear war, spending $100 million on alternate foods would still be competitive with AI from a long term future perspective. Also, this spending is already highly justified for the present generation even not including nuclear winter risk, so it is likely a no-regrets policy (at least with some uncertainty about what to value or if flow through effects to the far future of saving lives now are significant). Of course AI safety would save expected lives in the present generation, but it would be 1-2 orders of magnitude less than alternate foods (see below). This is because an AI catastrophe is likely to kill everyone, while agricultural catastrophes can kill many people without causing an existential catastrophe.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Another steelman is that the estimate of cost effectiveness of AI is too low. Some think that the total existential risk associated with developing highly capable AI systems, bearing in mind all of the work on safety that will be done, is higher than the current 95th percentile of 7% chance.<sup>7</sup></span><span> This could reduce the optimal amount of funding for alternate foods if they have to be competitive with AI, but it would be very unlikely to eliminate additional funding for alternate foods, and alternate foods do not necessarily have to be competitive with AI for it to be optimal to fund them.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>A further steelman is that cost effectiveness estimates tend to worsen over time, as GiveWell found for global poverty interventions. This could apply both to AI and alternate foods, though alternate foods are newer, so one might expect that it would apply more to alternate foods. However, given my conservatism, I would expect the estimate of the cost effectiveness of alternate foods to rise over time. Indeed, this has been the case for me over the last few years as I have discovered more catastrophes that alternate foods could ameliorate. In my experience, one has to be conservative to pass peer review at a mainstream journal like the biosecurity </span><a href=\"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/hs.2017.0028\"><span>paper </span></a><span>(though admittedly, not all of my inputs here have been peer reviewed).</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Less detailed view</span></p>\n<p><span>The </span><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/importance-neglectedness-tractability/\"><span>importance, tractability, neglectedness</span></a><span> (ITN) framework is useful for screening cause areas. There is debate about using the ITN framework for interventions as well as risks. Indeed, alternate foods can only potentially solve 90% of the mortality (and perhaps similar for X risk), but this is within the uncertainty of the analysis. The larger concern is that if we allocate money across all the interventions for a risk, less money should be spent on an individual intervention than on the entire cause area. One could look at the categories of interventions for nuclear winter, which might be prevent war, eliminate/reduce nuclear weapons, prevent nuclear winter given nuclear war, and adapt to nuclear winter. I have argued that adaptation should focus on alternate foods, so perhaps alternate foods should have &#x2155; the funding of the cause. But since 80,000 Hours has listed about 10 </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/\"><span>interventions</span></a><span>, let&#x2019;s say alternate foods should have 1/10 the funding a priori. This means spending $100 million on alternate foods should be equivalent in cost effectiveness as spending $1 billion on the nuclear winter cause area. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The less detailed view could look at just importance and neglectedness. </span><span>According to these models, AI poses a 4% expected risk of existential catastrophe this century (bearing in mind all of the work on safety that will be done), and agricultural catastrophes pose a 1.6% expected risk (of which alternate funds can only address about 90%). With equal tractability and the same level of funding for the cause areas, one would expect that AI would be about three times as cost effective as alternate foods because of the greater importance of AI. </span><span>Table 5 shows different levels of funding</span><span> and assumes logarithmic returns to investment (see the bottom of the Guesstimate </span><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9782\"><span>model</span></a><span>). For the alternate foods cost effectiveness for average of $100 million (from $10 million to $1 billion equivalent for nuclear winter cause area) this less detailed view predicts that alternate foods should be 5 times as cost-effective as AI marginal at $3 billion. Since the result in Table 3 was 3 times as cost effective as AI, this implies similar tractability of AI to alternate foods. This was surprising to me, because I expected alternate foods to be something like an order of magnitude more tractable than AI because there are clear ways to make progress in alternate foods and alternate foods are not talent constrained. This could indicate that all those ways I am being conservative with alternate foods really add up. A big one is that I assume the interventions are only valuable for about 20 years instead of a century like for AI (though it is true that if AGI comes soon, alternate foods will be moot). If the conservatism is removed, it could be that alternate foods at the $100 million spending level are significantly more cost-effective than I am claiming and therefore significantly more cost effective than AI at the $3 billion spending level.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>This less detailed view can also be used to estimate the marginal cost effectiveness of the one hundred millionth dollar and right now assuming logarithmic returns. &#xA0;It is about 5 times less cost-effective for the $100 million marginal to alternate foods than for $100 million of funding on average (see bottom of Guesstimate </span><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9782\"><span>model</span></a><span>). Since this is $1 billion equivalent for nuclear winter cause area, this yields the same cost-effectiveness as AI (see Table 5). It is about 20 times as cost-effective for the marginal dollar now ($1 million for alternate foods or $10 million equivalent to the nuclear winter cause area) than for $100 million of funding on average. This yields 100 times as cost-effective as AI (see Table 5). This is roughly consistent with my detailed estimates of the cost effectiveness of the marginal dollar now. </span></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><span>Table 5.

This is not nearly as cost-effective as alternate foods, but it is significantly lower cost than GiveWell estimates for global health interventions: </span><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness\"><span>$900-$7,000</span></a><span>. Since AI appears to be underfunded from the present generation perspective, it would be extremely underfunded when taking into account future generations. If this were corrected, then in order to have similar cost-effectiveness with alternate foods, more funding for alternate foods would be justified. Indeed, in order to fund alternate foods just from a current generation perspective at a level of similar cost-effectiveness to global poverty interventions, billions of dollars of alternate food funding would be </span><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13753-016-0097-2\"><span>justified</span></a><span>. Much more funding would be justified if valuing future generations. It is kind of depressing that, while we in the X risks community are generally motivated by future generations, we cannot even get work on these risks funded at a level that would be justified by the present generation, a point made in the book </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Catastrophe-Risk-Response-Richard-Posner/dp/0195306473\"><span>Catastrophe: Risk and Response</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Timing of funding</span></p>\n<p><span>If one agrees that alternate foods should be in the EA budget for X risks, the next question is how to allocate funding to the different causes over time. For AI, there are arguments both for </span><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/the-timing-of-labour-aimed-at-reducing-existential-risk/\"><span>funding now and funding later</span></a><span>. For alternate foods, since most of the catastrophes could happen right away, there is significantly greater urgency to fund alternate foods now. Furthermore, it is relatively more effective to scale up the funding quickly because we can, through requests for proposals, co-opt relevant expertise that already exists (e.g. in the different foods, such as biofuel experts who know how to turn fiber into sugar). Since I have not monetized the value of the far future, I cannot use traditional cost-effectiveness metrics such as the benefit to cost ratio, net present value, payback time, and return on investment. However, in the case of saving expected lives in the present generation, the return on investment was from 100% to 5,000,000% per year. This suggests that the $100 million or so for alternate foods should be mostly spent in the next few years to optimally reduce X risk (a smaller amount would maintain preparedness in the future). Since AI safety funding is now about </span><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/changes-in-funding-in-the-ai-safety-field/\"><span>$10 million</span></a><span> per year, this would mean more funding for alternate foods than AI in the near term. I think that this alternate foods funding gap could be filled by large and small EA donors with additional capacity. Also, donors who are concerned about X-risk (or just present generations) but find claims about AI implausible could contribute (but I don&#x2019;t want to let those concerned about AI off the hook!). The formal optimization including other causes such as </span><a href=\"http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/pmpmta/Mahoney_extinction.pdf\"><span>asteroid deflection </span></a><span>and terrestrial/space </span><a href=\"http://sethbaum.com/ac/2015_Refuges.pdf\"><span>refuges </span></a><span>to repopulate the earth is future work and is related to work at GCRI including <a href=\"http://tony-barrett.com/papers/Summ-VOI-GCRs-DA.htm\">value of information</a> and <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/integrated-assessment/\">integrated assessment</a>.

More relevant, money has been spent developing alternate foods for other reasons, such as mushrooms and natural gas digesting bacteria. This could easily be tens of millions of dollars that would have needed to be spent for catastrophe preparation. So this would be relevant for the marginal $100 million. However, there are very high value interventions we would do first, like figuring out how to exploit mass/social media in a catastrophe to get the right people to know about alternative foods. Though the alternative foods would not work as well as with $100 million of R&amp;D, just having the leaders of countries know about them and implement them in their own countries without trade could still significantly increase the chance of retaining civilization. The cost of these first interventions would be very low, so it would be very high cost effectiveness.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>6 </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Open AI already has </span><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2015/12/11/openai-is-a-1-billion-nonprofit-dedicated-to-artificial-intelligence-research/\"><span>~$1 billion</span></a><span>, so I estimate that $3 billion will be committed to AI.

If we adjust the scenario above so they cannot discuss with one another but are merely informed of each other&#x2019;s credences (and that they are peers regarding P), the right strategy remains to meet in the middle.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt5\">[5]</a></sup>&#xA0;Yet how come Adam and Beatrice are doing <span>better</span>&#xA0;if they <span>ignore</span>&#xA0;relevant information? Both Adam and Beatrice have their &#x2018;inside view&#x2019; evidence (i.e. what they take to bear on the credence of P) <span>and</span><span>&#xA0;the &#x2018;outside view&#x2019; evidence (what each other think about P). Why not use a hybrid strategy which uses both?</span></p>\n<p>Yet to&#xA0;whatever extent Adam or Beatrice&#x2019;s hybrid approach leads them to diverge from equal weight, they will do worse. Oliver can use the &#x2018;meet in the middle strategy&#x2019; to get an expectedly better accuracy than either biasing towards their own inside view determination. In betting terms, Oliver can arbitrage any difference in credence between Adam and Beatrice<span>.</span></p>\n<p>We can explain why: the credences Adam and Beatrice offer can be thought of as very compressed <span>summaries</span><span>&#xA0;of the considerations they take to bear upon P. Whatever &#x2018;inside view&#x2019; considerations Adam took to bear upon P are already &#x2018;priced in&#x2019; to the credence he reports (ditto Beatrice). Modesty is not ignoring this evidence, but weighing it appropriately: if Adam then tries to adjust the outside view determination by his own take on the balance of evidence, he double counts his inside view: once in itself, and once more by including his credence as weighing equally to Beatrice&#x2019;s in giving the outside view. </span></p>\n<p>One&#x2019;s take on the set of considerations regarding P may err, either by bias,<sup><a href=\"#ftnt6\">[6]</a></sup>&#xA0;ignorance, or &#x2018;innocent&#x2019; mistake. Splitting the difference between you and your peer&#x2019;s very high level summary of these captures the great fraction of benefit of hashing out where these summaries differ.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt7\">[7]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;Modesty correctly diagnoses that one&#x2019;s high level summary is no more likely to be more accurate than one&#x2019;s peers, and so holds those in equal regard, even in cases where the components of one&#x2019;s own summary are known better.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Repeated measures, brains as credence censors, and the wisdom of crowds</span></h2>\n<p>Modesty outperforms non-modesty in the n=2 case. The degree of outperformance grows (albeit concavely) as <span>n</span><span>&#xA0;increases.</span></p>\n<p>Scientific fields often have to deal with unreliable measurement. They commonly mitigate this by having repeat measurement. If you have a crummy thermometer, repeating readings several times improves accuracy over just the once. Human brains also try and measure things, and they are also often unreliable. It is commonly observed that nonetheless the average of their measurement tends to lie closer to the mark than the vast majority of individual measurements. Consider the commonplace &#x2018;guess how many skittles are in this jar&#x2019; or similar estimation games: the <span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DiOucwX7Z1HU&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926158000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEzGad2g9eRc9R5e2ih54P6k8sf3w\">usual observation</a></span>&#xA0;is that the average of all the guesses is better than all (or almost all) the individual guesses.</p>\n<p>A toy model makes this unsurprising. The individual guesses will form some distribution centered on the true value. Thus the expected error of a given individual guess is the standard deviation of this distribution. The expected error of the average of all guesses is given by the <span>standard error</span>, which is the standard deviation divided by root(number of guesses):<sup><a href=\"#ftnt8\">[8]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;with 10 individuals, the error is about 3 times smaller than the expected error of each individual guess; with 100, 10 times smaller; and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span>Analogously, human brains also try to measure credences or degrees of belief, and are similarly imperfect to when they&#x2019;re trying to estimate &#x2018;number of X&#x2019;. Yet one may expect a similar effect to this &#x2018;wisdom of crowds&#x2019; to operate here too. In the same way Adam and Beatrice would do better in the situation above if they took the average (even if it went against their view of the balance of reasons by their lights), if Adam-to-Zabaleta (all epistemic peers) investigated the same P, they&#x2019;d expect to do better if they took the average of their group versus steadfastly holding to the credence they arrived at &#x2018;by their lights&#x2019;. Whatever inaccuracies that may throw off their individual estimates of P somewhat cancel out.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Deferring to better brains</span></h2>\n<p><span>The arguments above apply to cases where one is an epistemic peer. If not, one needs to adjust by some measure of &#x2018;epistemic virtue&#x2019;. In cases where Adam is an epistemic superior to Beatrice, they should meet closer to Adam&#x2019;s view, commensurate with the degree of epistemic superiority (and vice versa).</span></p>\n<p><span>Although reasons for being an epistemic superior could be &#x2018;they&#x2019;re a superforecaster&#x2019; or &#x2018;they&#x2019;re smarter than I am&#x2019;, perhaps the most common source of epistemic superiors lie under the heading of &#x2018;subject matter expert&#x2019;. On topics from human nutrition, to voting rules, to the impact of the minimum wage, to the nature of consciousness, to basically anything that isn&#x2019;t trivial, one can usually find a fairly large group of very smart people who spend many years studying that topic, who make public their views about this topic (sometimes not even behind a paywall). That they at least have a much greater body of relevant information and have spent longer thinking about it gives them a large advantage compared to you. </span></p>\n<p>In such cases, the analogy might be that your brain is a sundial, whilst theirs is an atomic clock. So if you have the option of taking their readings rather than yours, you should do so. The evidence a reading of a sundial provides about the time conditional on the atomic clock reading is effectively zero. &#x2018;Splitting the difference&#x2019; in analagous epistemic cases should result with both you and your epistemic superior agreeing that they are right and you are wrong.<span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<h2><span>Inference to the ideal epistemic observer </span></h2>\n<p>We can summarise these motivations by analogy to ideal observers (used elsewhere in perception and ethical theory). We can gesture that an ideal (epistemic) observer is just that which is able to form the most accurate credence for P given whatever prior: we can explain they have vast intelligence, full knowledge of all matters that bear upon P, perfect judgement, and in essence all epistemic virtues <span>in</span>&#xA0;<span>excelsis</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now consider this helpful fiction:</span></p>\n<p><em><span>The epistemic fall</span></em>:<span>&#xA0;</span><span>Imagine a population solely comprised of ideal observers, who all share the same (correct) view on P. Overnight their epistemic virtues are assailed: they lose some of their reasoning capacity; they pick up particular biases that could throw them one way or another; they lose information, and so on, and each one to varying degrees.</span></p>\n<p><span>They wake up to find they now have all sorts of different credences about P, and none of them can remember what credence they all held yesterday. What should they do?</span></p>\n<p><span>It seems our fallen ideal observers can begin to piece together what their original credence was about P by finding out more about their credences and remaining epistemic virtue, and so backpropagate their return to epistemic apotheosis. If they find they&#x2019;re all similarly virtuous and are evenly scattered, their best guess is the ideal observer was in the middle of the distribution (c.f. the wisdom of crowds). If they see a trend that those with greater residual virtue tend to hold a higher credence in P, they should attempt to extrapolate this trend to suggest the ideal agent origin from which they were differentially blown of course from. If they see one group demonstrates a bias that others do not, they can correct the position of this group before trying these procedures. If they find the more virtuous agents are more scattered regarding P, (or that they segregate into widely dispersed aggregations), this should make them very unsure about where the ideal observer initially was. And so on.</span></p>\n<p><span>Such a model clarifies the benefit of modesty. Although we didn&#x2019;t have some grand epistemic fall, it is clear we all fall manifestly short of an ideal observer. Yet we all fall short in different respects, and in different degrees. One should want to believe whatever one would believe if one was an ideal observer, shorn of one&#x2019;s manifest epistemic vices. Purely immodest views must say their best guess is the ideal observer would think the same as they do, and hope that all the vicissitudes of their epistemic vice happen to cancel out. By accounting for the distribution of cognisers, modesty allows a much better forecast, and so a much more accurate belief. And the best such forecast is the strong form of modesty, where one&#x2019;s particular datapoint, in and of itself, should not be counted higher than any other.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1><span>Excursus: Against common justifications for immodesty</span></h1>\n<p><span>So much for strong modesty in theory. How does it perform in practice?</span></p>\n<p><span>One rough heuristic for strong modesty is this: for any question, find the plausible expert class to answer that question (e.g. if P is whether to raise the minimum wage, talk to economists). If this class converges on a particular answer, believe that answer too. If they do not agree, have little confidence in any answer. Do this no matter whether one&#x2019;s impression of the object level considerations that recommend (by your lights) a particular answer.</span></p>\n<p><span>Such a model captures all the common sense cases of modesty - trust the results in typical textbooks, defer to consensus in cases like when to put the bins out, and so on. I now show it is also better in many cases where people think it is better to be immodest.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Being &#x2018;well informed&#x2019; (or even true expertise) is not enough</span></h2>\n<p><span>A common refrain is that one is entitled to &#x2018;join issue&#x2019; with the experts due to one having made some non-trivial effort at improving one&apos;s knowledge of the subject. &#x201C;Sure, I accept experts widely disagree on macro-economics, but I&#x2019;m confident in neo-Keynesianism after many months of careful study and reflection.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>This doesn&#x2019;t fly by the symmetry argument above. Our outsider observes widespread disagreement in the area of macroeconomics, and that many experts who spend years on the subject nonetheless greatly disagree. Although it is possible the ideal observer would have been in one or another of the &#x2018;camps&#x2019; (the clustering implies intermediate positions are less plausible), the outsider cannot adjudicate which one if we grant the economists in each appear to have similar levels of epistemic virtue. The balance of this outside view changes imperceptibly if another person who despite a few months of study remains nowhere near peerhood (let alone superiority) of these divided experts, happens to side with one camp or another. By symmetry, one&apos;s own view of the balance of reason should remain unchanged if this &#x2018;another person&#x2019; happened to be you.</span></p>\n<p>The same applies even if you <span>are</span>&#xA0;a bona fide expert. Unless the distribution of expertise is such that there is a lone &#x2018;world authority&#x2019; above all others (and you&#x2019;re them)&#xA0;your fellow experts form your epistemic peer group.&#xA0;Taking the outside view is still the better bet: the consensus of experts tends to be right more often than dissenting experts, and so some difference splitting (weighed more to the consensus owing to their greater numbers) is the right answer.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<h2><span>Common knowledge &#x2018;silver bullet arguments&#x2019;</span></h2>\n<p><span>Suppose one takes an introductory class in economics. From this, one sees there must be a &#x2018;knock-down&#x2019; argument against a minimum wage:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Well, suppose you&#x2019;re an employee whose true value on the free market is less than the minimum wage. But under the minimum wage, the firm might not decide on charitably employing above your market value, and just firing you instead. You&#x2019;re worse off, as you&#x2019;re on the dole, and the firm&#x2019;s worse off, as it has to meet its labour demand another way. Everyone&#x2019;s lost! So much for the minimum wage!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet one quickly discovers economists seem to be deeply divided&#xA0;over the merits of the minimum wage (as they are about most other things). See for example <span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/what-economists-think-about-raising-the-minimum-wage/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926164000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbAMz7kbVUV2TVWacsumIxKcJQ3w\">this poll</a></span>&#xA0;suggesting 38 economic experts in the US are pretty evenly divided on whether the minimum wage would &#x2018;hit&#x2019; employment for low-skill workers, and leant <span>in favour</span><span>&#xA0;of the minimum wage &#x2018;all things considered&#x2019;.</span></p>\n<p><span>It seems risible to suppose these economists don&#x2019;t know their economics 101. What seems much more likely is that they know other things that you don&#x2019;t which make the minimum wage more reasonable than your jejune understanding of the subject suggests. One need not belabour which side the outside view strongly prefers.</span></p>\n<p>Yet it is depressingly common for people to confidently hold that view X or Y is decisively refuted by some point or another, notwithstanding the fact this point is well known to the group of experts that nonetheless hold X or Y.<span>&#xA0;Of course in some cases one really has touched on the decisive point the experts have failed to appreciate. More often, one is proclaiming that one is on the wrong side of the Dunning-Kruger effect.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Debunking the expert class (but not you)</span></h2>\n<p><span>To the litany of cases where (apparent) experts screwed up, we can add verses without end. So we might be inclined to debunk a particular &#x2018;expert consensus&#x2019; due to some bias or irrationality we can identify. Thus, having seen there are no &#x2018;real&#x2019; experts to help us, we must look at the object level case. </span></p>\n<p>The key question is this: &#x201C;How are you <span>better</span><span>?&#x201D; And it is here that debunking attempts often flounder:</span></p>\n<p>An undercutting defeater for one aspect of epistemic superiority for the expert class is not good enough. Maybe one can show the expert class has a poor predictive track record in their field. Unless one has a better track record in <span>their</span><span>&#xA0;field, this puts you on a par with respect to this desideratum of epistemic virtue. They likely have others (e.g. more relevant object-level knowledge) that should still give them an edge, albeit attenuated.</span></p>\n<p>An undercutting defeater that seems to apply equally well to oneself as the expert class also isn&#x2019;t enough. Suppose (say) economics is riven by ideological bias: why are you<span>&#xA0;less</span>&#xA0;susceptible to these biases? The same ideological biases that might plague professional economists may also plague amateur economists, but the former retain <span>other</span><span>&#xA0;advantages. </span></p>\n<p><span>Even if a proposed debunking is &#x2018;selectively toxic&#x2019; to the experts versus you, it still might be your epistemic superior all things considered. Both Big Pharma and Professional Philosophy may be misaligned, but perhaps not so much to be orthogonal or antiparallel to the truth: in both they still expectedly benefit by finding drugs that work or making good arguments respectively. They may still fare better overall than, &#x201C;Intelligent layperson who&#x2019;s read extensively&#x201D;, even if they are not subject to &#x2018;publish or perish&#x2019; or similar.</span></p>\n<p>Even if a proposed debunking shows one as decisively superior to that expert class, there may be <span>another</span>&#xA0;expert class which remains epistemically superior to you. Maybe you can persuasively show professional philosophers are so compromised on consciousness that they should not be deferred to about it. Then the real expert class may simply switch to something like &#x2018;intelligent people outside the academy who think a lot about the topic&#x2019;. If it&#x2019;s the case that <span>this</span><span>&#xA0;group of people do not share your confidence in your view, it seems outsiders should still reject it - as should you.</span></p>\n<p>It need not be said that the track record for these debunking defeaters is poor. Most crackpots have a persecution narrative to explain why the mainstream doesn&#x2019;t recognise or understand them, and some of the most mordant criticisms of the medical establishment arise from those touting complementary medicine. Thus &#x2018;explaining away&#x2019; expert disagreement may not put one in a more propitious reference class than one started from. One should be particularly suspicious of debunking(s) sufficiently general that the person holding the unorthodox view has no epistemic peers - they are akin to Moses, descending from Mt. Sinai, bringing down God-breathed truth for the rest of us.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt10\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Private evidence and pet arguments</h2>\n<p><span>Suppose one thinks one is in receipt of a powerful piece of private evidence: maybe you&#x2019;ve got new data or a new insight. So even though the experts are generally in the right, in this particular case they are wrong because they are unaware of this new consideration.</span></p>\n<p><span>New knowledge will not spread instantaneously, and that someone can be &#x2018;ahead of the curve&#x2019; comes as no surprise. Yet many people who take themselves to have private evidence are wrong: maybe experts know about it but don&#x2019;t bother to discuss it because it is so weak, or it is already in the literature (but you haven&#x2019;t seen it), or it isn&#x2019;t actually relevant to the topic, or whatever else. Most mavericks who take themselves to have new evidence that overturns consensus are mistaken.</span></p>\n<p>The natural risk is people tend to be too partial to their pet arguments or pet data, and so give them undue weight, and so one&#x2019;s &#x2018;insider&#x2019; perceptions should perhaps be attenuated by this fact. I suspect most are overconfident here.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt11\">[11]</a></sup>&#xA0;If this private evidence really is powerful, one should expect it to be persuasive to members of this expert class once they become aware of it. So it seems the credence one should have is the (appropriately discounted) forecast of what the expert class would think once you provide them this evidence<span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>The natural test of the power of this private evidence is to make it public. If one observes experts (or just epistemic peers) shift to your view, you were right about how powerful this evidence was. If instead one sees a much more modest change in opinion, this should lead one to downgrade your estimate as to how powerful this evidence really is (and perhaps provide calibration data for next time). Holding instead this really is decisive evidence leads one to the problematic &#x2018;common knowledge silver bullet&#x2019; case discussed above. Inferring from this experts just can&#x2019;t understand your reasoning or are biased against outsiders or whatever else produces a suspiciously self-serving debunking argument, also discussed above. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<h1>&#xA0;</h1>\n<h1><span>Objections</span></h1>\n<p><span>So much for the case in favour. What about the case against? I divide objections into those &#x2018;in theory&#x2019;, and those &#x2018;in practice&#x2019;. </span></p>\n<h2><span>In theory</span></h2>\n<h3>There&#x2019;s no pure &#x2018;outside view&#x2019;<sup><a href=\"#ftnt12\">[12]</a></sup></h3>\n<p>It is not the case you can bootstrap an outside view from nothing. One needs to at least start with some considerations as to what makes one an epistemic peer or superior, and probably some minimal background knowledge of &#x2018;aboutness&#x2019; to place topics under one or another expert class.<span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>In the same way large amounts of our empirical information are now derived by instrument rather than direct application of our senses (but were ultimately germinated from direct sensory experience), large amounts of our epistemic information can be derived by deferring to better (or more) brains rather than using our own, even if this relies on some initial seed epistemology we have to realise for ourselves. This &#x2018;germinal set of claims&#x2019; can still be modestly revised later. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Immodestly modest?</span></h3>\n<p>One line of attack from the <span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02691728.2014.907833?journalCode%3Dtsep20&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926169000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAW4RfOXYif_Fz7fOiNY2kB2BYgA\">social epistemology literature</a></span>&#xA0;is that strong forms of modesty are self-defeating. If one is modest, one should assumedly be modest about &#x2018;What is the right way to form beliefs if epistemic peers disagree with you?&#x2019; Yet one finds that very few people endorse the sort of epistemic modesty advocated above. When one looks among potential expert classes, such as more intelligent friends of mine (i.e. friends of mine), epistemologists, and so on, conciliatory views like these command only a minority. So the epistemically modest should vanish as they defer to the more steadfast consensus.</p>\n<p><span>If so, so much the worse for modesty. I offer a couple of incomplete defences:</span></p>\n<p><span>One is haggling over the topic of disagreement. In my limited reading of &#x2018;equal weight/conciliatory views and their detractors&#x2019;, I take the detractors to be suggesting something like &#x201C;one is &#x2018;within one&#x2019;s rights&#x2019; to be steadfast&#x201D;, rather than something like &#x201C;you&#x2019;re more accurate if you&#x2019;re steadfast&#x201D;. Maybe there are epistemic virtues which aren&#x2019;t the same as being more accurate. Yet there may be less disagreement on &#x2018;conditional on an accuracy first view, is modesty the right approach?&#x2019;</span></p>\n<p>This only gets so far (after all, shouldn&#x2019;t we be modest whether only to care about accuracy?) A more general defence is this:&#xA0;the &#x2018;what if you apply the theory to itself?&#x2019; problem looks pretty pervasive across theories.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt13\">[13]</a></sup>&#xA0;Accounts of moral uncertainty that in whatever sense involve weighing normative theories by their plausibility tend to run into problems if the same accounts are applied &#x2018;one level up&#x2019; to <span>meta</span><span>-moral uncertainty. Bayesian accounts of epistemology seem to go haywire if we think one should have a credence in Bayesian epistemology itself, especially if one assigns any non-zero credence on any theory which entails object level credences have undefined values. </span></p>\n<p>Closer to home, milder versions of conciliation (e.g. &#x201C;Pay some attention to peer disagreement, but it&#x2019;s not the only factor&#x201D;) share a similarly troublesome recursive loop (&#x201C;Well, I see most other people are steadfast, so I should update to be a bit less conciliatory, but now I have to apply my modified view to this disagreement again&#x201D;) and neat convergence is not guaranteed. The theories which avoid this problem (e.g. &#x2018;Wholly steadfast, so peer disagreement should be ignored&#x2019;), tend to be the least plausible on the object level (e.g. That if you believe bins are on Thursday, the fact all your neighbours have their bins out on Tuesday is not even <span>reason to reconsider</span><span>&#xA0;your belief).</span></p>\n<p>A solution to these types of problems remains elusive. Yet modesty finds itself in fairly good company.<span>&#xA0;It may be the case that a good resolution to this type of issue would rule out the strong form of modesty advocated here, in favour of some intermediate view. Until then, I hope the (admittedly inelegant) &#x201C;Be modest, save for meta-epistemic norms about modesty itself&#x201D; is not too great a cost to bear across the scales from the merits of the approach.</span></p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2><span>In practice</span></h2>\n<p><span>I take most of the action to surround whether modesty makes sense as a practical procedure in the real world, even granting it&#x2019;s &#x2018;in theory&#x2019; virtue. Given the strength of modesty, I advocate, the fact we use something like it in some cases, and we can identify it can help in others, is not enough. It needs to be shown as a better strategy than even slightly weaker forms, in circumstances deliberately selected to pose the greatest challenge to strong modesty. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Trivial (and less trivial) non-use cases</span></h3>\n<p><span>For some topics there&#x2019;s no relevant epistemic peers or superiors to consider. This is commonly the case with pretty trivial beliefs (e.g. my desk is yellow).</span></p>\n<p>Modesty also doesn&#x2019;t help much for individual tastes, idiosyncrasies, or circumstances. If Adam works best listening to Bach and Beatrice to Beethoven, they probably won&#x2019;t do better &#x2018;meeting in the middle&#x2019; and both going half-and-half for each (or maybe picking a composer intermediate in history, like Mozart). Anyway, Adam is probably Beatrice&#x2019;s significant epistemic <span>superior</span>&#xA0;on &#x201C;What music does <span>Adam</span>&#xA0;work best listening to?&#x201D;, and vice-versa. One can also be credulous of claims like &#x201C;It turned out this diet really helped my back pain&#x201D;: perhaps it&#x2019;s placebo, or perhaps it is one of those cases where different things work for different people, and one expects in such cases individuals to have privileged access to what worked for them.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt14\">[14]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>There will be cases where one really is plowing a lonely furrow where there aren&#x2019;t any close epistemic peers or superiors. It&#x2019;s possible I really am the world&#x2019;s leading expert on &#x201C;How many counter-factual DALYs does a doctor avert during their career?&#x201D;, because no one else has really looked into this question. My current role involves investigating global catastrophic biological risks, which appears understudied to the point of being pre-paradigmatic. </span></p>\n<p>These comprise a very small minority of topics I have credences about. Yet even here modesty can help. One can use more distant bodies of experts: I am reassured that my autumnal estimate for the &#x2018;DALY question&#x2019; coheres with expert consensus that medical practice had a minor role in improvements to human health, for example. Even if I don&#x2019;t have any epistemic peers, I can <span>simulate</span>&#xA0;some by asking, &#x201C;If there were lots of people as or more reasonable&#xA0;than me looking at this, would I expect them to agree with my take?&#x201D; Given that the econometric-esque methods I deploy to the answer the &#x2018;DALY question&#x2019; could probably be done better by an expert, and in any case reasonable people are often sceptical of these in other areas, I am less confident of my findings than my &#x2018;inside view&#x2019; suggests, which I take to be a welcome corrective to &#x2018;pet argument&#x2019; biases.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt15\">[15]</a></sup>&#xA0; &#xA0;<span>&#xA0; </span></p>\n<h3><span>In theory, the world should be mad</span></h3>\n<p>Whether devoured by Moloch, burned by Ra, trapped by aberrant signalling equilibria, or whatever else, we can expect to predict when apparent expert classes (and apparent epistemic peers) are going to collectively go wrong. With this knowledge, we can know which topics we should expect to ourselves to outperform expertise. Rather than the scenario where we commonly find ourselves looking <span>up</span>&#xA0;(at experts) or <span>around</span><span>&#xA0;(at our peers), we find ourselves in many situations where those who are usually epistemic peers or superiors are below us - and above us, only sky. </span></p>\n<p>We could distinguish two sorts of madness, a surprising <span>absence</span>&#xA0;of expertise and a surprising <span>error </span><span>of expertise: </span></p>\n<p>The former is a gap in the epistemic market. Although an important topic <span>should</span><span>&#xA0;be combed over by a body of experts, for whatever reason it isn&#x2019;t, and so it takes surprisingly little effort to climb to the summit of epistemic superiority. In such cases our summaries of expert classes as ranging over a broad area conceal the degree of expertise is very patchy: public health experts generally know a great deal about the health impacts of smoking; they usually know much less about the health impacts of nicotine.</span></p>\n<p>The latter is a stronger debunking argument. One appeals to some features of the world that generates expertise and suggests that these expertise generating features are <span>anti-correlated to the truth</span><span>, thus one can adjudicate between warring expert camps (or just indict all so-called &#x2018;experts&#x2019;) based on this knowledge. One strong predictor of incompatibilism regarding free will among philosophers is believing in God. If we are confident these beliefs in God are irrational, then we can winnow the expert class by this consideration and side with the compatibilist camp much more strongly. </span></p>\n<p>Yet, similar to the problems of debunking mentioned earlier, that there is a good story suggesting one of these things does not imply one will do better &#x2018;striking out on one&apos;s own&#x2019;. Even in cases of disease where accuracy is poorly correlated to expert activity, it is hard to think of cases where these line up orthogonal or worse. Big pharma studies are infamous, but even if you&#x2019;re in big pharma optimising for &#x2018;can I get evidence to support my product&#x2019;, your drug <span>actually working</span><span>&#xA0;does make this easier. Even in pre-replication crisis psychology, true results would be overrepresented versus false ones in the literature compared to some base rate across generated hypotheses.</span></p>\n<p>The &#x2018;residual&#x2019; expert class still often remains better. Although most public health experts know little about nicotine per se, there are some nearby health experts, perhaps scattered across our common-sense demarcation of fields, who do know about the impacts of nicotine. It may still take quite a lot of <span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gwern.net/Nicotine&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926174000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGKDJ10pWROgwXPRXAYw-eWjwth-w\">effort</a></span>&#xA0;to reach parity or superiority to these. Even if we want to strike all theists from free will philosophers, compatibilism does not rise close to unanimity, and so cautions against extremely high confidence this is the correct view.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt16\">[16]</a></sup>&#xA0;So, I aver, the world is not <span>that</span><span>&#xA0;mad.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Empirically, the world is mad</span></h3>\n<p><span>One can offer a more direct demonstration of world-madness, and so refute modesty: outperformance.</span></p>\n<p><span>A common reply is to point to a particular case where those being modest would have gotten it wrong. There are lots of cases where amateurs and mavericks were ridiculed by common sense or experts-at-the-time, only to be subsequently vindicated.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another problem is the modest view introduces a lag - it seems one often needs to wait for the new information to take root among one&#x2019;s epistemic peers before changing one&#x2019;s view, whilst a cogniser just relying on the object level updates on correct arguments &#x2018;at first sight&#x2019;. It is often crucially important to be fast as well as right in both empirical and moral matters: it is extremely costly if a view makes one slower to recognise (among many other past moral catastrophes) the horror of slavery.</span></p>\n<p>Yet modesty need not infallible, merely an improvement. Citing cases where it goes poorly is (hopefully less than) half the story. Modesty does worse in cases the maverick is right, yet better where the maverick is wrong: there are more cases of the latter than the former. Modesty does worse in being sluggish in responding to moral revolutions, yet better at avoiding being swept away by waves of mistaken sentiment: again, the latter seem more common than the former.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt17\">[17]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Maybe one can follow a strategy such that you can &#x2018;pick the hits&#x2019; of when to carve out exceptions, and so have a superior track record.

They appear by my lights to be unable to judiciously &#x2018;pick their battles&#x2019;, staking out radical views in topics where there <span>isn&#x2019;t</span>&#xA0;a good story as to why the experts would be getting this wrong (still less why they&#x2019;re more likely to get it right). So although they do get big wins, the modal outcome of their contrarian take is a bust.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt18\">[18]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>Modesty should price in the views of better-than-chance contrarians into how it weighs consensus. Confidence in a consensus view should fall if a good contrarian takes aim at it, but not so much one now takes the contrarian view oneself. If one happens to be a particularly successful contrarian one should follow the same approach: &#x201C;I get these right surprisingly often, but I&#x2019;m still wrong more often than not, so it might be worth it to look into this further to see if I can strike gold, but until then I should bank on the consensus view.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<h2><span>Expert groups are seldom in reflective equilibrium</span></h2>\n<p><span>Even if modesty works well in the ideal case of a clearly identified &#x2018;expert class&#x2019;, it can get a lot messier in reality:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Suppose one is in the early 1940s and asks, &#x201C;Is there going to be explosives with many orders of magnitude more power than current explosives?&#x201D; One can imagine if one consulted explosive experts (however we cash that out), their consensus would generally say &#x2018;no&#x2019;. If one was able to talk to the physicists working on the Manhattan project, they would say &#x2018;yes&#x2019;. Which one should an outside view believe?<sup><a href=\"#ftnt19\">[19]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Most people believe god exists (the so called &#x2018;<span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.newappsblog.com/2012/05/the-common-consent-argument-for-gods-existence-and-cognitive-science-of-religion.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926178000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUePiUINo-pQHCwbegLKv5iW-d_g\">common consent argument</a></span>&#xA0;for God&#x2019;s existence&#x2019;); if one looks at potential expert classes (e.g. philosophers, people who are more intelligent), most of them are Atheists. Yet if one looks at philosophers of religion (who spend a lot of time on arguments for or against God&#x2019;s existence), most of <span>them</span>&#xA0;are Theists - but maybe there&#x2019;s a <span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://crucialconsiderations.org/rationality/theism-and-expert-knowledge/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926178000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkRddXIUlqSw9HrBMy92qeZAUJDQ\">gradient</a></span>&#xA0;within them too. Which group, exactly, should be weighed most heavily?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So constructing the ideal &#x2018;weighted consensus&#x2019; modesty recommends deferring to can become a pretty involved procedure. One must carefully divine whether a given topic lies closer to the magisterium of one or another putative expert class (e.g. maybe one should lean more to the physicists, as the question is really more &#x2018;about physics&#x2019; than &#x2018;about explosives&#x2019;). One might have to carefully weigh up the relevant epistemic virtues of various expert classes that appear far from reflective equilibrium from one another (so perhaps one might use likely selection effect of philosophy of religion party discount the apparent support this provides). One might have to delve into complicated issues of independence: although most people may believe god exists, unlike guesses of how many skittles are in the jar, they are not all forming this belief independently from one another.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt20\">[20]</a></sup></p>\n<p>This exercise begins to look increasingly insider-view-esque. Trying to determine the right magisterium involves getting closer to object level considerations about &#x2018;aboutness&#x2019; of topics; trying to tease apart issues of independence and selection amount to looking at belief forming practices, and veer close to object level justifications for the belief in question. At some point it becomes extraordinarily challenging to try and back-trace from all these factors to the likely position of the ideal observer: the degrees of freedom these considerations invite (and the challenge in estimating them reliably) <span>make strong modesty go worse.</span></p>\n<p>One should not give up too early, though: modesty can still work pretty well even in these tricky cases. One can ask whether there&#x2019;s any communication between the classes, and if so any direction of travel (e.g. did some explosive experts end up talking to the physicists, and agreeing they were right? Vice-versa?), even if they were completely isolated, one can ask if a third group having access to both made a decision (e.g. the agreement of the U.S. and German governments with the implied view of the physicists). This is a lot more involved, but the expected &#x2018;accuracy yield per unit time spent&#x2019; may still be greater than (for example) making a careful study of the relevant physics.<span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>A broader modification would be &#x2018;immodest only for the web of belief, but modest for the weights&#x2019;: one uses an inside view to piece together the graph of considerations around P, but one still defers to consensus on the weights. This may avoid cases where (for example) strong modesty may mistake astronomers as the expert class for about space travel being infeasible (versus primordial rocket scientists), even though astronomers and rocket scientists agreed about the necessary acceleration, but astronomers were inexpert on the key question as to whether that explanation could be produced.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt21\">[21]</a></sup></p>\n<p>What if one cannot even do that? Then modestly (rightly) offers a counsel of despair. If an area is so fractious there&#x2019;s no agreement, with no way to see which of numerous of disparate camps have better access the truth of the matter; so suffused with bias that even those with apparent epistemic virtues (e.g. judgement, intelligence, subject-matter knowledge) cannot be seen to even <span>tend</span><span>&#xA0;towards the truth; what hope does one have to do better than they? In attempting to thread the needle through these hazards towards the right judgement, one will almost certainly run aground somewhere or somehow, alike all one&apos;s epistemic peers or superiors who made the attempt before. Perhaps reality obliges us to undertake these doxastic suicide missions from time to time. If modesty cannot help us, it can at least provide the solace of a pre-emptive funeral, rather than (as immodest views would) cheer us on to our almost certain demise. </span></p>\n<h4><span>Somewhat satisfying Shulman &#xA0;</span></h4>\n<p><span>Carl Shulman encourages me to offer my credences and rationale in cases he takes to be particularly difficult for my view, and suggests in these cases I either arrive at absurd credences or I am covertly abandoning the strong modesty approach.

Suppose in the original example Beatrice does what I suggest and revise their credences to be 0.6, but Adam doesn&#x2019;t. Now Charlie forms his own view (say 0.4 as well) and does the same procedure as Beatrice, so Charlie now holds a credence of 0.6 as well. The average should be lower: (0.8+0.4+0.4)/3, not (0.8+<span>0.6</span><span>+0.4)/3, but the results are distorted by using one-and-a-half helpings of Adam&#x2019;s credence. With larger cases one can imagine people wrongly deferring to hold consensus around a view they should think is implausible, and in general the nigh-intractable challenge from trying to infer cases of double counting from the patterns of &#x2018;all things considered&#x2019; evidence.</span></p>\n<p>One can rectify this by distinguishing &#x2018;credence by my lights&#x2019; versus &#x2018;credence all things considered&#x2019;. So one can say &#x201C;Well, by my lights the credence of P is 0.8, but my actual credence is 0.6, once I account for the views of my epistemic peers etc.&#x201D; Ironically, one&#x2019;s personal &#x2018;inside view&#x2019; of the evidence is usually the most helpful credence to publicly report (as it helps others modestly aggregate), whilst ones all things considered modest view usually for <span>private</span>&#xA0;consumption<span>.</span></p>\n<h3>Community benefits to<span>&#xA0;immodesty</span></h3>\n<p>Modesty could be parasitic on a community level. If one is modest, one need never trouble oneself with any &#x2018;object level&#x2019; considerations at all, and simply cultivate the appropriate weighting of consensuses to defer to. If everyone free-rode like that, no one would discover any new evidence, have any new ideas, and so collectively stagnate.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt23\">[23]</a></sup>&#xA0;Progress only happens if people get their hands dirty on the object-level matters of the world, try to build models, and make some guesses - sometimes the experts have gotten it wrong, and one won&#x2019;t ever find that out by deferring to them based on the fact they usually get it right.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt24\">[24]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>The distinction between &#x2018;credence by my lights&#x2019; versus &#x2018;credence all things considered&#x2019; allows the best of both worlds.&#xA0;One can say &#x2018;by my lights, P&#x2019;s credence is X&#x2019; yet at the same time &#x2018;all things considered though, I take P&#x2019;s credence to be Y&#x2019;. One can form one&#x2019;s own model of P, think the experts are wrong about P, and marshall evidence and arguments for why you are right and they are wrong; yet soberly realise that the chances are you are more likely mistaken; <span>yet also </span><span>think this effort is nonetheless valuable because even if one is most likely heading down a dead-end, the corporate efforts of people like you promises a good chance of someone finding a better path.</span></p>\n<p>Scott Sumner seems to do something <span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/05/why_bryan_capla_1.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926189000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5rY2Mxms4Sy4vpDJcJfhr-01iPA\">similar</a></span><span>:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>In macro, it&apos;s important for people like me to always search for the truth, and reach conclusions about economic models in a way that is independent of the consensus model. In that way, I play my &quot;worker ant&quot; role of nudging the profession towards a greater truth. But at the same time we need to recognize that there is nothing special about our view. If we are made dictator, we should implement the consensus view of optimal policy, not our own. People have trouble with this, as it implies two levels of belief about what is true. The view from inside our mind, and the view from 20,000 miles out in space, where I see there is no objective reason to favor my view over Krugman&apos;s.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Despite this example, maybe it is the case that &#x2018;having a creative brain which makes big discoveries&#x2019; is anticorrelated to &#x2018;having a sober brain well-calibrated to its limitations compared to others&#x2019;: anecdotally, eccentric views among geniuses are common. Maybe for most it isn&#x2019;t psychologically tenable to spend one&apos;s life investigating a renegade view one thinks ultimately is likely a dead-end, and in fact people do groundbreaking research generally have to be overconfident to do the best science. If so, we should act communally to moderate this cost<span>, but not celebrate it as a feature.</span></p>\n<p>Not <span>everyone</span><span>&#xA0;has to do be working on discovering new information. One could imagine a symbiosis between eccentric overconfident geniuses whose epistemic comparative advantage is to who gambol around idea-space to find new considerations, and well-calibrated thoughtful people whose comparative advantage is in soberly weighing considerations to arrive at a well callibrated all-things-considered view. </span></p>\n<h1>&#xA0;</h1>\n<h1><span>Conclusion: a pean, and a plea</span></h1>\n<p><span>I have argued above for a strong approach to modesty, one which implies - at least in terms of &#x2018;all things considered view&#x2019; - one&#x2019;s view of the object level merits counts for very little. Even if I am mistaken about the ideal strength of modesty, I am highly confident both the EA and rationalist communities err in the &#x2018;insufficiently modest&#x2019; direction. I close on these remarks.</span></p>\n<h2>Rationalist/EA exceptionalism<span>&#xA0;</span></h2>\n<p>Both communities endure a steady ostinato of complaints about arrogance. They&#x2019;ve got a point. I despair of seeing some wannabe-iconoclast spout off about how <span>obviously</span>&#xA0;the solution to some famously recondite issue is X and the supposed experts who disagree obviously just need to better understand the &#x2018;tenets of EA&#x2019; or the sequences. I become <span>lachrymose</span>&#xA0;when further discussion demonstrates said iconoclast has a shaky grasp of the basics, that they are recapitulating points already better-discussed in the literature, and so forth.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt25\">[25]</a></sup></p>\n<p>To stress (and to pre-empt), the problem is not, &#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t kowtowing appropriately to social status!&#x201D; The problem is considerable over-confidence married with inadequate understanding. This both <span>looks</span>&#xA0;bad to outsiders,<sup><a href=\"#ftnt26\">[26]</a></sup>&#xA0;but it also <span>is</span><span>&#xA0;bad as the individual (and the community itself) could get to the truth faster if they were more modest about their likely position in the distribution of knowledge about X, and then did commonsensical things to increase it. </span></p>\n<p>Consider Gell-Mann amnesia (<span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/65213-briefly-stated-the-gell-mann-amnesia-effect-is-as-follows-you&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926191000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHUdRda2v6vVkiC5G25-kDNVZlQvw\">via</a></span><span>&#xA0;Michael Crichton):</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray&apos;s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward&#x2014;reversing cause and effect. I call these the &quot;wet streets cause rain&quot; stories. Paper&apos;s full of them.</span></p>\n<p><span>In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gell-Mann cases invite inferring adverse judgements based on extrapolating from in instance of poor performance. When experts in <span>multiple different subjects</span><span>&#xA0;say the same thing (i.e. Murray and Crichton chatted to an expert on Palestine who had the same impression), this adverse inference gets all the stronger. </span></p>\n<p><span>Some, perhaps many, pieces of work or corporate projects in our community share this property: it might look good or groundbreaking to us as relatively less-informed, domain experts in the fields it touches upon tend to report it is misguided or rudimentary. Although it is possible to indict all these judgements, akin to a person who gives very adverse accounts of all of their previous romantic partners, we may start to wonder about a common factor explanation. Our collective ego is writing checks our epistemic performance (or, in candour, performance generally) cannot cash; general ignorance, rather than particular knowledge, may explain our self-regard.</span></p>\n<h2><span>To discover, not summarise</span></h2>\n<p><span>It is thought that to make the world go better new things need to be discovered, above and beyond making sound judgements on existing knowledge. Quickly making accurate determinations of the balance of reason for a given issue is greatly valuable for the latter, but not so much for the former.</span></p>\n<p>Yet the two should not be confused. If one writes a short overview of a subject &#x2018;for internal consumption&#x2019; which gives a fairly good impression of what a particular view should be, one should not be too worried if a specialist complains that you haven&#x2019;t covered all the topics as adequately as one might. However, if one is aiming to write something which articulates an insight or understanding not just novel to the community, but novel <span>to the world</span><span>, one should be extremely concerned if domain experts review this work and say things along the lines of, &#x201C;Well, this is sort of a potted recapitulation of work in our field, and this insight is widely discussed&#x201D;.</span></p>\n<p>Yet I see this happen a lot to things we tout as &#x2018;breakthrough discoveries&#x2019;. We want to avoid case where we waste our time in unwitting recapitulation, or fail to catch elementary mistakes. Yet too often we license ourselves to pronounce these discoveries without sufficient modesty in cases where there&#x2019;s already a large expert community working on similar matters. This does not <span>preclude</span>&#xA0;these discoveries, but it cautions us to <span>carefully check first</span>. On occasions where I take myself to have a new insight in areas outside my field (most often philosophy), I am <span>extremely suspect</span>&#xA0;of my supposed discovery: all too often would this arise from my misunderstanding, or already be in the literature somewhere I haven&#x2019;t looked.

More generally, a more modest view of &#x2018;intra-community versus outside competence&#x2019; may also avoid cases of having to reinvent the wheel (e.g. that scoring rule you spent six months deriving for a karma system is in this canonical paper), or for an effort to derail (e.g. oh drat, our evaluation provides worthless data because of reasons we could have known from googling &#x2018;study design&#x2019;).</span></p>\n<h2>Paradoxically pathological modesty<span>&#xA0;</span></h2>\n<p><span>If the EA and rationalist communities comprised a bunch of highly overconfident and eccentric people buzzing around bumping their pet theories together, I may worry about overall judgement and how much novel work gets done, but I would at grant this at least looks like fertile ground for new ideas to be developed.</span></p>\n<p>Alas, not so much. What occurs instead is agreement approaching fawning obeisance to a small set of people the community anoints as &#x2018;thought leaders&#x2019;, and so centralizing on <span>one</span>&#xA0;particular eccentric and overconfident view.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt28\">[28]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;So although we may preach immodesty on behalf of the wider community, our practice within it is much more deferential.</span></p>\n<p>I hope a better understanding of modesty can get us out of this &#x2018;worst of both worlds&#x2019; scenario. It can at least provide better &#x2018;gurus&#x2019; to defer to. Better, modesty also helps to correct two mistaken impressions: one, overly wide gap between our gurus and other experts; two, the overly narrow gap between &#x2018;intelligent layperson in the community&#x2019; and &#x2018;someone able to contribute to the state of the art&apos;. Some topics are <span>really hard</span>: being able to become someone with &#x2018;something useful to say&#x2019; about these not take days but take <span>years</span><span>; there are many deep problems we must concern ourselves with; that the few we select as champions, despite their virtue, cannot do them all alone; and that we need all the outside help we can get.</span></p>\n<h2>Coda</h2>\n<p>What the EA community mainly has now is a briar-patch of dilettantes: each ranges widely, but with shallow roots, forming whorls around others where it deems it can find support.

I suggest (although this is not necessary for this argument) that in many cases most of the action lies in judging the &#x2018;power&#x2019; of evidence. In most cases I observe people agree that a given consideration C influences the credence one holds in P; they usually also agree in its qualitative direction; the challenge comes in trying to weigh each consideration against the others, to see which considerations one&#x2019;s credence over P should pay the greatest attention to.</span></p>\n<p><span>This may represent</span><span>&#xA0;a general feature of webs of belief being dense and many-many (A given credence is influenced by many other considerations, and forms a consideration for many credences in turn</span><span>), or it may simply be a particular feature of webs of belief in which humans perform poorly: although I am confident I can determine the sign of a particular consideration, I generally don&#x2019;t back myself to hold credences (or likelihood ratios) to much greater precision than the first significant digit, and I (and, perhaps, others) struggle in cases where large numbers of considerations point in both directions. &#xA0; </span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref3\">[3]</a><span>&#xA0;In the literature this is called &#x2018;straight averaging&#x2019;.

Yet (given epistemic peerhood), they have no principled reason to suppose &#x201C;I know something that they don&#x2019;t&#x201D; is more plausible than the opposite. So again they should be symmetrical.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref6\">[6]</a><span>&#xA0;(On which more later) it is worth making clear that the possibility of bias for either Adam or Beatrice doesn&#x2019;t change the winning strategy on expectation. Say Adam&#x2019;s credence for P is in fact biased upwards by 0.4. If Adam knows this, he can adjust and become unbiased, if Oliver or Beatrice knows this (and knows Adam doesn&#x2019;t), the break the peerhood for Adam but can </span><span>simulate</span><span>&#xA0;unbiased Adam* which would remain a peer, and act accordingly. If none of them know this, then it is the case that Beatrice wins, as does Oliver following a non-averaging &#x2018;go with Beatrice&#x2019; strategy. Yet this is simply epistemic luck: without information, all reasonable prior distribution candidates of (Adam&#x2019;s bias - Beatrice&#x2019;s bias) are symmetrical about 0. &#xA0; </span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref7\">[7]</a><span>&#xA0;Another benefit of modesty is speed: Although it is the case Adam and Beatrice&#x2019;s credence (and thus the average) gets more accurate if they have time to discuss it, and so catch one another if they make a mistake or reveal previously-private evidence, averaging is faster and the trade-off in time for better precision may not be worth it. It still remains the case, as per the first example, that they still do better, </span><span>after</span><span>&#xA0;this discussion, if they meet in the middle on residual disagreement.</span><span>&#xA0; </span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref8\">[8]</a><span>&#xA0;A further (albeit minor and technical) dividend is that although individual guesses may form any distribution (for which the standard deviation may not be a helpful summary), the central limit theorem applies to the average of guesses distribution, so it tends to normality. &#xA0;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref9\">[9]</a><span>&#xA0;Even if one is the world authority, there should be some deference to lesser experts.

Very volatile credences may represent the buffeting of a degree of belief by evidence large relative to one&apos;s prior - but it may also represent poor calibration in overweighing new evidence (and vice versa). The &#x2018;ideal&#x2019; response in terms of accuracy is given by standard theory. Yet it is also worth noting that&#x2019;s one prudential reasons may want to introduce further lag or lead, akin to the &#x2018;D&#x2019; or &#x2018;I&#x2019; components of a </span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1509307926204000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbexuDVVYGsSj_6_ViKcMFiKuhKQ\">PID controller</a></span><span>. In large irreversible decisions (e.g. career choice) it may be better to wait a while after one&#x2019;s credences support a change to change action; for case of new moral consideration it may be better to act &#x2018;in advance&#x2019; for precautionary principle-esque reasons.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref18\">[18]</a><span>&#xA0;(Owed to Will MacAskill) There&#x2019;s also a selection effect: of a sample of &#x2018;accurate contrarians&#x2019;, many of these may be lucky rather than good.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref19\">[19]</a><span>&#xA0;I owe this particular example to Eric Drexler, but similar counter-examples along these lines to Carl Shulman.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref20\">[20]</a><span>&#xA0;Another general worry is these difficult-to-divine considerations offer plenty of fudge factors - both to make modesty get the &#x2018;right answer&#x2019; in historical cases, and to fudge present areas of uncertainty to get results that accord with one&#x2019;s prior judgement. </span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref21\">[21]</a><span>&#xA0;I owe both this modification and example to discussions with Eric Drexler. There are some costs - one may think there are cases one should defer to an outside view on the web of belief (E.g. Christian apologist: &#x201C;Sure, I agree with scientific consensus that it&#x2019;s improbable Jesus rose </span><span>naturally</span><span>&#xA0;from the dead, but the key argument is whether Jesus rose </span><span>supernaturally</span><span>&#xA0;from the dead.

First chapter below, with the rest to follow over the coming days.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This is a book about two incompatible views on the age-old question: &#x201C;When should I think that I may be able to do something <em>unusually well</em>?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>These two viewpoints tend to give wildly different, nearly <em>cognitively nonoverlapping</em> analyses of questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>My doctor says I need to eat less and exercise, but a lot of educated-sounding economics bloggers are talking about this thing called the &#x201C;Shangri-La Diet.&#x201D; They&#x2019;re saying that in order to lose weight, all you need to do is consume large quantities of flavorless, high-calorie foods at particular times of day; and they claim some amazing results with this diet. <em>Could they really know better than my doctor? Would I be able to tell if they did?</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My day job is in artificial intelligence and decision theory. And I recall the dark days before 2015, when there was plenty of effort and attention going into advancing the state of the art in AI capabilities, but almost none going into AI alignment: better understanding AI designs and goals that can safely scale with capabilities. Though interest in the alignment problem has since increased quite a bit, it still makes sense to ask whether <em>at the time</em> I should have inferred from the lack of academic activity that there was no productive work to be done here; since <em>if there were reachable fruits, wouldn&#x2019;t academics be taking them</em>?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Should I try my hand at becoming an entrepreneur? Whether or not it should be difficult to spot promising ideas in a scientific field, it certainly can&#x2019;t be easy to think up a profitable idea for a new startup. <em>Will I be able to find any good ideas that aren&#x2019;t already taken?</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The effective altruism community is a network of philanthropists and researchers that try to find the very best ways to benefit others per dollar, in full generality. Where should effective altruism organizations like GiveWell expect to find low-hanging fruit&#x2014;neglected interventions ripe with potential? <em>Where should they look to find things that our civilization isn&#x2019;t already doing about as well as can be done?</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I think about problems like these, I use what feels to me like a natural generalization of the economic idea of efficient markets. The goal is to predict what kinds of efficiency we should expect to exist in realms beyond the marketplace, and what we can deduce from simple observations. For lack of a better term, I will call this kind of thinking <em>inadequacy analysis.</em></p>\n<p>Toward the end of this book, I&#x2019;ll try to refute an alternative viewpoint that is increasingly popular among some of my friends, one that I think is ill-founded. This viewpoint is the one I&#x2019;ve previously termed &#x201C;modesty,&#x201D; and the message of modesty tends to be: &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t expect to be able to do <em>X</em> that isn&#x2019;t usually done, since you could just be deluding yourself into thinking you&#x2019;re better than other people.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll open with a cherry-picked example that I think helps highlight the difference between these two viewpoints.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>i.</h2>\n<p>I once wrote a report, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf\">Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics</a>,&#x201D; that called for an estimate of the economic growth rate in a fully developed country&#x2014;that is, a country that is no longer able to improve productivity just by importing well-tested innovations. A footnote of the paper remarked that even though Japan was the country with the most advanced technology&#x2014;e.g., their cellphones and virtual reality technology were five years ahead of the rest of the world&#x2019;s&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t going to use Japan as my estimator for developed economic growth, because, as I saw it, Japan&#x2019;s monetary policy was utterly deranged.</p>\n<p>Roughly, Japan&#x2019;s central bank wasn&#x2019;t creating enough money. I won&#x2019;t go into details here.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine, and one of the most careful thinkers I know&#x2014;let&#x2019;s call him &#x201C;John&#x201D;&#x2014;made a comment on my draft to this effect:</p>\n<p>How do you claim to know this? I can think of plenty of other reasons why Japan could be in a slump: the country&#x2019;s shrinking and aging population, its low female workplace participation, its high levels of product market regulation, etc. It looks like you&#x2019;re venturing outside of your area of expertise to no good end.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;How do you claim to know this?&#x201D; is a very reasonable question here. As John later elaborated, macroeconomics is an area where data sets tend to be thin and predictive performance tends to be poor. And John had previously observed me making contrarian claims where I&#x2019;d turned out to be badly wrong, like endorsing Gary Taubes&#x2019; theories about the causes of the obesity epidemic. More recently, John won money off of me by betting that AI performance on certain metrics would improve faster than I expected; John has a good track record when it comes to spotting my mistakes.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s also easy to imagine reasons an observer might have been skeptical. I wasn&#x2019;t making up my critique of Japan myself; I was reading other economists and deciding that I trusted the ones who were saying that the Bank of Japan was doing it wrong&#x2026; &#x2026; Yet one would expect the governing board of the Bank of Japan to be composed of experienced economists with specialized monetary expertise. How likely is it that any outsider would be able to spot an obvious flaw in their policy? How likely is it that someone who isn&#x2019;t a professional economist (e.g., me) would be able to judge which economic critiques of the Bank of Japan were correct, or which critics were wise?</p>\n<p>How likely is it that an entire country&#x2014;one of the world&#x2019;s most advanced countries&#x2014;would forego trillions of dollars of real economic growth because their monetary controllers&#x2014;not politicians, but appointees from the professional elite&#x2014;were doing something so wrong that even a non-professional could tell? How likely is it that a non-professional could not just suspect that the Bank of Japan was doing something badly wrong, but be <em>confident</em> in that assessment?</p>\n<p>Surely it would be more <em>realistic</em> to search for possible reasons why the Bank of Japan might not be as stupid as it seemed, as stupid as some econbloggers were claiming. Possibly Japan&#x2019;s aging population made growth impossible. Possibly Japan&#x2019;s massive outstanding government debt made even the slightest inflation too dangerous. Possibly we just aren&#x2019;t thinking of the complicated reasoning going into the Bank of Japan&#x2019;s decision.</p>\n<p>Surely some <em>humility</em> is appropriate when criticizing the elite decision-makers governing the Bank of Japan. What if it&#x2019;s you, and not the professional economists making these decisions, who have failed to grasp the relevant economic considerations?</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll refer to this genre of arguments as &#x201C;modest epistemology.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In conversation, John clarified to me that he rejects this genre of arguments; but I hear these kinds of arguments fairly often. The head of an effective altruism organization once gave voice to what I would consider a good example of this mode of thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I find it helpful to admit to unpleasant facts that will necessarily be true in the abstract, in order to be more willing to acknowledge them in specific cases. For instance, I should expect a priori to be below average at half of things, and be 50% likely to be of below average talent overall; to know many people who I regard as better than me according to my values; to regularly make decisions that look silly ex post, and also ex ante; to be mistaken about issues on which there is expert disagreement about half of the time; to perform badly at many things I attempt for the first time; and so on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect shows that unskilled individuals often rate their own skill very highly. Specifically, although there does tend to be a correlation between how competent a person is and how competent they <em>guess</em> they are, this correlation is weaker than one might suppose. In the original study, people in the bottom two quartiles of actual test performance tended to think they did better than about 60% of test-takers, while people in the top two quartiles tended to think they did better than 70% of test-takers.</p>\n<p>This suggests that a typical person&#x2019;s guesses about how they did on a test are evidence, but not particularly powerful evidence: the top quartile is underconfident in how well they did, and the bottom quartiles are highly overconfident.</p>\n<p>Given all that, how can we gain much evidence from our belief that we are skilled? Wouldn&#x2019;t it be more prudent to remind ourselves of the base rate&#x2014;the prior probability of 50% that we are below average?</p>\n<p>Reasoning along similar lines, software developer Hal Finney has endorsed &#x201C;abandoning personal judgment on most matters in favor of the majority view.&#x201D; Finney notes that the <em>average</em> person&#x2019;s opinions would be more accurate (on average) if they simply deferred to the most popular position on as many issues as they could. For this reason:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I choose to adopt the view that in general, on most issues, the average opinion of humanity will be a better and less biased guide to the truth than my own judgment.</p>\n<p>[&#x2026;] I would suggest that although one might not always want to defer to the majority opinion, it should be the default position. Rather than starting with the assumption that one&#x2019;s own opinion is right, and then looking to see if the majority has good reasons for holding some other view, one should instead start off by following the majority opinion; and then only adopt a different view for good and convincing reasons. On most issues, the default of deferring to the majority will be the best approach. If we accept the principle that &#x201C;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&#x201D;, we should demand a high degree of justification for departing from the majority view. The mere fact that our own opinion seems sound would not be enough.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1-definition\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this way, Finney hopes to correct for overconfidence and egocentric biases.</p>\n<p>Finney&#x2019;s view is an extreme case, but helps illustrate a pattern that I believe can be found in some more moderate and widely endorsed views. When I speak of &#x201C;modesty,&#x201D; I have in mind a fairly diverse set of positions that rest on a similar set of arguments and motivations.</p>\n<p>I once heard an Oxford effective altruism proponent crisply summarize what I take to be the central argument for this perspective: &#x201C;You see that someone says <em>X</em>, which seems wrong, so you conclude their epistemic standards are bad. But they could just see that you say <em>Y</em>, which sounds wrong to them, and conclude your epistemic standards are bad.&#x201D;<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2-definition\">2</a></sup> On this line of thinking, you don&#x2019;t get any information about who has better epistemic standards merely by observing that someone disagrees with you. After all, the other side observes just the same fact of disagreement.</p>\n<p>Applying this argument form to the Bank of Japan example: I receive little or no evidence just from observing that the Bank of Japan says &#x201C;<em>X</em>&#x201D; when I believe &#x201C;not <em>X</em>.&#x201D; I also can&#x2019;t be getting strong evidence from any object-level impression I might have that I am unusually competent. So did my priors imply that I and I alone ought to have been born with awesome powers of discernment? (Modest people have posed this exact question to me on more than one occasion.)</p>\n<p>It should go without saying that this isn&#x2019;t how I would explain my own reasoning. But if I reject arguments of the form, &#x201C;We disagree, therefore I&#x2019;m right and you&#x2019;re wrong,&#x201D; how can I claim to be correct on an economic question where I disagree with an institution as reputable as the Bank of Japan?</p>\n<p>The other viewpoint, opposed to modesty&#x2014;the view that I think is prescribed by normative epistemology (and also by more or less mainstream microeconomics)&#x2014;requires a somewhat longer introduction.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>ii.</h2>\n<p>By ancient tradition, every explanation of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis must open with the following joke:</p>\n<p>Two economists are walking along the street, and one says, &#x201C;Hey, someone dropped a $20 bill!&#x201D; and the other says, &#x201C;Well, it can&#x2019;t be a real $20 bill because someone would have picked it up already.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Also by ancient tradition, the next step of the explanation is to remark that while it may make sense to pick up a $20 bill you see on a relatively deserted street, if you think you have spotted a $20 bill lying on the floor of Grand Central Station (the main subway nexus of New York City), and it has stayed there for several hours, then it probably <em>is</em> a fake $20 bill, or it has been glued to the ground.</p>\n<p>In real life, when I asked a group of twenty relatively young people how many of them had ever found a $20 bill on the street, five raised their hands, and only one person had found a $20 bill on the street on two separate occasions. So the empirical truth about the joke is that while $20 bills on the street do exist, they&#x2019;re rare.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the implied policy is that if you do find a $20 bill on the street, you should go ahead and pick it up, because that does happen. It&#x2019;s not <em>that</em> rare. You certainly shouldn&#x2019;t start agonizing over whether it&#x2019;s too arrogant to believe that you have better eyesight than everyone else who has recently walked down the street.</p>\n<p>On the other other hand, you <em>should</em> start agonizing about whether to trust your own mental processes if you think you&#x2019;ve seen a $20 bill stay put for several hours on the floor of Grand Central Station. Especially if your explanation is that nobody else is eager for money.</p>\n<p>Is there any other domain such that if we <em>think</em> we see an exploitable possibility, we should sooner doubt our own mental competence than trust the conclusion we reasoned our way to?</p>\n<p>If I had to name the <em>single</em> epistemic feat at which modern human civilization is most adequate, the peak of all human power of estimation, I would unhesitatingly reply, &#x201C;Short-term relative pricing of liquid financial assets, like the price of S&amp;P 500 stocks relative to other S&amp;P 500 stocks over the next three months.&#x201D; This is something into which human civilization puts an <em>actual effort</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Millions of dollars are offered to smart, conscientious people with physics PhDs to induce them to enter the field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These people are then offered huge additional payouts conditional on actual performance&#x2014;especially outperformance relative to a baseline.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3-definition\">3</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Large corporations form to specialize in narrow aspects of price-tuning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They have enormous computing clusters, vast historical datasets, and competent machine learning professionals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They receive repeated news of success or failure in a fast feedback loop.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4-definition\">4</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The knowledge aggregation mechanism&#x2014;namely, prices that equilibrate supply and demand for the financial asset&#x2014;has proven to work beautifully, and acts to sum up the wisdom of all those highly motivated actors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An actor that spots a 1% systematic error in the aggregate estimate is rewarded with a billion dollars&#x2014;in a process that also corrects the estimate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Barriers to entry are not zero (<em>you</em> can&#x2019;t get the loans to make a billion-dollar corrective trade), but there are thousands of diverse intelligent actors who are all individually allowed to spot errors, correct them, and be rewarded, with no central veto.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;This is certainly not perfect, but it is <em>literally as good as it gets on modern-day Earth.</em></p>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t think I can beat the estimates produced by that process. I have no significant help to contribute to it. With study and effort I might become a decent hedge fundie and make a standard return. Theoretically, a liquid market should be just exploitable enough to pay competent professionals the same hourly rate as their next-best opportunity. I could potentially become one of those professionals, and earn standard hedge-fundie returns, but that&#x2019;s not the same as significantly improving on the market&#x2019;s efficiency. I&#x2019;m not sure I expect a huge humanly accessible opportunity of that kind to <em>exist</em>, not in the thickly traded centers of the market. Somebody <em>really would</em> have taken it already! Our civilization <em>cares</em> about whether Microsoft stock will be priced at $37.70 or $37.75 tomorrow afternoon.</p>\n<p>I can&#x2019;t predict a 5% move in Microsoft stock in the next two months, and <em>neither can you</em>. If your uncle tells an anecdote about how he tripled his investment in NetBet.com last year and he attributes this to his skill rather than luck, we know <em>immediately and out of hand</em> that he is wrong. Warren Buffett at the peak of his form couldn&#x2019;t reliably triple his money every year. If there is a strategy so simple that your uncle can understand it, which has apparently made him money&#x2014;then we guess that there were just hidden risks built into the strategy, and that in another year or with less favorable events he would have lost half as much as he gained. Any other possibility would be the equivalent of a $20 bill staying on the floor of Grand Central Station for ten years while a horde of physics PhDs searched for it using naked eyes, microscopes, and machine learning.</p>\n<p>In the thickly traded parts of the stock market, where the collective power of human civilization is truly at its strongest, I doff my hat, I put aside my pride and kneel in true humility to accept the market&#x2019;s beliefs as though they were my own, knowing that any impulse I feel to second-guess and every independent thought I have to argue otherwise is nothing but my own folly. If my perceptions suggest an exploitable opportunity, then my perceptions are far more likely mistaken than the markets. That is what it feels like to look upon a civilization doing something adequately.</p>\n<p>The converse side of the efficient-markets perspective would have said this about the Bank of Japan:</p>\n<p><strong>Conventional Cynical Economist:</strong> So, Eliezer, you think you know better than the Bank of Japan and many other central banks around the world, do you?</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong> Yep. Or rather, by reading econblogs, I believe myself to have identified which econbloggers know better, like Scott Sumner.</p>\n<p><strong>C.C.E.:</strong> Even though literally trillions of dollars of real value are at stake?</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong> Yep.</p>\n<p><strong>C.C.E.:</strong> How do you make money off this special knowledge of yours?</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong> I can&#x2019;t. The market also collectively knows that the Bank of Japan is pursuing a bad monetary policy and has priced Japanese equities accordingly. So even though I know the Bank of Japan&#x2019;s policy will make Japanese equities perform badly, that fact is already priced in; I can&#x2019;t expect to make money by short-selling Japanese equities.</p>\n<p><strong>C.C.E.:</strong> I see. So exactly who is it, on this theory of yours, that is being stupid and passing up a predictable payout?</p>\n<p><strong>Eliezer:</strong> Nobody, of course! Only the Bank of Japan is allowed to control the trend line of the Japanese money supply, and the Bank of Japan&#x2019;s governors are not paid any bonuses when the Japanese economy does better. They don&#x2019;t get a million dollars in personal bonuses if the Japanese economy grows by a trillion dollars.</p>\n<p><strong>C.C.E.:</strong> So you can&#x2019;t make any money off knowing better individually, and nobody who has the actual power and authority to fix the problem would gain a personal financial benefit from fixing it? Then we&#x2019;re done! No anomalies here; this sounds like a perfectly normal state of affairs.</p>\n<p>We don&#x2019;t usually expect to find $20 bills lying on the street, because even though people sometimes drop $20 bills, someone else will usually have a chance to pick up that $20 bill before we do.</p>\n<p>We don&#x2019;t think we can predict 5% price changes in S&amp;P 500 company stock prices over the next month, because we&#x2019;re competing against dozens of hedge fund managers with enormous supercomputers and physics PhDs, any one of whom could make millions or billions on the pricing error&#x2014;and in doing so, correct that error.</p>\n<p>We can expect it to be hard to come up with a truly good startup idea, and for even the best ideas to involve sweat and risk, because lots of other people are trying to think up good startup ideas. Though in this case we do have the advantage that we can pick our own battles, seek out <em>one</em> good idea that we think hasn&#x2019;t been done yet.</p>\n<p>But the Bank of Japan is just one committee, and it&#x2019;s not possible for anyone else to step up and make a billion dollars in the course of correcting their error. Even if you think you know exactly what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, you can&#x2019;t make a profit on that. At least some hedge-fund managers also know what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, and the expected consequences are already priced into the market. Nor does this price movement fix the Bank of Japan&#x2019;s mistaken behavior. So to the extent the Bank of Japan has poor incentives or some other systematic dysfunction, their mistake can persist. As a consequence, when I read some econbloggers who I&#x2019;d seen being right about empirical predictions before saying that Japan was being grotesquely silly, and the economic logic seemed to me to check out, as best I could follow it, I wasn&#x2019;t particularly reluctant to believe them. <em>Standard economic theory, generalized beyond the markets to other facets of society, did not seem to me to predict that the Bank of Japan must act wisely for the good of Japan.</em> It would be no surprise if they were competent, but also not much of a surprise if they were incompetent. And knowing this didn&#x2019;t help me either&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t exploit the knowledge to make an excess profit myself&#x2014;and this too wasn&#x2019;t a coincidence.</p>\n<p>This kind of thinking can get quite a bit more complicated than the foregoing paragraphs might suggest. We have to ask why the government of Japan didn&#x2019;t put pressure on the Bank of Japan (answer: they did, but the Bank of Japan refused), and many other questions. You would need to consider a much larger model of the world, and bring in a lot more background theory, to be confident that you understood the overall situation with the Bank of Japan.</p>\n<p>But even without that detailed analysis, in the epistemological background we have a completely different picture from the modest one. We have a picture of the world where it is perfectly plausible for an econblogger to write up a good analysis of what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, and for a sophisticated reader to reasonably agree that the analysis seems decisive, without a deep agonizing episode of Dunning-Kruger-inspired self-doubt playing any important role in the analysis.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iii.</h2>\n<p>When we critique a government, we don&#x2019;t usually get to see what would actually happen if the government took our advice. But in this one case, less than a month after my exchange with John, the Bank of Japan&#x2014;under the new leadership of Haruhiko Kuroda, and under unprecedented pressure from recently elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who included monetary policy in his campaign platform&#x2014;embarked on an attempt to print huge amounts of money, with a stated goal of doubling the Japanese money supply.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5-definition\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Immediately after, Japan experienced real GDP growth of 2.3%, where the previous trend was for falling RGDP. Their economy was operating that far under capacity due to lack of money.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6-definition\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Now, on the modest view, this was the unfairest test imaginable. Out of all the times that I&#x2019;ve ever suggested that a government&#x2019;s policy is suboptimal, the rare time a government tries my preferred alternative will select the most mainstream, highest-conventional-prestige policies I happen to advocate, and those are the very policy proposals that modesty is least likely to disapprove of.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if John had looked further into the issue, he would have found (as I found while writing this) that Nobel laureates had also criticized Japan&#x2019;s monetary policy. He would have found that previous Japanese governments had also hinted to the Bank of Japan that they should print more money. The view from modesty looks at this state of affairs and says, &#x201C;Hold up! You aren&#x2019;t so specially blessed as your priors would have you believe; other academics already know what you know! Civilization isn&#x2019;t so inadequate after all! This is how reasonable dissent from established institutions and experts operates in the real world: via opposition by other mainstream experts and institutions, not via the heroic effort of a lone economics blogger.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>However helpful or unhelpful such remarks may be for guarding against inflated pride, however, they don&#x2019;t seem to refute (or even address) the central thesis of civilizational <em>inadequacy</em>, as I will define that term later. Roughly, the civilizational inadequacy thesis states that in situations where the central bank of a major developed democracy is carrying out a policy, and a number of highly regarded economists like Ben Bernanke have written papers about what that central bank is doing wrong, and there are widely accepted macroeconomic theories for understanding what that central bank is doing wrong, and the government of the country has tried to put pressure on the central bank to stop doing it wrong, and literally <em>trillions</em> of dollars in real wealth are at stake, then <em>the overall competence of human civilization</em> is such that we shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to find the professional economists at the Bank of Japan doing it wrong.</p>\n<p>We shouldn&#x2019;t even be surprised to find that a decision theorist without all that much background in economics can identify which econbloggers have correctly stated what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, or which simple improvements to their current policies would improve the situation.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>iv.</h2>\n<p>It doesn&#x2019;t make much difference to my life whether I understand monetary policy better than, say, the European Central Bank, which as of late 2015 was repeating the same textbook mistake as the Bank of Japan and causing trillions of euros of damage to the European economy. Insofar as I have other European friends in countries like Italy, it might be important to them to know that Europe&#x2019;s economy is probably not going to get any better soon; or the knowledge might be relevant to predicting AI progress timelines to know whether Japan ran out of low-hanging technological fruit or just had bad monetary policy. But that&#x2019;s a rather distant relevance, and for most of my readers I would expect this issue to be even less relevant to their lives.</p>\n<p>But you run into the same implicit background questions of inadequacy analysis when, for example, you&#x2019;re making health care decisions. Cherry-picking another anecdote: My wife has a severe case of Seasonal Affective Disorder. As of 2014, she&#x2019;d tried sitting in front of a little lightbox for an hour per day, and it hadn&#x2019;t worked. SAD&#x2019;s effects were crippling enough for it to be worth our time to consider extreme options, like her spending time in South America during the winter months. And indeed, vacationing in Chile and receiving more exposure to actual sunlight <em>did</em> work, where lightboxes failed.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, the obvious next thought was: &#x201C;Empirically, dinky little lightboxes don&#x2019;t work. Empirically, the Sun does work. Next step: <em>more light</em>. Fill our house with more lumens than lightboxes provide.&#x201D; In short order, I had strung up sixty-five 60W-equivalent LED bulbs in the living room, and another sixty-five in her bedroom.</p>\n<p>Ah, but should I assume that my civilization is being <em>opportunistic</em> about seeking out ways to cure SAD, and that if putting up 130 LED light bulbs often worked when lightboxes failed, <em>doctors would already know about that</em>? Should the fact that putting up 130 light bulbs isn&#x2019;t a well-known next step after lightboxes convince me that my bright idea is probably not a good idea, because if it were, everyone would already be doing it? Should I conclude from my inability to find any published studies on the Internet testing this question that there is some fatal flaw in my plan that I&#x2019;m just not seeing?</p>\n<p>We might call this argument &#x201C;Chesterton&#x2019;s Absence of a Fence.&#x201D; The thought being: I shouldn&#x2019;t build a fence here, because if it were a good idea to have a fence here, someone would already have built it. The underlying question here is: How strongly should I expect that this extremely common medical problem has been thoroughly considered by my civilization, and that there&#x2019;s nothing new, effective, and unconventional that I can personally improvise?</p>\n<p>Eyeballing this question, my off-the-cuff answer&#x2014;based mostly on the impressions related to me by every friend of mine who has ever dealt with medicine on a research level&#x2014;is that I wouldn&#x2019;t <em>necessarily</em> expect any medical researcher ever to have done a formal experiment on the first thought that popped into my mind for treating this extremely common depressive syndrome. Nor would I strongly expect the intervention, if initial tests found it to be effective, to have received enough attention that I could Google it.</p>\n<p>But this is just my personal take on the adequacy of 21st-century medical research. Should I be nervous that this line of thinking is just an excuse? Should I fret about the apparently high estimate of my own competence implied by my thinking that I could find an obvious-seeming way to remedy SAD when <em>trained doctors</em> aren&#x2019;t talking about it and I&#x2019;m not a medical researcher? Am I going too far outside my own area of expertise and starting to think that I&#x2019;m good at everything?</p>\n<p>In practice, I didn&#x2019;t bother going through an agonizing fit of self-doubt along those lines. The systematic competence of human civilization with respect to treating mood disorders wasn&#x2019;t so apparent to me that I considered it a better use of resources to quietly drop the issue than to just lay down the ~$600 needed to test my suspicion. So I went ahead and ran the experiment. And as of early 2017, with two winters come and gone, Brienne seems to no longer have crippling SAD&#x2014;though it took a <em>lot</em> of light bulbs, including light bulbs in her bedroom that had to be timed to go on at 7:30am before she woke up, to sustain the apparent cure.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-7-definition\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>If you want to outperform&#x2014;if you want to do anything not usually done&#x2014;then you&#x2019;ll need to conceptually divide our civilization into areas of lower and greater competency. My view is that this is best done from a framework of incentives and the equilibria of those incentives&#x2014;which is to say, from the standpoint of microeconomics. This is the main topic I&#x2019;ll cover here.</p>\n<p>In the process, I will also make the case that modesty&#x2014;the part of this process where you go into an agonizing fit of self-doubt&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t actually helpful for figuring out when you might outperform some aspect of the equilibrium.</p>\n<p>But one should initially present a positive agenda in discussions like these&#x2014;saying first what you think is the correct epistemology, before inveighing against a position you think is wrong.</p>\n<p>So without further ado, in the next chapter I shall present a very simple framework for inadequate equilibria.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Cross-posted to <a href=\"https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/zsG9yKcriht2doRhM/inadequacy-and-modesty\">Less Wrong</a><!-- and <a href=\"https://equilibriabook.com\">equilibriabook.com</a>-->.

There is much to be gained from sharing knowledge, ideas, connections and encouragement within local EA communities, including an increase in talent working on</span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/\"> <span>top global issues</span></a><span> - possibly the largest </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/\"><span>bottleneck</span></a><span> of the EA movement. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>London is home to one of the</span><a href=\"/ea/1e1/ea_survey_2017_series_community_demographics/\"> <span>most concentrated and fastest-growing</span></a><span> EA communities in the world, as well as to many globally important institutions in politics, finance, tech, charity, academia and other areas. Already in London there are community leaders, events and career networks that are providing inspiration, advice and other support to people engaging with EA ideas.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Two experienced EA community builders are keen to work part-time supporting the EA community in London next year, under the guidance of others who have been growing and strengthening this community for the past 4 years. Effective Altruism London is seeking \u00a333,000 by 8th December 2017 to fund this work for 2018. The purpose of this document is to outline our plan for 2018, as well as to provide other information and considerations relevant to anyone considering Effective Altruism London as a giving opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>This document is mainly written for an audience familiar with EA. For an introduction to EA see </span><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/\"><span>here</span></a><span>, and for reasons why supporting the EA movement can be a particularly effective way to do good see </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/community/\"><span>here</span></a><span>,</span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/\"> <span>here</span></a><span> and</span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration/\"> <span>here</span></a><span>. But in a nutshell: EA is a global movement of people who have huge ambition to make the world a better place. They do not settle for making a difference; they want to make the most difference. They are passionate about doing the most good first, and particular causes and careers second - they switch their focus according to what the evidence and careful reasoning suggest is the most impactful, not the most rewarding. They see the challenge of prioritising when there are so many problems in the world and so few resources at their disposal, yet they have the audacity to try. They anticipate threats and opportunities in uncertain futures and do their best to help humanity steer a good course. And by drawing members of this movement together, we can help them to learn from, motivate and support each other to achieve far more than they could alone.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>-- Holly Morgan, Sam Hilton and David Nash (28th October 2017)</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>&nbsp;</h1>\n<h1><span>Summary</span></h1>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Our focus for 2018 will be to:</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Develop our capacity to provide community support for London\u2019s aspiring effective altruists in starting and leading high-impact careers and groups.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>We plan to have two part-time members of staff working on this.

Effective Altruism London</span></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>The EA community in London has been growing steadily over the last 4 years. In June 2016, the community funded Sam Hilton to spend a year building the community. The focus of this year was on raising awareness of EA, getting people engaged with the community and supporting and inspiring them to make their behaviour more altruistic and effective.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<h2><span>Our impact so far</span></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>We estimate that over this year we caused 900 people to attend our events, 240 people to attend multiple events, 175 small but significant changes to behaviour or beliefs, 12 Giving What We Can</span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\"> <span>pledges</span></a><span> and 6 other large (pledge-level) behaviour changes; we also supported 7 new EA sub-communities in London. With a direct financial cost per pledge-equivalent of around \u00a31,500, we estimate that we are in the same ball-park but slightly less effective than the more established EA organisations doing movement-building work.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>A full write-up of this work and the impact we had - including examples of individuals and sub-communities supported - can be found in our </span><a href=\"/ea/1fh/lessons_from_a_fulltime_community_builder_part_1/\"><span>impact assessment</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><strong><br></strong></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><span>\f</span></h1>\n<h1><span>Plans</span></h1>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<h2><span>A new focus for a new year</span></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>We have learned a lot in the past year and we think that by choosing a new focus we can lead to even more impact on the world.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667994856/mirroredImages/9feKRSCkSzWMKeGYG/l7rr3klsrhotapsia4tl.jpg\" alt=\"Photo editing_Cloud20171028.jpg\"></span></p>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2><span>Focus</span></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>For the next year our focus will be to:</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Develop our capacity to provide community support for London\u2019s aspiring effective altruists in starting and leading high-impact careers and groups</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>What do we mean by this?</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>\u201cfocus\u201d</span> <span>- 80-90% of our activity; remaining 10-20% maximising impact in other ways</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>\u201cdevelop our capacity\u201d </span><span>- prioritise activities that put us in a better position to support the community in future years e.g. starting a community database, personal skill-building, gathering data relating to what does and doesn\u2019t work</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>\u201ccommunity support\u201d</span><span> -

If you are currently considering donating to us, we first encourage you to see if you find any of the following reasons to </span><span>not </span><span>fund us compelling.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>We can separate reasons to not fund Effective Altruism London into two categories: reasons mainly stemming from the plans as laid out in this document and reasons mainly relating to funding a local EA group in London regardless of the plans. It should be noted that if you have strong disagreements with the specific plans then we want to hear from you. We are very open to critical feedback and to adjusting our plans based on the views of the London EA and wider EA communities.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>The following reasons are those that we find most compelling.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<h2><span>Reasons to not fund a local EA group in London</span></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Local groups rarely have sufficient evidence of impact to warrant substantial investment</span><span> - The purported impact of \u201cmeta\u201d organisations should be held under</span><a href=\"/ea/my/ea_risks_falling_into_a_meta_trap_but_we_can/\"> <span>additional scrutiny</span></a><span> as their work is (at least) one step removed from actual impact. The geographical limits of a local group\u2019s target audience pose a further challenge to gathering evidence of impact (when compared with the global reach of online meta work). Plausibly, these considerations render Effective Altruism London too intractable a project to justify more than a few hours\u2019 worth of work a week, which could be achieved with a </span><a href=\"/ea/ey/how_i_organise_a_growing_effective_altruism_group/\"><span>volunteer-run</span></a><span> model or minimal funding.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Most of the value captured with much less work</span><span> - You might also expect local EA groups to not be worth more than a few hours\u2019 work a week if you anticipate rapidly diminishing returns to additional time invested. You\u2019d expect the low-hanging fruit to be taken first (e.g. monthly socials to sustain altruistic motivation among people Earning to Give), and there may not be many high-value opportunities that require a critical mass of regular time invested. Note that this could also be merely a reason to partially fund Effective Altruism London e.g. to fund one member of staff.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Staff time more impactful if used elsewhere </span><span>- Again, please comment below (or contact David (david [at] ealondon [dot] com) or Holly (holly [at] ealondon [dot] com) directly) if you would like more information on how potential staff would otherwise spend their time.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Bias</span><span> - Perhaps you\u2019re aware of other high-impact giving opportunities, but this one is a rubber-stamped \u201cEA\u201d organisation and/or you are friends with the people who run it, and you think that this might account for a significant part of the motivation you have to fund it.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<h2><span>Reasons to not fund these plans</span></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Insufficient priority given to the most promising people</span><span> - You might think that our focus on aspiring effective altruists and our judgement of the highest-impact careers/groups they are working on is too broad. Given that opportunities to do good are</span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/\"> <span>power law distributed</span></a><span>, perhaps we should focus more narrowly on supporting people who can demonstrate particularly high dedication to EA or who have achieved particularly impressive things in the past.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Insufficient focus on a single metric</span><span> - Having one single metric to optimise for allows for more robust learning about what does and doesn\u2019t work, so we should plausibly choose one metric that captures a lot of what we\u2019re trying to achieve and invest close to 100% of staff time in trying to maximise that metric.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>The more \u201cmeta\u201d you get, the more uncertain you are of the impact</span><span> - Not only is Effective Altruism London already a meta-charity in virtue of being a local group, but many of our proposed activities are yet another step removed from impact (e.g. supporting people to do workplace activism), so we should be particularly uncertain regarding the impact.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>There should be a more focused effort to learn from outside of the EA echo chamber </span><span>- The global EA community is relatively</span><a href=\"/ea/1e1/ea_survey_2017_series_community_demographics/\"> <span>young and homogeneous</span></a><span> (~80-90% under-35s and e.g. ~80% not religious, ~70% male, ~60% in the US/UK), which we can expect to contribute to a na\u00efvety and homogeneity of thought. Perhaps our plans should focus less on supporting aspiring effective altruists to act according to prevailing EA thinking, and more on amplifying the perspectives of those within the EA community from underrepresented demographics and outreach to those demographics.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Londoners don\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t have the time for side projects</span><span> - The London EA community is comprised mainly of young professionals. Perhaps it would be net harmful in the large majority of cases to attempt to divert some of their attention away from their current careers and towards side projects, exploring other careers, supporting other aspiring effective altruists, workplace activism etc.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>You don\u2019t know enough about our plans or the people who will execute them </span><span>- Of course, it could be the case that while Effective Altruism London is worth funding, you simply don\u2019t have enough information to know that, particularly with regard to the Strategy Director who will not have done paid work for Effective Altruism London before.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br><strong><br></strong></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\f</p>\n<h1><span>Donating to us</span></h1>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>If you are considering donating to Effective Altruism London but would like to find out more about our plans first, please get in touch at </span><a href=\"mailto:fundraising@ealondon.com\"><span>fundraising@ealondon.com</span></a><span>.

We have begun to develop relevant expertise and curate potential strategies for intervention. We are now consulting with experts to deepen our expertise and build partnerships, as well as narrowing down potential locations in which to focus our work. We hope to develop a GiveWell-worthy charity that can exceptionally effectively put donations to work in improving the lives of vulnerable people. We believe that despite the challenges to achieving this ambitious goal, this initiative is worth our efforts. It provides great career capital and learning opportunities for us, and we believe this project will have valuable lessons for the effective altruism movement.

Several potential approaches may be employed to improve access to these key nutrients and therefore combat IDA and NTDs. Any strategy we implement would be pursued in coordination with local organizations, international organizations, academic experts, and others. We will rigorously evaluate the potential for EA-aligned action consistent with these and other strategies.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>Here are some intervention approaches we have identified as possibilities:</span><br><br></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span><strong>Facilitating mandatory fortification of staple foods</strong>. We would work with local health professionals, lobbyists, and governments to establish requirements for specific staples that are industrially processed (such as&#xA0;flour or rice) to be fortified with iron and folic acid, to evidence-based standards.</span></li>\n<li><span>Short of working towards the introduction of legislation where it does not already exist, we could&#xA0;</span><strong>work with the government to update technical standards for fortification to reflect the WHO and Cuernavaca guidelines</strong><span>. One analysis suggested that&#xA0;</span><span><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwXb8PPFFuQDemI1bmRfTk9RdzA/view\">only nine&#xA0;out of the 78 countries countries with mandatory iron fortification of flour are doing so most effectively</a></span><span>, yet the infrastructure and political will exists (existed) to take on this issue, it could be a particularly feasible opportunity for impact.</span></li>\n<li><span>Within countries that mandate fortification, there may be poor adherence to fortification policy. We could&#xA0;<strong>develop capacity for (and carry out) quality assurance (monitoring, and evaluation) of fortification practices</strong>, working with the government to improve the effectiveness of existing programs that might exist on paper without adequately serving the people they are meant to support.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>&#xA0;<br>The above strategies are particularly appealing because of the scale of the potential impact. However, if further investigation proves they are either too crowded or infeasible, our efforts may be most impactful in extending fortification initiatives to communities often outside their reach, such as by:</span><br><br></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span><strong>Providing technical support and subsidize fortification at small-scale, local mills</strong> in communities outside the reach of fortification initiatives that tend to target large-industrial mills.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Revisiting strategies beyond fortification </span></strong><span>to improve nutrition, such as supplementation.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><br><span>If you would like to learn more, guide us, or join us, please&#xA0;</span><span><a href=\"http://www.fortifyhealth.global/contact.html\">email us</a></span><span>.

This post will address gender-based exclusion more than other issues as that&#x2019;s the one I have the most knowledge on, but a lot of the practices I suggest should make the community more inclusive of a broader diversity of people. My goal is to keep the ball rolling by spurring further discussion on solutions and helping people implement the most promising ones, so especially if you are from an underrepresented group and/or have expertise in this area, please do comment with your own thoughts, information, and ideas.

These features suggest limitations of our capabilities, both individual and collective, that could be relieved if we worked harder on diversity and inclusion.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I&#x2019;ve met </span><span>many</span><span> people who are deeply driven to help others as much as possible and who beyond that are highly capable &#x2014; e.g. high analytical ability, years of experience with nonprofit management, other specialized skills, graduate degrees in relevant fields &#x2014; but who left, limit their involvement in, or never joined the EA community because of their experience with its culture and norms. Some of those who have stuck around do so begrudgingly because the community still offers them enough to be worth it or because they think the community has so much potential that bearing it to contribute what they can is worth it, but they&#x2019;re not giving us all they have to offer, and many others are turning away entirely. One big effect here seems to be the exclusion of women, as suggested through my conversations with many women and the community&#x2019;s gender ratio of </span><a href=\"/ea/1e1/ea_survey_2017_series_community_demographics/\"><span>roughly 70% men</span></a><span> and 2.7:1 men:women. The exclusion of people of color is a noticeable problem as well, with e.g. black and hispanic persons </span><a href=\"/ea/1ex/demographics_ii/\"><span>severely underrepresented</span></a><span> compared to U.S. demographics. </span><span>We&#x2019;re losing the potentially huge amounts of resources that such people could bring to the EA movement: knowledge, experience, management ability, perspective, ideas, creativity, analytical ability, emotional understanding, social competence, big-picture thinking, enthusiasm, career capital, career opportunity, a variety of specialized skills, networks, money &#x2014; you name it.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>See also </span><a href=\"/ea/ek/ea_diversity_unpacking_pandoras_box/\"><span>Alexander Gordon-Brown&apos;s post</span></a><span> on some other characteristics EA is missing out on in terms of diversities of talent, experience, opinion, and appearance.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Not only are we missing out on those individuals and their resources themselves, but a sum that would be greater than the whole of its parts: </span><span>[Edit: As a <a href=\"/ea/1g3/why_how_to_make_progress_on_diversity_inclusion/c7a\">commenter noted</a>, the content of following sentence is debated in psychology.] A group&#x2019;s collective intelligence is only moderately related to its individuals&#x2019; intelligences, and gender-diverse teams score higher on collective intelligence than all-male or all-female teams (</span><span>What Works: Gender Equality by Design</span><span>, 10).</span> <span>Research also shows that diverse teams are more creative, more innovative, better at problem-solving, and better at decision-making &#x2014; see Georgia Ray&#x2019;s post </span><a href=\"https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2017/08/22/diversity-and-team-performance-what-the-research-says/\"><span>&quot;Diversity and team performance: What the research says&quot;</span></a><span> for more detail. Companies in the top quartile for diversity in gender and ethnicity are </span><a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters\"><span>15% and 35% more likely to outperform their industry&#x2019;s median performance</span></a><span>, respectively, and companies in the bottom quartile lag behind the median. Fortune&#x2019;s top 50 workplaces for diversity list an </span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/12/05/diversity-inclusion-workplaces/\"><span>average 24% higher year-over-year revenue growth</span></a><span> than companies that didn&#x2019;t make the list, and companies with multiple women in the C-Suite </span><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/02/study-firms-with-more-women-in-the-c-suite-are-more-profitable\"><span>are more profitable</span></a><span>. These are all correlations, but the effect sizes are very large and the causal explanation seems highly plausible.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>There are also known issues in EA that seem likely to be mitigated or eliminated through an increase in diversity. For example, this year&#x2019;s EA Global San Francisco conference focused on shifting the community towards &#x201C;doing good together.&#x201D; </span><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3020561/why-women-collaborate-men-work-alone-and-everybodys-mad\"><span>Women tend to be more collaborative than men</span></a><span>, so if the community had better gender representation, we could already be thinking big and emphasizing doing good together.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>Even if people in our community are less prejudiced than the rest of society, small biases can have big impacts: One simulation found that bias accounting for only 1% of variance in evaluation scores resulted in the top level of the simulated workforce being only 35% comprised of the discriminated-against group, instead of 50% like the original pool (</span><span>What Works: Gender Equality by Design</span><span>, 14).</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Unfortunately I suspect some people in the community are content, implicitly or explicitly, to assume that women and people of color are inherently so much worse than white men at thinking about altruism effectively that the constitution of the community is merely an effect of this presumed difference, and that as such putting effort into diversity and inclusion would either be too difficult and costly to be worthwhile or would dilute the community. I find this argument lacking given the alignment of that thinking with demonstrated biases in society at large &#x2014; i.e. people </span><a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00483480410539489\"><span>tend to think</span></a><span> that women are more intuitively-driven and less analytical than men, which does not seem to be borne out and in fact <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2016/05/12/how-decision-making-is-different-between-men-and-women-and-why-it-matters-in-business/#5aacb7d54dcd\">the opposite may be more likely</a></span><span> &#x2014; and given the suspiciously large gender and race disparity in EA, as well as the the very small size of the community at present. The latter enables us to target selectively, not randomly from the general population, even if this loaded, simplistic, and to my knowledge unfounded claim is true. Moreover, there are </span><span>many</span><span> examples of women, white and of color, who felt or feel excluded by the EA community, despite being entirely onboard with the philosophy of EA, having participated in the community for years, and having made major changes in their thinking and lives because of EA &#x2014; they just really dislike the community.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Relatedly, some may assume that our community is genuinely merit-based &#x2014; that we simply reach out to and include the most qualified people, regardless of their race, gender, etc. Did you know that, at least in an experimental setting, </span><a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/65884\"><span>when organizations espouse meritocracy</span></a><span> managers show </span><span>greater</span><span> gender-based discrimination than those at other companies? And that having a </span><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/workplace-gender-quotas-incompetence-efficiency-business-organisations-london-school-economics-lse-a7797061.html\"><span>gender quota</span></a><span> is more likely, assuming probably that an organization is competent at hiring, to weed out mediocre men than to introduce mediocre women? Unfortunately most of the specific details of the conclusive and pervasive sexism I have experienced, seen, and heard of first-hand within the EA community are confidential &#x2014; and I don&#x2019;t just mean sexual harassment and assault, there are other more pernicious and more prevalent forms of sexism in society and in the community, such as </span><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2787021?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\"><span>the holding of women to higher standards of competence</span></a><span> and the consistent underestimation of women&#x2019;s trustworthiness (</span><span>What Works: Gender Equality by Design</span><span>, 27). Happily some of it has been acknowledged by its offenders, who have in some cases stated credible intentions to improve &#x2014; though whether they are in fact improving takes time to assess, and without ongoing personal or even cultural support they may find improving difficult. Even without the details of specific experiences people have had, it should be sufficient to observe that there are many examples of qualified people being excluded, and no evidence has been offered to justify the assumption &#x2014; which was recently voiced, to no opposition as I understand it, on a panel at EAGxBerlin &#x2014; that we are merit-based. </span><span>[Edit: I want to note as well that who EA seems to select for matches exceptionally well with privilege in society at large, which would be quite a coincidence.]</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Some people in the community have made other thoroughly unreasonable claims to justify the status quo, such as that women would be a distraction in the workplace. If they are, the problem is </span><span>entirely</span><span> the men who can&#x2019;t adhere to basic professional norms and who presume their contributions so important that the minor cost to them of being less sexist outweighs all of the potential contributions of all the women they&#x2019;re keeping out. To my knowledge this claim was recanted &#x2014; under pressure or reflection, I&#x2019;m not sure &#x2014; but it&#x2019;s a red flag for other sexism. Someone else has said women aren&#x2019;t as willing as men to take low salaries for altruistic purposes, apparently in ignorance of the rest of the nonprofit world, whose </span><a href=\"https://priceonomics.com/the-altruism-gender-gap/\"><span>volunteers</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://trust.guidestar.org/blog/2015/11/20/women-in-nonprofits-then-now/\"><span>workforce</span></a><span> are overwhelmingly women. Such unrigorousness should be thoroughly discouraged.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I think the majority of the problem, however, is that while many people know we have a problem, they don&#x2019;t know what they themselves can do about it.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1><span>What changes can we make to more effectively select for the right people? </span></h1>\n<p><span>The evidence base on effective strategies to reduce prejudice and increase inclusion in general is weak, though growing. I don&#x2019;t claim that the following are all of the answers, nor necessarily the best answers, nor even that they&#x2019;re all right or involve no tradeoffs. My aim is just to put my ideas out there in the interest of continued discussion and </span><span>action </span><span>on this issue. I also don&#x2019;t claim to be perfect in implementing these myself, but I do generally aspire to embody those I&#x2019;m failing in.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Recognize that there is a problem, in society at large, </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/\"><span>in the communities EA sources from</span></a><span>, and within the EA community.</span><span> Even if you are not convinced by the evidence I&#x2019;ve presented about why this is a problem our community needs to address, you should still be compelled by the fact that so many people both in EA and elsewhere think we have a serious problem. Look to data &#x2014; I include barely any of the literature on sexism and other systematic biases in this post because it is vast and Googleable &#x2014; and to accounts of people in the community &#x2014; or no longer are &#x2014; who are from the groups in question. Do not rely on your intuitions or those of anyone lacking the perspectives of people from underrepresented groups. If you disagree that this is an important problem or about any of the steps I suggest to make headway on it, let&#x2019;s have a discussion so we can get to the truth of the matter.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Recognize that it is extremely probable that you harbor biases that you are not accounting for.</span><span> Recognize that recognizing bias in society and our community isn&#x2019;t enough &#x2014; people </span><a href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/02/how-intellectual-humility-can-make-you-a-better-person.html\"><span>tend to think</span></a><span> they are less biased than average, and tend to demonstrate the same levels of bias even when they are experienced with seeing a bias, made explicitly aware of the bias, and asked to introspect to ensure they are not making a biased judgement (</span><span>What Works: Gender Equality By Design</span><span>, 45-48). The latter can even backfire, which may be the effect of this whole statement, but I think transparency is sufficiently important to outweigh that risk. Even if you have evidence that you are successfully debiased in some ways &#x2014; e.g. calibrating against overconfidence in online tests &#x2014; the society you grew up in has many biases, and you are highly unlikely to be exempt from all of them. People in the EA community might even be particularly susceptible to some.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Don&#x2019;t penalize the &#x201C;heart&quot; as though there is only the &#x201C;head.&quot;</span><span> EA is both, and one is nothing without the other in this movement. I prefer to play the long game with my own investments in community building, and would rather for instance invest in someone reasonably sharp who has a track record of altruism and expresses interest in helping others most effectively than in someone even sharper who reasoned their way into EA and consumed all the jargon but has never really given anything up for other people. I see exceptions to this being the best investment on the whole, but none who I think wouldn&#x2019;t be here anyways if we were focusing much more on the former personalities. In practice, </span><span>the lowest-hanging fruit to elevate the heart is to be empathetic with and kind to people</span><span>. At the very least, ensure you are not being dismissive of people&#x2019;s emotions, and in particular feminine-coded emotions like empathy, grief, sadness, or love &#x2014; things that drive a lot of people&#x2019;s altruism. </span><span>Some of the most talented and resolute people in this community are here because they are deeply emotionally compelled to help others as much as possible, and we&#x2019;re currently missing out on many such people by being so cold and calculating.

CEA and EAF, your intention is to be institutional leaders of the EA community, so lead the way on this critical aspect of movement-building &#x2014; there is definitely a full-time job&#x2019;s worth of advising and other work to do, probably even just with the suggestions I list here. Some universities and companies have such a position, and I &#x2014; and I&#x2019;m sure others &#x2014; would be happy to advise on what the position&#x2019;s responsibilities would look like. (Thank you Sana Al Badri for this suggestion.)</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; </span><span>All organizations should </span><span>hire communications staff who are versed in inclusionary communications practices. </span><span>Alternatively, the Diversity &amp; Inclusion Officer could train them.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Adopt and enforce a clear policy &#x2014; as organizations and individuals &#x2014; for dealing seriously and fully with illegal actions like sexual harassment and explicit discrimination or discrimination revealed by HR or legal counsel.</span><span> Commensurate consequences and reform procedures, escalating as necessary to expulsion, are critical. The perpetrator is not so much more important than the greater number of people they are driving away, the risk of a lawsuit to the organization protecting them, or the risk they bring to the community&#x2019;s reputation, that such actions should be protected. If this community&#x2019;s members are as smart as we like to think, using a heavy hand once, if necessary at all, should be all it takes, so long as the threat of using it again is credibly maintained.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; If you go out with colleagues, ensure you&#x2019;re not just including the ones most like you.</span><span> A lot of opportunity to build skills, network, and advance one&#x2019;s career </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/\"><span>happens out of the office</span></a><span>, and favoring some colleagues over others can lead to systematic disempowerment. If you are a man and can&#x2019;t go out with women colleagues without thinking of them sexually and making the interaction uncomfortable, or if you can&#x2019;t have a conversation about work and EA with women colleagues at lunch, you should not be managing anyone.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; If you see something, say something.</span><span> Don&#x2019;t leave the reporting of problematic behavior to the people who directly experience it. They are feeling disempowered and alienated and are usually in a far less capable position to do something about it.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; If you experience something, try to at least say something to someone.</span><span> Whether you decide it is in your interest to say something or not, ensure you at least consider the risks to other people and the broader community if you do not. I appreciate that in many if not most cases we just want to move on with our lives, and this burden should, as noted above, not be left to the people experiencing the problem, who generally face higher risk bringing it up than other people.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; We could establish a website providing resources for legal counsel and enabling people to anonymously share experiences</span><span> regarding discrimination, harassment, and assault, both to inform less-aware community members of issues in the community and to provide a sense of accountability to the movement as a whole, as the testimonies would be publicly accessible.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Update your valuations of men&#x2019;s competencies downwards, and of women&#x2019;s upwards, particularly when you are forming your first impressions. </span><span>People already </span><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.abstract#aff-1\"><span>inaccurately perceive</span></a><span> women as less competent than men, </span><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/53729-bias-against-female-coders.html\"><span>even when their work is superior</span></a><span>, in addition to which </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/\"><span>men overestimate and oversell themselves while women underestimate and undersell themselves</span></a><span>. Yes, this will penalize the rare men who represent themselves accurately or under-represent themselves, and favor the rare women who represent themselves accurately or over-represent themselves, so take care, but the risk of overcorrection is not sufficient reason to resort to the prejudiced status quo. Additionally, in more long-term and formal environments, utilize standardized and objective metrics of competency whenever possible, such as trial projects when hiring. Relatedly, consider promotions and do hiring </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323706704578229891743848414\"><span>in rounds, not on a rolling individual basis</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Amplify the contributions of people from underrepresented groups</span><span>, in personal interactions, meetings, articles, podcasts, Facebook posts, conferences &#x2014; everywhere.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; If a colleague from an underrepresented group can speak on an issue you&#x2019;ve been asked to speak about, whether at a conference or for a quote in an article, give them the opportunity. </span><span>If they decline, ask why &#x2014; they may be interested but want PR training.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Giving announcer and moderator positions to people from underrepresented groups at conferences is an easy way to start including them more.</span><span> That&#x2019;s not a license to not consider diversity and inclusion elsewhere else, but it is a step. Many people are very capable of being great emcees and moderators, so there&#x2019;s little or no reason not to use this opportunity to include them. Note that EAG Boston and San Francisco 2017 both had a white man as the emcee.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Don&#x2019;t dismiss or trivialize the altruistic concerns ordinary people have.</span><span> It&#x2019;s great that people care about immigration reform, worms in children in impoverished regions, and dog rescue. It would be even more great if they put their energy into efforts of greater impact, but moving them in a more effective direction, whether within their currently preferred project or cause or to another, is easier done if they have a sense of community with you, which is easier achieved if they know you care about the issues they care about. It&#x2019;s all but impossible to achieve if you stick your nose in the air at their altruism because their thinking on the weighty and new topic of effectiveness is underdeveloped &#x2014; like yours once was.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Quit the hero worship.</span><span> Major progress is made by groups, not individuals. People should be praised for their individual contributions, and some people will be leaders, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean other people aren&#x2019;t contributing as much or more. Hero worship in EA is almost always directed towards white men, and while it&#x2019;s great to celebrate their achievements, overdoing that celebration exacerbates the issue of how we represent ourselves to newcomers and outsiders, and encourages a masculine, individualistic culture where newcomers can&#x2019;t thrive.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Do not consider anyone&#x2019;s arguments or positions above questioning or criticism.</span><span> Never presume that someone has no place questioning someone else whose intellect you laud. No one is infallible, and no one has every answer or has considered every possible angle and argument. This particular form of hero worship is a common complaint from people who feel excluded from the community.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; </span><span>People from underrepresented groups: </span><span>Own your worth</span><span>.

The other person will likely end up more informed and feel more welcomed, and it won&#x2019;t take too much of your time. Remember too that being willing to engage with newcomers and people of lower status or perceivable &#x201C;usefulness&#x201D; is very common in other communities, and particularly advocacy communities, so when people act otherwise it seems surprising, rude and alienating.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Don&#x2019;t emphasize earning to give too much</span><span>.

Even if we ourselves know we&#x2019;re speaking in generalities, it can very easily come off like we&#x2019;re advocating a one-size-fits-all approach, or asserting that any one cause or career path is the best path to maximum impact for everyone.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Represent the community&apos;s values accurately.</span><span> This can be a challenge in a single 140 character tweet, but not in a whole Twitter feed or in a conversation. Consistently presenting anti-malarial nets as the community&apos;s primary concern is going to attract people with that particular interest. This means a relatively high proportion of people who are resistant to pushing new frontiers, as global poverty is a popular cosmopolitan cause that normal people can get lots of praise for contributing to more effectively, with no or nowhere near the personal risk of less mainstream causes and projects. Such an emphasis will also mean the community gets skipped over by people who are exploring other and unconventional ways of doing good.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; </span><span>Relatedly, </span><span>our public image can and should be weird in the right ways</span><span>. It can say true, abstract, challenging things like &#x201C;We should consider the interests of all sentient beings,&#x201D; &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have all the answers, our goal is to find and implement them,&#x201D; &#x201C;How our actions affect people in the far future could vastly outweigh the impact they have now,&#x201D; and &#x201C;New technologies may transform the quality of life on Earth and beyond to a much greater extent than they have even in the past century.&quot; And it can do all that without using jargon, without throwing around the term &#x201C;AI&#x201D; with no qualification or explanation, without looking or sounding like a young socially awkward white guy in tech, and while emphasizing the altruism motivating these intellectual explorations and providing palatable examples of relatively high-impact actions people can take &#x2014; including, but not inordinately emphasizing, those that best help individuals in poverty. It&#x2019;s not a question of either being weird AI fanboys or mainstream philanthropists.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Don&#x2019;t get hostile in conversations. </span><span>Keep the focus on the information and arguments at hand.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Don&#x2019;t reward people for aggressive communication styles</span><span>. If you want to express agreement with their content, but their delivery is bad form, you can say for instance &#x201C;I agree, but your [snarkiness, ad hominem comment, exaggeration, etc] was unnecessary and not conducive to rigorous discussion.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Do not disproportionately penalize women for aggressive communication styles.</span> <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/people-reward-angry-men-but-punish-angry-women-study-suggests_us_561fb57be4b050c6c4a47743\"><span>When a man and woman are equally aggressive</span></a><span>, people tend to see the man as more persuasive but the woman as less credible, and women are given feedback that they&#x2019;re &#x201C;too aggressive&#x201D; three times as often as men.

If you&#x2019;re in the EA community, you know lots of men who demonstrate multiple such tendencies.</span><span> In all likelihood men just </span><span>hide</span><span> their emotions </span><a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/dating/guys-more-emotional-girls/1077730\"><span>better than women</span></a><span>, which does not mean their judgements are less emotionally-motivated.</span><span> It&#x2019;s even possible that men&#x2019;s judgements are more emotionally-motivated, as girls and women in society tend to have more social encouragement and opportunity to examine their emotions.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Replace competitiveness with collaborativeness.</span><span> In successful communities, people empower each other and become better off on the whole for it &#x2014; another EA&#x2019;s success strengthens and grows the community, and the community&#x2019;s strength and size helps you and your purposes. So: Is someone&#x2019;s counter to your argument making you feel defensive? This is an opportunity to get closer to the truth, together. Is someone considering starting a project that you were also thinking of? Combine your resources, and if it needs just one leader, sort out who&#x2019;s best positioned for it &#x2014; that&#x2019;s great for the project. Are your donors shifting funds to a new organization? Sounds like you should drop inferior programs, and also like the community needs to grow the donor pool.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Don&#x2019;t try to take shortcuts to status, and particularly don&#x2019;t try to gain status by disempowering other people.</span><span> Status for most of us is not a zero-sum game. In fact, there is a lot of status to be gained by developing a reputation as someone who empowers other people. So it doesn&#x2019;t matter what you&#x2019;ve accomplished, you are not above giving a few minutes to an enthusiastic new EA who wants to learn how to get more involved, or at the least directing them warmly to someone who has more time to engage. And your public/semi-private conversation at an EA event is not so important that you can&#x2019;t take a few seconds to say hello to someone trying to enter the conversation and fill them in, or to change the topic for the new person &#x2014; you can pick up the other conversation again later.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; </span><span>Relatedly, </span><span>empower people, don&#x2019;t use them &#x2014; &#xA0;act in good faith, and show faith in your community members.</span><span> Consider the other people in the community your collaborators, neither your competition nor a means to your ends. When collaborating with other EAs, be honest about your information, goals, and thought processes. Even if, for instance, you really just want someone to donate to or work for your project, and they&#x2019;re deciding between yours and another, you should still give them your honest thoughts &#x2014; or a better source &#x2014; and critical or full information on the tradeoffs you see, not just what you think will convince them to support you instead of the other project. Introduce them to people at the other project if they aren&#x2019;t introduced already. </span><span>Help them make their own decision</span><span>. Doing otherwise incentivizes further dishonesty and manipulativeness in the community.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; </span><span>Relatedly, </span><span>consider the bigger picture, in everything you do.</span><span> The good you can do does not just encompass the direct impact of your actions, but also how they influence other people. Establishing stronger norms of honesty would both incentivize stronger norms of intellectual rigor and select more strongly for new members who are intellectually rigorous rather than manipulative or manipulable. It&#x2019;s also helpful to probably everyone as individuals to have a variety of people out there who appreciate you and will be enthusiastic about lending you a hand when you choose to ask for one, so be careful handling fire around bridges.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Similarly, when considering whether to go vegetarian or take some other step to avoid participating in a major moral problem, consider how not doing so could validate and perpetuate the biases and selfishness that enable people commit that act normally, and how that act could help others feel licensed to do other selfish and harmful things that </span><span>you</span><span> disagree with, like lying to sexual partners about having an STI or being dishonest and uncharitable in representations of your organization or preferred cause area.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Some people may have their own reasons for thinking that it&#x2019;s good for them to act in and use people in short-sighted ways, and to be confident that they have nothing left to learn and no need to build social capital, but even if that actually is the right call for them individually, such short-sighted self-interest is bad for the broader EA community and limits what it can accomplish, so it should be discouraged. Controversy here may point to a deeper issue, of which I have seen concerning evidence, of some people using the broader EA community as a mere conduit to their preferred issue rather than a meeting place for everyone to learn from each other and help each other and grow the broader community and each other&#x2019;s sub-communities on the whole. The community has a lot of room to grow, and actively trying to cannibalize each other is probably not in anyone&#x2019;s long-run interest. So when, for instance, newcomers ask me about AI safety, I give them a clear and palatable introduction and I answer their questions or direct them to people who can answer better, and I do so even if we might not get a chance to talk about things I suspect would be a better use of their resources and which I have resolved are better use of mine. For me, the EA community isn&#x2019;t just another place to pitch animal advocacy, it&#x2019;s a place where I can learn and grow as an effective altruist, and where I can help others learn and grow as effective altruists. It&#x2019;s a place where, in its better moments, people do good together, not alone.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Give to the people in your community.</span><span> Acknowledge their contributions, introduce them to people they might be interested in knowing, offer them your expertise, help them when they need a favor&#x2026; this community is no exception to all communities&#x2019; needs for basic positive social norms.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; When people make mistakes, kindly and clearly identify them.</span><span> If the mistake was not just an intellectual error but harmed someone, identify it in the interest of achieving justice for the person who was wronged, but also and perhaps more importantly in the interest of helping the person who made the mistake to grow and improve. That is to their benefit, the benefit of the community, the benefit of other people they would have gone on to wrong, and the benefit of others still who they&#x2019;d be failing to help by falling short of who they could be. Encourage and reward good behavior privately and publicly, and discourage bad behavior privately, and more publicly and severely as it becomes more necessary to raise the costs to people of refusing to adopt better attitudes and behaviors. If we are only concerned with the direct impact of our own actions or don&#x2019;t care about our omissions, we won&#x2019;t get far in improving this community &#x2014; we need to empower others to do better as well, so </span><span>give people a genuine chance to improve.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>To be clear, I&#x2019;m not suggesting endless second chances, and some actions taken even once will warrant zero tolerance and immediate expulsion.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Also, even people who are exceptionally humble and exceptionally interested in personal growth still need to feel accepted and their egos can still be wounded, so take care not to overload people &#x2014; give criticisms seriously but compassionately, focus on priorities, be clear about what happened, why the action was a problem, and what you think the person should have done instead, and in normal circumstances it&#x2019;s probably best to give criticisms sparingly. Criticisms also have more credibility and are less hurtful when the critic has gained the respect and camaraderie of the criticized.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Accept that you will make mistakes, and take responsibility when you do.</span><span> Encourage yourself to value humility and growth even if it hurts your pride. We all make mistakes! When we are informed or otherwise realize that we have, we should take responsibility, rather than ignore the mistake or defend it and lose the opportunity to improve &#x2014; not to mention incentivizing others to prioritize their own pride over self-improvement. Especially if you can feel an accusation wounding your ego and alerting your defenses, or if you can&#x2019;t explicitly argue against an accuser&apos;s points, you are probably not thinking very clearly. </span><span>It should be a norm in the community to comfortably and casually admit &#x201C;oh, you&#x2019;re right I got that wrong&#x201D;</span><span> and &#x201C;good point, I&#x2019;ve changed my mind&#x201D; and &#x201C;I was not thinking about that effect of my actions, I&#x2019;m sorry and thank you for bringing this to my attention.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Take up that humility more generally. </span><span>Don&#x2019;t judge that you&#x2019;re right and another party is wrong before ensuring you know their reasoning &#x2014; ask someone why they hold the position they do, maybe they&#x2019;ve thought of something you haven&#x2019;t just as you may be assuming you&#x2019;ve thought of things they haven&#x2019;t.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; You can disagree with people while entirely respecting their positions, appreciating their contributions, and recognizing them as an ally. </span><span>The reason I spend my time strategizing to bring down animal farming and to expand humanity&#x2019;s moral circle instead of working &#x2014; directly at least &#x2014; on AI safety generally seems to come down to intuitive differences between myself and people who prioritize direct work on AI safety. These differences are sometimes minor and in my experience generally irreconcilable with available information. I also disagree that near-term interventions to help individuals in poverty are the best use of most EA&#x2019;s resources because I don&#x2019;t think lives matter as much as well-being, and poverty interventions are not relatively robust in their address of well-being. I disagree with many of my allies and colleagues about the value of farmed animal welfare reforms and other near-term interventions ultimately because I tend to be more risk-tolerant and compelled by expected value than they are, and because I consider the net impacts of near-term interventions sufficiently uncertain that I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s useful to consider them categorically more measurable than interventions whose intended impacts are less direct or further in the future. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Nonetheless, I&#x2019;m very excited that these people are working on these projects, which I still consider important even if I disagree that they&#x2019;re the best use my or these individuals&#x2019; resources, and I still have a lot of respect for some of these allies&#x2019; and colleagues&#x2019; analyses, and I am deeply moved by their altruistic drives and grateful for their contributions to the EA community and to my own thinking on these issues. Disagreement is critical for finding the best answers to the kinds of questions EAs ask.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; There is a point at which championing &#x201C;free speech&#x201D; actually inhibits it</span><span>, enabling what was once innovative, challenging, rigorous discussion to become regressive, harmful, thoughtless trolling and/or identity politics. When people say severely intolerant things that disenfranchise other people &#x2014; especially if they for instance cannot justify it, respond to criticisms of it with aggressive repetition of their claims with no evidence and/or with personal attacks, and cannot explain why it&#x2019;s important that they say it at all &#x2014; don&#x2019;t tolerate it.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>For instance, it should be outright unacceptable for someone to say that women do not contribute to society and are leeches if they don&#x2019;t offer men sex. This actually happened, recently, and is a problem for two reasons: One, the factual claim is highly contrary to </span><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2013/sdn1310.pdf\"><span>economic</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/how-women-could-change-the-world-if-we-let-them-fc356ff9e066/\"><span>other</span></a><span> data as well as extensive anecdotal evidence, and such unrigorousness should be discouraged. Two, the value judgement, which is explicitly sexist to an atypically extreme degree, is well beyond the limit of what the community should accept as any kind of a &#x201C;diversity of opinion&quot; unless we want to severely limit our diversity of participants, and as such that very diversity of opinion. People are both less able to and less interested in contributing their resources to the community when they are treated with such hostility and when such hostility is accepted by the community. It is women&#x2019;s interests to assume that every man who is okay with this person&#x2019;s behavior has an appallingly poor understanding of sexism in society, if not also of basic social norms generally, and that as such he probably harbors a dangerous level of sexism himself, if not also a shockingly &#x2014; contextually &#x2014; limited intellectual capabilities given the obvious lack of intellectual rigor in the offender&#x2019;s comments. So toleration of such comments makes the whole community look highly unappealing.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Happily, this particular individual &#x2014; who is probably a troll in general &#x2014; was banned from the groups where he repeatedly and unrelentingly said such things, though it&#x2019;s concerning there was any question about whether this was acceptable behavior. </span><span>Maybe we should have a reference document of what kinds of actions in online forums warrant an explanation of the problem, ensuing non-engagement, warnings from the moderator, and bans.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>To be clear, </span><span>by tolerating rude and intellectually unrigorous behavior we are in fact choosing to have such people in the community </span><span>in the place of</span><span> the more rigorous and compassionate people they are likely to put off.</span><span> Such toleration of intolerance is also likely to normalize that intolerance and as such to increase the biases in the rest of community. It concerns me that I even have to bring this up as a problem, as I think e.g. most Fortune 500 companies have by now figured out that it&#x2019;s very important that employees not be outright assholes to other employees. [Edit: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/8/16106728/google-fired-engineer-anti-diversity-memo\">example</a> that came to mind redacted because while problematic, I would not describe the person as an &quot;outright asshole,&quot; though this action was still a <a href=\"/ea/1g3/why_how_to_make_progress_on_diversity_inclusion/c8g\">serious problem</a>.] </span><span>Yes, some people in broader society now respond to correctable offenses with a mob mentality and too much readiness for ostracization, but just because some people have swung too far past the mark doesn&#x2019;t mean we should default to a status quo that falls so short of it.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; </span><span>Hiring processes and employee management are a big topic, but for starters, </span><span>take care with job postings</span><span>: </span><a href=\"https://qz.com/797559/gender-bias-job-listings-language/\"><span>Use less masculine language</span></a><span>; talk about the concrete skills and experience you&#x2019;re interested in instead of appealing to people with &#x201C;startup&#x201D; experience; ensure that the qualities you say are &#x201C;required&#x201D; are </span><span>actually</span><span> required; and appreciate that women may conceive of their achievements differently than men tend to, for instance attributing their successes more to their team rather than to themselves.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Men, accept that many women will be your equals, and others your superiors, in intelligence, knowledge, and other abilities you aspire to or pride yourself in. Even those who aren&#x2019;t will sometimes have a better argument or more relevant information than you.</span><span> And no, just because you can point to one or two women whose intellects and other competencies you appreciate does not mean you are evaluating other womens&#x2019; fairly &#x2014; especially if the women you are thinking of are in your community and share your positions. The same goes for people of color, and others.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; People who belong to currently disenfranchised groups, adopt the attitude that the success of other people who are disenfranchised, particularly for the same reasons as you, is your success.</span><span> Women who encounter discrimination early in their careers may </span><a href=\"http://www.people.hbs.edu/acuddy/2002,%20fiske,%20cuddy,%20glick,%20&amp;%20xu,%20JPSP.pdf\"><span>distance themselves from other women</span></a><span>, refuse to help them, and align themselves with men at other women&#x2019;s expense. The disempowerment of women in the EA community may make women feel as though there is only room for a few women to have some voice, but we don&#x2019;t need to accept someone else&#x2019;s narrative that we have to compete with each other &#x2014; we can make more room for each other, like women in other masculine men-dominated communities have done before us and are doing alongside us, by empowering each other. As I&#x2019;ve said already, this is not a zero-sum game: Every person of color&#x2019;s success should, with sustained inclusionary efforts from the rest of the community, reduce some racism in the community, which in turn increases opportunity for other people of color in a virtuous circle.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Mentor people from underrepresented groups.</span><span> Or if you belong to an underrepresented group, seek out mentors.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; Take an interest in people. </span><span>You will at times, often even, have to judge when someone isn&#x2019;t going to be so involved in the movement that it&#x2019;s worth your time to continue engaging, but give people a chance, and try to be mindful of your intuitions, some of which will be more valid and useful than others and some of which will be plain biased &#x2014; try to be conscientious in that judgement and focus on concrete measures of a person&#x2019;s likelihood to engage well enough that they&#x2019;ll learn to do good better.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>&#x25CF; </span><span>Finally: </span><span>Take responsibility for improving diversity and inclusion in EA.</span><span> Whatever your role in the community and movement and however inclusive your actions tend to be already, there is more you can do, and saying it&#x2019;s someone else&#x2019;s problem to solve will only result in a collective action problem.</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1><span>Other notes</span></h1>\n<p><span>See also </span><a href=\"/ea/mp/pitfalls_in_diversity_outreach/\"><span>Kelsey Piper&#x2019;s notes</span></a><span> on failure modes in efforts to increase demographic diversity, </span><a href=\"/ea/zu/making_ea_groups_more_welcoming/\"><span>Julia Wise&#x2019;s post</span></a><span> on specific actions people can take to be more welcoming at events, and </span><a href=\"/ea/5p/keeping_the_effective_altruist_movement_welcoming/\"><span>Owen Cotton-Barrett&#x2019;s post</span></a><span> on being welcoming.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I should note that I put vastly more time and effort into working with people outside of EA to develop their thinking on effectiveness independently of the EA community than I do bringing new people into the community, which frankly I only do when they&#x2019;ve explicitly expressed interest. This is because I usually expect introducing them to the community to waste their time, cause them stress, cost some of my relationship with them because of that, and most importantly, </span><span>turn them off from thinking about effectiveness</span><span>. In fact, I think we backfire often just because we present ourselves so suboptimally.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The time I have spent on EA community-building, which has been substantial, has focused on supporting individuals who are already in the community, for the most part in the wing that intersects with the animal advocacy community. I should note, brusque though this comment may be, that the animal-advocacy-focused sub-community of EA tends to be significantly more socially competent, welcoming, and proficient in the kinds of inclusionary practices I&#x2019;ve suggested here than some other parts of the community. This may be largely explained by how women-dominated the animal advocacy community is &#x2014; though heavily white and guilty of other failings &#x2014; and how its members are generally much better versed in issues of discrimination and inclusion than EAs are. Animal advocates, particularly in the farmed animal wing, tend to be highly liberal and generally actively encourage concern for broad social justice &#x2014; which stands in stark contrast to the many people in the EA community who use strawmans and the worst of the social justice community to dismiss, insult, and otherwise actively discourage any association with the term, to the point of taking pride in that opposition.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I should also note that most other women, white and of color, who have been in the community for several years and who I have spoken with about diversity and inclusion issues, are exhausted from talking about and even thinking about this problem for so long and to so little avail. True, the vast majority of that conversation has been in private or otherwise sequestered discussions, and mostly among people who agree there&#x2019;s a problem and aren&#x2019;t contributing to it as much as others, whether by act or omission. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m putting all of these thoughts online. Regardless, people from more represented backgrounds and who are otherwise in more influential positions need to take up this mantle.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Also FYI, I am currently

Effective Altruism, and part of this process included wondering how the Foundational Research Institute (FRI) had considered issues around diversity<a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\"><span><span><span><span>[i]</span></span></span></span></a> and inclusion at its inception.<span>&#xA0; </span>I didn&#x2019;t initially find what I was looking for, but I did happen across this article from Brian Tomisik titled: &#x2018;</span><a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/\"><span>Reasons to Be Nice to Other Value Systems</span></a><span>&#x2019; (I recommend reading it before proceeding further).</span></p>\n<p><span>I think there are fairly good reasons to be nice to other value systems, and I want to consider whether Effective Altruism for Animals (EAA) reflects this view from a foundational perspective.<span>&#xA0; </span>For a starting point I&#x2019;m going to consider the </span><a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/welfarists-or-abolitionists-division-hurts-animal-advocacy/\"><span>trend</span></a><span> to utilise an animal movement model based on a welfare / abolition dichotomy.<span>&#xA0; </span>This has tended to reflect the appearance of welfare being something which isn&#x2019;t related to a certain form of &#x2018;abolition&#x2019; (namely the </span><a href=\"http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/\"><span>Abolitionist Approach</span></a><span>).<span>&#xA0; </span>So in relation to this model, where Effective Altruists do not fit into the Abolitionist Approach, and choose not to advocate welfare (in an industry sense), then a good question seems to be how they fit into EAA and what this means in relation to the different value systems that Effective Altruists could utilise.<span>&#xA0; </span></span></p>\n<p><span>To provide some background to this question it is useful to look at the </span><a href=\"https://qz.com/829956/how-the-vegan-movement-broke-out-of-its-echo-chamber-and-finally-started-disrupting-things/\"><span>origin</span></a><span> of the welfare / abolition framework, something which also provides some insight into the formation of EAA, as a number of the group who divided the vegan movement (with the reasonable intention of making it more effective) are also associated with Effective Altruism.<span>&#xA0; </span>The central aim of this division appears to have been to increase the scope of the vegan movement, however, it could also be said this scope already existed within the broader animal movement.<span>&#xA0; </span>For instance, the largest groups have traditionally included HSUS, CIWF, RSPCA, and all are concerned primarily with welfare rather than ending exploitation.<span>&#xA0; </span>These groups have occupied an integral part of the modern animal movement, and are closely aligned with the form of welfare advocacy with which the model was concerned.<span>&#xA0; </span>This is to say the adoption of reducetarian or flexitarian approaches are a good fit with traditional welfarism (both exist within carnism / a framework of animal consumption).&#xA0; <span><br></span></span></p>\n<p><span>In terms of the decision to divide the movement, it is worth considering whether it also exacerbated some issues in relation to marginalisation, particularly where &#x2018;welfare&#x2019; has reflected <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0FjZQC8gcs\">mainstream</a> society.<span>&#xA0; </span>For instance, the non-profit groups promoted by ACE are largely structured on a fairly standardised organisational model, which is to say they largely reflect the system of white male leadership (for instance we can look at the CEOs of successful profit making organisations to note the </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/jul/21/diversity-is-not-important-to-the-white-men-in-power\"><span>comparison</span></a><span>).<span>&#xA0; </span>If this aspect had been considered it is difficult to ascertain where it has been accounted, because the impact of utilising a patriarchal system explicitly or implicitly would need to be offset. <span>&#xA0;</span>Otherwise we risk the negative impacts of patriarchy (sexism and misogyny in their various forms) appearing within organisations, and more generally in the animal movement as a cost of this strategy.<span>&#xA0; </span>For people affected by this </span><a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/advocacy-advice/learn-from-professionals/carol-j-adams/\"><span>Carol J. Adams</span></a><span> has engaged a process where issues can be </span><a href=\"https://www.canhad.org/speak-out/\"><span>reported</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>When we further consider the situation that a small group of people in the animal movement created a divide in the vegan movement (perhaps with reference to the </span><a href=\"https://network23.org/orcasandanimals/2017/05/06/the-unilateralists-curse-and-effective-altruism-for-animals/\"><span>Unilateralist&#x2019;s Curse</span></a><span>), it might follow that resources were equally divided along this ideological schism, but there is no evidence of this being the case, if it were the case then we could perhaps more easily negotiate different value systems in terms of greater parity of wealth and influence.<span>&#xA0; </span>However, the split seems to have led to further consolidation of resources to various groups weighted toward welfare, and we can identify this today with various welfare / reducetarian organisations such as HSUS, Mercy for Animals, Animal Equality, The Humane League, Pro Veg occupying positions as the recipients of a vast proportion of movement resources.<span>&#xA0; </span>There is something of a comparison here in relation to the </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/19/charity-animals-cats-dog\"><span>discuss</span><span><span>ion</span></span></a><span> within Effective Altruism regarding animal shelters as the beneficiary of resources over farmed animal groups.<span>&#xA0; </span>When we look at the farmed animal movement then we can observe how a small number of welfare organisations have accumulated wealth and power<a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\"><span><span><span><span>[ii]</span></span></span></span></a>, whilst more ideologically diverse groups are consequently neglected in terms of both resources and consideration within EAA, and often in the broader movement at large.</span></p>\n<p><span>The benefits for utilitarian oriented groups gathering behind a single ideology are fairly numerous from an organisational perspective, where it is possible to support one another to equalise movement discourse in such a way that groups reinforce one another.<span>&#xA0; </span>So we could look at correlations between associated groups that dominate animal conferences, such as the </span><a href=\"https://ar-conference.org/\"><span>International Animal Rights Conference</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.arconference.org/\"><span>Animal Rights Conference</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://sentience-conference.org/\"><span>Sentience Conference</span></a><span> (in particular).<span>&#xA0; </span>This also means that groups can globalise under the same system, and this has happened in relation to the Centre for Effective Vegan Advocacy (CEVA), an ideologically reducetarian organisation that has chosen not to define the parameters of the work it undertakes.<span>&#xA0; </span>This is an approach backed by Peter Singer, Pro Veg, Faunalytics, Animal Equality, Beyond Carnism, FARM Sanctuary, Good Food Institute and HSUS through their board of advisors.<span>&#xA0; It&apos;s also worth mentioning at this point that including</span> Peter Singer as a board advisor can make it difficult to raise critical points in relation to organisations, this seems to coincide with people giving support on the basis of an association with one of the most famous people in Effective Altruism.<span>&#xA0; </span>So to argue against them in some way, is often to argue against the support he gives to that organisation, and essentially his judgement in doing so.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even whilst this form of welfare / reducetarian advocacy has become the norm within EAA, it still remains that in 2016 ACE recommended both </span><a href=\"http://www.animal-ethics.org/\"><span>Animal Ethics</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"https://www.nonhumanrights.org/\"><span>Non-Human Rights Project</span></a><span>, and neither necessarily fit into the welfare / abolition category, <span>&#xA0;</span>or are they particularly related groups. However, the overall picture supports a dominant discourse that is a combination of utilitarianism and welfare, so given that influence we ought to ask how it is that EAAs are working hard to be inclusive of other organisations and value systems.<span>&#xA0; </span>So one question might be the extent ACE are working with, and evaluating groups that exist outside the welfare paradigm in order to incorporate those issues of diversity.</span>&#xA0; <!-- [if gte mso

href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-interviews-lauren-ornelas/\">interviews</a>, the incorporation of some of the ideas as part of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICKxhc5VOr8\">symposium</a>, and an <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/how-can-we-integrate-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-into-the-animal-advocacy-movement/\">article</a> this year, but it remains unclear as to how important this is to ACE or EAA generally, and there is a vast disparity when comparing the work undertaken with welfare organisations, where issues such as these haven&apos;t been incorporated in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p><span>We also might consider the impact that EAA backed welfare organisations have had within the broader animal movement, and the possibility that people who choose not to associate with welfarism would also become disenfranchised with Effective Altruism, or indeed choose not to engage at all. <span>&#xA0;</span>Of course, we could wonder whether people would form their own groups, or attempt to exist outside this paradigm, though we could counter that &#x2018;welfare&#x2019; has also become increasingly globalised, so there is a consequent difficulty in maintaining alternative spaces.<span>&#xA0; </span>I believe the impact of this into the future has been under-considered in a similar way to how its existence has been neglected.<span>&#xA0; </span>Given this outcome EAA is unlikely to attract leading thinkers from different value systems, and this could be accounted as a cost in the reduction of analysis from different perspectives, and perhaps analysis overall (whilst also incorporating the risk of replacing expertise with something far less useful).<span>&#xA0; </span></span></p>\n<p><span>Another point to consider is where competitive movement aspects may have become limited, potentially leading to a decline in engagement.<span>&#xA0; </span>For instance, if EAA had the appearance of considering welfare as the best thing, and anything not associated with it as secondary, less effective or ineffective, then it can also diminish the requirement for counter consideration.<span>&#xA0; </span>Arguably we may already have reached the point that welfare has become the dominant narrative to the extent that EA frameworks are under applied, as utilising that perspective would have become self-evident.<span>&#xA0; </span>Further to this, meta-evaluation is not considered reasonably important by either </span><a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/01/external-evaluation-of-our-research/\"><span>GiveWell</span></a><span> or ACE, and neither by many people within EAA, so if we believe there is at least some validity in relation to concerns raised, there is no reference point to independent sources that could lead to validation or invalidation.<span><br></span></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Concluding thoughts.</span></p>\n<p><span>I am uncertain whether many EAAs would generally recognise they were treading on toes, but it might be one way to explain how it lacks diversity.<span>&#xA0; </span>The best way to find this out is from people who don&#x2019;t want to be involved with EAA and are critical of it.<span>&#xA0; </span>If instead we really believe that many people in the animal movement aren&#x2019;t interested in evidence, rationality, or effectiveness in relation to animal advocacy then I think this is unfortunate, because whilst some will not be, many would be interested in improving their advocacy on behalf of other animals.<span>&#xA0; </span>It also might be that EAA (or EA) isn&#x2019;t particularly interested in addressing these issues, preferring to think about other important ideas rather than foundational considerations.<span>&#xA0; </span>However, this overlooks that without these initial considerations it is very difficult to draw potential conclusions from EAA work in relation to what might be the best, or most effective thing to do, if it isn&#x2019;t based on a fair understanding of the various ideas present in the animal movement.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Considering some ways forward.</span></p>\n<p><span>Meta-evaluation &#x2013; with the necessary scope to consider foundational issues.</span></p>\n<p><span>Speculation &#x2013; in terms of donating to organisations that have certain values compatible with EA and that could provide a counter-point to the dominant position of utilitarian welfare groups within EAA and the broader animal movement.<span>&#xA0; </span>Given many people would not have the time to look beyond ACE top charities there could be a standardised form of offsetting or hedging based on ACE metrics.</span></p>\n<p><span>Democratisation / accountability &#x2013; EAA might consider whether the role of CEO at ACE could be limited in duration, and the potential value of rotating this role.<span>&#xA0; </span>I am also uncertain whether the advisory board is sufficiently diverse, and it appears there is reasonable scope for improvement.</span></p>\n<p><span>Modelling &#x2013; commit resources to modelling EAA in a way that is more inclusive, whilst fostering relations between people who aren&#x2019;t utilitarian or associated with the welfare movement.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0; </span>In this way it might be the case that EAA doesn&#x2019;t tread on toes as a matter of course (for example, where non-welfare &#x2018;abolitionists&#x2019; are referred to as extremist, fundamentalist, puritan, dogmatic absolutists). <span>&#xA0;</span>I also think there could be some adjustment around institutional intervention (particularly in relation to reflecting corporate organisation and hierarchy<a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\"><span><span><span><span>[iii]</span></span></span></span></a>) and individual &#x2018;mainstream&#x2019; messaging, to further consideration of </span><a href=\"http://www.gsdrc.org/professional-dev/social-movements/\"><span>social movement</span><span><span>s</span></span></a><span> which emphasise shared meanings and respectful characterisation that would also relate to EA <a

The examples used are neither exhaustive nor intended as recommended causes (although some may become recommended causes in the light of future research).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Causes that make systems change more tractable</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Systems change is typically very intractable; it can take a lot of time and resources to build public support for change and to drive through important policy changes.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>E.g. Political/democratic system</span></p>\n<p><span>If we were to change the political/democratic system itself, so that it becomes substantially easier to change policies for the common good, this would make changing other systems far more tractable.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Systems that affect our lives to a very large degree</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Some systems seem to have a particularly pervasive impact on our lives. Changing these systems for the better would likely have a very large positive impact.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>E.g. Economic system (including finance and banking system)</span></p>\n<p><span>In theory, in a capitalist economy wealth trickles down from the rich to the poor by way of the &#x2018;invisible hand&#x2019;. However, the structure of our current global economic, financial, corporate taxation and banking systems results in increasing financial inequality. </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/16/worlds-eight-richest-people-have-same-wealth-as-poorest-50\"><span>The world&#x2019;s eight richest people have the same wealth as the poorest 50%</span></a><span>. Structural systemic changes could reliably distribute global wealth in a far more equitable way.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>For profit corporations are legally responsible to their shareholders, and thus put profits first. Businesses are not legally designed to operate in the best interests of the world at large, and are free to exploit labour, and pollute and plunder the natural world. Businesses&#x2019; negative externalities could be internalised through regulation and taxation, building the social and environmental costs into the price of their goods and services.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>E.g. Education/social systems</span></p>\n<p><span>We are moulded by the systems that we grow up in; they shape our values, our habits, our sense of self and place in the world, and our beliefs about what&#x2019;s possible. Our social systems including our systems of healthcare, welfare, criminal justice and especially education, have the potential to give the population of Earth, en masse, the necessary tools, motivation and support to thrive and live deeply fulfilling, positively impactful lives.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Changing our system of technological innovation</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Technological progress is exponential, and shows no signs of slowing down. As a result, there is exponential opportunity for new technology to have positive impact. Emerging and future technologies also pose an increasing risk to the human civilization thriving long into the future. From unstoppable pandemics to runaway artificial intelligence, our technology may realistically become our undoing as a species.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Technological innovation is driven, in no small part, by economic forces: many research and development funding choices are based on the potential financial returns, which in turn are &#xA0;based on what humans with money are willing to buy, and we don&#x2019;t always buy what&#x2019;s best for us. Just because we can build it, and we can sell it, doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that we should.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Should we work to identify research that has an unacceptably high chance of causing harm, and prevent such research from happening? Do we need to put the brakes on our technological progress as a whole? </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Changing our system of technological innovation may well be harder than making our civilization environmentally sustainable; it may require a major reorientation of our global economic system. Given the scale of what&#x2019;s at stake, it may also be the most important cause there is.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Technological innovations that change systems</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Most system changes are driven primarily by one of three things: political action (e.g. setting up the UN), grassroots action (e.g. the abolition of slavery), or technological innovation (e.g. the electric light bulb, ushering in leisure time after dark). Given the exponential trend of technological innovation, this may now be the primary driver of systems change.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Technological innovations for whole systems change</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Breakthrough technologies often don&#x2019;t fit neatly into one system, but instead have wide-ranging impact across society and culture. Some new technologies lay the foundations for countless other innovations, and thus repattern the way we live our lives. Such &#x2018;foundational&#x2019; technologies include:</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>E.g. The internet, which has given unprecedented open access to knowledge and information, and normalized peer-to-peer production and consumption of news via social media.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>E.g. Blockchain, the technology that Bitcoin is built on. Still in its infancy, blockchain technology provides a tamper-proof, distributed public record, without the need for centralized management or administration. The potential applications are vast. Services built on blockchains could ultimately replace our centralized banking and political governance systems with transparent, distributed alternatives.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Technological innovations for specific system change</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>With a good understanding of a specific system, its failings, and a sense of what it could become, timely strategic technological innovations can play a vital role in bringing about systems change.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>E.g.

Time bankers can offer their time (perhaps doing something they love but wouldn&#x2019;t typically get paid for, for example, portrait painting), and can request help with specific tasks. This brings to life a gift economy, where individuals help each other out willingly without expecting financial recompense. Participating in a time bank can shift one&#x2019;s perception of economic value in a profound way, from being something scarce and transactional to something personal and abundant.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>&#xA0;</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Changing systems that directly relate to the top EA cause areas already identified</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Within the EA community, causes have been prioritized relating to the welfare of extremely poor people, and to the welfare of animals under human control. A systems change approach may offer highly effective ways to help these beneficiaries. In fact, I think that the current EA approach in both areas is somewhat systemic in nature.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>E.g.

The cash is generally spent on the things that will have the biggest positive impact on the quality of life of the recipients.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>This research, backed up with extensive pilot programmes, makes a good case for scaling up this intervention strategy.

Our faculty consists of internationally renowned experts, scientists, political activists and scholars; the one thing they share is a strong commitment to the urgency of educating people on this important topic.

E.g. if a group thinks that X is bad, then it&apos;s often seen as outright immoral to make an argument which would imply that X isn&apos;t quite as bad, or that some things which are classified as X would be more correctly classified as non-X instead. I don&apos;t want to give any specific examples so as to not derail the discussion, but hopefully everyone can think of some; the article &quot;<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/can-democracy-survive-tribalism.html\">Can Democracy Survive Tribalism</a>&quot; lists lot of them, picked from various sides of the political spectrum.</p>\n<p>Joshua Greene (<a href=\"https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27168\">among</a> <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.840.3768&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">others</a>) makes the argument, in his book <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Moral-Tribes-Emotion-Reason-Between/dp/0143126059/\">Moral Tribes</a>, that tribalism exists for the purpose of coordinating aggression and alliances against other groups (so that you can kill them and take their stuff, basically). It specifically exists for the purpose of making you hurt others, as well as defend yourself against people who would hurt you. And while defending yourself against people who would hurt you is clearly good, attacking others is clearly not. And everything being viewed in tribal terms means that we can&apos;t make much progress on things that actually matter: as someone commented, &quot;people are fine with randomized controlled trials in policy, as long as the trials are on things that nobody cares about&quot;.</p>\n<p>Given how deep tribalism sits in the human psyche, it seems unlikely that we&apos;ll be getting rid of it anytime soon. That said, there do seem to be a number of things that affect the <em>amount</em> of tribalism we have:</p>\n<p>* As Steven Pinker argues in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature\">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a>, violence in general has declined over historical time, replaced by more cooperation and an assumption of human rights; Democrats and Republicans may still hate each other, but they generally agree that they still shouldn&apos;t be killing each other.<br> * As a purely anecdotal observation, I seem to get the feeling that people on the autism spectrum tend to be less tribal, up to the point of not being able to perceive tribes at all. (this suggests, somewhat oddly, that the world would actually be a better place if everyone was slightly autistic)<br> * Feelings of safety or threat seem to play a lot into feelings of tribalism: if you perceive (correctly or incorrectly) that a group Y is out to get you and that they are a real threat to you, then you will react much more aggressively to any claims that might be read as supporting Y. Conversely, if you feel safe and secure, then you are much less likely to feel the need to attack others.</p>\n<p>The last point is especially troublesome, since it can give rise to self-fulfilling predictions. Say that Alice says something to Bob, and Bob misperceives this as an insult; Bob feels threatened so snaps at Alice, and now Alice feels threatened as well, so shouts back. The same kind of phenomenon seems to be going on a much larger scale: whenever someone perceives a threat, they are no longer willing to give someone the benefit of doubt, and would rather treat the other person as an enemy. (which isn&apos;t too surprising, since it makes evolutionary sense: if someone <em>is</em> out to get you, then the cost of misclassifying them as a friend is much bigger than the cost of misclassifying a would-be friend as an enemy. you can always find new friends, but it only takes one person to get near you and hurt you really bad)</p>\n<p>One implication might be that general mental health work, not only in the conventional sense of &quot;healing disorders&quot;, but also the positive psychology-style mental health work that actively seeks to make people happy rather than just fine, could be even more valuable for society than we&apos;ve previously thought. Curing depression etc. would be enormously valuable even by itself, but if we could figure out how to make people generally happier and resilient to negative events, then fewer things would threaten their well-being and they would perceive fewer things as being threats, reducing tribalism.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Kaj_Sotala"}}, {"_id": "jL3ts6NyDQmcneGPy", "title": "General lessons on how to build EA communities.

In particular it:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Reinforces the importance of having a good offer</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Suggests a strategy growing a fledgling EA community, by considering P and O</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Breaks down the things to consider when outreaching EA through a community.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h2>A, Access &#x2013; &#xA0;leverage potential community members</h2>\n<p><span>Access is how well you can reach and talk to a group. We can break down into:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Available potential community members. </span><span>People you already have contacts to who would be willing to be part of this community. This is the biggest factor to getting access. (See section below on </span><span>Getting Started</span><span>).</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eliteness</span><span>. How elite / high status people are inversely affects how easily they can be reached. Gatekeeping may be needed for elite communities (See section below on </span><span>Gatekeeping</span><span>).</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Skill</span><span>. The persuasiveness and skill of the person doing the community outreach work.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Other factors</span><span>.

Roughly it is the percentage of people who are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Altruistic </span><span>enough to care about having an impact,</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Interested in </span><span>effectiveness </span><span>enough to care about doing the most good</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Flexible </span><span>enough to change any existing altruistic plans they have.

It can be valuable to focus community building efforts on such people. </span><span>Eg GWWC</span><span> puts effort to help people who have pledged donate effectively. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>O, offer &#xA0;&#x2013; &#xA0;Reinforcing the importance of having a good offer</h2>\n<p><span>EA provides useful tools to support people to do good.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Sometimes EA has a strong offer, for example if you are a student making a career decision EA has a lot of advice that can multiply your impact. EA has produced valuable research on early career choice, cause selection, charity evaluation, existential risk, and animal ethics. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Often EA has a very weak offer, (at times I have tended to forget this, assuming that because EA was useful to me, others will find it helpful). We currently have little to offer to people who are not utilitarian, not at the start of their career, interested in activism, want to create systemic changes, already experts in global poverty, have communities encouraging them to do good, have limited capacity (time/money) for doing good, etc, etc.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Case study:</span><span> when I was running THINK lots of universities were successfully starting EA chapters.

Often there is a body of people who would benefit from a community and it just needs a bit of action to bring it together.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>When creating communities like this it &#xA0;is helpful to have someone who is already part of the target group who is willing to run a community.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>For example </span><span>when THINK seeded new student groups this had a high failure rate, but where there was existing keen student(s) willing to run a group success was more likely.<br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Case study:</span><span> The London EA finance group was started by people working in finance in London. To kickstart the group we pulled together a list of existing EAs who worked in finance (thinking of contacts we knew and inviting people form the EA London email list to let us know if they worked in this area). This meant that the initial events already had a sizable body of interesting engaged EAs, making it easier to develop events good enough for people in finance to bring colleagues to. The group was run by an EA who worked in finance.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><span><br>Even one or two people who of the type you are looking to outreach too is really useful.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>For example </span><span>REG already had contacts within professional poker. The Future Generations APPG of UK Lords and MPs benefited from having Lord Martin Rees on board.<br><br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Be business smart</h2>\n<p><span>It feels like obvious advice but it is so rarely stated. If you want to run a community full-time you should be generally good at running things:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Be business smart. understand strategy and how to set targets, make plans, reach goals, etc.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Find good mentors and advisors to support you. Other EAs will help you! </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Take a lean approach, try to prioritise learning.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<h2>Momentum</h2>\n<p><span>The default state of a community is decay - people attend when something is new gradually will return less and less frequently. &#xA0;Communities need to retain momentum to keep people engaged. This means fostering:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Change. </span><span>A community that grows, changes and has a stream of new people and new ideas remains interesting.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Sub-communities </span><span>that long term attendees can join (such as a career network or being a member of GWWC).</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Friendships.</span><span> Connect people to others they&#x2019;d get on well with.

Apparently, they were so friendly they started to attract a small body of people (largely guys) with limited social skills. Drawn in by the welcoming atmosphere they felt at home. However, this made the group off-putting to other people.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I have continued to ensure the London community stays welcoming and friendly. I have handled this issue by asking people to volunteer or supporting people to improve how they approach others or talk about effective altruism.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<h2>Gatekeeping</h2>\n<p><span>Gatekept events or whole communities tend to be higher quality and people are more likely to attend an event if they feel it will be relevant to them. Furthermore</span><span> gatekeeping does not necessarily lead to less attendance at events</span><span>, a gatekept event may well get higher turnout. (Of course this has to be weighed against the fact that gatekept events may be elitist and off-putting).</span></p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Case study:</span><span> Our first event for people in finance attracted a lot more interest than expected.

Here are some examples of gatekeeping form the minimal to the most severe:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Reactive gatekeeping: Turn away disruptive or aggressive individuals</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. an individual turns up who drinks far too much and is rude to others so you tell them not to come again</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. discourage an attended who you think is looking just to plug their own product form turning up to an event by sending a personal email warning them that we do not like people to push their own products at events.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Passive gatekeeping: only market to certain channels</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. Post on Facebook so only the more engaged people in your community who follow the Facebook group see the post</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. Not run an event join with a particular group as you worry that your own community will be inundated by people from this group and become undiverse.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Off-putting: Make it an effort to find out about or attend events. How off-putting an event is can be varied drastically.</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. charging for events or hosting in locations that have a significant travel time cost.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. On event signups: </span><span>If you want to come to this event please say in 150 words what your aims are and what you want to get out of the event</span><span>.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. Saying: </span><span>if you are interested in this topic please email the following address</span><span>. Then only inviting the people who emailed to attend the event or join the community.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Incidental entry requirements</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. event is in a school so only students can attend</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Entry requirements</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. You must be a GWWC member to attend this event.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. You must be a past or current UK Civil Servant to attend this event / be on this email list.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. Question on a form for people interested in finance events: </span><span>please state which area of finance you work in</span><span>? Asking for details can prevent people from falsely attending.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Application form</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. Saying: If you are interested in founding a charity please let us know by filling out this short form. Then only telling people who gave good responses that you will host an event (no one is knowingly rejected).</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Eg. Saying: </span><span>to attend EA Global please apply by answering these questions</span><span>. We will pick people we think are interesting.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Invitee only.
