Consistent with other \"link posts\" on this blog, this is me sharing stuff I've come across and read, and in this case I've read the papers partly because of personal connections to the organizations.)</p><h2><strong>Eliciting Latent Knowledge</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://alignmentresearchcenter.org/\"><strong><u>Alignment Research Center (ARC)</u></strong></a>, a two-person organization I\u2019m on the board of, released a paper on <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge\"><strong><u>Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)</u></strong></a>, which I\u2019d summarize as \u201ctrying to think of theoretically robust ways to train an AI such that it will \u2018tell the truth,\u2019 even in a sort of worst-case situation where it would be easy by default for it to fool humans.\u201d</p><p>The paper largely takes the form of a \u201cgame\u201d between a \u201cbuilder\u201d (who proposes training strategies that might work) and a \u201cbreaker\u201d (who thinks of ways the strategies could fail), and ARC is offering <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QEYWkRoCn4fZxXQAY/prizes-for-elk-proposals\"><strong><u>cash prizes</u></strong></a> for people who can come up with further \u201cbuilder\u201d moves.</p><p>The heart of the challenge is the possibility that when one tries to train an AI by <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/#making-pasta\"><strong><u>trial-and-error</u></strong></a> on answering questions from humans - with \"success\" being defined as \"its answers match the ones the human judges (possibly with AI assistance) think are right\" - the most simple, natural way for the AI to learn this task is to learn to (a) <i>answer a question as a human judge would answer it</i>, rather than (b) <i>answering a question truthfully.</i></p><ul><li>(a) and (b) are the same as long as humans can understand everything going on (as in any tests we might run);</li><li>(a) and (b) come apart when humans can't understand what's going on (as might happen once AIs are taking lots of actions in the world).</li></ul><p>It's not clear how relevant this issue will turn out to be in practice; what I find worrying is that this seems like just the sort of problem that could be <i>hard to notice </i>(or fix) via experimentation and direct observation, since an AI that learns to do (a) could pass lots of tests while not in fact being truthful when it matters. (My description here is oversimplified; there are a lot more wrinkles in the writeup.) Some of the \"builder\" proposals try to think about ways that \"telling the truth\" and \"answering as a human judge would answer\" might have differently structured calculations, so that we can find ways to reward the former over the latter.</p><p>This is a theory paper, and I thought it'd be worth sharing a side note on its <a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/my-research-methodology-b94f2751cb2c\"><strong><u>general methodology </u></strong></a>as well.</p><ul><li>One of my big concerns about AI alignment theory is that there are no natural feedback loops for knowing whether an insight is important (due to how embryonic the field is, there isn't even much in the way of interpersonal mentorship and feedback). Hence, it seems inherently very easy to spend years making \"fake progress\" (writing down seemingly-important insights).</li><li>ARC recognizes this problem, and focuses its theory work on \"worst case\" analysis partly because this somewhat increases the \"speed of iteration\": an idea is considered failed if the researchers can think of any way for it to fail, so lots of ideas get considered and quickly rejected. This way, there are (relatively - still not absolutely) clear goals, and an expectation of daily progress in the form of concrete proposals and counterexamples.</li></ul><p><strong>I wrote a </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Q2BJnpNh8e6RAWFnm/consider-trying-the-elk-contest-i-am\"><strong><u>piece on the Effective Altruism forum</u></strong></a><strong> pitching people (especially technical people) on spending some time on the contest, even if they think they\u2019re very unlikely to win a prize or get hired by ARC.</strong> I argue that this contest represents an unusual opportunity to get one\u2019s head into an esoteric, nascent, potentially crucial area of AI research, without needing any background in AI alignment (though I expect most people who can follow this to have some general technical background and basic familiarity with machine learning).

But don't take the lower word count as lower excitement - I think this series of papers is some of the most important work going on in AI research right now. <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2269iGRnWruLHsZ5r/transformer-circuits\"><strong><u>This piece by Evan Hubinger </u></strong></a>gives a brief technical-ish summary of what\u2019s exciting, as well.</p><p>Breaking down and starting to understand the \u201cblack box\u201d of how AI models are \"thinking\" is a lot of work, even for simplified systems, but it seems like essential work to me if these sorts of systems are going to become more powerful and integrated into the economy.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnm1a2myprn2e\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefm1a2myprn2e\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is of course a simplification.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn5fgbv2abiis\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref5fgbv2abiis\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>\"Prompting\" is different from \"training.\" The AI has been \"trained\" on huge amounts of Internet content to pick up the general skill: \"When prompted with some words, predict which words come next.\" The intervention discussed here is adding to the words it is \"prompted with\" that are giving its already-trained prediction algorithm clues about what comes next.&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "HoldenKarnofsky"}}, {"_id": "insWrZ96B85nWdkqL", "title": "[Cause Exploration Prizes] NOT Getting Absolutely Hosed by a Solar Flare", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T08:23:23.613Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This essay was submitted to Open Philanthropy's&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-exploration-prizes/\"><i>Cause Exploration Prizes</i></a><i>&nbsp;contest.</i></p><p>On September 1, 1859, the Carrington Event happened\u2014a massive solar storm that caused actual fires in telegraph stations due to sparks from wires. Our current best estimates for the frequency of these storms is around once every 150 years. I will note that 2022\u20131859 = 163 years. I will also note that no organism has anything resembling metal wires in its physiology, even though evolution could absolutely make wire-like constructs and such a thing would be useful in a variety of situations. I'd ADDITIONALLY note that the Carrington Event isn't necessarily the strongest solar storm that could ever happen.&nbsp;</p><p>If a Carrington-level Event were to happen today, it would be absolutely devastating to the planet. All of our satellites, including GPS, would be destroyed. There is a good chance that much of the data on the internet would be erased. During the event, it's not possible to communicate by radio, which would cause havoc among military forces, who would suddenly wonder if a nuclear attack has happened, yet be unable to contact anyone higher up in the chain of command. Supposedly, some military communication lines and data centers are \"hardened\" against a Carrington Event. I am very suspicious about these supposed protections, because I haven't seen robust testing to confirm that they are indeed resistant to Carrington-levels of solar storm. Anything not routinely tested and audited will almost certainly fail when we need it most. Even if some militaries are more prepared than I think they are, it is worth OpenPhil's investment to do a survey of military preparedness and expected responses to a Carrington Event.</p><p>My proposal is not to somehow mitigate a Carrington Event entirely. That's impossible. Regardless of what we do, many trillions of dollars will be lost the next time a Carrington Event happens. That's already locked-in. However, I think there are a few focus areas where an organization like OpenPhil could buy a decent amount of risk mitigation for minimal dollars:</p><h1>Overall summary of highest impact per $ actions OpenPhil can take in this area.&nbsp;</h1><p>1.) Fund research to survey military preparedness for a Carrington Event. Summarize the likely military results that would occur if a Carrington Event would happen today, with a special emphasis on the probability of an accidental nuclear exchange.&nbsp;</p><p>2.) Fund research to propose to governments mitigation strategies for a Carrington Event including securing food supplies, and establishing a strategic reserve of radio equipment and other computer technologies stored offline inside a Faraday cage.</p><h1>Other thoughts</h1><p>1) Make sure that the militaries with nuclear weapons have actually reasonable safeguards in place to not launch nukes in the event of a Carrington Event. During a Carrington Event, radio stops working; the event would likely strike suddenly and without warning, and it would resemble an EMP attack or even a nuclear attack. Ideally, nuclear subs and other nuclear launch stations should have a clear way to discriminate between a Carrington Event and an EMP/nuclear attack and the training to actually make that discrimination. One way to make this discrimination might be to look for auroras\u2014which happen during Carrington Events but not nuclear attacks\u2014but there are almost certainly much better ways to make this distinction. I think that an organization like OpenPhil could potentially help an organization dedicated to developing materials or translating existing materials and making them available to militaries across the world.&nbsp;</p><p>2) A more ambitious project would be to develop a method of country-to-country communication that would function during the precious minutes of a Carrington Event when every other communication technology is utterly disrupted. Even if it would be a very expensive technology compared to telecommunication, it would probably be worth it to have it in place as a substitute for the mythical \"red phone\" in the White House. All-optical technologies / robust hardness + testing are options here.&nbsp;</p><p>3) OpenPhil could pay to build an ACTUALLY hardened data center (with routine Carrington-level tests) and store within it critical information of historical interest, or lobby governments to do the same. This would safeguard valuable historical data and help to rebuild the internet after it gets severely damaged during the next major solar storm.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "aurellem"}}, {"_id": "nf4g6CrQRYyXwBuZk", "title": "[Cause Exploration Prizes] Social Enterprises in Africa", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T07:18:35.494Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This essay was submitted to Open Philanthropy's&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-exploration-prizes/\"><i>Cause Exploration Prizes</i></a><i>&nbsp;contest.</i></p><h2><strong>In a nutshell</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>What is the problem?</strong></li></ul><p>Social entreprises in Africa build and maintain single service delivery models for their organizations, which is initially costly and unsustainable, forcing them to seek subsidies or bundle products to until they achieve a sustanable model.</p><ul><li><strong>What are possible interventions?&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Outsourcing.</p><p>Bundling products and services.</p><p>Seeking subsidies.</p><p>Going into upmarket client segments.</p><p>Limiting the reach into deep rural and marginalized areas.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else is working on this?&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Outsourcing companies.</p><p>Companies leveraging the gig economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The problem</strong></h2><p>The past decade of development and social enterprise investments in Africa has highlighted two recurring paths: 1) Often, single-service programs run through subsidies until the desired goals are reached, and the program is closed or becomes unsustainable; 2) Alternatively, those programs that seek sustainability, more often than not, are forced to begin adding new product and service offerings or take over increasingly large parts of the value chain (i.e., procurement, logistics, credit, etc.). While the latter can be an effective path to sustainability, there is a massive time and financial cost associated with the gradual ramp-up until a comprehensive and financially efficient product offering is reached.</p><h2><strong>Possible Interventions</strong></h2><ul><li><i><strong>Outsourcing</strong></i></li></ul><p>Many social enterprises, especially post COVID-19, are outsourcing third-party&nbsp; companies to perform services or create goods that were traditionally performed in-house by the company's staff as a cost-cutting measure.</p><ul><li><i><strong>Product bundling through strategic partnerships</strong></i></li></ul><p>Many social enterprises resort to grouping several products together and selling them as a single unit for one price. This strategy is used to encourage customers to buy products that they need but do not see the sufficient value to trigger them to invest. For instance, many tech-enabled advisory products targeting smallholder farmers are unsustainable because, even though they are affordable to end customers, the cost of setting up a single-purpose distribuion channel would render the solution economically unviable. Therefore, they partner with organizations with viable offering, such as lending institutions, and embed their agronomy advisory to credit, which are together distributed by village agents.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>Seeking subsidies</strong></i></li></ul><p>Social enterprises can leverage subsidies through philanthropic investments or government subsidies to lower the costs of offering innovative solutions to people in need or increase the uptake of their solution by the target group. A good example is an insuretech offering agriculture insurance to smallhlders. They would require premium subsidies from the government to generate enough revenue to sustain the product in rural areas.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>Limiting the reach into deep rural and marginalized areas and&nbsp;going upmarket.</strong></i></li></ul><p>A lot of social entrepreneurs set out to serve the most marginalised members of society whene they start their companies. However, they discover the cost of sustaining operations is quite steep, especially in comparison to the revenue they generate per customer. Without subsidies or product bundling, many of these entrepreneurs tend to start targeting urban and peri-urban markets where the costs of operations are significantly lower and the revenue per client is higher than rural markets. As a result, marginalized communities are left out of the picture and have to resort to coping mechanisms to get by. For instance, we see social impactful organizations such One Acre Fund now targeting large scale farmers as well, to remain competitive and sustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What could a philanthropist support?</strong></h2><p>Philanttorpists can:</p><ul><li><i><strong>Support studies</strong></i></li></ul><p>As we mentioned previously, there is deficiency in data shedding light on the actual costs of single service delivery models required to assess the potential impacts of multi-delivery channel. It\u2019s not that the data is not available, it\u2019s just that the data is not publicly avaiable since most social entreprises are not public or publicly traded institituions. However, investors can estimates the distribution and customer acquisition costs of the innovations they fund through financial reports.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>Measure and monitor the cost of distribution of the innovations they fund</strong></i></li></ul><p>Philanthropists may track the distribution costs of the solutions they fund as a key performance indicator, based on the different target locations and products. We believe that customer acquisition and product distribution costs are a significant spending for start ups in Africa, espeically those serving marginalized customers in hard to reach areas.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>Offer funding and technical assistance support to organizations tackling the distribution challenges in marginalized communities.</strong></i></li></ul><p>Providing technical assistance to innovative organizations creating multi-purpose delivery channels could improve the outcomes of impact investments per dollar, espeically in the hard-to-reach areas where most organizations don\u2019t even venture into due to the high costs of acquiring customers with low purchasing power. Investing in such organizations is like investing in constructing the roads into these communities, so that other organizations can drive there.</p><ul><li><i><strong>Influence policy&nbsp;</strong></i></li></ul><p>Deleloping marginalized areas and ensuring that the populations there have access to essential goods and services are largely the responsibility of the government. Therefore, philanthropic efforts might focus running pilot and scaling projects, generating critical insights and providing decision makers in the government with the evidence and resources to craft effective rural development policies.</p><h2><strong>How cost effective could spending in this area be?</strong></h2><p>While we have not investigated the overall cost of single service delivery models vs multi-purpose delivery channels, there\u2019s widespread agreement that the needs of communities are intertwined, and creating a multi-service delivery model with service integrations that focus on the whole customer journey maximizes the strength of product offerings, reduces prices, minimizes confusion, gains trust, and, ultimately, improves the quality of life.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Who else is working on this?</strong></h2><ul><li><i><strong>Philanthropic organizations</strong></i></li></ul><p>Philanthropic interest in rural development appears to be limited but growing rapidly with over 80% of social investment in Africa from 2015 to 2019, going towards financial inclusion, smallholder agriculture and clean energy solutions for off-grid households, all largely targeting rural communities.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>Government</strong></i></li></ul><p>Governments are the facilitators of rural development, playing key roles in through law enforcement, policy formulation and implementation, and providing administrative services with external assistance.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What we have done</strong></h2><p>FlexGiG onboards and profiles agents across Africa via its mobile app, driving visibility to its existing and potential partners on agents available for their solutions across Africa. FlexGiG assigns its top talents to understand each customer's needs deeply, adapt clients\u2019 strategies into local contexts, and select suitable agents with skill and precision. The recruited agents will be the trusted link between our partners and customers, ensuring our partners' products successfully reach the right markets, whatever their solutions may be. FlexGiG helps its partners recruit suitable agents for their business needs basing on agents\u2019 education level, experience, psychometric profile, past performance ratings, and proximity to project location.</p><p>FlexGiG then works with the partner to develop a project training curriculum, performance targets, deliverables, performance indicator dashboards, and smart contract incentive structures for agents selected to carry out the assignment. FlexGiG runs soft pilots for the client to assess the quality of work before signing off a full-scale roll-out. FlexGiG will take full ownership of the project for the customer and agent output, providing complete customer visibility of the project activities through API system integrations, live dashboards, and scheduled communications and reports.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure we always deliver results, FlexGiG is always resourceful in providing its partners with all the necessary access to knowledge, advice, relationships, and on-the-ground logistics.</p><p>From mid-April, when we formed, to date, FlexGiG has registered its entity in Kenya, set up a basic IT infrastructure (website, mobile app, web platform, G-suite, digital learning platform for agent remote training), a strategic partnership with one organization, has gathered a database of over 5,000 agents across 5 countries in Africa, has created 10 jobs and has onboarded one corporate client.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Potential risks and downsides</strong></h2><p>We have identified a number of potential risks and downsides to funding multi-purpose delivery channels in Africa, including</p><ul><li><strong>Hesitance by corporates to engage gig workers.</strong> Corporate and SME usage of gig workers is still developing, as is the uptake of online professional services. This is especially true among corporations due to their misperception that these workers are of poor quality</li><li><strong>No gig workers in rural areas.</strong> Online gig work is also limited to urban areas, despite the efforts of government and other development actors to introduce youth in rural areas to digital skills and employment. Poor network coverage or connectivity quality, little information, and low awareness and trust in gig work limit penetration in these geographies.</li><li><strong>Social protection for workers.&nbsp;</strong>The failure of the trade union movement to fully adapt to deindustrialization and decentralization of labor greatly reduces the bargaining power of workers relative to capital.</li><li><strong>Regulatroy uncertainty.</strong> Gig economy and multi-purpose delivery channels is a new arena for legislation and regulation. As gig workers rise, governments will enact new legislation for their taxation and social benefits. Some laws may limit the work that companies can outsource in the international gig economy. Also, data protection laws are getting more stringent, and multinational companies are very cautious about sharing the key information required to implement their core activities with other parties outside their organization.</li><li><strong>Ethical concerns.</strong> Ethical concerns as gig economy companies are widely criticized for unethical practices such as low pay, precarity, stressful and dangerous working conditions, one-sided contracts, and a lack of social protection.</li><li><strong>Limited research into gig economy.&nbsp;</strong>To date, little is known about the size and impact of the gig economy in low- and middle-income countries, limiting investments into the sector.</li><li><strong>Limited tech infrastructure&nbsp;</strong>in rural infrastructure may limit the spread and reach of gig workers, leaving certain portions of the population still unserved or underserved.</li><li><strong>Women face societal and occupational barriers that may limit their participation in the gig economy.&nbsp;</strong>Social norms and occupational segregation \u2013 the tendency for women to be employed in some sectors and not others \u2013 have significantly limited women\u2019s engagement in gig work.</li></ul><h2><strong>Our process and next steps</strong></h2><p>FlexGiG targets SMEs and multinationals seeking to expand their businesses in new or existing markets in Africa.

FlexGiG intermediates with project management services to ensure the partners\u2019 expectations concerning quality, performance, and compliance standards are satisfied.&nbsp;</p><p>FlexGiG\u2019s service provider agents typically fall into four segments: 1) Free agent who derives primary income from independent work; 2) Casual earner who supplements income by choosing independent work; 3) Reluctant who lives off independent work but prefers traditional jobs and; 4) Financially strapped who works out of necessity. They choose FlexGiG because;</p><ol><li>They demand more flexibility in how they work,</li><li>They are diversifying their income streams,</li><li>They want more control over their location,</li><li>They lack experience or technical training required for formal jobs and need job exposure and career advancements,</li><li>They want to be their boss</li><li>There are no job opportunities in their location that digitalization provides.</li><li>They want a better work-life balance.</li></ol><p>For its agents; FlexGiG provides capacity building, offers, bonuses, and incentives to independently contract with FlexGiG via the digital platform and implement projects. Capacity building a remote workforce requires FlexGiG to reimagine its learning programs and integrate \u201clearning moments\u201d in a seamless gig agent journey.&nbsp;</p><p>FlexGIG uses a boundless digital \u201clearning as a journey\u201d approach that starts even before the agents start work and continues for all the upskilling and engagement they will need during their partnership with FlexGiG. The system provides a balance where agents would be able to learn at a pace they\u2019re comfortable with and at their point of need, which can only be done through digital solutions that are always-on. The training must be designed with the agent at heart (see graphic) because remote learning requires greater self-discipline and motivation. Consequently, the design of each course puts the agents' experience at the core to make learning delightful, fun, motivating, and engaging, as shown in the graphic below;</p><p>We encode the following attributes in digital learning to ensure agents get the most out of FlexGiG\u2019s remote digital-learning offerings:</p><ol><li>Bite-sized chunks of microlearning to maximize knowledge retention;</li><li>Experiential \u201chands-on\u201d experience even though they are virtual;</li><li>Social elements that involve learning in collaboration with other agents;</li><li>Games and competitions induce a sense of fun, achievement, and friendly competition.</li></ol><p>FlexGiG can continue empowering agents to produce sustained performance and success for the wide variety of FlexGiG\u2019s partners at scale by incorporating a flexible, scalable, and customized digital learning solution. The learning platform also provides a centralized hub for agents\u2019 access to engaging learning content, capacity-building resources, updates, and other support items that encourage agents to immerse themselves within their roles and continuously work to attain professional growth. Conversely, an engaged, empowered, and knowledgeable team that continues to innovate can withstand evolving industry changes and client/project needs.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>Partners</strong></i></li><li><i><strong>Technology</strong></i></li></ul><p>FlexGiG partners outsource to FlexGiG geographically-tethered work that requires it to happen in specific places and at specific times. In other words, work that they cannot outsource over the internet (constrained by the internet\u2019s physical infrastructure) nor conveniently conduct themselves due to geographic constraints such as distance and the local political economy. FlexGiG connects them with workers who need to be in the right place and at the right time to complete the geographically tethered tasks such as; sales, marketing, training, customer registrations, research, data collection, price reporting, competitor analysis, after-sale services, and assessments. Through a partnership with FlexGiG, organizations;</p><ol><li>Cut costs on staff recruitment and retention initiatives such as wages, benefits, training, workspace, transport, and equipment (e.g., tablets, motorcycles, etc.)</li><li>Can find the best workers in target markets without physical and managerial constraints</li><li>Fill specific roles that would be cost-inefficient to hire full-time staff.</li><li>Can better adapt to workload seasonality&nbsp;</li><li>Access to a more diverse and dispersed workforce</li><li>Cost-efficiently set up and run shorter-term and deadline-tight projects such as field research, data collection, market analysis, merchandising, product development, and pilots.</li></ol><p>FlexGiG\u2019s business model is designed to intermediate and address the following concerns that prevent SMEs and multinationals from engaging the gig economy workers;</p><ol><li>Limited knowledge transfer and skills development capacity of gig workers</li><li>More difficulty building organization culture and developing long term relationship with clients</li><li>More challenges to training and quality management</li><li>Some gig workers take on too much work and have competing priorities with multiple firms/companies</li><li>Availability and loyalty of gig workers may not be as high as for employees</li><li>In many jurisdictions, gig workers are required to use their own technological devices, and this could result in greater technology and cybersecurity risks<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>FlexGiG business model relies on a suite of cutting-edge digital infrastructure platform that include;&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Web Platform and Mobile app - Currently, FlexGiG has developed and manages a digital labour platform that&nbsp; allow it to access a pool of on-demand workers to offer its partners tailored market-linkage, advisory and on-ground logistics services for their market expansion. In the future, FlexGiG will further develop the app to provide a more robust infrastructure and a core architecture that governs the interaction possibilities between different demand-side and supply-side user groups, driven by network effects to draw in users.</li><li>Payments infrastructure - FlexGig will develop need technology functions embedded in banking and new mobile wallet payment platforms to facilitate payments, establishing trust mechanisms between the company and its decentralized workforce. We\u2019ll encode a myriad of performance management features that impose regulations and nudges on the quality and volume of agent output such as real-time location tracking and timing of every agent.</li><li>FlexGiG will build its products and services on top of this globalized stack of infrastructures&nbsp; such as the IP addressing system, the GPS, Google Maps as a base layer, the Apple and Google Android phone operating systems, and cloud management information systems and storage to scale relatively quickly and easily adapt to market conditions and contexts. The use of algorithms will keep the costs low while providing a new way to manage a geographically dispersed and scalable workforce. Jobs are assigned and evaluated through code and data without human intervention.</li></ol>", "user": {"username": "elvin"}}, {"_id": "EsKBf4Cgwsw7foEXy", "title": "[Cause Exploration Prizes] Building a new milk", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T07:09:49.379Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This anonymous essay was submitted to Open Philanthropy's&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-exploration-prizes/\"><i>Cause Exploration Prizes</i></a><i>&nbsp;contest and published with the author's permission.</i></p><p>I have noticed that a mixture that is 50% cashew milk and 50% cow milk taste pretty much exactly like milk (although one might want to experiment with the percentage).&nbsp;</p><p>Since cashew milk is 25 calories per cup, and regular milk is 90 to 150 calories a cup (depending on fat percentage), cc milk (that is, cow + cashew milk) has vastly fewer calories than milk.

The problem&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The lack of access to financial literacy programs for adults is a big challenge for the rural populations in Africa. Financial literacy plays a crucial role in eradicating poverty and uplifting rural areas' economic development. However, the lack of reliable financial literacy data makes it difficult to assess financial illiteracy levels in Africa confidently. It has been argued that financial literacy and capability are vital demand-side elements to foster financial inclusion. However, little is currently known about these topics in Africa, and surveys are just beginning to measure financial literacy and capability. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Making Finance Work for Africa (MFW4A) partnership initiated projects that are trying to improve diagnostics for understanding financial literacy in Africa.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1.1 Importance&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Financial illiteracy is a huge problem in rural communities in Africa: According to Africa Development Bank\u2019s Financial Inclusion report, less than one adult out of four in Africa has access to an account at a formal financial institution. It\u2019s also neglected as stakeholders often overlook financial literacy as a critical intervention.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1.2 Neglectedness&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Financial literacy is not a new concept and is not highly neglected. Millions of dollars have been invested into financial literacy programs across East Africa. Usually, banks, microfinance institutions, SACCOs, insurance companies, and INGOs offer financial education. However, due to the cost-ineffectiveness of and inability to measure impact in conventional financial education programs, stakeholders often see them as a public good rather than a viable business case. As a result, only a tiny number of organizations are formed solely focused on trying to promote financial literacy.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1.3 Tractability&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><strong>How can a philanthropic funder help to make progress on this problem?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are cost-effective interventions for delivering financial topics more effectively at scale through partnerships using modern content styles and delivery channels that could significantly contribute to solving the problem of financial illiteracy in rural communities. Philanthropic funders can help support these innovations (which can be developed, tested, iterated, and piloted cheaply) to scale and measure the impact of financial literacy initiatives on beneficiaries\u2019 lives and well-being in the short- and long-term.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2. Possible Interventions&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3><strong>2.1 Challenges in existing solutions&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Rural Inclusion\u2019s approach to offering financial literacy to the target market in rural communities addresses the pain points of the vast majority of existing financial literacy programs, which are mainly face-to-face workshops. The first challenge is that in order to scale, expenditure increases proportionately: Typical training costs are salaries of specialist facilitators, facilitation on the ground for learning groups, travel costs, accommodation costs, and materials. The second challenge is the content style needs to be engaging for the rural population, which means going beyond generic materials such as leaflets for complex topics such as insurance into styles such as gamification, roleplays, dramas, and radio which can be entertaining. However, still, the cost to scale these programs are significant and there is a lack of continuous learning and an inability to create linkages over a long period which is needed for any new topic, especially financial education which doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Another challenge is the standardization of delivery of content, which is left in the hands of facilitators in traditional delivery, who typically are not financial specialists due to the complexity of certain topics in finance. Standardization of delivery in training is a key issue for organizations using community-centric approaches that creates trust working through champion farmer models and village extension workers employed locally, as messages from trainer of trainer sessions can be diluted and difficult to track.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3. Who else is working on this?&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3><strong>3.1 Financial services providers&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Usually, banks, microfinance institutions, SACCOs, insurance companies, and INGOs offer financial education. They educate their customers and members about finance in productbased education workshops, where groups will often learn about the benefits of a specific product without increasing their wider financial knowledge. These organizations are interested in promoting financial literacy among their customers. They may want their customers to increase savings and retirement planning, make realistic assessments of financial products and services, manage debt, make investments or learn consumer rights as per regulation.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>4. What have we done so far?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Rural Inclusion (RI) is a non-profit social enterprise focusing on financial education in rural communities in Africa. RI supports holistic financial literacy among the poorest groups to ensure no one is left behind. To date, RI is self-funded by the co-founders\u2019 contribution of $115,000 spent on animations, mobile app development, and research projects.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Successfully conducted a research project with 8,395 individuals belonging to 235 VSLA groups in Lwengo District, Uganda in partnership with Lwengo District Business Council and Joy for Humanity.&nbsp;</li><li>Following the pilot project, we began to develop a solution for rural communities called Ostrii. Ostrii is a platform redefining the delivery of financial education to fulfill the current needs of a post-COVID-19 world, leveraging 3D/2D animation, expert videos, comic books and quizzes to empower local partners to teach rural communities on budgeting and bookkeeping, saving, investments, credit, insurance, and digital literacy. RI integrated the insights for ensuring the feasibility and fidelity of implementation of Ostrii in rural places from the pilot into the design of Ostrii.&nbsp;</li><li>Developed the Ostrii MVP that includes the following content: o 3D Animated Film (Perils) in English and Luganda. 3D animated character films depicting a rural setting and following a character through key life events to cover a number of topics on a higher level and spark a mindset change, which can be later built on with other content styles such as 2D, expert videos and comic books. RI\u2019s experience shows that the 3D format presents is the most important layer of content that can trigger a change in perception or expose an individual to a new topic in an interesting way. o 2D Animated Videos in English and Luganda. 2D animated content focussing on specific topics (e.g. the risks of a loan, how crop insurance is monitored, how to use savings productively). 2D content costs less to produce than 3D and RI designs the 2D content to be bite-sized lessons. o Expert Videos in English, Swahili, and Luganda. Expert videos to follow 2D, which RI designed to build on the learnings with a human instructor, more real-world examples, and the opportunity for demonstration (e.g. a human instructor creating a budget and talking through the process is difficult to replicate in 2D). \u2022&nbsp;</li><li>Launch of mobile app to assist the agent network in delivery, and also opens up the possibility for groups to learn by themselves about insurance, book-keeping, credit, budgeting, saving, and investing, should they have the technological capabilities.&nbsp;</li><li>RI launched a network of voluntary individual partners - the Inclusion Ambassadors - to support RI\u2019s management team in identifying strategic partners within the project country, supporting the creative team with local knowledge in the conceptualization stage of new ideas and content, maintaining communications with in-country colleagues, attending in-person events, and sourcing suppliers in their specific countries. The ambassador network currently stands at over 24 individuals, spanning six target countries, and with individuals holding positions at the World Bank, IFC, FSD along with large insurance companies and commercial banks.&nbsp;</li><li>Local languages - When RI enters new markets, usually it involves local language translation of all videos, comic books and materials, voiceover artists for animated videos, dubbing into animation, filming of resident teacher in new language and amendments to language within the web and mobile app.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>5.Our process and next steps&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>Our processes.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>RI\u2019s crucial distribution model is working with partner organizations that support village saving groups (VSLA\u2019s) due to the following reasons:&nbsp;</p><p>1) VSLA groups meet regularly (often weekly),&nbsp;</p><p>2) When meeting with their group, VSLA members are already thinking about finance (hence a good time to implement training) and&nbsp;</p><p>3) There are instant opportunities for group members to practice the training from Ostrii and organizations to evaluate and analyze impact.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that a group directly would unlikely be able to subscribe to a paid plan for education on the Ostrii platform, along with the operational difficulty for RI in scaling its solution while working directly with individual groups, RI works with organizations that support and facilitate VSLA groups such as international NGOs, local NGOs, social enterprises, microinsurance institutions, commercial Banks, coffee companies, and tea companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Our initial criteria for the partnership include the organization&nbsp;</p><p>1) possessing a potent agent infrastructure that has relationships with target VSLA groups,&nbsp;</p><p>2) having regular interaction between its agents and VSLA groups, and&nbsp;</p><p>3) sharing RI\u2019s social values.&nbsp;</p><p>RI partners reap the following benefits of using Ostrii;&nbsp;</p><p>1) Quality content in the local language for use with the groups,&nbsp;</p><p>2) Offline usage of the app,&nbsp;</p><p>3) Standardization of training delivery using the Trainer-of-Trainer model,&nbsp;</p><p>4) Improves the confidence of agents who struggle when delivering financial literacy,&nbsp;</p><p>5) Access to mobile app usage data to understand and measure the activities of each agent,&nbsp;</p><p>6) Enhanced customer experience through personalized certification for groups who complete the course and&nbsp;</p><p>7) Access to research data obtained from quizzes and surveys to understand the needs of their customers further.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Next steps.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our next step is scaling the Ostrii platform in Uganda and pivoting the foundation of RI ambassadors to launch in the target five countries of Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Rwanda and Tanzania , which primarily involves creating;&nbsp;</p><p>1. Additional languages- As RI moves forward from the pilot in Central Uganda, it needs to add other languages to the platform to cater to new partners.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Additional content using 3D animated films, 2D lessons, comic books, expert videos and USSD capability. As the Ostrii platform progresses and as we continue to engage with our partners and end groups, there may be scope to increase the number of topics on the platform and expand from financial literacy. We plan to include a course on digital literacy for rural groups initially. In the future, we can consider topics such as business skills &amp; entrepreneurship, VSLA Governance, agronomy, and health education. Building an in-house animation studio will increase our delivery effectively.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>6.

I usually order things online and some are recurring purchases, so I expect at least a couple of packages every month. Last month I made a big purchase (big for me at least) and the delivery failed 2-3 times. So, I was constantly contacting the delivery company for the whereabouts. I got a text message which linked to \u201ctheir website\u201d and it looked exactly like the original website. It asked me to input my credit card details as I was charged a fine of $3 for another delivery attempt as they had passed their 3 deliveries maximum, I naively paid, later when I heard back from the UPS customer service, I found out that their failed deliveries were due to the package room of my apartment undergoing maintenance and I immediately blocked my card.</p><p>Another such incidence is that I and many of my friends and colleagues from the university I study at keep getting emails from \u201cdepartment staff or faculty\u201d asking for our personal details for applications for seminars or jobs but it is not really them. And many of us have fallen for such emails despite having a good awareness of such crimes.</p><p>Some time back a worse fraud ended up retrieving money from a friend\u2019s father. He is a middle-aged guy in India working in a small company earning enough to afford a simple life. He got a call saying their bank account was expiring and they wanted him to give all the account details for the scammer to help him \u201cwith the transition\u201d- a textbook fraud, the likes of which would not fool many young people or so I think. He lost close to 600,000 rupees which is what he had saved for over a few years.</p><p>Now, there is no way that these scammers would get caught, they would immediately change their numbers, keep the money flowing from one account to the other so it never gets traced. All in all, an extremely hard to reach criminal with no name, face, or identity. Someone lost their life savings in minutes and there is no going back.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few ways in which I can see this issue getting some serious de-escalation. One would be good public awareness campaigns, especially for the people in the age bracket 40-65 or 75 who are not so savvy with the current technology and are significantly more gullible to such attacks thereby making them a prime target. Public awareness is a broad term, it includes TV advertisements, local meetups, and talks; spreading awareness via any form of social network or information media.&nbsp;</p><p>Another and a more direct approach would be to fund startups or research groups that are working on identification and possible subsequent blocking of such wildly circulated phishing frauds. I have read of one of many such research groups who are working on reducing the effectiveness of scammers identifying all the details of a person. So, they scramble some information thereby mismatching, say, addresses of the people and they found that this does reduce the chances of a successful identification of a targeted person. Also, many such scamming groups get their information about one person from many diverse sources. If there was a way that they are not able to accurately identify someone or get misinformation such that their attack is not efficient, that would be impactful as well.&nbsp;</p><p>We sometimes get a notification from the phone saying things like \u201cScam Likely\u201d or \u201cThis number has been blocked by 234 people\u201d which is useful, but it does not work many times. There are so many individuals who have lost their hard-earned money by falling into such dishonest schemes that it begs to be taken much more seriously. Since there is not enough funding in this field based on what I gathered talking to a professor at my university who works on data privacy. If there is a way to reduce such attacks, it would greatly&nbsp;benefit many people, both young and old.</p>", "user": {"username": "AJ Shah"}}, {"_id": "jaufy77ygmSmNhhd2", "title": "[Cause Exploration Prizes] CELL-CULTURED AND PLANT-BASED ALTERNATIVES?", "postedAt": "2022-08-28T07:12:28.185Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This essay was submitted to Open Philanthropy's&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-exploration-prizes/\"><i>Cause Exploration Prizes</i></a><i>&nbsp;contest.</i></p><p><i>By <strong>Kayode Adekoya</strong>&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A</strong> growing consensus is forming around the prediction that the global human population will reach nearly 10 billion people by 2050 (<i><strong>FAO, 2009a).</strong></i> Providing adequate and nutritious food for such a large population highlights the importance of the world's agriculture system. Indeed, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) projects that food production will have to increase by 70 percent over the same time frame (<i><strong>FAO, 2009a).&nbsp;</strong></i>Note that as with any prediction, there are numerous underlying assumptions and uncertainties associated with the reported number; however, it is almost certain that there will be a need for global food production to increase substantially in the foreseeable future. Projected increases in income globally will increase demands for not only more food but for better quality food, leading to an increased intake of animal protein (<i><strong>FAO, 2009a; Masuda and Goldsmith, 2010</strong></i>). The demand for more high-quality foods will have to be met by increases derived from plant and animal production systems.</p><p>As a result, animal agriculture in the 21st century faces increasing and persistent challenges to produce more animal protein products in the context of an emerging, globally complex set of conditions for sustainable animal production. This, in turn, requires the rethinking of the very nature of animal science. In addition to the increasing demand for animal products in the context of globalization of food systems.</p><p>Climate change will only make things worse as elevated levels of CO2 reduce the nutritional content of grains, tubers and legumes, affecting key nutrients such as zinc and iron ,The estimated impact of undernutrition on gross domestic product (GDP) is 11% every year \u2013 more than the annual economic downturn caused by the global financial crisis .</p><p>A growing population means more mouths to feed. The expanding global population is getting wealthier, and richer people tend to eat more and demand food that is resource intensive to produce, particularly meat and dairy.</p><p>It has been estimated that we need to produce more food in the next 35 years than we have ever produced in human history, given the projected increases in world population, and on the basis that rising incomes will continue to change diets.</p><p>Climate variability and extremes.</p><p>Economic slowdowns and downturns (exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic).</p><p>\u201cIn addition, millions of people around the world suffer from food insecurity and different forms of malnutrition because they cannot afford the cost of healthy diets,\u201d says the report, noting that the impact of these drivers is heightened by pre-existing levels of inequality \u2013 and they are often interconnected.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/global-food-security-challenges-solutions/\"><i><strong>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/global-food-security-challenges-solutions/</strong></i></a></p><p>Globally, food security challenges are usually framed from the perspective that food production must increase by 60-70% in order to feed an expanding global population, expected to reach almost 10 billion people by 2050.1 In an EU context, the implication that there will be insufficient food available to feed the growing global population suggests that the EU agri-food sector has a key role to play in contributing to global food security by increasing output, primarily through increasing productivity. In particular, the EU agri-food sector is expected to enhance its competitiveness on the world market in order to capitalise on the dietary needs of a growing and more affluent global population. However this focus on addressing food availability ignores the far more nuanced issues facing food insecurity and the fact that food security challenges are highly context specific and vary significantly between low to high-income countries.As a result is important to briefly consider food security challenges&nbsp;</p><p>Raising animals for meat directly pollutes the air and water, and degrades land. The environmental impact of companies invested in animal agriculture is most directly experienced by the economically exploited and racially minoritized communities that live near factory farms.&nbsp;</p><p>the horrors animals face on factory farms every single day is mind boggling, the worst abuses of innocent animals who live painful lives\u2014suffering from extreme overgrowth, crippling injuries, and frightening deaths etc.</p><p>Hence the laudable intervention of EA organizations/NGO like gfi which is a commendable step and initiative towards Nonhuman animals right, food sustainability in Europe through Production of plant-based and cell-based animal product alternatives.</p><p><i><strong>https://gfieurope.org/about/</strong></i></p><p>Going by all these background, however ,</p><p><strong>how healthy?

The principal transgenic crops grown commercially in field are herbicide and insecticide resistant soybeans, corn, cotton and canola. Other crops grown commercially and/or field-tested are sweet potato resistant to a virus that could destroy most of the African harvest, rice with increased iron and vitamins that may alleviate chronic malnutrition in Asian countries and a variety of plants that are able to survive weather extremes. There are bananas that produce human vaccines against infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, fish that mature more quickly, fruit and nut trees that yield years earlier and plants that produce new plastics with unique properties. Technologies for genetically modifying foods offer dramatic promise for meeting some areas of greatest challenge for the 21st century. Like all new technologies, they also pose some risks, both known and unknown. Controversies and public concern surrounding GM foods and crops commonly focus on human and environmental safety, labelling and consumer choice, intellectual property rights, ethics, food security, poverty reduction and environmental conservation.</p><p><i>These are silver linens of GMO/ GE foods back in the days! it's early days, several decades ago but can same be said again now going by various medical reports linking it to some human health challenges&nbsp;</i></p><p>Some effects and health risks posed by genetic engineering</p><p>According to FDA(Food and Drug&nbsp; Administration) :</p><p>1. <i><strong>Toxicity</strong></i></p><p>Genetically engineered foods are inherently unstable. Each insertion of a novel gene, and the accompanying \u201ccassette\u201d of promoters, antibiotic marker systems and vectors, is random. GE food producers simply do not know where their genetic \u201ccassette\u201d is being inserted in the food, nor do they know enough about the genetic/chemical makeup of foods to establish a \u201csafe\u201d place for such insertions.&nbsp;As a result, each gene insertion into a food amounts to playing food safety \u201croulette,\u201d with the companies hoping that the new genetic material does not destabilize a safe food and make it hazardous.Each genetic insertion creates the added possibility that formerly nontoxic elements in the food could become toxic.</p><p>FDA was well aware of the \u201cgenetic instability\u201d problem prior to establishing their no-testing policy.&nbsp; FDA scientists warned that this problem could create dangerous toxins in food and was a significant health risk.The scientists specifically warned that the genetic engineering of foods could result in \u201cincreased levels of known naturally occurring toxicants, appearance of new, not previously identified toxicants, [and] increased capability of concentrating toxic substances from the environment (e.g., pesticides or heavy metals).\u201d &nbsp;These same FDA scientists recommended that long term toxicological tests be required prior to the marketing of GE foods.&nbsp; FDA officials also were aware that safety testing on the first genetically engineered food, the Calgene Flavr Savr tomato, had shown that consumption of this product resulted in stomach lesions in laboratory rats.</p><p>FDA\u2019s response to the potential toxicity problem with genetically engineered foods was to ignore it. They disregarded their own scientists, the clear scientific evidence and the deaths and illnesses already attributed to this problem.The agency refused to require pre-market toxicological testing for GE foods or any toxicity monitoring.&nbsp; FDA made these decisions with no scientific basis and without public notice and comment or independent scientific review. The agency\u2019s actions can only be seen as a shameful acquiescence to industry pressure and a complete abandonment of its responsibility to assure food safety.</p><p>2. <i><strong>Allergic Reactions</strong></i></p><p>The genetic engineering of food creates two separate and serious health risks involving allergenicity.The first is that genetic engineering can transfer allergens from foods to which people know they are allergic, to foods that they think are safe.&nbsp; This risk is not hypothetical. A study by the New England Journal of Medicine showed that when a gene from a Brazil nut was engineered into soybeans, people allergic to nuts had serious reactions to the engineered product. At least one food, a Pioneer Hi-Bred International soybean, was abandoned because of this problem.&nbsp;Without labeling, people with known food allergies have no way of avoiding the potentially serious health consequences of eating GE foods containing hidden allergenic material.</p><p>There is another allergy risk associated with GE foods.These foods could be creating thousands of different and new allergic responses.&nbsp; Each genetic \u201ccassette\u201d being engineered into foods contains a number of novel proteins (in the form of altered genes, bacteria, viruses, promoters, marker systems, and vectors) which have never been part of the human diet.&nbsp;Each of these numerous novel proteins could create an allergic response in some consumers.&nbsp; The FDA was also well aware of this new and potentially massive allergenicity problem.&nbsp; The agency\u2019s scientists repeatedly warned that genetic engineering could \u201cproduce a new protein allergen.\u201d</p><p>Once again the agency\u2019s own scientists urged long-term testing.&nbsp; However, the FDA again ignored its own scientists.&nbsp;Because these foods were allowed to be marketed without mandatory testing for this kind of allergenicity, millions of unsuspecting consumers have continuously been exposed to a potentially serious health risk.&nbsp; This FDA action is especially negligent in that the potential consequences of food allergies can include sudden death, and the most significantly affected population is children.</p><p>3. <i><strong>Antibiotic Resistance</strong></i></p><p>Another hidden risk of GE foods is that they could make disease-causing bacteria resistant to current antibiotics, resulting in a significant increase in the spread of infections and diseases in the human population.&nbsp; Virtually all genetically engineered foods contain \u201cantibiotic resistance markers\u201d which help the producers identify whether the new genetic material has actually been transferred into the host food.&nbsp; FDA\u2019s large-scale introduction of these antibiotic marker genes into the food supply could render important antibiotics useless in fighting human diseases.&nbsp; For example, a genetically engineered maize plant from Novartis includes an ampicillin-resistance gene.&nbsp; Ampicillin is a valuable antibiotic used to treat a variety of infections in people and animals.&nbsp; A number of European countries, including Britain, refused to permit the Novartis Bt corn to be grown, due to health concerns that the ampicillin resistance gene could move from the corn into bacteria in the food chain, making ampicillin far less effective in fighting a wide range of bacterial infections.</p><p>Again, FDA officials have ignored their own scientists\u2019 concerns over the antibiotic resistance problem. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) addressed this problem in its own study of GE foods. The BMA\u2019s conclusion was unequivocal: \u201cThere should be a ban on the use of antibiotic resistance marker genes in GM food, as the risk to human health from antibiotic resistance developing in microorganisms is one of the major public health threats that will be faced in the 21st century.\u201d</p><p>4. <i><strong>Immuno-suppression</strong></i></p><p>The well-respected British medical journal, The Lancet, published an important study conducted by Drs. Arpad Pusztai and Stanley W.B. Ewen under a grant from the Scottish government. The study examined the effect on rats of the consumption of potatoes genetically engineered to contain the biopesticide Bacillus Thuringiensis (B.t.). Thescientists found that the rats consuming geneticallyaltered potatoes showed significant detrimentaleffects on organ development, body metabolism, and immune function.</p><p>The biotechnology industry launched a major attack on Dr. Pusztai and his study.&nbsp;However, they have as of yet not produced a single study of their own to refute his findings.&nbsp; Moreover, twenty-two leading scientists recently declared that animal test results linking genetically engineered foods to immuno-suppression are valid.</p><p>5. <i><strong>Cancer</strong></i></p><p>Along with its approval of GE foods, the FDA in 1993 also approved the use of genetically engineered recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH), used to induce dairy cows to produce more milk.&nbsp; At the time the FDA assured consumers that the milk was safe. Since then, however, regulatory bodies in both Canada and Europe have rejected the drug, citing numerous animal and human health concerns.&nbsp; Perhaps of most immediate concern for consumers is that research shows that the levels of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are increased in dairy products produced from cows treated with rBGH.&nbsp;The Canadians and Europeans further found that the FDA had completely failed to consider a study which showed that the increased IGF-1 in rBGH milk could survive digestion and make its way into the intestines and blood streams of consumers.&nbsp; These findings are significant because numerous studies now demonstrate that IGF-1 is an important factor in the growth of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer.</p><p>6. <i><strong>Loss of Nutrition</strong></i></p><p>Genetic engineering can also alter the nutritional value of food. In 1992, the FDA\u2019s Divisions of Food Chemistry &amp; Technology and Food Contaminants Chemistry examined the problem of nutrient loss in GE foods.The scientists involved specifically warned the agency that the genetic engineering of foods could result in \u201cundesirable alteration in the level of nutrients\u201d of such foods. They further noted that these nutritional changes \u201cmay escape breeders\u2019 attention unless genetically engineered plants are evaluated specifically for these changes.\u201d&nbsp;Once again, the FDA ignored findings by their own scientists and never subjected the foods to mandatory government testing of any sort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</i></p><p><i>Center for Food Safety | GE Food &amp; Your Health | |</i></p><p><i>https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/311/ge-foods/ge-food-and-your-health</i></p><p>These are some major fallout about the safety, environmental and ecological risks and health hazards involved with GMO/GE that humanity is still battling as I prepare this piece , if these , then apprehension, fear, doubt concerns for cell - based plant and animal - base cell production, drawing from experiences&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Once bitten twice shy !</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><i><strong>Cell-cultured and plant-based alternatives</strong></i>&nbsp; is a relatively new practice still under research, which means the long-term effects / outcome on health and safety are not yet clear.</p><p>Therefore serious caution is required in this regard .<strong>Gfi</strong> and other related organizations should not be in a hurry to be officially out rather engage in more painstaking research on health,safety and ethics of these laudable ingenious initiative.</p><p>There is the need to be more careful,most cautious , and time - delay in rushing to the finish line .dotting all the i's and crossing all the t\"s in a bid to get the best job done is key ,why?

Indonesia consists of several islands, cultures, tribes and languages, so Indonesia is also known as \u201cA big house with many windows\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>The southern part of The Indonesia archipelago is bordered with The Australia continent. Taking into account various border-related issues, there are indeed vulnerabilities in the border regions of Indonesia with neighboring countries, including Australia. The sea border territory often incurs illegal fishing activities by Rote Island fishermen who got caught by The Australia for violating the Australian territorial boundary and smuggling people activities from Rote island to Australia. Rote island is located at Timor Sea which is the closest island to Australia.</p><p>It seems that the title of this narrative is contradictory, but that is what actually happened in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabupaten_Rote_Ndao\">Rote Ndao</a> district. A district located at the southernmost tip of the Asian continent, the southernmost part of Indonesia and the southernmost part of Southeast Asia. Rote Ndao is one of the poorest districts among all districts in East Timor province in Indonesia.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sumsel.inews.id/berita/10-provinsi-termiskin-di-indonesia-nomor-9-banyak-tambang-dan-perkebunan\">East Timor</a> is also one of the poor provinces among all provinces in Indonesia.</p><p>Why has Rote Ndao been poor for so long? The islands of Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi are the major islands in Indonesia that receive more attention from the central government. Papua, Ambon and Timor are the least developed provinces, even though they are part of the Republic of Indonesia, along with Java, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Let's take a look at the things that prevent Rote Ndao from progressing and developing, which have happened and have been there for a long time.</p><p>Prior to 1974, fishermen from Rote were free to sail and fish on Ashmore Reef, a small arid island on the southern sea border between Indonesia and Australia. Basically, the main livelihood of the people of Rote is from the sea, because the majority of them are sailors. Since 1974, there has been a new maritime boundary agreement between Indonesia and Australia, called MOU BOX 1974, which made the Ashmore Reef area Australian waters.</p><p>Australia stipulates that Indonesian fishermen are not allowed to set foot on Ashmore Reef, because Ashmore Reef is Australia's maritime border. Sailboats that approach Australia's maritime border, including Ashmore Reef to search for marine products, are not allowed to use motorized engines, only traditional sailboats are allowed. This was one of the beginnings of a protracted catastrophe, rooting out the poverty that gripped the people of Rote. Why do I say that? Let's take a look at the impact this has had on the people of Rote.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>A Humanitarian Crisis at Rote Ndao</h1><ol><li>Many Rote residents are not in favor of the 1974 MOU BOX agreement, because their ancestors searched for marine products up to Ashmore Reef, there were even Rote people who were buried in Ashmore Reef. They consider this unfair to them, for the sake of the central government's political interests, they have been sacrificed. Why do Rote fishermen insist on fishing in the waters of Ashmore Reef? Because there, it is said, there are a lot of sea cucumbers and kelp and sharks for their fins to be taken. Sea cucumbers, abalone and shark fins are high-value commodities.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><i><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b3b1fa4104831f9003da1cc4ff49cf3659741c5c8c879691.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b3b1fa4104831f9003da1cc4ff49cf3659741c5c8c879691.png/w_116 116w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b3b1fa4104831f9003da1cc4ff49cf3659741c5c8c879691.png/w_196 196w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b3b1fa4104831f9003da1cc4ff49cf3659741c5c8c879691.png/w_276 276w\"></i></p><p><i>The Treaties, called AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA MARITIME DELIMITATION TREATY was published in November 1997, as an update of the MOU Box 1974. It addressed some issues of the changes to the Exclusive Economic Zone boundary near the Ashmore Islands, in regards to the ongoing issue of Indonesian traditional fisher access to Australian waters which impacts to the ecological of Australia fish stocks. The agreement refers to the Operations of Indonesian Traditional Fishermen in Areas of the Australian Fishing Zone. It recognises the access of the traditional fishermen in shared waters with the north of Australia, especially for trepang, abalone, trochus and sponge.</i> (Government, Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, 2016).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Rote island is located at Timor Sea which is the closest island to Australia. The fact that fishermen were broke and had no other way to earn money, tempted them to smuggle people from Rote island to Australia. The number of ships brought irregular-migrants increased in 2012- 2013, and a lot of people died on the journey. Everyone who arrived was immediately arrested. They are processed in camps on Christmas Island, Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

This is strongly opposed by the Australian government, because they oppose boat people seeking refugees in Australia, which enter Australian territory illegally. Apart from the moral responsibility of helping people smuggle into Australia, this decision was taken because of economic problems. The fishermen are struggling to survive because the damage to coral reefs nearby is suffering from overfishing and environmental damage. Many fishermen accumulate debts to boat owners because of the low catch. Some people are trying to turn to traditional seaweed cultivation as an alternative, to pay off debts, but that is not enough.

A marine based alternative solution with support from the private sector or international aid could be explored more and is likely to be a great solution to the problem. Support from a philanthropic will allow the development of a generic model for a positive knowledge management intervention in the seaweed farming industry, from Research &amp; Development, seeding and harvesting, processing and producing and selling for local or export markets globally. Given the global problem of greenhouse gas emissions caused by livestock, and natural solutions have been found, there is hope and potential for cultivating Asparagopsis Taxiformis in Rote waters and producing these animal feed supplements in Rote. In addition to abundant resources, affordable cost, raising the dignity and creating prosperity of the people of Rote and working with the UN to achieve sustainable goals. This can be done in several ways, including by working with the Australian government and/ or FutureFeed.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Rote island is also famous as a natural brown sugar producer from Lontar trees.

Formative research shows that girls face monthly challenges, with 65% of women and girls in Kenya unable to afford sanitary pads. Only 50% of girls say that they openly discuss menstruation at home. Just 32% of rural schools have a private place for girls to change their menstrual product. And only 12% of girls in Kenya would be comfortable receiving the information from their mother. There are also more jarring statistics signaling that menstruation is tied to more fundamental risks and issues of gender inequity, with studies showing 2 out of 3 of pad users in rural Kenya receiving them from sexual partners and 1 in 4 girls do not associate menstruation with pregnancy.</p><p><strong><u>Overview of Current Challenges in Kenya:</u></strong></p><p><strong>Education and Awareness</strong>: Girls receive inadequate education on menarche, puberty, and MHM, and lack the necessary information channels for ongoing support, mentorship, and knowledge.</p><p><strong>Products</strong>: High costs and distribution challenges limit the accessibility of disposable pads to the majority of low-income girls and women, especially in rural areas. There is an increase in low-cost sanitary pad enterprises but their reach is still limited.</p><p><strong>Sanitatio</strong>n: Awareness of WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) needs for proper MHM exists, but MHM is still under-prioritized given significant gaps in access to sanitation facilities in urban, low-income settings.</p><p><strong>Policy:</strong> There is growing national attention to MHM with the National Sanitary Towels Program for school girls and development of national MHM guidelines.</p><p><strong><u>Stories from the Field\u2014A Glimpse into Girls\u2019 Experience</u></strong></p><p>Triza, 14 years old, lives in Kawangware, a slum located in the western part of Nairobi County, Kenya. She attends school in Kawangware, where she also lives with three siblings and parents in a one-bedroom house. She shares a bed with her sister, and the family shares an outdoor toilet facility. She generally feels safe using the toilet, except at night when she sometimes feels scared to. The school environment and structures are not very conducive to learning, sometimes the classrooms are very cold, and the teachers are not well trained. There is no access to running water, and students like Triza are required to either fetch water from the nearby river, or carry a 5-liter container of water to flush the toilet after use. Triza does not enjoy the company of the boys at her school; sometimes they play bad jokes, like pressing the girls against the door, or trying to hold their hands. At school, girls are provided with pads if their period starts in school, and they also receive permission to go home and take a bath if they have stained their dress. However, she is not scared of her period, and she continues to go about her daily activities as normal.</p><p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p>Mary is 18 years old and lives in Kangundo in Machakos County, Kenya. She lives with her extended family, specifically her grandmother, uncle, brother, and niece. Her mother lives in Kajiado County where she works. Mary dropped out of school because her family could not raise enough school fees for her to continue her education. During the day, she does not work for pay and spends most of her day tending to the livestock, specifically grazing the goats. She also buys groceries for the family such as milk and vegetables, and is responsible for preparing all the meals, washing the dishes, doing laundry, and fetching firewood. They have an outdoor bathroom and toilet. Since they do not have running water, they use basin water and soap to take a bath. During her periods, she experiences a lot of pain in her lower back and abdomen, and she is not able to work. The boys in her area do not know much about menstruation, and although Mary has a boyfriend, he lives in Nairobi and they do not discuss menstruation.</p><p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p>Christine is a 12-year-old girl from Machakos County, Kenya. She lives with her six siblings and parents. She fetches water and washes dishes every evening after school, and thereafter spends time doing her homework. She likes her school because the buildings are clean and well-constructed, and the students always perform well in their exams. She remembers getting her first period when she was at home, when she was 11 years old. She did not know anything about menstruation before then, and she was shocked. However, she told her mother, and her mother assured her that it was normal and provided her with sanitary pads. Once she started her period, she felt that she had now matured into an adult. In school, they are taught menstruation and her female teachers provide her and other female students a lot of support. However, some of her classmates laugh when they find out that one of the girls is menstruating. Christine\u2019s dream is to complete her education so that she can have a prosperous life.</p><p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p>This is truly heart-breaking and therefore my partner (Margaret Wangeci Muita) under an organization that we intend to register as <strong>Gleam Girls Kenya</strong>, are out to offer a helping hand in slaying this monster that is messing the Kenyan girl child.</p><p>We intend to apply the following solutions:</p><p><strong>Education and Awareness</strong>: Kenya\u2019s existing sexuality curriculum offers the biological context around menstruation, but additional instruction to both boys and girls on the gendered</p><p>sociocultural aspects of menarche and interpersonal relationships at puberty would serve to support girls to manage menstruation in a more dignified manner. There is a need to build the capacity of teachers, school administrators, and parents to deliver this information and serve as ongoing mentors as a source of emotional support for girls as they transition through puberty.</p><p><strong>Products</strong>: Improve access to low-cost MHM products for underprivileged and/or low-income consumers. There is a gap between product demand and supply for low-income consumers.</p><p><strong>Sanitation</strong>: Menstrual waste is placing an increasing amount of pressure on existing sanitation infrastructure, and there are few sustainable, appropriate solutions for the individual or the system. Innovative technology or models are needed to ensure girls can dispose of menstrual waste privately and safely and that system can process waste efficiently while limiting health and environmental risks.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and considering our request. Without your support, this will only remain a dream for us and a nightmare for about 65% of women and girls in Kenya. Coin by coin, brick by brick and we shall together be able to address this elephant in the room.</p><p>Yours Faithfully,</p><p>Gleam Girls Kenya.</p>", "user": {"username": "Open Philanthropy"}}, {"_id": "FEHPpuiEpd3nyHdJG", "title": "[Cause Exploration Prizes] Transformative Gender Norms", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T07:05:39.251Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This essay was submitted to Open Philanthropy's&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-exploration-prizes/\"><i>Cause Exploration Prizes</i></a><i>&nbsp;contest.</i></p><p><strong>Part I</strong></p><p><strong>Summary&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The <strong>Cause</strong> being addressed in this paper is, transformative gender norms in the family, <i>as the transport mechanism</i> for healthy families, communities and society.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It would be easy to glance at this Topic/Cause and think, that\u2019s not new, everyone is working on/concerned about this, without understanding that the <i>Approach&nbsp;</i>to this cause is what is different.&nbsp; This becomes evident as you read through the case study and understand on one hand its simplicity yet, because of its emphasis on locality and culture the complexity of getting it right. Because of this, the first few sections below on Importance, Tractability and Neglectedness are brief and generalized where as the example in Part II is fairly detailed</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The worldview needed in order to make this effective, is diverse and inclusive.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Using a Bi-Gender, Bi-cultural, Localized worldview /approach with a Gender Transformative focus, to increase the all-around <i>well-being of the family unit,</i> would also exponentially increase the effectiveness of global aid. If one is to visualize society as the tree, communities as the branches, families as the leaves.&nbsp; Then this <i>cause</i> is the sap that nourishes all of the tree called society, slowly growing and spreading into a healthy society.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: This approach, may sound similar to <strong>Community-Driven Development, which CAUSE has researched and found wanting, however, this is addressed at the end of Part 1(on p5).&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What is the problem?</strong></p><p>Harmful Gender norms can be intertwined with cultural norms like bride price within marriage and the family, these can be shown to negatively impact the majority of the SDGs, in the majority of the Least Developed countries.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The challenge experienced with&nbsp;Global Development, is that the <i>priorities and worldview of outsiders</i> determine the dreams, opportunities and solutions of local community insiders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who is already working on it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While many Agencies/CBO\u2019s claim to be addressing harmful norms or introducing \u201ctransformative\u201d gender behavior, the majority of the time the change is not long term and it is not <i>contagious</i>. By that we mean, the transformative change is not spreading of its own accord to others in the community.&nbsp; The litmus test of long-term sustainability, comes up short. There are several reasons for this failure. Primarily however it usually comes down to a few basic reasons</p><ul><li>When behaviour change is mandated and not based on choice,&nbsp;</li><li>When the benefits are seen, or in fact, go to one gender and not the other. (Especially when the gender of power and privilege is bypassed)</li><li>When the cultural way of learning and doing is bypassed</li><li>When the unique \u201cneeds\u201d identified by both genders are not met.</li><li>When the Agency/CBO is adding the right verbiage to their proposals/reports but there is no real transformative behaviour being modelled from the implementers right through to the participants</li></ul><p>In these conditions, it is rare that the \u201ctransformative behaviour\u201d demonstrated during the project will still be practiced even a year later. Additionally, behind the scenes in the community, if it was only women benefitting from the project, there is likely more gender-based violence than before.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; One of the significant research initiatives is just wrapping up a seven-year, international study into norm changing around young people and reproductive health.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.irh.org/projects/passages/\">https://www.irh.org/projects/passages/</a><strong>.&nbsp; </strong>It has engaged several Universities as well as large NGO\u2019s and funded by USAID.&nbsp; There various findings as to defining norms and how to design norm change projects and the attributes that are needed to be successful are now published.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://gehweb.ucsd.edu/briefs-reports/\">https://gehweb.ucsd.edu/briefs-reports/</a></p><p>Without access to these reports, SCORE Against Poverty, (SCORE) <a href=\"https://www.scoreagainstpoverty.org/\">https://www.scoreagainstpoverty.org/</a> has covered all the boxes indicated in the above-mentioned study and added two more elements that are perhaps inferred but not articulated in the study.&nbsp; These are the <i>identification of skills,</i> needed by the participants, <i>each</i> reference groups, in the population in which you are attempting to effect the change, and the particular skills training of each sub reference group in the identified areas i.e., dialogue or cooking.&nbsp; By simultaneously, working with both genders, providing a safe place for dialogue and understanding of how gender norms in the family can be destructive and limiting to the family, while also simultaneously engaging both genders&nbsp; in the skills they were lacking, they have addressed and influenced both 1) descriptive (behavioral) and injunctive (attitudinal) norms.&nbsp;</p><p>This Zimbabwe CBO has pioneered the approach of this paper, and are in the last stages of documenting its effectiveness.&nbsp; It is from SCORE that the examples below of a successful gender transformative approach in the family is taken.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>What could a new philanthropist do? &nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to make good grant making decisions it is necessary to develop expertise and networks around training grantees and their partners (CBOs), as to the characteristics of effective norm changing programs entails.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Bi-Gender, Bi-cultural,</li><li>Localized worldview /approach&nbsp;</li><li>Integration of Understanding what underpins harmful norms&nbsp;<ul><li>with identified skills to build positive norms.</li></ul></li><li>The role of change in the family, to cause the ripple effect of change in the community and beyond.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These are more fully explained in the Section on Gender Strategy below.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the benefits to the families we have seen the following benefits from participants in the pilot project of this approach paired with conservation agriculture now 5 years later.</p><ul><li>Provides a new higher standard to the auditing the global development&nbsp;</li><li>Brings economies closer to home,&nbsp;</li><li>Restores &amp; expanding self reliance</li><li>Cuts through the clutter of globalization, and</li><li>Supports locally-led economies &amp; communities</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Importance&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; While it is true that there are elements and degrees of male privilege which are present in every society, this approach is most effective in agrarian societies, which have gender norms which hold back 50% of their population, women. When one considers the number of subsistence farmers globally, the numbers are substantial and significant. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, in addition to the limiting community norms, played out in the family, there are legislative and institutional norms whereby women are held back by various means.&nbsp; Which are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no easy way to quantify the economic impact of this approach yet although SCORE will be doing some indicative studies based on the economic return/impact of this approach based on a sample from their pilot project.</p><p><strong>Sources of Uncertainty</strong></p><ul><li>Will the community &amp; local authorities in other cultures, support a move that will bring women into discussions and positions of influence?</li><li>Will the CBO\u2019s and the international stakeholders implement and be held accountable for implementing a gender strategy in their own organizations that is equitable and transparent.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Financial Cost</strong></p><p>The cost to initiate <i>the approach</i> alone, would be neglectable.&nbsp; Unless the organization is not paying their staff equitably.&nbsp; The Approach combined with the activities in a project country, to change harmful gender norms is estimated below. &nbsp;</p><p>Every country is different however the items to be costed are as follows;</p><ul><li>The Doner partner cost \u2013 home office expense of personnel &amp; material support. (Examples would be World Vision, Action Aid etc.)</li><li>Implementing Partner on the ground \u2013 CBO, or local NGO - personnel &amp; material support.</li><li>Training activities: <i>Aside from the wages &amp; fuel for gender specialist to facilitate the trainings&nbsp;</i>\u2013 the average cost in rural Zimbabwe, during Covid, for a 4-hour training of about 50 adults (20 couples and 10 other adults) was about USD $1,200 <i>per session</i>.&nbsp; These cost cover:</li><li>Refreshments and light local meal for the 50 people and children</li><li>Covid protection protocols, - Masks, handwashing station and monitoring person pay</li><li>Professional Child care on site.&nbsp;</li><li>Transport for cooking utensils, PPE and personnel&nbsp;</li><li>Renumeration (day\u2019s wage) of cooks, ECS professional, Covid Monitor and logistics supervisor.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If this approach and activity is combined with another ongoing project, (agriculture, climate mitigation, etc.) &nbsp;which is an ideal way to use it, the cost would significantly less, likely USD $600 or less per session day of 50 people. The rational for this is that many of the other cost aside from the activity itself would already be paid for by shared cost with the ongoing project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Neglectedness: &nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Why are others not taking this approach?&nbsp;It is fortunate for us that CAUSE understands and in fact highlights the concept of \u201cworldview\u201d.&nbsp; The prevailing world view, put very simplistically, until recently in development has been the West knows best.&nbsp; The subtext to that is that the rich in the west know how to use \u201cdevelopment\u201d to improve their bottom line while appearing to be humanitarian.&nbsp;Thus, you had extractive colonialism which morphed into Bi-lateral aid for raw resources and tied aid for humanitarian responses. In addition, the current aid industry, has made an art form out of forms and charts, which ostensibly can predict the future and by which Agencies can be held to account. &nbsp;While in the past this may have been possible with certain types of projects that largely deal with material inputs, it is no longer possible. &nbsp;The interconnected world which relied on a generally healthy, predictable global work force/supply chains, currently does not exist and even when/if global events realign, it may not be the same given a global emphasis on \u201cmake [my country] great again.\u201d</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The other worldview connected to this, is the trickle-down theory of economics, and most everything else.&nbsp;When a \u201cproblem\u201d emerges in the rural area of Zimbabwe, the answer is generated by the aid community in the Northern hemisphere, and as long as the new money keeps flowing the problem appears to diminish.&nbsp; The accumulation (compounding impact), of this type of thinking, along with an extractive worldview, is what has contributed to the climate change disasters that are facing us today.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Tractability &amp; Speed</strong></p><p>Impact per dollar</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based on the training sessions, the cost per session-per family is approximately, US $60.00 per \u201ccouple/family.&nbsp; ($1200/20 families) The optimal working size for groups.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The \u201cprogram\u201d should include at least ten \u201con the job family skill development\u201d sessions and ten Forums to discuss norms, challenges &amp; solutions.&nbsp; Therefore, an estimate would be US $1,200.00 per couple per complete course.</p><p>Return on investment:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No detailed economic return has been done given that attribution of economic impact caused by a change in gender/cultural norms is difficult.&nbsp; What we can measure&nbsp;</p><p>is the social impact of those who have used this approach with their households since the pilot project 3 years ago.&nbsp; Following are a few comments from these participants.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>What impact did the pilot project Men can Cook have on you?<i>&nbsp; \u201cBecause it taught cooking skills, it really increased the harmony between my wife and I, now when she goes out, I can cook the meal and have it ready when she comes home and she can rest.&nbsp; My children have watched and learned and the men in their family are cooking and dividing labour in the home.\u201d</i></p><p><i>SCORE Chairman, Saul Mapfacha (older male)</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen discussing the impact of the program he said there were two things he acted on, from the discussions (Gender Forum) on access to resources, that has greatly increased the well being of his family. The first was he bought a phone for his wife, so now both have a phone.&nbsp;The other thing he said has helped is that, now they both pool the money they earn from the farm, fish and cooking and jointly decide what they should do with the money.</i></p><p><i>Joseph (Fisher/Farmer, middle aged man)</i></p><p>When asked what has changed outside of the family, in the community: <i>\u201cThe wives of the McC families are testifying to the neighbours about the improvement in family relations, that there is more harmony, less burden.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Stanley (A Village head)</i></p><p><i>\u201cPeople in the community have been \u201cSHANDUKO\u2019, which literally means \u201cchanged by an activity\u201d.&nbsp; \u201cWe were like slaves before, now we are showing others that gender roles can be opened up and shared\u201d</i></p><p><i>Rindai (Window with four grown boys, three married)</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>\u201cI wish this program could be spread to other communities because it causes a quick \u201cSHANDUKO\u201d.&nbsp; \u201cI now have time to work on poultry and my husband works the field and we combine our money and decide together how to spend it.&nbsp;This never happened before.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sithokosile (Mother of six)</i></p><p>&nbsp;As the testing project continues until the end of the year we will continue to try and quantify some of the changes in the families that have gone through the program.</p><p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, after five months of training &amp;

It will likely take much longer to bring about the legislative changes, for example to deal with issues like and single ownership of bank accounts, animal stock registration and other items which impact the norms and practices like bride price.&nbsp; Meanwhile communities and families are devising solutions that work for their families in the near term.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; I realize that this approach, may sound similar to <strong>Community-Driven Development, </strong>which CAUSE has researched and found wanting, in the context of conflict mitigation.&nbsp; In that context I would tend to agree with the analysis. &nbsp;However, I would suggest that a) this is a different context and b) in this approach we are suggesting that the women be much more of the steering/driving mechanism than the men who typically make community decisions.&nbsp; This approach also changes norms and behaviors at the family level, rather than assets at the community level which can be viewed as \u201cpolitical\u201d by proponents and opponents alike. Lastly, it increases the harmony within the family, to better cope with disharmony or violence outside the family over which they have little control. &nbsp;There is a growing body of research, that is just emerging, out of Harvard and other research centers, sponsored by the Dali Lama and Desmond Tutu, which demonstrate the wellness benefits of inner joy in coping with conflict and anxiety.&nbsp; In addition, there is some strong research coming out of a Canadian organization, Make Music Matter (<a href=\"https://makemusicmatter.org/\">https://makemusicmatter.org</a>), which is now being documented in partnership with a Stanford University team around the value of healing trauma in civil conflict through the inner healing of making music. Its therapeutic value is transforming communities in the middle of the conflict zone of the DRC.&nbsp; It is not ending the war but it is gradually giving individuals and communities the adaptation tools to cope with the trauma of rape and violence, until enough communities can say, enough is enough.&nbsp; Lastly the research cited by CAUSE, in this connection was looking at <i>good governance</i> not family social cohesion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sources of Uncertainty</strong></p><p>Family-Level Measures</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although both the pilot and the testing program \u201cMen can Cook, have used this approach successfully in rural Zimbabwe I am uncertain how well this will transfer to other quite different cultures.&nbsp; Perhaps a lot of willingness on the part of the men and women came from the credibility that the community gave to SCORE for making a difference in their farming lives as participants in the Conservation Agriculture program of which the Gender program was part.&nbsp; I am relatively certain that the fact that SCORE was a very local CBO, spoke the (three) local languages, and accepted the underlying culture, and had good relations with the governance structure both village and district level was a significant factor in participants willingness to participate and truthfully engage in Forum discussions. Those deep discussions and the safe ground they provided for disagreement were crucial.&nbsp; The willingness of men to change their normative views of masculinity and of their wives to trade power in the kitchen for greater engagement with their husbands was quicker in the testing program than in the pilot.&nbsp; The reason for this according to them as that they had \u201cseen\u201d or heard of the change in the pilot program even though it happened in a different district and this weakened their hesitancy, about adopting and trying some of the changes.&nbsp; For this reason, I think it is crucial that the implementing organization must be local, well known and have a successful track record with the community and the local governance bodies.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It is also known that a fact that good (enabling resilience) can be \u201cgiven\u201d to an oppressed population, in this case women, in order to achieve more productivity out of them for a third party. In this case since the \u201cproductivity\u201d produced is chosen jointly but includes choices of leisure, participation in community work and/or family enterprise, as well as the fact that the husband is taking on more of the household chores and family care giving, it is hard to make this care.&nbsp; But it should be considered when replicated elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Part II</strong></p><p><strong>Changing harmful gender norms within the family \u2013 a working model&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp; As noted below, SCORE began this gender transformative testing project by laying out very clearly in their initial MOU with the northern partner both their own governance structure and their expectations of structure with any northern partner.&nbsp;</p><p>SCORE is a highly democratic institution. Leadership comes from the community and its key decisions are arrived at by a community steering committee comprised of group of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scoreagainstpoverty.org/leadership-and-partners/\">seven local volunteers</a> in Mwenezi, whose work is supported by the local elders.&nbsp; SCORE has established strong working relationships with local authorities, agricultural and health representatives, police departments, civil society groups and representatives from different ministries at the local level.&nbsp; The project planning, implementation and evaluation is thus highly participatory, reflecting the rights and equity principles that need to guide both SCORE and SMRUC [northern partner].</p><p>This relationship, based on mutual trust, common social justice goals and other shared values is a critical element in managing risk, as both partners are willing to share challenges. The processes of co-creating and co-monitoring mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of project success.&nbsp;</p><p>This association would flip the traditional paradigm where a Canadian Agency goes to Zimbabwe and finds an indigenous partner that is capable and willing to implement projects in line with the Canadian Agencies mandate and provides all the project planning and direction. Here, we as SCORE, a Zimbabwean Agency is coming to you a Canadian Charitable partner that has similar values and experience and we are looking to you for resources and supports to carry out a project(s) that has been trialed but not tested for scalability. The recognition of this paradigm switch is part of this MOU.</p><p>Next, they worked with the Canadian partner to build and practice a <strong>Gender Strategy</strong> and gender integration should apply to more than just a project. It was agreed that, if both organizations do not have a progressive gender strategy, which they apply across the board to everything the organization does, then the odds of the organization truly being able to implement a gender transformative project are relatively low.&nbsp; Therefore, our joint strategy starts at an organizational level.</p><p><strong>Philosophically&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The projects taken on by SCORE must benefit women and lessen their work load, <strong>by </strong><i><strong>removing barriers</strong></i><strong> to equity, through culturally based solutions in which the community (M&amp;F) assists in developing and testing.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This takes different forms depending on the challenge being addressed.&nbsp;</p><p>The core of this approach is that, the values for anything which SCORE does, from research to regular development activities are based on the following philosophical principles:</p><ol><li>Support the community\u2019s ability to solve their own problem with existing resources where possible turn to external sources if necessary.<ol><li>Communities know what they need, <i>However</i>, they may not know <i>the how, why or when</i>.&nbsp;</li><li>They may not initially know<i> what the solution will look like.</i></li></ol></li><li>The Role of an external [Partner Agency] needs to sequence &amp; maintain <i><strong>structure</strong>&nbsp;</i>not control.</li><li>The community generates the content of a project/activity. <i>Therefore, a feedback loop to the stakeholders/community for validating what is done.</i></li><li>Projects/ Activities serve the community not the project.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These principals lead us to developing our Gender Equality Strategy/Approach.&nbsp;</p><p>Which, in its most succinct form is,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i> \u201cInvolve both Genders in any project, in meaningful, culturally relevant, beneficial ways.\u201d&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>Gender Equity Approach&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Administratively, </strong>for the whole organization this strategy involves:</p><ul><li>When selecting projects, choose ones that include gender equality focus areas.&nbsp;</li><li>Recruiting predominantly female leadership which is committed to accountability.</li><li>Gender pay equity.&nbsp;</li><li>Female leaning composition of the workplace.&nbsp;</li><li>Support for child care in order to recruit the right staff.</li><li>Mainstreaming flexible working&nbsp;hours/conditions.</li><li>Preventing gender-based/sexual harassment and discrimination, and bullying.&nbsp;</li><li>Provide professional development, networking, mentoring opportunities which can accommodate other family commitments as needed.</li><li>Structuring consideration for women\u2019s workload into all projects, in terms of childcare &amp; timing, when the community is asked to participate in</li></ul><p>It is also essential to remember that all the activities in this project at their core revolve around 3 basic things.</p><ol><li><strong>New ways of knowing,</strong> (Knowledge to both genders)&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Skills to use the knowledge</strong> in healthy, helpful and productive ways. (Skills to both genders)</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Bridging - a safe place and support from local champions to assist processing /aligning new information.</strong>&nbsp; (A way to <strong>connect</strong> the <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>skills</strong> in a culturally acceptable, gender transformative way for both genders.)&nbsp;<ul><li><i>gain organizational and constructive/respectful dialogue skills</i></li></ul></li></ol><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Using these principles and values, four years ago, SCORE tried a small pilot program, as part of a larger Conservation Agriculture (CA) program. &nbsp;It was the vision of the farmers, mostly women, to address two questions. The first was \u201cHow do we cook some of the new crops you are teaching us about. Crops that are more suited to our changing climate, like Lab-lab.&nbsp; The second question was even more interesting, some of the men farmers were asking questions like, \u201cHow do we work together as a family to be more productive as a family farm?\u201d</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; SCORE decided to go back to the women to answer both questions.&nbsp; The result was an ad hoc program, that combined the skill of cooking with a discussion group on gender roles.&nbsp; This idea was so successful that it was selected by the Fund for Innovation and Transformation (FIT), a program under Global Affairs Canada, to test how the idea might change the way men interact with their families.&nbsp;</p><p>It was designed by SCORE in partnership with St. Marys Road United Church in Winnipeg Manitoba to document the changes in the norms and attitudes of men towards their wives and the family unit.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike most projects related to addressing Gender equity, it involved both skills and serious discussions, by both the husbands and the wives.&nbsp; For the discussion groups (Men\u2019s Forum on Gender) the women outlined the topics they wanted the men to discuss, areas where they as wives would like to work together with their husbands.&nbsp; And so, they devised a fairly unique and innovative way of recycling a topic from the women to the men back to the women and adding more layers of discussion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These discussions were moderate and facilitated by Gender Specialist to help avoid any arguments but instead, try to stimulate thinking about how the household could do things together.&nbsp; The men\u2019s discussion was led by a man and the women by a woman.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These are places where hard questions are wrestled with for weeks, bride price, sale of cattle, who controls the cell phone.&nbsp; How can we change from viewing the wife as an asset, like a plow or a cow to be used at the whim of the husband, to a partner who can help a couple build a better relationship and family and economic future together?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the cooking component SCORE utilized the local Home Economics teacher to start training and then invited wives and daughters to come and teach their husbands how to cook and to continue teaching in the home.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These are times of laughter as men begin to understand how much hard work and skill it takes to cook the traditional sadza, (thick corn porridge) and make the vegetable or meat sauce that goes with it.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; </strong>Although the testing project will not be finished until the end of 2022 there are already positive results happening.&nbsp; More and more of the men are seeing the family as a partnership, where they can take on chores like collecting water, firewood and basic cooking and spending more time with their children and wife.&nbsp; The wives are reporting that the men are now involving them in discussions and decisions on a variety of topics, which never happened before at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of this<strong>&nbsp;</strong>approach and their gender interventions/activities was to contribute <strong>to three basic outcomes </strong>for the Men can Cook Project.</p><p><strong><u>Intermediate Outcome 1&nbsp;</u></strong><u>- More equitable participation </u><strong><u>by men</u></strong><u> in household (HH) and family tasks.&nbsp;</u></p><p>New ways of Knowing,<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The approach of using 1) drawing as a research tool and 2) turning learning to cook into a fun, family-oriented time, encourages men to participate in the testing.&nbsp;This is known from the pilot project.&nbsp;During the recruitment process, when men realized they would be full participants in a positive way, the spaces for involvement filled immediately and there is a waiting list if there are any more openings. The <strong>Men\u2019s forum on Gender (MfG)</strong>, is managed by trained male facilitators, who encourage collaborative meaning-making. Culturally, this allows men to see and add to each others comments, allowing men to give voice to what the drawing was intended to convey. The technique works well in a non literate society and allows for a quick visual summary at the end and in the next meeting. By verbalizing and visualizing together it encourages the men to hold each other accountable for the new understandings they gain. This approach is now grounded in a cultural foundation that will change how men see their role, but more importantly this <i>subsequent behaviour is <strong>based on mindset/attitude change </strong>not fear or mandate.</i> This is validated by community visits,(p18) where the Gender Specialist validate this change by checking with the family. This accountability leads to more participation in family tasks such as sharing in cooking and HH family task</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Safety &amp; Childcare</i> - One of the goals of our Gender Equity Strategy, (GES) is to ensure that the practical needs and strategic interests of both women and men are considered at all stages of the project implementation.&nbsp;The approach/opportunity of providing ECL type childcare<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, along with covid safety protocols at all meetings (especially men\u2019s) has had a significant uptake in participation.&nbsp; To see men walking home from meetings with their children has ready provided a jolt to a system where men would NEVER take a child to any activity.&nbsp; Therefore, this is not seen just as an activity, although obviously on one hand it is, but we see this intervention as an essential part of our strategy of<strong> removing barriers, and reducing the work load on women and helping men to understand in a practical, mentoring way what that looks like.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;This addressing a piece of our baseline gender norm survey, where approximately three-quarters of the men in this culture think it is inappropriate to share household responsibilities, which includes child care.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Intermediate Outcome 2</u></strong><u> Increased supportive behaviours (advocacy and leadership) related to women </u><strong><u>by men</u></strong><u> in the community and in institutions.&nbsp;</u></p><p>The approach requires a culturally appropriate safe place, with supports, for men to discuss feelings. This has been shown to be essential. Traditionally, in this geographic area and likely in general, men have been shamed and blamed for voicing cultural gender norms.&nbsp; <i>Therefore, the first part</i> of increasing <i>supportive behaviours</i>, is to develop a meaningful understanding and acknowledgement of what the current situation is and then work through meaningful ways of communicating to others how it can be changed for the better.&nbsp; <strong>A safe place, the MfG,&nbsp;</strong>is especially critical in dealing with the sensitive and at times volatile values, contained in our ultimate outcome of masculinity and femininityas it occurs in the unequal distribution of labor in the home.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Beliefs /Norms portion component of activities takes place the Men\u2019s Forum on Gender (MFG).&nbsp; In order to do this, men need a supportive place to describe their thoughts and react to information.&nbsp; This is where men can, through guided discussion, talk about the shortcomings of their cultural normative beliefs, Examples would be, that it is not acceptable to be involved in cooking &amp; housework or share control of assets etc.&nbsp;During the length of the program this is also a safe place to share what they are learning at home from their wife/daughter and a place where they start to see women as people, not just workers/cooks.&nbsp;Male champions from the pilot project or staff are on hand to share how their lives and family changed when they started seeing women as equal partners, not objects to do their bidding.&nbsp;Eventually the men start to identify a variety of situations identified in which they as men can advocate on behalf of women.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Originally in the pilot project, the wives met informally at a different location and discussed the ideas with which they wanted the men (husbands) to discuss and understand. In the test project iteration, the wives wanted to be at the same meeting. engaging in a process to shift cultural norms in the family around, viewing the family as a unit with a co-managed team, not a dictatorship.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A typical Forum session in the early part of the testing project, involved 20 men sitting under a tree and in wrestling with the question of who controls what assets in the family. After listing about 10 assets, including chickens, cattle, cellphones and sex, all of which they agreed was under control of the men (except maybe, if there were just a few chickens, those could be controlled by their wives).&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, they narrowed the list down to about 5 topics they were willing to engage on over the next few months.&nbsp; A big topic intertwined in the discussion was the \u201cbride price\u201d which they saw as a lose-lose proposition. Part 2 of the discussion was then to say, OK how can we begin to think and talk about this with our wives.&nbsp; It was an earnest conversation ranging from fears to anger to a partial resolution of first steps.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile 75 meters away the wives sat with another SCORE female Gender Specialist, who was facilitating a discussion with the wives about the thoughts of their husbands from a week earlier.&nbsp; This is how it works, there is a continuous feedback loop between the men and women (hopefully) building towards a more equitable and harmonious understanding of gender roles and partnership in the home.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>The second part of increasing supportive behaviours</i> is for men to learn skills that can actually allow space &amp; time for women to participate in events in the community with out the rest of the family suffering.&nbsp; In this instance part of the Baseline/Gender survey high lighted that men do not have any cooking skills beyond boiling water and throwing in tea leaves or grain for porridge.&nbsp; The part for men comes as a SCORE facilitator works with both the wives and the men in what essentially is a breakdown of skills needed to cook a complete meal. Starting with starting a fire, using a knife to prep vegetables and working through the steps necessary to prepare a balanced meal.&nbsp;These steps are identified and then are practiced in the home using wives or daughters as teachers to teach cooking and domestic skills.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually at the end of the project, a Men can Cook (McC) contest is held where the men compete in public by teams to <i>demonstrate and discuss what they have learned by being involved in sharing the work in the HH.&nbsp; </i>This is a public way of opening up some of the gender norms for discussion and <i>advocating for changes in what have been considered traditional gender norms</i> in the community. The contest was what the community saw and others heard about, which really motivated new couples to sign up for the testing project of McC in the new testing communities.</p><p><strong><u>Intermediate Outcome 3&nbsp;</u></strong><u>Expanded behaviours related to gender roles </u><strong><u>by women</u></strong><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>The approach of a culturally appropriate safe place, with supports, for women to discuss feelings, is also essential.&nbsp; This was demonstrated by the findings in the BL and Gender survey, showing the large gaps between what women aspire to be the norms around HH activities and family decision making and what is culturally acceptable at the moment. One cause of this gap is that women don\u2019t have the skills/tools to engage in discussions with men without provoking anger or violence. The other, for a smaller number of women is they want to protect the little autonomy they have by keeping men out of the kitchen area.</p><p><strong>The skills,&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Similar to the men, there are local/community women champions who can assist women struggling with changes in the home, especially giving up sole control of the [very small] domain, the kitchen that has been theirs.&nbsp;Discussions with the older women can show the benefits of trading some control of the kitchen for enlarged participation by husbands. More spare time for one and likely more discussions of mutual interest.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, for the women participate in discussions with the staff women to discuss curriculum items that they would like their husbands to discuss in the MFG and also get a chance to provide feedback on information their husbands produce out of the Forum.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Women gain (or have opportunity to gain) skills in various areas.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>the of skill of understanding the role of&nbsp;</i>action learning<i> in the home/family</i></li><li><i>the art of negotiating space</i></li><li><i>understanding long term gain from short term actions</i></li><li>It is quite likely that they will also learn from the discussion forums, the skills of defining and articulating discussion topics in the home and in community in a peaceful manner.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: The GBA showed that women have little or no say in the areas of sharing HH/family care duties, control of assets or participation in decision making either in the family or the community. With regard to influence /participation in the community, because the testing period is so short, we do not expect to see changes in long term institutional situations, for example, women being elected into key community positions, as there may not even be opportunity for this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> However</strong>, IF men start to take up more of the burden of HH chores and women have more choice of what to do in general and with spare time and <i><strong>we can document what choices they make.</strong></i>&nbsp; The \"development\" activities are <strong>one&nbsp;</strong>area that should be easy to follow.&nbsp; Our purpose during the testing project, for having Outcome Three, was to be able to document<i> what this means and how the women themselves will define this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This leads to an observation with regard to typical logframes &amp; Project Management Forms. &nbsp;The shortcoming of having predefined indicators in situations of normative behaviour change as opposed to a skill or outcome, is that it can take away from <i>allowing the people involved, to demonstrate or define, what that looks like.</i>&nbsp; This approach of letting the participants define indicators of change, is uncharacteristic of typical development. Development Agencies have decided,&nbsp;what is best (from a Northern perspective) for a given situation and then \"gifted\" that solution to the community.&nbsp; That is precisely what happened in some of these McC communities, where food aid was used as an incentive to accomplish the desired \"outcomes\" of a project. (As documented in our BL/G surveys and verification exercises.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the<i> general outcome</i> of, <strong>expanded positive behaviours related to gender roles by women</strong> was agreed to at the onset by the participants in the community, however the<i> indicators of what this would look like evolved&nbsp;</i>through the period of testing and likely continue <i>to evolve for each woman</i> afterwards if the program is successful. The relationship between husband and wife continues to evolve closer to, mutually agreed upon, and family defined gender equity over time. (It likely will not look identical in the particulars for every family)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is another population of women, that will <strong>benefit from the skills component</strong>, in a project which is the CBO women on the project team.&nbsp; <i>More technical skills will provide more options.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;By design, much of the SCORE staff is already women, however due to family obligations, women staff often do not choose to leave the area for training. This approach to project management a small amount of equity to this by hiring a role model(s) professional woman to guide and advise on project testing tools and curriculum design.&nbsp; The first one has already been involved virtually by WhatsApp and Zoom in continuous, one on one training, as well as larger discussions groups once the project activities start.&nbsp; This (champion) professional woman runs training sessions held with various women on project staff who will then, collect, enter, analyze and validate data. Also, intentional &nbsp; work is done collaboratively with CBO staff on developing evaluation and curriculum tools. One of the very few benefits of Global Covid has been the whole rapid and enlargement of what is possible in virtual training.</p><p><strong>Learnings and Notes for the northern partner, from a Localization Approach to International Development.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>An important part of the upside-down process which occurs when the northern donor/implementer believe and practice the idea that their role involves resources and sequencing rather than imposing and interpreting is that when they come to the project it is more than a flying visit with a check list.&nbsp; It is a time of sharing and learning.&nbsp; They spend weeks not days on site, living in the culture.&nbsp; This can contribute to both sides the northerners learn a lot about the \u201cwhys\u201d of the project which results in new tools being co -designed to make reporting easier.&nbsp; This can range from the finances to the narrative of story telling. The CBO learns techniques and tips to make the reporting easier. Some of the benefits to the northern partner, of this approach are noted below.</p><p><strong># Privilege</strong></p><p>\u2013 It is easy to enjoy, and not even know it is happening. Watch what is happening to different groups around you, color, gender, age, financial status, are they all being treated the same?</p><p><strong># Integrating Gender approach</strong></p><p>- By coming and spending a month at a time with the local partner, it allows and facilitates deep sharing with the team, not only the project team, but the entire host agency team. This sharing opened up gender discussions with both men &amp; women, showing how our gender project could have a very important beneficial impact on the other Agency projects.&nbsp;Within the project, it is leading slowly and with much discussion to understanding and engaging men in a process/approach to shift cultural norms in the family around viewing the family as a unit with a co-managed team, not a dictatorship.&nbsp;</p><p><strong># Localization \u2013 Notes from a northern partner</strong></p><p>- Our project area is about 8 hours from the capital, 3 hours from the nearest Hotel. I was graciously invited to stay at the homestead farm of the Directors mother, a widow, within walking distance of the office.&nbsp; Nothing could be better for me to get a picture of what can happen when you open yourself to this kind of hospitality.&nbsp;</p><p>- Most of the staff at SCORE are from this district, I think only one is from an outside district.&nbsp; That has allowed the staff to feel like they are really improving their own district and when needed are willing to sacrifice time and energy to solve a challenge.</p><p>- The officials from the District Officer to <i>local representatives</i> of, Ministry of Women, Ministry of Health even the Office of the [National] President have been called upon, and it is obvious that because SCORE is concentrating on this District, they have and continue to give, it supports and privileges of access and support that larger international groups are not given.</p><p>- Solving challenges from a local culturally acceptable approach, has allowed SCORE to bridge gaps that have been around for decades.&nbsp; Not solve, but at least make in-roads to facilitate discussions which are the precursor to generating culturally acceptable solutions.&nbsp; The fact that Traditional healers and prophets have been able to assist and get some resources from Ministry of Health for Covid 19 is an unheard-of break through, and exponentially impactful, as on the same day 20 people might come for Covid treatment and testing to the hospital, 2 \u2013 400 rural people were coming to the traditional healers that same day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Validating results</strong></p><p>When working with norms and beliefs it is vitally important to know whether what you are told (data) is correct <i>or</i> is a version of information given out to outsiders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SCORE and SMRUC work from the premise that data from a community belongs to the community and so whenever SCORE does a community survey of any kind, especially a baseline, gender norms, way of life survey. The results are immediately taken back to the local community stakeholders and the community to verify the results. If one or the other cannot agree with the results, then a two-step process, first the community stakeholders and then with participants is conducted which addresses <i>why</i> they are not reflective and <i>what&nbsp;</i>caused the error and <i>what&nbsp;</i>the true situation is.</p><p>Who are these community stakeholders, in our case it engages the local/village town representatives that are living there including <u>as relevant:</u></p><ul><li>Ministry of Women Affairs, Youth and Gender</li><li>Mwenezi Rural District Council - Councillors&nbsp;</li><li>Traditional leaders - for example village heads, chiefs&nbsp;</li><li>Ministry of Health/Environmental Health Technicians&nbsp;</li><li>Ministry of Social Welfare&nbsp;</li><li>Zimbabwe Republic Police (as they deal with domestic violence and ensure security)&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Working Process&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First there was a Focus Group Discussion with the stakeholders which reviews the preliminary findings. They identified questions and areas, if any, that do not seem to reflect lived experience and their reasons for each.&nbsp; If the community stakeholders identify areas of concern, incongruence with their experience and knowledge, then Stage two is initiated, where in each community of impact, the team, randomly contacts participants from the initial survey, by a text phone blast, to please come at a designated time to a designated location</p><p>&nbsp; At the gathering, the community leaders and stakeholders first hold a discussion as to why they had questions about the data and give assurances as to the acceptance of all answers with no recrimination regardless of answers. Next, there are one on one interviews/discussions for data collection based on clarifications given in the general meeting. This data is then re examined by the local stakeholders/leaders for verification.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The second level of verification is ongoing, and follows up on information and statements given during the bi monthly group discussion/training sessions.&nbsp; The Gender specialist leading the training go out to the various villages of the participants in the training sessions on alternate weeks for community visits.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the day of visit, about five or six participants from the training sessions are randomly selected. Open ended questions are asked in a family setting, with the aim of determining the impact of the project.</p><p>This gives participants opportunities to talk about their experiences to date, or show how they are changing the way they are doing things based on their learnings in the project.&nbsp; At times we see projects the couple have jointly started, or activities initiated by men to help their spouses. Some outline new plans that they have jointly made as spouses.&nbsp; Visits give participants more time and space to open up on matters that they would normally do within groups. Children have opportunities to speak on many matters that parents talk about, they can confirm if their parents now plan things together or if they have seen their father helping to cook or take care of children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The program is continually updated/ adjusted based on these visits. These visits are very important to this test the impact and veracity of the program. These community visits further validate information given in training sessions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;A couple of example grants that could be made to address this problem.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u201cI\u2019d want to fund the following if I could find a grantee to carry it out.\u201d</p><p>The testing project just finishing up in November had 4 groups&nbsp;</p><p>1.No treatment</p><p>2.

I am one of the founding board members of&nbsp;the Golden Thread Initiative\u2122 (GTI), a 501(c)3 non-profit organization founded in 2019. The inspiration for creating GTI stemmed from&nbsp;a belief in the unique power of women and girls to transform their world.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>We wish to bring attention to the cause of creating world peace through women's education and self-development.&nbsp;</strong>We also want to highlight the importance of women and girls having access to effective education and self-development opportunities worldwide.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The strategies we propose include elements beyond academics, life skills or technical training: incorporating the study of consciousness in education helps&nbsp;to fulfill&nbsp;a woman\u2019s potential\u2014her holistic&nbsp;wellbeing and spiritual&nbsp;fulfillment.&nbsp;Women\u2019s inner growth then&nbsp;becomes the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>foundation for progress, harmony and prosperity of any society.</p><p>Evidence shows that when women and girls have access to effective education and self-development opportunities, the long-term ripple effects transform their own lives&nbsp;as well as the lives of their family and community.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p><p>Because the impact of general education for girls and women is seen on a community-wide scale, we can infer that the same dynamics could potentially work on a global scale. Implementing a strategy which focuses on tools for developing women\u2019s full potential\u2014including techniques to maximize brain functioning, develop higher states of consciousness and experiences of personal/spiritual growth\u2014will have an even wider positive social impact. Through women\u2019s interconnections, the effects can spread from local communities to the global world family.</p><p><strong>What we\u2019re doing to further this cause:</strong></p><p>The mission of the Golden Thread Initiative is to create world peace by increasing access to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 education and self-development programs worldwide. GTI serves as a philanthropic intermediary connecting donors with non-profit organizations around the world that have been vetted for their ability to provide the most effective, life-transforming opportunities for women and girls.&nbsp;</p><p>GTI\u2019s vision is to ensure that evidence-based programs for self-development are accessible to women and girls of all ages, nationalities, ethnicities, education levels, backgrounds and socio-economic status.</p><p>Our long-term strategy to accomplish our mission includes:</p><ul><li>Conducting fundraising campaigns\u2014and facilitating grants, scholarships and project funding\u2014to make these programs available to women and girls on all continents..&nbsp;</li><li>Networking with organizations, thought-leaders and philanthropists who share our vision.</li><li>Informing the public about the importance of women\u2019s education and self-development and the effective programs which are available.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Since 2019, GTI has awarded grants/scholarships for women to attend educational and self-development programs administered by various independent non-profit organizations worldwide which provide a safe, blissful, and nourishing environment where women and girls are free to explore the full capacity of their potential. In our grantmaking procedures, we work with grantee organizations to demonstrate measurable outcomes, such as student progress reports, self-reported surveys, and/or data through well-designed research studies.&nbsp;</p><p>We are interested to know from Open Philanthropy what kind of data would be of interest to donors who are inspired by this cause and seeking to invest their charitable giving dollars effectively.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Importance</strong></p><p><br>There\u2019s a saying that for a forest to be green, every tree must be green. For the concept of world peace to be realistic, every individual must experience peace. People are at peace only when there is progress in their lives, when their creative intelligence is able to flourish. While it would be easy (and obvious) to say that \u201ceveryone\u201d would benefit from \u201cworld peace\u201d, in order to further this cause, researchers and funders need to focus on strategies that yield outcomes&nbsp;that can be measurable, reliable and effective in all cultures. In other words, universal.&nbsp;</p><p>Evidence indicates that education which improves the lives of women and girls has the greatest social impact.<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>We suggest expanding the scope of education by including programs which develop inner peace and the innate creative intelligence of women and girls, particularly in the most populous regions of the world. For example, we could focus on inner growth for the 189,527,000 women of North America, or the 706,249,000 women of Africa, or the 2,267,674,000 women of Asia (2021 statistics according to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.populationof.net\">www.populationof.net</a>), with priority given to those who are in need of financial assistance to access education and self-development programs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tractability: Women and Community\u2014the Ripple Effect</strong></p><p>A common feature of all&nbsp;the programs GTI supports are Consciousness-based Education\u2120 and the Transcendental Meditation<sup>\u00ae</sup> technique.&nbsp;A large body of published scientific research shows that use of these programs effectively leads to self-development<sup>2</sup>, greater resilience against stress<sup>3</sup> and improved brain&nbsp;functioning<sup>4</sup>, as well as improved mental and physical health<sup>5</sup>. GTI secures financial support for programs that, with sufficient funding, are scalable and sustainable and can cause transformation in the lives of women and their communities, especially in places where women are under-resourced.</p><p>Giving women the opportunity to develop&nbsp;their mental and physical health and brain functioning automatically leads to more orderliness and peace in society, through the ripple effects of their daily actions in their family, society, and nation.&nbsp;</p><p>Although many studies have been done on the effects of both individual and group practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique, measuring the impact per dollar would require collaboration between economists, social science researchers and meditation experts. Having an integrated approach to assessing the short and long-term needs of groups practicing meditation together would ensure that scalable and sustainable programs can be structured, offering the possibility for a systematic approach to creating world peace.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Neglectedness: What\u2019s missing in current philanthropic strategies</strong></p><p>While there are many organizations providing solutions to external problems faced by women\u2014for example, improving access to nutrition, safety, financial security and job skills\u2014the vision of GTI is to empower every woman and girl with tools for inner growth and self-development as the foundation for her success and well-being, no matter what vocation she chooses to pursue.</p><p>Whatever we choose to call it\u2014self-development, self-actualization, or enlightenment\u2014 it is everyone\u2019s birthright to develop their full potential, to be happy and fulfilled.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is self-development particularly important for women? Women have many roles which require not only skills but inner strength and equanimity. Because a woman\u2019s influence in her family, community and vocation is far-reaching, self-development is not a luxury for a few lucky people. Women\u2019s self-development is a necessity for the flourishing of society.&nbsp;</p><p>In the mid 1940s, psychologist Abraham Maslow developed his theory of <i>Hierarchy of Needs&nbsp;</i>identifying the requirements for a complete and healthy personality. Originally depicted as a five-layered pyramid, the first four layers refer to <i>Deficiency-needs</i>: 1) physiological (food,&nbsp;shelter, etc); 2) safety; 3) relationships/belonging, and; 4) esteem/accomplishment. The 5th level corresponds with <i>Growth-needs</i> which Maslow termed <i>self-actualization</i>, characterized by personal growth and peak experiences.</p><p>In later models, he expanded on the&nbsp;<i>Growth-needs</i>, culminating in transcendence (or \u201c<i>self-transcendence</i>\u201d), when a person is motivated by values beyond themselves, including spiritual fulfillment and service to others.</p><p>Since the late 1990s, the field of positive psychology has built on Maslow's work by studying the sources of human flourishing, including <i>self-actualization</i> and <i>self-transcendence</i>.</p><p><i>Deficiency-needs</i> are more physically-based. Whereas <i>Growth-needs</i> are also, in fact, basic needs, they support psychological maturation and growth. As we know, the brain and body are connected with the psyche. The ideal growth model would have all of these needs identified and addressed. Because they are not <i>Deficiency-needs</i> and are less easily measured, <i>Growth-needs</i> are often the first to be overlooked or ignored. However, they are extremely important.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Just as a spectrum of nutrients are required for good health,&nbsp;our full spectrum of needs must be met in order to develop our full potential as humans.&nbsp;<i>Self-actualization</i> and <i>self-transcendence</i> are what cause a person and a society to thrive and progress. The result of that progress is fulfillment. This is the basis for inner peace and world peace.</p><p>GTI believes that well-meaning organizations which support programs benefiting women have been less likely to&nbsp;address the&nbsp;<i>Growth-needs</i> because they may not&nbsp;have been aware of effective strategies or programs to <strong>systematically develop</strong> full human potential. Also, it is much easier to identify <i>Deficiency-needs</i> such as a lack of food or safety.&nbsp;Considering the evidence that investing in women has a greater positive social impact than generalized funding, the possibility of large numbers of girls and women&nbsp;gaining an education which&nbsp;simultaneously fulfills their basic needs and <i>Growth-needs</i> could have an unprecedented, positive, world-changing impact. Dare we say it? World peace.&nbsp;</p><p>This potential impact deserves sufficient funding to implement the strategies effectively. Fortunately, the costs of implementing Consciousness-based Education and the Transcendental Meditation technique (along with its advanced programs) are relatively inexpensive compared to the costs of crisis management.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Return on Investment</strong></p><p>A prevention-oriented approach strengthens women from the inside so that they can deal with life challenges more effectively. This means that a few hundred dollars (or less in developing countries) spent on teaching the Transcendental Meditation technique to an individual can potentially prevent the need for spending tens of thousands of dollars to treat the effects of poor mental and physical health (see Blue Cross study statistics below<sup>5</sup>). Since the TM technique is simple and effortless, children can easily learn to meditate and potentially have a lifetime of cumulative benefits<sup>8</sup>, so the ROI of educating girls in this area can be even greater.</p><p>On a larger scale, group practice of an advanced technique of Transcendental Meditation, the TM-Sidhi<sup>\u00ae</sup> Program, has been demonstrated to effectively reduce crime and other negative societal trends. Stated simply, groups of TM-Sidhi practitioners of a sufficient size appear to reduce negative trends in the community around them in a significant, positive and measurable way. Surprising as this may be, I encourage foundations and philanthropists who are interested in this topic to look at the data<sup>6</sup>.&nbsp;</p><p>Numerous studies on this phenomenon have primarily involved volunteers who participated in conferences for several weeks or months. If a sufficient number of people trained in the TM-Sidhi program could be funded as professional \u201cpeace-creators\u201d (i.e. so that the group and effect would not be temporary) the cost savings to society could be more than 1000x return-on-investment<sup>7</sup> when all the different ripple effects are taken into consideration.<br><br>Since the concept of world peace is open to interpretation (and there\u2019s little historical evidence it has ever been achieved on a global scale), philanthropists and foundations might wish to fund research which would measure and forecast the impact of women\u2019s education and self-development (in this case, including <i>self-actualization</i> and <i>self-transcendence</i>) on social factors which contribute to world peace, such as a balanced economy, public health and geo-political stability, environmental health, etc.</p><p>No studies to date have fully quantified the potential return on investment of this type of balanced approach to women\u2019s self-development and education. This is an area of research that deserves funding, and could have a significant impact on the entire world\u2019s population.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strategies for implementation: Examples of real and hypothetical grants</strong></p><p><u>Collaborations:</u></p><p>Many existing organizations and governments already have systems in place to address women\u2019s <i>Deficiency-needs</i> (food, shelter, safety etc.). Interested stakeholders (e.g., funders, nonprofit executives, governments, and concerned citizens) could collaborate with these existing organizations to diversify their programs by adding Transcendental Meditation and Consciousness-based Education to their existing curricula, thereby supporting women\u2019s <i>Growth-needs&nbsp;</i>in addition to meeting their basic needs. These TM and CBE programs are offered through certified teachers who have received extensive training, and the technique is taught in the same way worldwide, making it easily replicable and researchable. This collaborative approach would make use of existing networks to more quickly reach a large population. Addressing the full spectrum of womens\u2019 needs could thus strike an ideal balance that would allow many more women to reach their full potential. This balanced inner and outer growth in turn would allow untold economic and social benefits to blossom for everyone else.</p><p><u>Academic scholarships:</u><br>In November 2021, GTI launched a campaign to raise money for full academic scholarships for under-resourced women from six countries to attend a 4-year Bachelor of Arts degree program at Rajapark Institute in Thailand and participate in a peace-creating group&nbsp;called the Asian Mother Divine Program (see footnotes). Currently, there are 17 highly-qualified applicants who need funding: seven women from Nepal; two from Mongolia; one from Malaysia; one from Russia; two from Ghana; and four from Thailand*.</p><p>&nbsp;<br>*The prospective students from Thailand are graduates of the Dhammajarinee Witthaya School, which is run by a Buddhist nun and offers free K-12 education to&nbsp;at-risk girls.&nbsp;Students at the school older than four are instructed in Transcendental Meditation and attend daily group practice. These four young women applying for the BA program&nbsp;at Rajapark Institute wish to return to the school to teach future generations after receiving their Bachelors degrees. This is how GTI envisions creating a ripple effect by supporting women\u2019s personal&nbsp;growth that will transform countless lives for generations.</p><p>Many of these BA applicants have stated that upon graduating, they plan to return to their home countries as school teachers with special training in Consciousness-based Education, in order to help create schools for girls.</p><p><u>Professional peace-creating groups of women on every continent:</u><br>In its first full fiscal year, 2020-2021, GTI awarded&nbsp;multiple grants to support the work of&nbsp;eight&nbsp;organizations across five continents, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Operating funds for six groups of peace-creating professionals called the Mother Divine Program\u2120 in&nbsp;the Americas, Europe, Thailand, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.</li><li>Funds for upgrading residential and meeting facilities for the Mother Divine Program in the USA and Europe.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The Mother Divine&nbsp;Program is an in-residence community of women who practice the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique and the TM-Sidhi<sup>\u00ae</sup> Program (an advanced technique of the TM&nbsp;program) in groups. The&nbsp;Mother Divine Program offers women the&nbsp;opportunity to focus exclusively on spiritual&nbsp;development and world peace. The living conditions and&nbsp;daily routine are designed to be ideal for deep meditation and advanced studies in consciousness. To our knowledge, this is the first time in history such an opportunity has been available to women.&nbsp;Since the founding of the Mother Divine Program in 1981,&nbsp;more than 2400 women and girls from 60 countries in theAmericas, Asia, Australasia and Europe have participated in the program.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;joined in the group for a year as their responsibilities or funding allowed, and some have continued for the past 40 years, inspired to make this lifestyle a&nbsp;vocation due to the spiritual fulfillment they experienced.</p><p>Aside from their personal benefit of spiritual growth,&nbsp;the members of the Mother Divine Program are deeply committed to serving as professional peace-creators. Intriguing evidence and research shows a strong positive correlation between the size of&nbsp;a group practicing the TM-Sidhi program together and positive societal changes in the geographic region&nbsp;including reduced crime and war<sup>6</sup>. In other words, the more people&nbsp;practicing the TM-Sidhi Program together, the greater the positive societal influence.</p><p>The Mother Divine Program provides a service to society by reducing societal stress. The operating costs of the program (e.g. housing, meals, etc.) are covered either by the participants\u2019 own funds or by financial support&nbsp;from donors who value the role of the&nbsp;Mother Divine Program.&nbsp;Many more women are interested in participating in&nbsp;the Mother Divine Program, and potentially making it a vocation, but lack the financial resources to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing the opportunity for more women to participate in the Mother Divine Program and pay them a professional salary will give women from all socio-economic levels an opportunity to&nbsp;participate in the professional peace-creating groups\u2014creating a larger, sustainable impact in society\u2014while also growing in spiritual fulfillment.</p><p><u>Continuing education or short courses:</u><br>GTI has also provided grants to help women attend the Transcendental Meditation Teacher Training course, learn advanced Transcendental Meditation techniques, and attend short courses and retreats with the Mother Divine Program. These short courses expand the&nbsp;number of women that can take advantage of these self-development opportunities.</p><p>The women who have received grants and attended courses funded by GTI are now continuing to pursue more educational opportunities and leadership training. As one grant recipient we\u2019ll call Wendy stated, \u201cThe knowledge and experience I gained continues to support me exponentially toward fulfilling my life purpose. Not only do I feel an infinite reservoir of creative potential within me, I am more integrated in my daily activities and feel more connected to the laws that govern life.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Support&nbsp;generated by Open Philanthropy and&nbsp;other philanthropists and foundations who share&nbsp;this vision can catalyze a shift toward global peace through the personal transformation and growth of women like&nbsp;Wendy.</p><p><u>Feasibility and/or pilot studies:</u></p><p>Funders, researchers, governments and business leaders who are interested in exploring the ideas presented here could contact us (Golden Thread Initiative) for a proposal to determine what is needed to sustainably fund a professional peace-creating group, offering \u201ccoherence as a service\u201d to society.

It is practiced by millions of people worldwide of all ages, vocations and social conditions. TM is not a religion and is practiced by people of many religions. Decades of research verify its benefits for mental and physical health and even its effectiveness at developing the qualities identified with self-actualization, fulfillment and peak performance.&nbsp;<br>See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tm-women.org/\">TM-Women.org</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tm.org/\">TM.org</a> for more information.</p><p>The TM technique comes from an ancient tradition of knowledge of human potential called the Vedic Tradition. Often considered a spiritual tradition, a more complete analysis reveals that it is a holistic scientific tradition that has led to fundamental concepts in physics, mathematics, medicine, the social sciences, and architecture. The Vedic tradition utilizes various mental and physical techniques to develop human potential including Yoga, Ayurveda (a natural, holistic system of health care) and the TM technique.</p><p><u>The Mother Divine Program</u>\u2120<br>The Mother Divine Program\u2120\u2014communities of women around the world practicing the TM technique and its advanced programs\u2014offers educational opportunities for women and girls ranging from weekend retreats to year-long enrichment courses and academic degree programs. The&nbsp;Mother Divine Program is administered by independent non-profit, nonsectarian organizations based in the USA, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. The name <i>Mother Divine</i> reflects the universal qualities inherent in women of all walks of life that touch the lives of their families, communities and society as a whole.</p><p>Currently courses are offered at small residential campuses on five continents including North America, South America, Europe, Asia (Thailand), and Australasia (New Zealand).</p><p>The core groups of the Mother Divine Program are full-time participants practicing the most advanced techniques of TM and modalities such as Yoga and Ayurveda (natural healthcare).</p><p><u>Consciousness-based Education</u>\u2120<br>Consciousness-Based Education features academics or fields of study in a healthy living environment and stress-free routine including the Transcendental Meditation technique. Currently this program has been implemented in over 800 educational institutions in 67 countries, with over 1,000,000 students (Source: CBE website).</p><p><strong>Network of interest:</strong><br>Organizations addressing this cause of creating world peace through women\u2019s and girls\u2019 education and self-development, some of whom Golden Thread Initiative may partner with:</p><ul><li>The Global Women's Center for Peace and Enlightenment<br><a href=\"https://www.globalwomenscenter.org/\">https://www.globalwomenscenter.org/</a></li><li>North American Mother Divine Program<br><a href=\"http://www.motherdivine.org\">www.motherdivine.org</a></li><li>Asian Mother Divine Program<br><a href=\"https://www.asianmd.org\">https://www.asianmd.org</a></li><li>Dhammajarinee Witthaya School (for at-risk girls in Thailand)<br><a href=\"https://www.thaischool.org\">https://www.thaischool.org</a></li><li>New Zealand Mother Divine Programme</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.motherdivinenz.org/\">https://www.motherdivinenz.org/</a></p><ul><li>The David Lynch Foundation, programs for women\u2019s health<br><a href=\"https://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/women.html\">https://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/women.html</a></li></ul><p>Additional organizations involved with Consciousness-Based education and the brain-based approach to peace:</p><ul><li>Maharishi International University<br><a href=\"https://www.miu.edu/\">https://www.miu.edu/</a></li><li>International Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education<br><a href=\"https://consciousnessbasededucation.org/\">https://consciousnessbasededucation.org/</a><br><a href=\"https://consciousnessbasededucation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CBE-Fact_Sheet_2021.pdf\">https://consciousnessbasededucation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CBE-Fact_Sheet_2021.pdf</a></li><li>Global Union of Scientists for Peace (GUSP)<br><a href=\"https://www.gusp.org/defusing-world-crises/brain-based-approach/\">https://www.gusp.org/defusing-world-crises/brain-based-approach/</a></li></ul><p>Please see references below, highlighting some of the published research in these areas.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><i><sup>1</sup><strong><sup> </sup></strong></i><strong>Girls\u2019 Education</strong><br>Harvard Kennedy School, <i>Investing in Girls\u2019 Education</i><br><a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/programs/cri/files/report_40_investing_in_girls.pdf\">https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/programs/cri/files/report_40_investing_in_girls.pdf</a><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup><strong>Self-development</strong></p><p><strong>Travis FT, Arenander A, DuBois D.

SAGE Open 2016 6(2):1-16. doi:10.1177/2158244016637891&nbsp;</strong>This research tests the hypothesis that group practice of the Transcendental Meditation\u00ae (TM) and TM-Sidhi\u00ae program by a group of sufficient size is associated with reduced rates of homicide and violent crime. Data from a prospective quasi-experiment were analyzed using intervention analysis or interrupted time series analysis. Dependent variables are time series of the U.S. monthly homicide rate as well as violent crime rate from a sample of 206 cities. The binary intervention variable is based on the size of the largest U.S. TM-Sidhi group. Intervention effects were analyzed by time series regression using a broken-trend intervention model. As hypothesized, there was a statistically and practically significant shift in trend in the direction of reduced rates for each of the variables beginning with the onset of the intervention period. Diagnostic tests indicate that key statistical assumptions of the analysis are satisfied. Alternative hypotheses are considered for the apparent effect of macro-level social behavioral change without micro-level behavioral interaction.&nbsp;(*Mother Divine Program groups were present at this assembly.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dillbeck MC, Cavanaugh KL.

SAGE Open 2017 7(1):1-15. doi:10.1177/2158244017697164.&nbsp;</strong>These two studies tested the prediction that the group practice of a procedure for the development of consciousness, the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi program, by a sufficiently large group of individuals would be sufficient to reduce collective stress in the larger population, reflected in two stress-related health indicators, infant mortality rate and drug- related fatality rate. Based on theoretical prediction and prior research, from January 2007 through 2010 (intervention period), this effect should have been measurable. Change in the rates of these two indicators during the intervention period were estimated from 2002 through 2010 data using a broken-trend (or segmented trend) intervention model with time series regression methods. The changes in trend were both statistically and practically significant, indicating an average annual decline of 3.12% in infant mortality rate and 7.61% in drug-related fatality rate. Diagnostic tests are satisfactory and indicate that it is unlikely that the statistical results are attributable to spurious regression. The mechanism for these collective effects is discussed in view of possible alternative hypotheses.&nbsp; (*Mother Divine Program groups were present at this assembly.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dillbeck MC, Cavanaugh KL, Glenn T, Orme-Johnson DW, Mittlefehldt&nbsp; V.

There could be a lot of them. We can make their lives&nbsp; go better.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the case for longtermism in a nutshell. The premises are simple,&nbsp; and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly controversial. Yet taking them seriously amounts to a moral revolution\u2014one with far-reaching implications&nbsp; for how activists, researchers, policy makers, and indeed all of us should&nbsp; think and act.&nbsp;</p><p>Future people count, but we rarely count them. They cannot vote or&nbsp; lobby or run for public office, so politicians have scant incentive to think&nbsp; about them. they can\u2019t bargain or trade with us, so they have little representation in the market. And they can\u2019t make their views heard directly: they&nbsp; can\u2019t tweet, or write articles in newspapers, or march in the streets. they are&nbsp; utterly disenfranchised.&nbsp;</p><p>Previous social movements, such as those for civil rights and women\u2019s&nbsp; su#rage, have often sought to give greater recognition and influence to disempowered members of society. I see longtermism as an extension of&nbsp; these ideals. Though we cannot give genuine political power to future people, we can at least give consideration to them. By abandoning the tyranny&nbsp; of the present over the future, we can act as trustees\u2014helping to create a&nbsp; flourishing world for generations to come. This is of the utmost importance. Let me explain why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Future People Count</strong></p><p>The idea that future people count is common sense. Future people, after all, are people. They will exist. They will have hopes and joys and pains and regrets, just like the rest of us. They just don\u2019t exist <i>yet</i>.</p><p>To see how intuitive this is, suppose that, while hiking, I drop a glass bottle on the trail and it shatters. And suppose that if I don\u2019t clean it up, later a child will cut herself badly on the shards.&nbsp;In deciding whether to clean it up, does it matter <i>when </i>the child will cut herself? Should I care whether it\u2019s a week, or a decade, or a century from now? No. Harm is harm, whenever it occurs.</p><p>Or suppose that a plague is going to infect a town and kill thousands. You can stop it. Before acting, do you need to know when the outbreak will occur? Does that matter, just on its own? No. The pain and death at stake are worthy of concern regardless.</p><p>The same holds for good things. Think of something you love in your own life; maybe it\u2019s music or sports. And now imagine someone else who loves something in their life just as much. Does the value of their joy disappear if they live in the future? Suppose you can give them tickets to see their favourite band or the football team they support. To decide whether to give them, do you need to know the delivery date?</p><p>Imagine what future people would think, looking back at us debating such questions. They would see some of us arguing that future people don\u2019t matter. But they look down at their hands; they look around at their lives. What is different? What is less real? Which side of the debate will seem more clear-headed and obvious? Which more myopic and parochial?</p><p>Distance in time is like distance in space. People matter even if they live thousands of miles away. Likewise, they matter even if they live thousands of years hence. In both cases, it\u2019s easy to mistake distance for unreality, to treat the limits of what we can see as the limits of the world. But just as the world does not stop at our doorstep or our country\u2019s borders, neither does it stop with our generation, or the next.</p><p>These ideas are common sense. A popular proverb says, \u201cA society grows great when old men plant trees under whose shade they will never sit.\u201d&nbsp;When we dispose of radioactive waste, we don\u2019t say, \u201cWho cares if this poisons people centuries from now?\u201d Similarly, few of us who care about climate change or pollution do so solely for the sake of people alive today. We build museums and parks and bridges that we hope will last for generations; we invest in schools and longterm scientific projects; we preserve paintings, traditions, languages; we protect beautiful places. In many cases, we don\u2019t draw clear lines between our concerns for the present and the future\u2014both are in play.</p><p>Concern for future generations is common sense across diverse intellectual traditions. The <i>Gayanashagowa</i>, the centuries-old oral constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy, has a particularly clear statement. It exhorts the Lords of the Confederacy to \u201chave always in view not only the present but also the coming generations.\u201d&nbsp;Oren Lyons, a faithkeeper for the Onondaga and Seneca nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, phrases this in terms of a \u201cseventh-generation\u201d principle, saying, \u201cWe . . . make every decision that we make relate to the welfare and well-being of the seventh generation to come. . . . We consider: will this be to the benefit of the seventh generation?\u201d</p><p>However, even if you grant that future people count, there\u2019s still a question of how much weight to give their interests. Are there reasons to care more about people alive today?</p><p>Two reasons stand out to me. The first is partiality. We often have stronger special relationships with people in the present, like family, friends, and fellow citizens, than with people in the future. It\u2019s common sense that you can and should give extra weight to your near and dear.</p><p>The second reason is reciprocity. Unless you live as a recluse in the wilderness, the actions of an enormous number of people\u2014teachers, shop- keepers, engineers, and indeed all taxpayers\u2014directly benefit you and have done so throughout your life. We typically think that if someone has benefited you, that gives you a reason to repay them. But future people don\u2019t benefit you the way others in your generation do.</p><p>Special relationships and reciprocity are important. But they do not change the upshot of my argument. I\u2019m not claiming that the interests of present and future people should always and everywhere be given equal weight. I\u2019m just claiming that future people matter significantly. Just as car- ing more about our children doesn\u2019t mean ignoring the interests of strangers, caring more about our contemporaries doesn\u2019t mean ignoring the interests of our descendants.</p><p>To illustrate, suppose that one day we discover Atlantis, a vast civilisation at the bottom of the sea. We realise that many of our activities affect Atlantis. When we dump waste into the oceans, we poison its citizens; when a ship sinks, they recycle it for scrap metal and other parts. We would have no special relationships with the Atlanteans, nor would we owe them repayment for benefits they had bestowed on us. But we should still give serious consideration to how our actions affect them.</p><p>The future is like Atlantis. It, too, is a vast, undiscovered country;&nbsp;and whether that country thrives or falters depends, in significant part, on what we do today.</p><p><strong>The Future Is Big</strong></p><p>It\u2019s common sense that future people count. So, too, is the idea that, morally, the numbers matter. If you can save one person or ten from dying in a fire, then, all else being equal, you should save ten; if you can cure a hundred people or a thousand of a disease, you should cure a thousand. This matters, because the number of future people could be huge.</p><p>To see this, consider the long-run history of humanity. There have been members of the genus <i>Homo </i>on Earth for over 2.5 million years.&nbsp;Our species, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, evolved around three hundred thousand years ago. Agri- culture started just twelve thousand years ago, the first cities formed only six thousand years ago, the industrial era began around 250 years ago, and all the changes that have happened since then\u2014transitioning from horse-drawn carts to space travel, leeches to heart transplants, mechanical calculators to supercomputers\u2014occurred over the course of just three human lifetimes.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:99.29%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/bwefwudcfochovfhj2kp\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/abnmhcf14mpmhm53rtkk 81w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/jre2wn5mkydaohx6ffam 161w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/ykg1dlciwcnbkrukdzk9 241w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/eqhlsmfn8oegn39hv35e 321w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/crnlhmkazp27rs0gh5tf 401w\"></figure><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:93.32%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/uygraqtnvqd0ouxg55di\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/mgot6ixanyfu61v360z9 82w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/ub5a4lht7ynxmdkd8roj 162w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/c2gwma4kxkg8g61qsesn 242w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/iq6bdd8b6ejpvhsg2fjl 322w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/o4rb19lpund3ftaocewz 402w\"></figure><p>How long will our species last? Of course, we don\u2019t know. But we can make informative estimates that take our uncertainty into account, including our uncertainty about whether we\u2019ll cause our own demise.</p><p>To illustrate the potential scale of the future, suppose that we only last as long as the typical mammalian species\u2014that is, around one million years. Also assume that our population continues at its current size. In that case, there would be eighty trillion people yet to come; future people would out- number us ten thousand to one.</p><p>Of course, we must consider the whole range of ways the future could go. Our life span as a species could be much shorter than that of other mammals if we cause our own extinction. But it could also be much longer. Un- like other mammals, we have sophisticated tools that help us adapt to varied environments; abstract reasoning, which allows us to make complex, long- term plans in response to novel circumstances; and a shared culture that allows us to function in groups of millions. These help us avoid threats of extinction that other mammals can\u2019t.</p><p>This has an asymmetric impact on humanity\u2019s life expectancy. The future of civilisation could be very short, ending within a few centuries. But it could also be extremely long. The earth will remain habitable for hundreds of millions of years. If we survive that long, with the same population per century as now, there will be a million future people for every person alive today. And if humanity ultimately takes to the stars, the timescales become literally astronomical. The sun will keep burning for five billion years; the last conventional star formations will occur in over a trillion years; and, due to a small but steady stream of collisions between brown dwarfs, a few stars will still shine a million trillion years from now.</p><p><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/shx0stibr4yb0hgpb0va\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/qyydh0jnuhcmayjutdoo 80w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/zxbxg5rclkbrvvfmvqgy 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/vnnl6gsakmfok8lkpob9 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/xxra6a5b3oabnkugfbhl 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/cj61rzvctuwf6gwbdkhq 400w\"></p><p>The real possibility that civilisation will last such a long time gives humanity an enormous life expectancy. A 10 percent chance of surviving five hundred million years until the earth is no longer habitable gives us a life expectancy of over fifty million years; a 1 percent chance of surviving until the last conventional star formations give us a life expectancy of over ten billion years.</p><p>Ultimately, we shouldn\u2019t care just about humanity\u2019s life expectancy but also about how many people there will be. So we must ask: How many people in the future will be alive at any one time?</p><p>Future populations might be much smaller or much larger than they are today. But if the future population is smaller, it can be smaller by eight billion at most\u2014the size of today\u2019s population. In contrast, if the future population is bigger, it could be much bigger. The current global population is already over a thousand times larger than it was in the hunter-gatherer era. If global population density increased to that of the Netherlands\u2014an agricultural net exporter\u2014there would be seventy billion people alive at any one time.&nbsp;This might seem fantastical, but a global population of eight billion would have seemed fantastical to a prehistoric hunter-gatherer or an early agriculturalist.</p><p>Population size could get dramatically larger again if we one day take to the stars. Our sun produces billions of times as much sunlight as lands on Earth, there are tens of billions of other stars across our galaxy, and billions of galaxies are accessible to us. There might therefore be vastly more people in the distant future than there are today.</p><p>Just how many? Precise estimates are neither possible nor necessary. On any reasonable accounting, the number is immense.</p><p>To see this, look at the following diagram. Each figure represents ten billion people. So far, roughly one hundred billion people have ever lived. These past people are represented as ten figures.

But I cut the diagram short. The full version would fill twenty thousand pages\u2014 saturating this book a hundred times over. Each figure would represent ten billion lives, and each of those lives could be flourishing or wretched.</p><p>Earlier, I suggested that humanity today is like an imprudent teenager: most of our life is ahead of us, and decisions that impact the rest of that life are of colossal importance. But, really, this analogy understates my case. A teenager knows approximately how long she can expect to live. But we do not know humanity\u2019s life expectancy. We are more like a teenager who, for all she knows, might accidentally cause her own death in the next few months but also might live for a thousand years. If you were in such a situation, would you think seriously about the long life that might be ahead of you, or would you ignore it?</p><p>The sheer size of the future can be dizzying. Typically, \u201clongterm\u201d think- ing involves attention to years or decades at most. But even with a low estimate of humanity\u2019s life expectancy, this is like a teenager believing that longterm thinking means considering tomorrow but not the day after.</p><p>Despite how overwhelming thoughts of our future can be, if we truly care about the interests of future generations\u2014if we recognize that they are real people, capable of happiness and suffering just like us\u2014then we have a duty to consider how we might impact the world they inhabit.</p><p><strong>The Value of the Future</strong></p><p>The future could be very big. It could also be very good\u2014or very bad.<br>To get a sense of how good, we can look at some of the progress humanity has made over the last few centuries. Two hundred years ago, average life expectancy was less than thirty; today, it is seventy-three. Back then, over 80 percent of the world lived in extreme poverty; now, less than 10 percent does. Back then, only about 10 percent of adults could read; today, more than 85 percent can.</p><p>Collectively we have the power both to encourage these positive trends and to change course on the negative trends, like the dramatic increases in carbon dioxide emissions and in the number of animals suffering in factory farms. We can build a world where everyone lives like the happiest people in the most well-off countries today, a world where no one lives in poverty, no one lacks adequate medical care, and, insofar as is possible, everyone is free to live as they want.</p><p>But we could do even better still\u2014far better. The best that we have seen so far is a poor guide to what is possible. To get some inkling of this, consider the life of a rich man in Britain in 1700\u2014a man with access to the best food, health care, and luxuries available at the time. For all his advantages, such a man could easily die of smallpox, syphilis, or typhus. If he needed surgery or had a toothache, the treatment would be agonising and carry a significant risk of infection. If he lived in London, the air he breathed would be seventeen times as polluted as it is today. Travelling even within Britain could take weeks, and most of the globe was entirely inaccessible to him. If he had imagined a future merely where most people were as rich as him, he would have failed to anticipate many of the things that improve our lives, like electricity, anaesthesia, antibiotics, and mod- ern travel.</p><p>It\u2019s not just technology that has improved people\u2019s lives; moral change has done so, too. In 1700, women were unable to attend university, and the feminist movement did not exist. If that well-off Brit was gay, he could not love openly; sodomy was punishable by death. In the late 1700s, three in four people globally were the victims of some form of forced labour; now less than 1 percent are. In 1700, no one lived in a democracy. Now over half the world does.</p><p>Much of the progress we\u2019ve made since 1700 would have been very difficult for people back then to anticipate. And that\u2019s with only a three-century gap. Humanity could last for millions of centuries on Earth alone. On such a scale, if we anchor our sense of humanity\u2019s potential to a fixed-up version of our present world, we risk dramatically underestimating just how good life in the future could be.</p><p>Consider the very best moments in your life\u2014moments of joy, beauty, and energy, like falling in love, or achieving a lifelong goal, or having some creative insight. These moments provide proof of what is possible: we know that life can be at least as good as it is then. But they also show us a direction in which our lives can move, leading somewhere we have yet to go. If my best days can be hundreds of times better than my typically pleasant but humdrum life, then perhaps the best days of those in the future can be hundreds of times better again.</p><p>I\u2019m not claiming that a wonderful future is <i>likely</i>. Etymologically, \u201cutopia\u201d means \u201cno-place,\u201d and indeed the path from here to some ideal future state is very fragile. But a wonderful future is not just a fantasy, either. A better word would be \u201ceutopia,\u201d meaning \u201cgood place\u201d\u2014something to strive for. It\u2019s a future that, with enough patience and wisdom, our descendants could actually build\u2014if we pave the way for them.</p><p>And though the future could be wonderful, it could also be terrible. To see this, look at some of the negative trends of the past and imagine a future where <i>they </i>are the dominant forces guiding the world. Consider that slavery had all but disappeared from France and England by the end of the twelfth century, but in the colonial era those same countries became slave traders on a massive scale. Or consider that the mid-twentieth century saw totalitarian regimes emerging even out of democracies. Or that we used scientific advances to build nuclear weapons and factory farms.</p><p>Just as eutopia is a real possibility, so is dystopia. The future could be one where a single totalitarian regime controls the world, or where today\u2019s qual- ity of life is but a distant memory of a former Golden Age, or where a third world war has led to the complete destruction of civilisation. Whether the future is wonderful or terrible is, in part, up to us.</p><p><strong>Not Just Climate Change</strong></p><p>Even if you accept that the future is big and important, you might be skeptical that we can positively affect it. And I agree that working out the long- run effects of our actions is very hard. There are many considerations at play, and our understanding of them is just beginning. My aim with this book is to stimulate further work in this area, not to be definitive in any conclusions about what we should do. But the future is so important that we\u2019ve got to at least try to figure out how to steer it in a positive direction. And, already, there are some things we can say.</p><p>Looking to the past, though there are not many examples of people deliberately aiming at long-run impacts, they do exist, and some had surprising levels of success. Poets provide one source. In Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 18 (\u201cShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?\u201d) the author notes that through his art he can preserve the young man he admires for all eternity:</p><p><i>But thy eternal summer shall not fade, .....................</i><br><i>When in eternal lines to time thou grow\u2019st.</i></p><p><i>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</i></p><p>Sonnet 18 was written in the 1590s but echoes a tradition that goes back much further. In 23 BC the Roman poet Horace began the final poem in his <i>Odes </i>with these lines:</p><p>I have finished a monument more lasting than bronze, more lofty than the regal structure of the pyramids, one which neither corroding rain nor the un- governable North Wind can ever destroy, nor the countless series of the years, nor the flight of time.</p><p>I shall not wholly die, and a large part of me will elude the Goddess of Death.</p><p>These claims seem bombastic, to say the least. But, plausibly, these poets\u2019 attempts at immortality succeeded. They have survived many hundreds of years and are in fact flourishing as the years pass: more people read Shakespeare today than did in his own time, and the same is probably true of Horace. And as long as some member of each future generation is willing to pay the tiny cost involved in preserving or replicating some representation of these poems, they will persist forever.</p><p>Other writers have also successfully aimed at very longterm impact. Thucydides wrote his <i>History of the Peloponnesian War </i>in the fifth century BC. Many consider him the first Western historian to try to depict events faithfully and analyse their causes. He believed he was describing general truths, and he deliberately wrote his history so that it could be influential far into the future:</p><p>It will be enough for me, however, if these words of mine are judged useful by those who want to understand clearly the events which happened in the past and which (human nature being what it is) will, at some time or other and in much the same ways, be repeated in the future. My work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever.</p><p>Thucydides\u2019s work is still enormously influential to this day. It is required reading at the West Point and Annapolis military academies and the US Na- val War College. The widely read 2017 book <i>Destined for War</i>, by political scientist Graham Allison, had the subtitle <i>Can America and China Escape Thucydides\u2019s Trap? </i>Allison analyses US-China relations in the same terms that Thucydides used for Sparta and Athens. As far as I know, Thucydides is the first person in recorded history to have deliberately aimed at longterm impact and succeeded.</p><p>More recent examples come from the United States\u2019 Founding Fathers. The US Constitution is almost 250 years old and has mostly remained the same throughout its life. Its founding was of enormous longterm importance, and many of the Founding Fathers were well aware of this. John Adams, the second president of the United States, commented, \u201cThe institutions now made in America will not wholly wear out for thousands of years. It is of the last importance, then, that they should begin right. If they set out wrong, they will never be able to return, unless it be by accident, to the right path.\u201d</p><p>Similarly, Benjamin Franklin had such a reputation for believing in the health and longevity of the United States that in 1784 a French mathematician wrote a friendly satire of him, suggesting that if Franklin was sin- cere in his beliefs, he should invest his money to pay out on social projects centuries later, getting the benefits of compound interest along the way. Franklin thought it was a great idea, and in 1790 he invested \u00a31000 (about $135,000 in today\u2019s money) each for the cities of Boston and Philadelphia: three-quarters of the funds would be paid out after one hundred years, and the remainder after two hundred years. By 1990, when the final funds were distributed, the donation had grown to almost $5 million for Boston and $2.3 million for Philadelphia.</p><p>The Founding Fathers themselves were influenced by ideas developed almost two thousand years before them. Their views on the separation of powers were foreshadowed by Locke and Montesquieu, who drew on Polybius\u2019s analysis of Roman governance from the second century BC. We also know that several Founding Fathers were familiar with Polybius\u2019s work themselves.</p><p>Those of us in the present don\u2019t need to be as influential as Thucydides or Franklin to predictably impact the longterm future. In fact, we do it all the time. We drive. We fly. We thereby emit greenhouse gases with very long-lasting effects. Natural processes will return carbon dioxide concentrations to preindustrial levels only after hundreds of thousands of years. These are timescales usually associated with radioactive nuclear waste. However, with nuclear power we carefully store and plan to bury the waste products; with fossil fuels we belch them into the air.</p><p>In some cases, the geophysical impacts of this warming get even more extreme over time rather than \u201cwashing out.\u201d The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that in the medium-low-emissions scenario, which is now widely seen to be the most likely, sea level would rise by around 0.75 metres by the end of the century. But it would keep rising well past the year 2100. After ten thousand years, sea level would be ten to twenty metres higher than it is today. Hanoi, Shanghai, Kolkata, Tokyo, and New York would all be mostly below sea level.</p><p>Climate change shows how actions today can have longterm consequences. But it also highlights that longterm-oriented actions needn\u2019t involve ignoring the interests of those alive today. We can positively steer the future while improving the present, too.</p><p>Moving to clean energy has enormous benefits in terms of present-day human health. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air with small particles that cause lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory infections. As a result, every year about 3.6 million people die prematurely. Even in the European Union, which in global terms is comparatively unpolluted, air pollution from fossil fuels causes the average citizen to lose a whole year of life.</p><p>Decarbonisation\u2014that is, replacing fossil fuels with cleaner sources of energy\u2014therefore has large and immediate health benefits in addition to the longterm climate benefits. Once one accounts for air pollution, rapidly decarbonising the world economy is justified by the health benefits alone.</p><p>Decarbonisation is therefore a win-win, improving life in both the long and the short term. In fact, promoting innovation in clean energy\u2014such as solar, wind, next-generation nuclear, and alternative fuels\u2014is a win on other fronts, too. By making energy cheaper, clean energy innovation improves living standards in poorer countries. By helping keep fossil fuels in the ground, it guards against the risk of unrecovered collapse that I\u2019ll discuss in Chapter 6. By furthering technological progress, it reduces the risk of longterm stagnation that I\u2019ll discuss in Chapter 7. A win-win-win-win-win.</p><p>Decarbonisation is a proof of concept for longtermism. Clean energy in- novation is so robustly good, and there is so much still to do in that area that I see it as a baseline longtermist activity against which other potential actions can be compared. It sets a high bar.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/loe2jxdw4muzolyxw6hc\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/elmbnjixcvz3jqhtacsl 95w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/vh8snhhlgxrujfpkyiue 175w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/agyuopziajt2khlwtlmj 255w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/nhy5ckfrqzsx8zqcxrlr 335w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/ddxvfou3yrhkk7qtaoqh 415w\"></figure><p>But it\u2019s not the only way of affecting the long term. The rest of this book tries to give a systematic treatment of the ways in which we can positively influence the longterm future, suggesting that moral change, wisely govern- ing the ascent of artificial intelligence, preventing engineered pandemics, and averting technological stagnation are all at least as important, and often radically more neglected.</p><p><strong>Our Moment in History</strong></p><p>The idea that we could affect the longterm future, and that there could be so much at stake, might just seem too wild to be true. This is how things initially seemed to me.</p><p>But I think that the wildness of longtermism comes not from the moral premises that underlie it but from the fact that we live at such an unusual time.</p><p>We live in an era that involves an extraordinary amount of change. To see this, consider the rate of global economic growth, which in recent decades averaged around 3 percent per year. This is historically unprecedented. For the first 290,000 years of humanity\u2019s existence, global growth was close to 0 percent per year; in the agricultural era that increased to around 0.1 percent, and it accelerated from there after the Industrial Revolution. It\u2019s only in the last hundred years that the world economy has grown at a rate above 2 per- cent per year. Putting this another way: from 10,000 BC onwards, it took many hundreds of years for the world economy to double in size. The most recent doubling took just nineteen years. And it\u2019s not just that rates of economic growth are historically unusual; the same is true for rates of energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, land use change, scientific advancement, and arguably moral change, too.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/hmzrdrjdwlxxrbebd6ou\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/fmq4pvfotstw88jui6v2 80w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/ekhbyj1oarabmwosipsd 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/mbsiwd2sdrpqojkvzcvr 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/wkpbnwrszla0llfxbh8d 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rdigzNQqDgiou5AmZ/jqlhdqzyaeyssjzko9we 400w\"></figure><p>So we know that the present era is extremely unusual compared to the past. But it\u2019s also unusual compared to the future. This rapid rate of change cannot continue forever, even if we entirely decouple growth from carbon emissions and even if in the future we spread to the stars. To see this, sup- pose that future growth slows a little to just 2 percent per year. At such a rate, in ten thousand years the world economy would be 10\u2078\u2076 times larger than it is today\u2014that is, we would produce one hundred trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion times as much output as we do now. But there are less than 10\u2076\u2077 atoms within ten thousand light years of Earth. So if current growth rates continued for just ten millennia more, there would have to be ten million trillion times as much output as our current world produces for <i>every atom </i>that we could, in principle, access. Though of course we can\u2019t be certain, this just doesn\u2019t seem possible.</p><p>Humanity might last for millions or even billions of years to come. But the rate of change of the modern world can only continue for thousands of years. What this means is that we are living through an extraordinary chapter in humanity\u2019s story. Compared to both the past and the future, every decade we live through sees an extremely unusual number of economic and technological changes. And some of these changes\u2014like the inventions of fossil fuel power, nuclear weapons, engineered pathogens, and advanced artificial intelligence\u2014have the potential to impact the whole course of the future.</p><p>It\u2019s not only the rapid rate of change that makes this time unusual. We\u2019re also unusually connected. For over fifty thousand years, we were broken up into distinct groups; there was simply no way for people across Africa, Europe, Asia, or Australia to communicate with one another. Between 100 BC and AD 150 the Roman Empire and the Han dynasty each comprised up to 30 percent of the world\u2019s population, yet they barely knew of each other. Even within one empire, one person had very limited ability to communicate with someone far away.</p><p>In the future, if we spread to the stars, we will again be separated. The galaxy is like an archipelago, vast expanses of emptiness dotted with tiny pinpricks of warmth. If the Milky Way were the size of Earth, our solar system would be ten centimetres across and hundreds of metres would separate us from our neighbours. Between one end of the galaxy and the other, the fastest possible communication would take a hundred thousand years; even between us and our closest neighbour, there-and-back communication would take almost nine years.</p><p>In fact, if humanity spreads far enough and survives for long enough, it will eventually become impossible for one part of civilisation to communicate with another. The universe is composed of millions of groups of galaxies. Our own is called, simply, the Local Group. The galaxies within each group are close enough to each other that gravity binds them together forever. But, because the universe is expanding, the groups of galaxies will eventually be torn apart from each other. Over 150 billion years in the future, not even light will be able to travel from one group to another.</p><p>The fact that our time is so unusual gives us an outsized opportunity to make a difference. Few people who ever live will have as much power to positively influence the future as we do. Such rapid technological, social, and environmental change means that we have more opportunity to affect when and how the most important of these changes occur, including by managing technologies that could lock in bad values or imperil our survival. Civilisation\u2019s current unification means that small groups have the power to influence the whole of it. New ideas are not confined to a single continent, and they can spread around the world in minutes rather than centuries.</p><p>The fact that these changes are so recent means, moreover, that we are out of equilibrium: society has not yet settled down into a stable state, and we are able to influence <i>which </i>stable state we end up in. Imagine a giant ball rolling rapidly over a rugged landscape. Over time it will lose momentum and slow, settling at the bottom of some valley or chasm. Civilisation is like this ball: while still in motion, a small push can affect in which direction we roll and where we come to rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnftcwq7c2ptv\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefftcwq7c2ptv\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This example is modified from <i>Reasons and Persons </i>(Parfit 1984, 315).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn2muarybez1h\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref2muarybez1h\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Though this is sometimes described as an ancient Chinese or ancient Greek proverb, its origin is unknown.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfwaio62opza\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffwaio62opza\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><i>Constitution of the Iroquois Nations </i>1910.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsigtbc3qoxo\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsigtbc3qoxo\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Lyons 1980, 173.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnuf2ri3lvvsl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefuf2ri3lvvsl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>That said, some reciprocity-type reasons might motivate concern for future gener-</p><p>ations, too.

In 2002, when Bourguignon and Morrisson published their seminal paper on the history of the world income distribution, this was the World Bank\u2019s international poverty line, typi- cally used to define extreme poverty. The World Bank has since updated the international poverty line to a daily income corresponding to what $1.90 would have bought in the US in 2011. Using this new definition, World Bank data indicates that the share of the global pop- ulation living in extreme poverty has been less than 10 percent since 2016; the COVID-19 pandemic tragically broke the long-standing trend of that percentage declining year after year, but it did not quite push it over 10 percent again (World Bank 2020). While the extent to which the old and new poverty lines match is often debated, I think the conclusion that the share of the world population in extreme poverty declined dramatically is unambiguous. This is not to deny we still have a long way to go in the fight against poverty; for instance, more than 40 percent of the world population still live on less than $5.50 per day (again, adjusted for inflation and international price differences relative to the US in 2011).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnct03unq0ivt\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefct03unq0ivt\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Roser and Ortiz-Ospina 2016.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnenf0lcrk1ul\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefenf0lcrk1ul\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Our World in Data 2017a.

Methane only stays in the atmosphere for about twelve years (IPCC 2021a, Chapter 7, Table 7.15); this is in stark contrast to carbon dioxide, which, as we\u2019ve seen, stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p>The most commonly used weighting for methane has been to treat it as thirty times as important as carbon dioxide, but this metric measures the effect methane has on tem- peratures after forty years.

That expected value \u2014 that is, the amount of value multiplied by the probability of achieving it \u2014 is even greater than the expected value of saving one life.</p><p><strong>Will MacAskill:</strong> So what do we do? I\u2019m like, \u201cEh, it really doesn\u2019t seem you should do the incredibly-low-probability thing.\u201d That seems very intuitive. And then the question is, can you design a decision theory that avoids that implication without having some other incredibly counterintuitive implications? It turns out the answer is no, actually.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Will MacAskill:</strong> Now, this isn\u2019t to say that you should do the thing that involves going after tiny probabilities of enormous amounts of value. It\u2019s just within the state where we can formally prove that there\u2019s a paradox here \u2014 that, I\u2019m sorry, the philosophers have failed you: we have no good answer about what to do here.</p></blockquote><p>My resolution is that I think you <i>should</i> do the extremely-low probability thing, as long as it's really true that it actually <i>will</i> have the one in a trillion ... trillion chance of producing the huge amount of value.</p><p>The problem is that in practice, you almost certainly never would be confident that that's the case, as opposed to, e.g. the proposed action not really making the huge value outcome more likely at all. Or as opposed to the one minus one in a trillion ... trillion chance&nbsp;outcomes actually dominating.</p><p><strong>2. I recently set out a heuristic that makes sense to me</strong></p><p>Here's a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5y3vzEAXhGskBhtAD/most-small-probabilities-aren-t-pascalian?commentId=32fAgg2qudCbeEAja\">link to the comment</a>, and I copy and paste almost all of it below.</p><p>What I wrote below appears to provide a useful framework for thinking about Pascal's Mugging situations.</p><blockquote><p>The <strong>Reversal/Inconsistency Test</strong>:</p><p><strong>If the logic seems to lead to taking action X, and seems to equally validly lead to taking an action inconsistent with X, then I treat it as a Pascal's Mugging.</strong></p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Original Pascal's Mugging:</strong><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/pascal.pdf\">original Pascal's Mugging</a> suggests you should give the mugger your 10 livres in the hope that you get the promised 10 quadrillion Utils.</li><li><strong>The test:</strong> It seems equally valid that there's an \"anti-mugger\" out there who is thinking \"if Pascal <i>refuses</i> to give the mugger the 10 livres, then I will grant him 100 quadrillion Utils\". There is no reason to privilege the mugger who is talking to you, and ignore the anti-mugger whom you can't see.</li><li><strong>Conclusion: fails the Reversal/Inconsistency Test, so treat as a Pascal's Mugging and ignore.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Extremely unlikely s-risk example:</strong><ul><li>I claim that the fart goblins of Smiggledorf will appear in the winter solstice of the year 2027, and magically keep everyone alive for 1 googleplex years, but subject them to constant suffering by having to smell the worst farts you've ever imagined. The smells are so bad that the suffering that each person experiences in one minute is equivalent to 1 million lifetimes of suffering.</li><li>The only way to avoid this horrific outcome is to earn as much money as you can, and donate 90% of your income to a very nice guy with the EA Forum username \"sanjay\".</li><li><strong>The test: </strong>Is there any reason to believe that donating all this money will make the fart goblins <i>less</i> likely to appear, as opposed to <i>more</i>?</li><li><strong>Conclusion: fails the Reversal/Inconsistency Test, so treat as a Pascal's Mugging and ignore.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Extremely </strong><i><strong>likely</strong></i><strong> x-risk example:&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>In the distant land of Utopi-doogle, everyone has a wonderful, beautiful life, except for one lady called Cassie who runs around anxiously making predictions. Her first prediction is incredibly specific and falsifiable, and turns out to be correct. Same for her second, and her third, and after 100 highly specific, falsifiable and incredibly varied predictions, with a 100% success rate, she then predicts that Utopi-doogle will likely explode killing everyone.</li><li>The only way to save Utopi-doogle is for every able-bodied adult to stamp their foot while saying Abracadabra. Unfortunately, you have to get the correct foot -- if some people are stamping their right foot and some are stamping their left foot, it won't work. If everyone is stamping their left foot, this will <i>either</i> mean that Utopi-doogle is saved, or that Utopi-doogle will be instantly destroyed.</li><li>A politician sets up a Left Foot movement arguing that we should try to save Utopi-doogle by arranging a simultaneous left foot stamp.</li><li><strong>The test: </strong>The simultaneous left foot stamp has equal chance of causing doom as of saving civilisation.</li><li><strong>Conclusion: fails the Reversal/Inconsistency Test, so treat the politician's suggestion as a Pascal's Mugging and ignore.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Note, interestingly, that other actions -- such as further research -- are not necessarily a Pascal's Mugging.

I'm drawing an analogy that I think informs us about how science works, at least from what I understand from the history of science. It also seems to resonate with the reflections of current alignment researchers, for example, see Richard's post </i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GkXKvkLAcTm5ackCq/intuitions-about-solving-hard-problems\"><i>Intuitions about solving hard problems</i></a><i>.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine that you ask a professional baseball player, let's call him Tom, how does he catch a fly ball? &nbsp;He takes a moment to respond realizing he's never reflected on this question before and ends up staring at you, not knowing how or what is there exactly to explain. He says he's never thought about it. Now imagine that you ask his baseball coach what's the best way to catch the ball. The coach has a whole theory about it. In fact, he insists that Tom and everyone on the team should follow one specific technique he thinks it's optimal. Tom and the rest of the team go ahead and do what the coach said (because they don't want to get yelled at even though they've been doing fine so far). &nbsp;And lo and behold the team misses the ball more often than before.&nbsp;</p><p>What could have gone wrong?</p><p>Richard Dawkins, in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Popular-Science/dp/0192860925\">The Selfish Gene</a>, gives the following explanation:</p><blockquote><p>When a man throws a ball high in the air and catches it again, he<br>behaves as if he had solved a set of differential equations in predicting<br>the trajectory of the ball. He may neither know nor care what a<br>differential equation is, but this does not affect his skill with the ball. At<br>some subconscious level, something functionally equivalent to the<br>mathematical calculations is going on.</p></blockquote><p>So here's the analogy I want to argue for: when you do science, by which I mean, when you set up your scientific agenda and organize your research, construct your theoretic apparatus, design experiments, interpret results, and so on, you behave as if you had solved a set of differential equations predicting the trajectory of your research. You may neither know nor care what this process is, but this does not affect your skill with the setup of your project. At some subconscious level, something functionally equivalent to the mathematical calculations is going on. (Be careful, I obviously don't mean the calculations that are explicitly part of solving the problem).</p><p>Well, I just paraphrased Dawkins' passage to make a point and that is that what we mean by \"gut feelings\" or \"intuitions\" is not magic, but rather a cognitive mechanism. This applies to a variety of tasks from baseball to thinking about agent foundations. It's a cognitive procedure that might even be ultimately explained in mathematical terms about how the brain works.&nbsp;</p><p>Up until this point, it looks like I draw this analogy with the practice of science in general in mind. It's worth trying to see what the analogy could suggest for alignment research, granting that<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DCtqgsywCRakLvHn6/alignment-s-phlogiston\"> it's still at a pre-paradigmatic stage</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>My analogy predicts that one or multiple insights about solving the alignment problem will come the way the experienced baseball player hits the ball before following his coach's instructions: as a natural movement in virtue of his gut feelings. And it will be a successful movement. Sure, that requires unpacking, but I think Gigerenzer offers a satisfactory account in his book.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref06xobzs52i5w\"><sup><a href=\"#fn06xobzs52i5w\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Meanwhile, in the contemporary study of the history of science (especially <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_philosophy_of_science\">HPS</a> approaches), we talk about myths in science and then have arguments that debunk them. One of the most famous myths, widespread in popular culture is that an apple hit Newton's head which inspired him to formulate the law of universal gravitation.&nbsp;</p><p>While this episode is primarily a cute myth about scientific discovery robustly incorporated into the historiographical package of the hero-scientist ideal, it reveals a truth about how scientists think, or at least, what we have noticed and prima facie believe about how they think. It encapsulates this sense of not being able to explain exactly how you got your insight as a scientist, just like the baseball player is clueless about what makes him catch the ball so perfectly. So, if this myth is meant to be treated as a metaphor then it tells us that the a-ha moment (also known as the \"eureka effect\") in scientific research, might come when you least expect it; a falling apple might just trigger it.&nbsp;</p><p>The scientist might try to rationalize the process in hindsight, trace back the steps in his reasoning and find clever ways to explain how he got to his insight.

These areas are complex and unlike many fields EA operates in, are often short of good public-facing explanations, which may make them hard for outside researchers, such as those from EA organizations, to understand in short order. This raises the possibility of getting basic, uncontroversial details wrong, which can both render analyses inaccurate and ruin the credibility of EA with experts in the field.</p><p>A bit of background: I've been fascinated by the defense world for over 20 years, and have spent the last 5 working for a major defense contractor. I write a blog, mostly covering naval history, at navalgazing.net, and it was this work which brought me into contact with what appears to be <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk\">the most in-depth evaluation of nuclear war risks by EA</a>, work conducted by Luisa Rodriguez for Rethink Priorities.</p><p>Unfortunately, while this was a credible effort to assess the risks of nuclear war, &nbsp;unfamiliarity with the field meant that a number of errors crept in, ranging from the trivial to the serious. The most obvious are in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dtQ5hpYjniYKWhmhx/would-us-and-russian-nuclear-forces-survive-a-first-strike \">the analysis of the survivability of the US and Russian nuclear arsenals</a>.</p><p>For instance, when discussing the sea-based deterrent, the article states that \"[America's] submarines\u2019 surfaces are covered in plastic, which disperses radar signals instead of reflecting them.\" This is clearly a reference to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_tile\">anechoic tiles</a> used on modern submarines, but these are intended to protect from sonar, not radar. This probably traces to the source used, an article that was confusingly written by someone who clearly doesn't know all that much about submarine design and ASW sensors, but it is exactly the sort of error which flags an article as being written by someone who doesn't really know what they're talking about.</p><p>But that's merely a nitpick, and there's also a very basic flaw with the assumption that nearly all of the warheads aboard SSBNs will survive. While I completely agree that any submarine at sea is nearly invulnerable (and am in fact rather more skeptical than some of the sources that improved technology will render the seas transparent) a substantial fraction of the SSBN force is in port, not at sea. The US attempts to minimize this by <a href=\"https://www.navalgazing.net/NWAS-Polaris-Part-4\">providing each submarine with two crews and swapping them out</a>, but even with this, each operational submarine still spend about a third of its time in port between patrols. (It will spend more time in overhauls, but sending ships to the yard with missiles aboard is considered bad form, so those warheads probably won't count against the US total.) How these would fare in a war would depend heavily on the situation leading up to the outbreak of war. If Russia launched a surprise attack, the bases at Bremerton and Kings Bay would undoubtedly be the highest-priority targets. If there had been substantial warning, then most would likely have been ordered to sea to strengthen the US deterrent.</p><p>The description of the strategic bomber force bears little connection to the reality of said force and contains even more jarring errors, such as describing the bombers as \"air-based\". The second paragraph begins with the following statement: \"While many strategic bombers are concentrated at air bases and aircraft carriers, making them potentially convenient to target, early warning systems would likely give US pilots enough time to take off before the nuclear warheads arrived at their targets and detonated.\"</p><p>Every part of this sentence is wrong. While the US Navy did operate <a href=\"https://www.navalgazing.net/Nuclear-Weapons-at-Sea-Heavy-Attack\">aircraft that were at least arguably strategic bombers</a>, they were retired from this role in the mid-60s. Nuclear strike with lighter aircraft remained a major carrier role for the rest of the Cold War, all shipboard nuclear weapons except the SLBMs were withdrawn in the early 90s. Whether or not they have nuclear weapons onboard, <a href=\"https://www.navalgazing.net/Carrier-Doom-Part-1\">aircraft carriers are exceedingly inconvenient to target</a>. And there is little prospect of any strategic bombers getting off the ground if they are caught unaware. During the Cold War, <a href=\"https://www.alternatewars.com/WW3/WW3_Documents/USAF/SAC_Alert_Summary/SAC_Alert_Program_Brief.htm\">Strategic Air Command did keep aircraft on emergency alert</a>, capable of scrambling and getting out of range in the interval between detecting incoming ICBMs and the missiles reaching the base. But this was never more than a minority of the bomber force, and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/president-bush-ends-b-52-alert-sept-27-1991-228549\">the practice ended with the fall of the Soviet Union</a>. Even more strongly than the SSBN force, the survivability of the bomber force will depend heavily on how much warning is available. At a minimum, it is likely to take an hour or more to load the weapons and brief the crew, a serious problem when a nuclear warhead will reach the base in 15 minutes.</p><p>A similar lack of understanding comes out in the discussion of the bombers themselves. The US has a mix of <a href=\"http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104482/b-2-spirit/\">B-2s</a> equipped with gravity bombs and <a href=\"http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104465/b-52h-stratofortress/\">B-52s</a> equipped with <a href=\"https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104612/agm-86bcd-missiles/\">cruise missiles</a>, but the B-52s are completely ignored, and the discussion of stealth technology doesn't make much sense. The discussion of ICBMs is somewhat better, and while I disagree with the pessimism on missile defense, the position taken by the author is at least colorable.</p><p>Similar problems plague the section on Russia, although lack of information and my being less familiar with their setup make them harder to analyze. Particularly notable is citing a 2001 report on Russian submarine readiness, as that marks the nadir of funding for Russian strategic forces. After Putin came to power, more funding flowed to Russia's nuclear forces, and while poor readiness due to corruption certainly cannot be ruled out, it's also far from certain that this is the case.</p><p>The other articles written for the Rethink Priorities series on nuclear war have fewer basic errors, probably because they are on subjects that are slightly less opaque and reliant on domain knowledge. I would argue that <a href=\"https://www.navalgazing.net/Nuclear-Winter\">the risk of nuclear winter is substantially overstated </a>thanks to reliance on papers that have a number of obvious flaws, and which John Schilling and I had <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/11/ot47-openai/#comment-344892\">critiqued on the EA-adjacent SSC in 2016</a>. Guarding against that sort of problem is a separate issue, and a rather more difficult one than I can address here.</p><p>The basic lesson of all this is the importance of domain knowledge in both understanding and analyzing a problem, and in making sure that those who deal with that problem professionally will take you seriously. &nbsp;Obviously, in the fields EA has the most involvement in, this is unlikely to be an issue, but it could recur as EA looks into new issues, and should be guarded against by trying to find and work with people who are familiar with the domain.</p>", "user": {"username": "bean"}}, {"_id": "oRzfcks6nSHgiXeoW", "title": "Working on global priorities and outreach in China", "postedAt": "2022-08-28T04:59:51.864Z", "htmlBody": "<p>An 80,000 Hours <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/china-specialist/\"><u>career guide</u></a> written in 2018 discussed a long-term need for many more people in the effective altruism community with knowledge of China.

to those of the most successful previous contributors; increased engagement with adjacent academic fields and debates; the creation of specialized journals, conferences, and research institutions; and

years?</h2><ul><li><strong>Certain contributors may have inspired others to publish on the topic.</strong></li></ul><p>The \u201cResults\u201d section above identifies a handful of initial authors who seem to have played a key role in sparking discussion relevant to AI rights in each new stream of research, such as Floridi for information ethics, Bostrom for transhumanism, effective altruism, and longtermism, and Gunkel and Coeckelbergh for social-relational ethics. Perhaps, then, some of the subsequent contributors who cited these authors were encouraged to address the topic because those writings sparked their interest in AI rights, or the publication of those items reassured them that it was possible (and sufficiently academically respectable) to publish about it.</p><p>This seems especially plausible given that the beginnings of exponential growth some time between the late \u201890s and mid-\u201900s (Figure 1) coincides reasonably well with the first treatments of the topic by several streams of research (Figure 2). This hypothesis could be tested further through interviews with later contributors who cited those pioneering works. Of course, even if correct, this hypothetical answer to our question would then beg another question: why did those pioneering authors themselves begin to address the moral consideration of artificial entities? Again, interviews (this time with the pioneering authors) may be helpful for further exploration.<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The gradual, accumulating ubiquity of AI and robotic technology may have encouraged increased academic interest.</strong></li></ul><p>A common theme in the introductions of and justifications for relevant publications is that the number, technological sophistication, and social integration of robots, AIs, computers, and other artificial entities is increasing (e.g. Lehman-Wilzig, 1981; Willick, 1983; Hall, 2000; Bartneck et al., 2005b). Some of these contributors and others (e.g. Freitas, 1985; McNally &amp; Inayatullah, 1988; Bostrom, 2014) have been motivated by predictions about further developments in these trends. We might therefore hypothesize that academic interest in the topic has been stimulated by ongoing developments in the underlying technology.</p><p>Indeed, bursts of technical publications on AI in the 1950s and \u201860s, artificial life in the \u201890s, and synthetic biology in the \u201800s seem to have sparked ethical discussions, where some of the contributors seem to have been largely unaware of previous, adjacent ethical discussions.</p><p>Additionally, the \u201cResults\u201d section above details how several new streams of relevant research from the 1980s onwards seem to have arisen independently of one another, such as Floridi\u2019s information ethics and the early transhumanist writers not citing each other or citing the previous research on legal rights for artificial entities. Even <i>within </i>the categories of research there was sometimes little interaction, such as the absence of cross-citation amongst the earliest contributors to discussion on each of legal rights for artificial entities, HCI and HRI (where relevant to AI rights), and social-relational ethics. If these different publications addressing similar topics did indeed arise independently of one another, it suggests that there were one or more underlying factors encouraging academic interest in the topic. The development and spread of relevant technologies is a plausible candidate for being such an underlying factor.</p><p>However, the timing of the beginnings of exponential growth in publications on the moral consideration of artificial entities \u2014 seemingly from around the beginning of the 21st century (Figure 1) \u2014 does not match up very well to the timing and shape of technological progress. For example, there seems to have only been linear growth in industrial robot installations and AI job postings in the \u201810s (Zhang et al., 2021), whereas exponential growth in computing power began decades earlier, in the 20th century (Roser &amp; Ritchie, 2013). This suggests that while this factor may well have contributed to the growth of research on AI rights and other moral consideration of artificial entities, it cannot single-handedly explain it.<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Relevant news events may have encouraged increased academic interest.</strong></li></ul><p>As noted in the \u201cSynthesis and proliferation\u201d subsection above, there have been a number of news events in the 21st century relevant to AI rights, and these have sometimes been mentioned by academic contributors to discussion on this topic. However, only a relatively small proportion of recent publications explicitly mention these events (Table 14). Additionally, the first relevant news event mentioned by multiple different publications was in 2006, whereas the exponential growth in publications seems to have begun prior to that (Figure 1). A particular news story also seems intuitively more likely to encourage a spike in publications than the start of an exponential growth trend.<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The growth in research on this topic reflects wider trends in academic research.</strong></li></ul><p>If the growth in academic publications in general \u2014 i.e. across any and all topics \u2014 has a similar timing and shape to the growth in interest in AI rights and other moral consideration of artificial entities, then we need not seek explanations for growth that are unique to this specific topic. There is some evidence that this is indeed the case; Fire and Guestrin\u2019s (2019) analysis of the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset identified exponential growth in the number of published academic papers throughout the 20th and early 21st century, and Ware and Mabe (2015) identified exponential growth in the numbers of researchers, journals, and journal articles, although their methodology for assessing the number of articles is unclear.</p><p>At a more granular level, however, the prevalence of certain topics can presumably deviate from wider trends in publishing. For example, Zhang et al. (2021) report \u201cthe number of peer-reviewed AI publications, 2000-19\u201d; the growth appears to have been exponential in the \u201810s, but not the \u201800s. There was a similar pattern in the \u201cnumber of paper titles mentioning ethics keywords at AI conferences, 2000-19.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>So it was not inevitable that the number of relevant publications would increase exponentially as soon as some of the earliest contributors had touched on the topic of the moral consideration of artificial entities. But science fiction, artificial life and consciousness, environmental ethics, and animal ethics all had some indirect implications for the moral consideration of artificial entities, even if they were not always stated explicitly. So it seems unsurprising that, in the context of exponential growth of academic publications, at least some scholars would begin to explore these implications more thoroughly and formally. Indeed, even though several of the new streams of relevant research from the 1980s onwards seem to have arisen largely independently of each other, they often owed something to one or more of these earlier, adjacent topics.</p><h2>Which levers can be pulled on to further increase interest in this topic?</h2><ul><li><strong>Adopt publication strategies similar to those of the most successful previous contributors, focusing either on integration into other topics or on persistently revisiting AI rights.</strong></li></ul><p>There seem to be two separate models for how the most notable and widely cited contributors to AI rights research have achieved influence.</p><p>Some, like Nick Bostrom, Mel Slater (and co-authors), and Lawrence Solum have published relatively few items specifically on this topic, but where they have done so, they have integrated the research into debates or topics of interest to a broader audience. They\u2019ve mostly picked up citations for those other reasons and topics, rather than their discussion of the moral consideration of artificial entities. They\u2019ve also tended to have strong academic credentials or publication track record relevant to those other topics, which may be a necessary condition for success in pursuing this model of achieving influence.</p><p>Others, like David Gunkel and Luciano Floridi, published directly on this topic numerous times, continuing to build upon and revisit it. Many of their individual contributions attracted limited attention in the first few years after publication, but through persistent revisiting of the topic (and the passage of time) these authors have nonetheless accumulated impressive numbers of citations across their various publications relevant to AI rights. These authors continue to pursue other academic interests, however, and a substantial fraction of the interest in these authors (Floridi more so than Gunkel) seems to focus on how their work touches on other topics and questions, rather than its direct implications for the moral consideration of artificial entities.</p><p>Of course, these two models of paths to influence are simplifications. Some influential contributors, like Christoper Bartneck and Mark Coeckelbergh, fall in between these two extremes. There may be other publication strategies that could be even more successful, and it is possible that someone could adopt one of these strategies and still not achieve much influence. Nevertheless, new contributors could take inspiration from these two pathways to achieving academic influence \u2014 which seem to have been quite successful in at least some cases \u2014 when seeking to maximize the impact of their own research.<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Engage with adjacent academic fields and debates.</strong></li></ul><p>As noted above, a number of contributors have accrued citations from papers that addressed but did not focus solely on the moral consideration of artificial entities. Early contributions that addressed the moral consideration of artificial entities more directly without reference to other debates often languished in relative obscurity, at least for many years (e.g. Lehman-Wilzig, 1981; Willick, 1983; Freitas, 1985; McNally &amp; Inayatullah, 1988). This suggests that engaging with adjacent academic fields and debates may be helpful for contributors to be able to increase the impact of their research relevant to AI rights. Relatedly, there is reason to believe that Fields\u2019 first exposure to academic discussion relevant to AI rights may have been at an AI conference, perhaps encouraging them to write their 1987 article.</p><p>Although it seems coherent to distinguish between moral patiency and moral agency (e.g. Floridi, 1999; Gray et al., 2007; Gunkel, 2012), many successful publications have discussed both areas. For instance, much of the relevant literature in transhumanism, effective altruism, and longtermism has focused on threats posed to humans by intelligent artificial agents but has included some brief discussion of artificial entities as moral patients. Many writings address legal rights for artificial entities in tandem with discussion of those entities\u2019 legal responsibilities to humans or each other. Before Gunkel (2018) wrote <i>Robot Rights</i>, he wrote (2012) <i>The Machine Question </i>with roughly equal weight to questions of moral agency and moral patiency. Even Floridi, who has often referred to information ethics as a \u201cpatient-oriented\u201d ethics, has been cited numerous times by contributors interested in AI rights for his 2004 article co-authored with Jeff Sanders \u201cOn the Morality of Artificial Agents\u201d; 32 of the items in Harris and Anthis\u2019 (2021) systematic searches (12.1%) have cited that article. Indeed, for some ethical frameworks, there is little meaningful distinction between agency and patiency. Similarly, some arguments both for (e.g. Levy, 2009) and against (e.g. Bryson, 2010) the moral consideration of artificial entities seem to be motivated by concern for indirect effects on human society. So contributors may be able to tie AI rights issues back to human concerns, discuss both the moral patiency and moral agency of artificial entities, or discuss both legal rights and legal responsibilities; doing so may increase the reach of their publications.</p><p>Artificial consciousness, environmental ethics, and animal ethics all had potentially important ramifications for the moral consideration of artificial entities. These implications were remarked upon at the time, including by some of the key thinkers who developed these ideas, but the discussion was often brief. Later, machine ethics and roboethics had great potential for including discussion relevant to AI rights, but some of the early contributors seem to have decided to mostly set aside such discussion. It seems plausible that if some academics had been willing to address these implications more thoroughly, AI rights research might have picked up pace much earlier than it did. There may be field-building potential from monitoring the emergence and development of new, adjacent academic fields and reaching out to their contributors to encourage discussion of the moral consideration of artificial entities.</p><p>As well as providing opportunities to advertise publications relevant to AI rights, engagement with adjacent fields and debates provides opportunities for inspiration and feedback. Floridi (2013) and Gunkel (2018) acknowledge discussion at conferences that had no explicit focus on AI rights as having been influential in shaping the development of their books. Additionally, several authors first presented initial drafts of their earliest relevant papers at such conferences (e.g. Putnam, 1960; Lehman-Wilzig, 1981; Floridi, 1999).<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Create specialized resources for research on AI rights and other moral consideration of artificial entities, such as journals, conferences, and research institutions.</strong></li></ul><p>While the above points attest to the usefulness of engagement with adjacent fields and debates (e.g. by attending conferences, citing relevant publications), in order to grow further, it seems likely that AI rights research also needs access to its own specialized \u201corganizational resources\u201d (Frickel &amp; Gross, 2005) such as research institutions, university departments, journals, and conferences (Muehlhauser, 2017; Animal Ethics, 2021). With a few exceptions (e.g. <i>The Machine Question: AI, Ethics and Moral Responsibility </i>symposium at the AISB / IACAP 2012 World Congress; Gunkel et al., 2012), the history of AI rights research reveals a striking lack of such specialized resources, events, and institutions. Indeed, it is only recently that whole books dedicated solely to the topic have emerged (Gunkel, 2018; Gellers, 2020; Gordon, 2020).</p><p>The creation of such specialized resources could also help to guard against the possibility that, as they intentionally engage with adjacent academic fields and debates, researchers drift away from their exploration of the moral consideration of artificial entities.<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Explore legal rights for artificial entities.</strong></li></ul><p>Detailed discussion of the legal rights of artificial entities was arguably the first area of academic enquiry to focus in much depth on the moral consideration of artificial entities. Articles that touch on the moral consideration of artificial entities from a legal perspective seem to more frequently accrue a substantial number of citations (e.g. Lehman-Wilzig, 1981; McNally &amp; Inayatullah, 1988; Solum, 1992; Karnow, 1994; Allen &amp; Widdison, 1996; Chopra &amp; White, 2004; Calverley, 2008). Additionally, in recent years, there have been a number of news stories related to legal rights of artificial entities (Harris, 2021). This could be due to differences in the referencing norms between different academic fields, but otherwise weakly suggests that exploration of legal topics is more likely to attract interest and have immediate relevance to public policy than more abstract philosophical or psychological topics.</p><h1>Limitations</h1><p>This report has relied extensively on inferences about authors\u2019 intellectual influences based on explicit mentions and citations in their published works. These inferences may be incorrect, since there are a number of factors that may affect how an author portrays their influences.</p><p>For example, in order to increase the chances that their manuscript is accepted for publication by a journal or cited by other researchers, an author may make guesses about what others would consider to be most appealing and compelling, then discuss some ideas more or less extensively than they would like to. Scholars are somewhat incentivized to present their works as novel contributions, and so not to cite works with a substantial amount of overlap. Authors might also accidentally omit mention of previous publications or ideas that have influenced their own thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few instances where a likely connection between authors has not been mentioned, although we cannot know in any individual case why not. One example is the works of Mark Coeckelbergh and Johnny Hartz S\u00f8raker, who were both advancing novel \u201crelational\u201d perspectives on the moral consideration of artificial entities while in the department of philosophy at the University of Twente, but who do not cite or acknowledge each other\u2019s work. Another is how Nick Bostrom gained attention for the ideas that suggest our world is likely a simulation, but a similar point had been made earlier by fellow transhumanist Hans Moravec.</p><p>These examples suggest that the absence of mentions of particular publications does not prove that the author was not influenced by those publications. But there are also some reasons why the opposite may be true at times; that an author might mention publications that had barely influenced their own thinking.</p><p>For example, they may be incentivized to cite foundational works in their field or works on adjacent, partly overlapping topics, in order to reassure publishers that there will be interest in their research. Alternatively, someone might come up with an idea relatively independently, but then conduct an initial literature review in order to contextualize their ideas; citing the publications that they identify would falsely convey the impression that their thinking had been influenced by those publications.</p><p>Since the relevance of identified publications was sometimes filtered by the title alone, it is likely that I have missed publications that contained relevant discussion but did not advertise this clearly in the title. Additionally, citations of included publications were often identified using the \u201cCited by\u2026\u201d tool on Google Scholar, but this tool seems to be imperfect, sometimes omitting items that I know to have cited the publication being reviewed.</p><p>This report initially used Harris and Anthis\u2019 (2021) literature review as its basis, which relied on systematic searches using keywords in English language. This has likely led to a vast underrepresentation of relevant content published in other languages. There is likely at least some work written in German, Italian, and other European languages. For example, Gunkel (2018) discussed some German-language publications that I did not see referenced in any other works (e.g. Schweighofer, 2001).</p><p>This language restriction has likely also led to a substantial neglect of relevant writings by Asian scholars. For Western scholars exploring the moral consideration of artificial entities, Asian religions and philosophies have variously been the focus of their research (e.g. Robertson, 2014), an influence on their own ethical perspectives (e.g. McNally &amp; Inayatullah, 1988), a chance discovery, or an afterthought, if they are mentioned at all. However, very few items have been identified in this report that were written by Asian scholars themselves, and there may well be many more relevant publications.</p><p>This report has not sought to explore in depth the longer-term intellectual origins for academic discussion of the moral consideration of artificial entities, such as the precedents provided by various moral philosophies developed during the Enlightenment.</p><p>As I have discussed at length elsewhere (Harris, 2019), assessing causation from historical evidence is difficult; \u201cwe should not place too much weight on hypothesized historical cause and effect relationships in general,\u201d or on \u201cthe strategic knowledge gained from any individual historical case study.\u201d The commentary in the discussion section should therefore be treated as one interpretation of the identified evidence, rather than as established fact.</p><p>The keyword searches are limited to the items included from Harris and Anthis\u2019 (2021) systematic searches. Those searches did not include all research papers with relevance to the topic. For example, the thematic discussion in this report includes a number of publications that could arguably have merited inclusion in that review, if they had been identified by the systematic searches.</p><p>The items identified in each keyword search were not manually checked to ensure that they did indeed refer to the keyword in the manner that was assumed. For example, the search for \u201cenvironment\u201d may have picked up mentions of that word that have nothing to do with environmental ethics (e.g. how a robot interacts with its \u201cenvironment\u201d) or just because they were published in \u2014 or cited another item that was published in \u2014 a journal with \u201cenvironment\u201d in its title.</p><p>Similarly, where multiple authors who might have been cited in the included publications share a surname (as is the case for at least the surnames Singer, Friedman, and Anderson), then the keyword searches might overrepresent the number of citations of that author. In contrast, if an author has a name that is sometimes misspelled by others (e.g. Putnam, Freitas, Lehman-Wilzig), then the searches might underrepresent the number of citations of them.</p><h1>Potential items for further study</h1><p>What is the history of AI rights research that is written in languages other than English? This report predominantly only included publications written in English, so relevant research in other languages may have been accidentally excluded.</p><p>Given the difficulty in assessing causation through historical evidence and in making inferences about authors\u2019 intellectual influences based solely on explicit mentions in their published works, it would be helpful to supplement this report with interviews of researchers and other stakeholders.</p><p>Previous studies and theoretical papers have identified certain features as potentially important for the emergence of \u201cscientific/intellectual movements\u201d (e.g. Frickel &amp; Gross, 2005; Animal Ethics, 2021). A literature review of such contributions could be used to generate a list of potentially important features. The history of AI rights research could then be assessed against this list: which features appear to be present and which missing?</p><p>Histories of other research fields could be useful for better understanding which levers can be pulled on to further increase interest in AI rights.

Once a year, we\u2019d run a benchmark or suite of benchmarks against the most generally intelligent AI systems available to us at the time, seeking to assess their generality and the overall shape of their capabilities. We would publicize the event widely among the AI research, policy, and forecasting communities.</p><h3>Why?</h3><p>We think this might be a good idea for several reasons:</p><ul><li>The event could provide a convening ground for the AI research community, helping it to arrive at a shared understanding of the current state of AGI research, and acting as a focal point for rational discussion on the future of AGI.</li><li>An annual benchmarking event has advantages over static, run-any-time benchmarks when it comes to testing generality. Unless one constrains the training data and restricts the hard-coded knowledge used by systems under evaluation, developers may directly optimize for a static benchmark while building their systems, which makes static benchmarks less useful as measures of generality. With the annual format, we are free to change the tasks every year without informing developers of what they will be beforehand, thereby assessing what Fran\u00e7ois Chollet terms <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547\"><i>developer-aware generalization</i></a>.</li><li>Frequent feedback improves performance in almost any domain; this event could provide a target for AGI forecasting that yields yearly feedback, allowing us to iterate on our approaches and hone our understanding of how to forecast the development of AGI.</li><li>The capabilities of an AGI will not be completely boundless, so it\u2019s interesting to ask what its strengths and limitations are likely to be. If designed properly, our benchmarks could give us clues as to what the \u201cshape\u201d of AGI capabilities may turn out to be.</li></ul><h3>How?</h3><p>We're currently working on a plan, and are soliciting ideas and feedback from the community here. To guide the discussion, here are some properties we think the ideal benchmark should have. It would:</p><ul><li>Engage a broad, diverse set of AI researchers, and act as a focal point for rational, forecasting-based discussion on the future of AGI.</li><li>Measure the generality and adaptability of intelligent systems, not just their performance on a fixed, known-beforehand set of tasks.</li><li>Form the basis for AGI forecasting questions with a one-year lifetime.</li><li>Generate predictive signal as to the types of capabilities that an AGI system is likely to possess.</li><li>Provide a quantitative measure of generality, ranking more general systems above less general ones, rather than giving a binary \u201cgeneral or not\u201d outcome.</li><li>Be sensitive to differences in generality even among the weakly general systems available today.</li></ul><p>Once we\u2019ve collected the strongest ideas and developed them into a cohesive whole, we will solicit feedback from the AI research community before publishing the final plan.

This year, there\u2019s been a notable and exciting increase in energy around outreach to new people who might be interested in EA.&nbsp; And lots of organizations are on the lookout for talented people to fill open roles (e.g. there have been ~2300 roles listed on the 80,000 Hours job board so far in 2022).&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, Katie spoke to ~20 people working on various EA projects to get a better sense of the current EA community talent and recruitment landscape. Here\u2019s what we observed across the community:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Individual organizations trying to hire people. </strong>This looks like in-house recruiters and hiring managers recruiting for their own orgs (via e.g. asking other organizations for referrals, scanning public lists for potential talent and conducting cold outreach). This also looks like open roles being publicly advertised in the hopes that the right people will proactively apply (see <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/job-board/\"><u>80K\u2019s Jobs Board</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.eawork.club/\"><u>EA Work Club</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-newsletter-archives\"><u>EA Newsletter</u></a>\u2019s \u2018applications due soon\u2019 section, the EA Forum\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DXcg6N6CGvRA2vrCk/who-s-hiring-may-september-2022\"><u>Who\u2019s hiring?</u></a> thread, EA group newsletters, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1062957250383195\"><u>Effective Altruism Job Postings</u></a> on Facebook, Tom Wein\u2019s <a href=\"https://effectivealtruism.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=52b028e7f799cca137ef74763&amp;id=ac3372d76c&amp;e=b3ab63d26f\"><u>list of social purpose job boards</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Candidates publicly listing themselves in the hopes of being hired. </strong>See the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/swcBj4rBC4HvwmwfD/who-wants-to-be-hired-summer-2022\"><u>EA Forum\u2019s Who wants to be hired?</u></a> thread, <a href=\"https://pineappleoperations.org/hiring-a-pa\"><u>Pineapple Operations\u2019 PA directory</u></a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rMuoqhoer8ThuGmGF/fill-out-this-census-of-everyone-who-could-ever-see\"><u>80K\u2019s longtermist census</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Some candidate-focused matchmaking efforts. </strong>E.g. <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/\"><u>80K\u2019s career coaching</u></a> program might include introductions to orgs that are hiring, and some EA groups have career coaches who mostly advise on making career plans but can nudge specific folk to apply to particular roles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A number of organizations and affinity groups maintain CRMs and help direct people towards roles as one of their activities. </strong>Many EA groups and community-building orgs do some recruitment (e.g. managing their own CRMs, responding to various organizations\u2019 requests for referrals for individual roles and \u2018signposting\u2019 people towards relevant opportunities).

Instead, talent bottlenecks within problem areas tend to be identified in a kind of organic, ad-hoc way (see \u2018EA needs more x!\u2019 forum posts which create a burst of interest in a particular career path). By the time attention gets paid to the talent bottleneck, it\u2019s a live concern that is holding organizations back from making progress on their goals, and people are scrambling to address them.&nbsp;</p><p>Developing relevant skills takes time; possibly years or decades. When it comes to responding to evolving talent needs in a small community of young people, more of a heads up would be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>We think it might be helpful to have a person or group of people with a primary focus and responsibility to conduct research on EA talent gaps. i.e.:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Talk to EA leaders to forecast how problem areas might develop over the next 2-5 years (i.e. volume of new organizations that might be launched, funding supply, areas of growth, etc.)</li><li>Run a survey with existing orgs to assess bottlenecks and forecast demand</li><li>Figure out how to model expected supply of talent (e.g. by surveying community members about their needs and current + future plans, conducting \u2018talent mapping\u2019 type activities to calibrate on the quality of talent etc.)</li><li>Communicate these insights to the community so that other EA groups and organizations working on community-building, recruitment and training can benefit.</li></ul><p>In previous years, CEA and 80K have surveyed EA orgs on their talent needs, but (according to representatives of these organizations we spoke to) it\u2019s not currently a priority for either. This year Training for Good explored taking up this mantle and are currently looking for someone to drive it forward.</p><p>We\u2019re uncertain how tractable it is to conduct this kind of high-level research for the EA community as a whole versus prioritizing and focusing on a limited number of specific problem areas (or conducting such research on the level of each cause area), but we\u2019d be curious to see further investigation.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Coordination between hiring organizations&nbsp;</h3><p>We\u2019re not sure what the optimal level of coordination between hiring organizations in the EA community is, but we suspect it\u2019s more than exists today. Increased coordination (e.g. an organization focused on headhunting across cause areas, or a cluster of cause-specific headhunters who are set up to coordinate with one another) could reduce duplication of effort and save candidates/recruiters time and energy. Below we outline some pain points that stem from today\u2019s low levels of coordination and how they might be improved by having more centralized hiring services in the community (and then we talk about some potential projects and risks).&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>1. Candidate time and frustration with applying and reapplying to many EA organizations. </strong>Some people in the community have reported frustration with repeatedly applying to many related organizations (many of which have unusually time-intensive application processes, involving multiple rounds of work tests), not feeling calibrated about what their odds are of being hired at any one of them and sometimes not receiving much feedback (see discussion <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Khon9Bhmad7v4dNKe/the-cost-of-rejection\"><u>here</u></a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really\"><u>here</u></a>). Hiring organizations, on the other hand, are often capacity strapped and may struggle to provide candidates services such as in-depth feedback or matchmaking to other roles.<ul><li><strong>How more coordination could help:&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>An EA \u201chiring agency\u201d (similar to traditional staffing agencies) that worked with organizations across the community could ease some of these pain points by more proactively working to match candidates with roles. By working with the same set of organizations over time, they would learn a lot about their hiring standards and preferences and help job-seekers narrow their list and identify the roles and organizations that are most likely to be a good fit for them. Since they would be working on behalf of the candidate as well as the organization, they could do more to provide them with some feedback and coaching throughout the process (and take the labor and legal risk of conveying feedback on performance back to candidates off the hiring organizations).</li><li>An organization could run a centralized \u201ccommon app\u201d and provide at least basic data with a bunch of organizations, who could then decide who to reach out to.</li><li>An even more maximally scoped organization could take some of the work of candidate vetting (e.g. interviews or work test administration) off hiring organizations for roles that tend to vary less across organizations (e.g. operations roles), thereby dramatically reducing e.g. the number of applications and work tests individual candidates needed to participate in.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>2. Information sharing about strong candidates between organizations tends to be ad hoc and inefficient. </strong>Currently organizations mainly contact each other one by one to request referrals from past open rounds (in Anya\u2019s experience the OP recruitment team gets ~5+ requests for referrals from other organizations per month, and often sends just as many). This creates many nodes and points of contact to keep track of; each request is time-consuming to respond to, and many fall by the wayside in favor of more urgent work. This ad hoc approach also creates privacy concerns around candidate data and makes it harder to establish a principled set of norms when sharing candidate information between organizations.<ul><li><strong>How more coordination could help: </strong>It would streamline the process considerably if recruiters could feed information about strong candidates back to a single organization or working group (and then ask that same organization/group for recommendations when they have an open role, trusting that that organizations\u2019 referrals have already incorporated suggestions from a variety of other organizations in the space). Reducing how much ad hoc information sharing about candidates is taking place could also have benefits for candidate privacy \u2014 organizations would be asking candidates for permission to share their information with just one entity, making it easier to set clear expectations about what is being shared and how it will be used.</li></ul></li><li><strong>3. Individual hiring organizations are incentivized to do the bare minimum, especially when it comes to sourcing and vetting unknown candidates. </strong>It doesn\u2019t make sense for individual organizations\u2019 recruiting teams to attempt to sort through and take calls with all the possibly stellar and interested people in the world just to fill just the roles they have open. Sourcing and vetting unknown candidates is extremely labor-intensive work and in-house recruiting teams tend to be busy and under time pressure to fill roles as quickly as possible. This creates a tendency to focus efforts on the sourcing that seems \u201csafest\u201d from an ROI perspective (which might mean e.g. saying no to lots of calls with people who look interesting on paper but who we don\u2019t have much signal about).<ul><li><strong>How more coordination could help: </strong>There are lots of other things that would be an unreasonable strain on an in-house team\u2019s recruiting capacity that would make sense to do on behalf of a long list of client organizations as the odds of finding a match will be much higher. A community-wide headhunting agency could undertake activities that are currently being duplicated across many organizations and do a much more thorough job, potentially helping the community build a larger pipeline.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Brainstorm of projects&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Here\u2019s a list of projects we think could be promising; these could sit under one organizational umbrella, but don\u2019t necessarily have to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Building an up-to-date CRM: a list of potential candidates and their hiring-related information (Linkedin data, skills, roles they\u2019re interested in etc). Whilst this would only be as useful as it is good, we\u2019re interested in the claim that there\u2019s a potential gap for someone to create, manage and use a community-wide CRM built for headhunting</li><li>Re-routing candidates who made it to the final stages of hiring rounds (but don\u2019t get the job) to other relevant orgs</li><li>Developing talent pipelines for specific problem areas, including conducting proactive outbound outreach to potential talent and having screening calls (especially with \u2018new/unknown\u2019 but potentially stellar candidates) with the intention of placing them in open roles</li><li>Systematically routing potential candidates to relevant orgs (including figuring out a way to collect, store and share references which could help hiring managers uncover cruxes about candidates earlier in the process)</li><li>Figuring out how to gather feedback from hiring managers and deliver it to candidates to improve the candidate experience</li><li>\u2018Talent mapping\u2019 of existing staff at EA orgs and developing relationships with them so that if they\u2019re seeking a role change, they can receive support</li><li>Contributing to the headhunting of top candidates from diverse backgrounds to increase the diversity of orgs\u2019 hiring pipelines</li></ul><p><strong>Potential risks&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Creating a more coordinated hiring or vetting organization dramatically raises the stakes of that one organization\u2019s work and raises the cost of mistakes. Some ways this could go wrong:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A centralized vetting organization could consolidate power. If the process inadvertently optimized for the wrong things but hiring organizations took the assessments seriously, this could lead to worse hiring decisions by many organizations. (Though it seems more likely in the short run that such an org would just struggle to create a process that a large number of organizations felt they could trust and buy into.)</li><li>With any kind of centralized information collection, communication around candidate data would need to be handled very sensitively in order to avoid creating a scenario in which candidates are disincentivized from using the service at all (out of real or imagined fears that it would damage their reputation or get them rejected from all EA organizations at once vs. having a bunch of different chances to impress specific organizations).</li><li>It will be hard for any centralized CRM to keep up with community growth and stay organized and exhaustive for very long; it may just inevitably devolve into a bunch of more niche CRMs maintained by different organizations.</li><li>In general, this is difficult work with large overheads; it requires balancing lots of people\u2019s interests and building trust networks among stakeholders whose incentives are not aligned (e.g. hiring organizations are competing with each other for the best talent; candidates are competing with each other for the best roles; candidates would probably prefer less information sharing about their performance if it could hurt their chances while hiring organizations want to avoid mistakes). We could imagine it generally just being hard to get something sufficiently high quality and trusted off the ground.</li></ul><p>(For more discussion on the risks and benefits of a Common App specifically, see discussion <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TcfszCh4iTTw7ffLH/brief-presentation-and-considerations-for-an-ea-common\"><u>here</u></a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9NcwopCEioTkkosuq/ea-common-app-development-further-encouragement\"><u>here</u></a>.

Before moving forward with any kind of initiative to coordinate hiring activities across organizations, people would need to ensure they were in compliance with data privacy, antitrust and employment laws in all applicable jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Finding and cultivating especially talented candidates&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Beyond more effectively allocating existing talent, we believe that there\u2019s value in experimenting with trying to proactively identify the candidates currently most highly valued by relevant labor markets, who are not familiar with EA ideas. These candidates can be classified as generically \u201chard to hire:\u201d they have already established career capital outside of EA and have access to numerous exciting opportunities and are unlikely to be looking to leave their current job. While it\u2019s true such people might also be less open to EA ideas or pivoting their careers, the upside of successfully moving them into impactful roles may be high enough to justify some extra effort to convince them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anecdotally, we\u2019ve seen several examples of people in this category who successfully transitioned out of the business world and into EA careers (despite having little EA context to start with) and very quickly began adding large amounts of value which younger, highly engaged EAs would be unable to replicate for years. We would love to see such success stories replicated more often.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brainstorm of projects&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Creating more custom \u2018entry points\u2019 for mid-career professionals with targeted messaging for this demographic.

We expect most successes to be more \u2018high-touch\u2019 and networks and relationships-based than usual; this would likely mean working outwards from who is already in the community.</li><li>A service could be developed to advise EA organizations on how to do effective \u201cvalues-vetting\u201d interviews with mid-career professionals in the later stages of job applications without relying on superficial \u201ccommunity involvement\u201d indicators (and without creeping the candidate out). The goal would be to assess whether a candidate has the \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mNRNWkFBZ2K6SHD8a/most-students-who-would-agree-with-ea-ideas-haven-t-heard-of#Proto_EA_intuitions\"><u>proto-EA</u></a>\u201d orientation required to be easily assimilated into EA orgs.</li><li>We think more ideas could be generated by studying best practices from other industries in which competition for top talent is the norm (this would be another project someone could take on).</li></ul><p>Beyond especially capable mid- and late-career professionals, we suspect this demographic-targeted headhunting approach could also be replicated to source and recruit excellent candidates from other underrepresented backgrounds.</p><p><strong>Potential risks&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>It may be that getting such people into EA roles is so difficult that it\u2019s not a good use of anyone\u2019s time to focus exclusively on this, and it should just be done opportunistically (via connections and relationships). (When we checked in with 80,000 Hours, they suggested that this consideration was part of what caused them to back off this type of work, but they also said they\u2019d be interested in seeing more people experiment with it.)</li><li>EA organizations may be justified in being wary of candidates who didn\u2019t self-select into the community; bringing in mid-career or senior people who are e.g. not primarily motivated by altruistic considerations, or have been steeped in an environment where values like truth-seeking are not encouraged, could dilute positive things about the movement\u2019s culture we\u2019d rather preserve.<ul><li>That said, we think EA organizations today might have an unreasonable degree of risk aversion when it comes to hiring highly talented individuals who are not culturally embedded in the community. Some candidates really do have incompatible goals and values; some will just make a lot of insider-baseball faux pas when interviewing with an EA organization because they\u2019ve never spent time with EAs before. There are definitely risks and trade-offs to consider here (and for some roles not just alignment but EA cultural context is important on day one). But there are also tradeoffs to passing on people with hard-to-find skills due to risk aversion about \u201cculture fit.\u201d&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Skillbuilding to do this work&nbsp;</h3><p>We believe that, as a community, we need more professional recruiters and headhunters to figure out how to place (or facilitate the placing of) suitable candidates in these open roles. This is a smaller point, but being included for completeness: in our experience it currently seems quite hard for EA organizations to hire aligned talent who already have recruiting skills and a solid understanding of best practices, and we don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever read this advice written down. (This is based on Anya\u2019s experience hiring at Open Phil and anecdotal evidence from talking to other organizations who were trying to hire recruiters.)&nbsp;</p><p>In our experience, being a good fit for generalist operations work doesn\u2019t perfectly map onto being a good fit for recruiting/headhunting/hiring. We think people who have already done this work in a professional context could bring unique value to EA organizations. (E.g. The following orgs are currently seeking recruitment talent: <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/careers/\"><u>Recruiting Manager at Open Philanthropy</u></a>, <a href=\"https://ought.org/careers/recruiter\"><u>Recruiter at Ought</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.schmidtfutures.com/careers/\"><u>multiple roles at Schmidt Futures</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/#job-postings\"><u>multiple roles at Anthropic</u></a>.)</p><p>This isn\u2019t a path that is likely to make sense for tons and tons of people, but we believe it would, on the margin, be quite helpful for some people drawn to this work to get jobs at high-end talent acquisition firms, skill build for a couple of years, and then come back to the community significantly more able to help.

I recently graduated from Tulane with a Bachelor's in Engineering and Philosophy, so I have a general background in technology and the humanities. However, I am interested in a career in DC as a scientific advisor to policy makers, and to do that I need a better technical understanding of these fields.</p><p>To that end, I had the idea to make a podcast about my journey learning about these topics. I plan to learn using a variety of self-teaching materials: books, video series, podcasts, online classes, etc. Once I finish something, I then write and record a thirty-ish minute summary of what I learned. I'm thinking of calling it \"X-Risk Upskill.\"</p><p>Even if this project doesn't become popular, it will have three main advantages for me: it will motivate me to actually do the work of upskilling; it will help me better absorb the material, since the best way to learn is to teach; and it will give me a chance to practice my science communication skills. If the podcast does get popular, it could bolster my career by getting my name out there and help other aspiring EAs upskill as well.</p><p>Does anyone have any advice before I start this project? In particular, are there any resources you recommend for teaching myself about machine learning, genomics, or politics? Should I find someone to edit my scripts before I record them?

I\u2019m an anthropologist at Rutgers University, and I focus much of my attention on how people cooperate. One particular form of cooperation seems to have been crucial to our ancestors\u2019 ability to survive and spread around the world, including into quite marginal habitats: Central place food sharing. Before I explain what that is, I should point out that although our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, do share some food, they share very little compared to humans. If you\u2019re a chimp or a bonobo and you have been weaned, then you\u2019re mostly on your own when it comes to finding food. The same was probably true of the common ancestors of humans, chimps, and bonobos.</p><p>We don\u2019t know exactly when, where, or how they did it, but our ancestors came up with a revolutionary new idea: Everyone who can forage does so, eating as they go but also bringing any surplus they may have obtained back to camp. Thus, those who either are unlucky while foraging or who could not forage because they were too old, too young, or too sick or injured to forage could also eat and, thus, survive another day. This created an opportunity for our ancestors to develop a division of labor regarding food acquisition and other necessary tasks, such as child care. For example, females with small children could remain in camp, confident that others would provide for them and their children. This may have allowed for shorter interbirth intervals and higher fertility. Males whose mates had small children could focus on reliable foods such as plants, small game, and honey, while other males could take a risk on hard-to-find and hard-to-capture larger game, confident that they, too, would still have something to eat at the end of the day if they failed, as they would have often done. Sick and injured people could recuperate rather than simply dying, and, thus, survive to contribute to the group\u2019s food supply in the future.</p><p>Judging from our species\u2019 subsequent success, central place food sharing seems not only to have been altruistic but also highly effective. So does central place food sharing qualify as our species\u2019 original form of effective altruism?<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Lee Cronk"}}, {"_id": "6o7CuxJGcnckTkg49", "title": "Sympathectomies - The New Lobotomy", "postedAt": "2022-08-27T08:28:01.885Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm posting here for the first time to raise awareness of an issue that has caused me considerable pain over the past five years, and has plagued many other people as well. I, as well as thousands of people around the world, have had surgeries called Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy (ETS), and Endoscopic Lumbar Sympathectomy (ELS), that clamp or sever a series of nerves along the Sympathetic chain, which controls the fight or flight response, among many other things -and thus sever off chunks of the receiving patients' nervous systems. They have caused me and many others severe and debilitating changes, to consciousness and cognition. I feel the members of this forum are especially qualified to understand the contents of this post.</p><p>My apologies if this topic does not fit the purpose of the forum. It's just that I have tried for over 5 years to raise awareness without much luck, and know the people on this forum are smart enough to understand quite well the consequences of surgically messing with the nervous system.&nbsp; I have managed to speak with some high profile people in EA/Rationality communities, and discussed writing a formal paper describing my experiences that they were prepared to disseminate widely. However, not much ever came of it because of my loss of cognitive capacity and coherence,&nbsp;</p><p>I myself have had both ETS and ELS performed, which have totally destroyed my life and caused me torture and suffering beyond description (relevant because members of this forum desire to reduce extreme suffering), modified my consciousness and mental states so much that my internal mind doesn't seem to function or interact with the world coherently (which might be relevant to many people's intellectual interests such as consciousness).&nbsp; I am 27 years old, and have basically spent close to a decade such that I have only gotten out of bed for 6 hours a day. (referring to the mode, not the mean)</p><p>One horrible period after ELS surgery was a period of approximately 2-3 years of continuous suffering, without a single moment of coherence or relief. A period of time took place when the thoughts that arose in my brain weren\u2019t even fully coherent, as the machine that is my nervous system had so many parameters of computation removed, that the machine couldn\u2019t function in its ideal state. My lumbar sympathectomy modified my consciousness and mental states so much that my internal mind doesn't seem to function or interact with the world coherently. As a result of the surgery, I now have lower \u201cMoral Weight\u201d, and lower capacity for conscious experiences. I also have great changes to the nature and type of my qualia.</p><p>Here is the Wikipedia page for ETS, which provides valuable information and is a good start. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_thoracic_sympathectomy\"><u>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_thoracic_sympathectomy</u></a> . This was one of the few sources of information I could find that described how Sympathectomies affect consciousness. Sympathectomies are banned in Sweden and partially banned in Taiwan, because they recognize the deleterious effects outweigh the possible benefits of reduced sweating for those suffering from excessive sweating. Yet in many countries, such as the United States, the surgeries are less regulated and still performed. Many of the doctors are performing the surgeries despite knowing of their great harms, downplaying the serious negative consequences and ignoring the complaints of many of their patients (including removing negative reviews and comments about their practices from social media), due to financial motivations, and possibly other motivations regarding status.There is a Facebook page of now over 2500 members, the vast majority of whom have suffered as a result of sympathectomies: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/334039357095989\"><u>https://www.facebook.com/groups/334039357095989</u></a></p><p>Dr. Tommy Nai-Jen Chang, an Assistant Professor in the Division of Reconstructive Microsurgery, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Microsurgery, Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center, Taiwan, works on peripheral nerve reconstruction for adult and pediatric brachial plexus injury, facial paralysis, and reconstruction of upper and lower extremity defects.

All capacities for preferable states of mind have been reduced to negligible levels.</li><li>Loss of capacity for many types of suffering, such as emotional suffering, loss of capacity for emotional state of crying, fear, hatred, anger, heartbreak, and frustration - which I think is part of why I feel my capacity to fight back and accomplish goals towards raising awareness towards the surgery have been severely compromised</li><li>Loss of fight or flight response</li><li>Chronic fatigue - To this day, my chronic fatigue is so bad that, on days that I go to work, I only spend about nine and a half hours a day out of bed in a 24-hour period.

Those data points were documented probably 6 months or so before this forum post.</li><li>Difficulties in speech and difficulties putting sentences together and having conversation</li><li>Weight gain and disruptions to my digestive system - At one point I could smell my internal organs failing and it was a period that my digestive system was so out of whack that I could only defecate on a frequency of about once every two or three weeks.</li><li>Decreased ability to create new memories, and destruction of memories from the past</li><li>Loss of reproductive system capabilities (male) - erectile dysfunction, loss of ability to find a woman attractive, loss of sexual arousal, etc.</li><li>Greatly decreased intelligence - slower processing speed, lesser capacity for thought experiment, increased forgetfulness, etc.</li><li>Greatly decreased capacity to appreciate music</li><li>Lower states of consciousness - I feel less awake</li><li>A state of being that is a lot less dense.

Let\u2019s start with a quick analogy which can provide a glimpse of where we\u2019re headed.</p><p><br><strong>Our Evolving Relationship With Food</strong></p><p>For most of our history humans have lived near the edge of starvation much of the time. In this scarcity context a \u201cmore is better\u201d relationship with food was entirely reasonable.</p><p>We live in a new food era now. In our time food is plentiful and readily available in much of the world, and where that\u2019s true more people die of obesity related diseases than die of starvation.</p><p>The point here is that a \u201cmore is better\u201d relationship with food which was entirely rational for a very long time in an era of food scarcity became outdated and dangerous when transported to a different era characterized by a food explosion. We lucky moderns are required to replace the simplistic \u201cmore is better\u201d food paradigm from the earlier era with a more intelligent and sophisticated relationship which can involve complicated cost/benefit calculations.</p><p><br><strong>Our Evolving Relationship With Knowledge</strong></p><p>This is where we are in our relationship with knowledge as well. The simplistic \u201cmore is better\u201d relationship with knowledge which served us so well for so long now must adapt to meet the challenge of the new environment which it\u2019s success has created.</p><p>The modern knowledge explosion obviously brings many benefits, way more than can be listed here, more than our ancestors could have even dreamed of. And although mistakes, missteps and even epic calamities do occur, so far we\u2019ve always managed to clean up the mess, fix the error, learn the lessons, and continue with progress. So what\u2019s the problem??</p><p>To understand the threat posed by operating from an outdated relationship with knowledge we need to examine the issue of scale. It is the vast scale of the powers emerging from the knowledge explosion that makes the longstanding progress =&gt; mistakes =&gt; more progress process that we are used to obsolete.</p><p><br><strong>Erasing The Room For Error</strong></p><p>Luckily for the purposes of this article at least, nuclear weapons provide a very easily understood example of how powers of vast scale change the threat landscape by erasing the room for error.</p><p>As you know, the nuclear stockpiles of the great powers will have to be managed successfully every single day forever, for as long as those weapons exist. The key thing to note here is that as far as the future of humanity goes, successfully managing such vast power most of the time is no longer sufficient. Doing a pretty good job no longer works. Making a mistake and then fixing it is no longer an option.</p><p>In the nuclear era the room for error we\u2019ve always counted on in the past is erased, and one bad day is all it takes to end the possibility for further progress. This is what defines the revolutionary new situation we now find ourselves in, a situation which demands perfection from us.</p><p><br><strong>And Now The Bad News</strong></p><p>If nuclear weapons were eliminated entirely the underlying \u201cmore is better\u201d knowledge development process which created the nuclear threat would continue to create more vast powers with the potential for crashing civilization.</p><p>Each emerging power of vast scale will have to be successfully managed every single day forever because a single mistake with a single such power a single time may be sufficient to crash the system and prevent the opportunity for renewal.</p><p><br><strong>More, Larger, Faster</strong></p><p>A key fact of the knowledge explosion is that it feeds back upon itself creating an ever accelerating unfolding of new knowledge, and thus new powers. So not only will emerging powers be larger than what we could produce in the past, and not only will there be more such vast powers than currently, but they will arrive on the scene at an ever faster pace.</p><p>Ever more, ever larger powers, delivered at an ever faster pace. Each of these accelerating factors; scale, number, and speed; needs to be graphed against the glacial pace of human maturity development.</p><p><br><strong>Are We Perfect?</strong></p><p>There is nothing about thousands of years of human history which suggests that we are capable of the consistently perfect management which powers of vast scale require.</p><p>We\u2019ve been able to survive repeated episodes of murderous insanity and other such mistakes in the past only because the powers available to us were limited. As example, we threw conventional explosives at each other with wild abandon in WWII, and were saved from total destruction only because conventional explosives simply aren\u2019t powerful enough to crash civilization.</p><p><br><strong>The Unexamined False Assumption</strong></p><p>A simplistic \u201cmore is better\u201d relationship with knowledge is built upon the false assumption that human beings will always be able to successfully manage any amount of power which emerges from the knowledge explosion. Simple common sense reveals this assumption to be a wishful thinking fantasy.</p><p>We sensibly limit the powers available to kids out of the realistic understanding that their ability to manage power is limited. But then we assume that when children turn 18 they somehow magically acquire the ability to successfully manage any amount of power that the knowledge explosion may deliver.</p><p>The irrationality of this assumption is proven beyond doubt by the thousands of hair trigger hydrogen bombs we adults have aimed down our own throats, a stark reality we rarely find interesting enough to comment upon.</p><p>Mature? Ready for even more power?</p><p><br><strong>Should We Become Luddites?</strong></p><p>Should we turn our backs on knowledge? We don\u2019t have that option. We make our livings on this Earth by knowledge. Knowledge is to humans what wings are to a bird, and fins are to a fish.</p><p>To illustrate the path we are now required to walk in our relationship with knowledge, let\u2019s return to the example of food. The solution to obesity is obviously not to stop eating. The solution to obesity is instead to develop a more sophisticated relationship with food, eating what our bodies need, while saying no to excessive consumption.</p><p>In the same way, a simplistic \u201cmore is better\u201d relationship with knowledge which has served us so well for so long must now make way for a more sophisticated relationship involving complicated cost/benefit calculations. And just as is the case with food, this will sometimes involve saying no to some new knowledge.</p><p>Yes, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s true, saying no to any knowledge is typically considered heresy in the age of science. Such reactions are surely understandable, but they are also wishful thinking prisoners of the past.</p><p>Nuclear weapons prove that the simplistic \u201cmore is better\u201d relationship with knowledge the modern world is built upon is outdated 19th century philosophy which requires updating to meet the existential threats presented by a revolutionary new era.</p>", "user": {"username": "Phil Tanny"}}, {"_id": "F76dnd5xvQHdqBPd8", "title": "What Is The Most Effective Way To Look At Existential Risk?\n", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T11:21:41.079Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This article will argue that a focus on particular technology driven existential risks may be misguided, and that shifting our focus to the source of such risks may be more productive.</p><p>When we examine a particular existential risk we are presuming that we have a chance to mitigate the risk and avoid a disaster.

I think the paper shows the importance of using distributions, rather than point-estimates: using point estimates results in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox\">Fermi paradox</a>. This is the reason why I\u2019ve been multiplying distributions, rather than point estimates</p><h2>4. Are any staff members dating?</h2><p>Note: Question does not include Junior Counselors, because I don\u2019t know the answer to that.</p><h3>Own answer</h3><p>The camp has 11 male and 3 women staff members. So the number of heterosexual combinations is (11 choose 1) \u00d7 (3 choose 1) = 11 \u00d7 3 = 33 possible pairings. However, some of the pairings are not compatible, because they repeat the same person, so the number of monogamous heterosexual pairings is lower.</p><p>Instead, say I\u2019m giving a 1% to 3% a priori probability for any man-woman pairing. How did I arrive at this? Essentially, 0.1% feels too low and 5% too high. That implies a cumulative ~10% to 30% probability that a given woman staff member is dating any man staff member. Note that this rounds off nontraditional pairings\u2014there is 1 nonbinary Junior Counsellor, but none amongst instructors, that I recall.</p><p>If we run with the 30% chance for each woman staff member:</p><pre><code>p(0) = 1 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 = 34.3%\np(1) = 3 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 = 44.1%\np(2) = 3 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.7 = 18.9%\np(3) = 1 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 = 2.7%\n</code></pre><p>If 10%:</p><pre><code>p(0) = 1 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 = 72.9%\np(1) = 3 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 = 24.3%\np(2) = 3 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.9 = 2.7%\np(3) = 1 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.1%\n</code></pre><p>So the probability that there is at least one pairing ranges from 65% to 35%, which is almost symmetrical. So this implies a roughly 50% that there is at least one pairing.</p><h3>Student estimates</h3><ul><li>25% no couples, 1: 50%, \u2026</li><li>0:25, 1:25 , 2: 33%, \u2026</li><li>0: 0, 1: 1/6, 2: 2/6, &gt;=3: 3/6</li><li>0: \u00bc, 1: \u00bc, \u2026</li></ul><h3>Check</h3><p>You don\u2019t get to know the answer to this!</p><h2>5.

One hint might be that, per the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\">central limit theorem</a>, sums of independent variables will tend to normals, which means that products will tend to be lognormals. And in practice I\u2019ve also found that lognormals tend to often capture the shape of my uncertainty.</p><p>So then here is our proof sketch that you can get better estimates by decomposing a problem into steps:</p><ul><li>Assume that guesses are independent lognormals, with a mean centered on the correct amount. This traditionally means that your guesses are lognormally distributed random variables, that is, that you are drawing your guess from a lognormal. But you could also think of giving your guess as a distribution in the shape of a lognormal, as I have done in the examples above.</li><li>Observe that the multiplication of two lognormals is the sum of the logs of those variables, which are normally distributed.<ul><li>Per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_normally_distributed_random_variables\">well known math</a>, the sum of two normals is a normal. And hence the product of two lognormals is a lognormal.</li><li>Look at the shape of <i>standard deviation / mean</i> of the underlying normals.</li><li>E.g., consider <i>n</i> lognormals with mean <i>m</i> and standard deviation <i>s</i> on their underlying normals.</li><li>Then that ratio is <i>s / m</i></li><li>Then consider the product of <i>n</i> such lognormals</li><li>Per <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/212690/the-product-of-two-lognormal-random-variables\">this</a>, the mean of the underlying normal of that product is going to be <i>n * m</i>, and the standard deviation of the underlying normal of that product is going to be <i>sqrt(n)*s</i></li><li>Then the ratio is going to be <i>sqrt(n) * s / (n * m)</i>, which converges to 0 as <i>n</i> grows higher.</li><li>We will get a similar phenomenon when we use lognormals that are not idential.</li><li>Then, if you have the ability to make estimates with a certain degree of relative error\u2014i.e., such that the <i>standard deviation / mean</i> of your estimates is roughly constant\u2014then you are better off decomposing your estimate in chunks and estimating those chunks.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I then have to argue that the ratio of <i>standard deviation / mean</i> is a meaningful quantity, because the proof wouldn\u2019t go through if we had used <i>mean / variance</i>. But the <i>standard deviation / mean</i> is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation\">coefficient of variation</a>, and it doesn\u2019t depend on the unit of measurement used\u2014e.g,. centimeters vs meters\u2014unlike some equivalent measure based on the variance.</p>", "user": {"username": "NunoSempere"}}, {"_id": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "title": "Climate Change & Longtermism: new book-length report", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T09:13:12.129Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Since 2021, as part of the research for What We Owe the Future, I have been working on a report on climate change from a longtermist perspective.

Views and mistakes are my own.&nbsp;</p><p>**</p><h1><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h1><p>In this report, I will evaluate the scale of climate change from a <i>longtermist</i> point of view. <a href=\"https://longtermism.com/\"><u>Longtermism</u></a> is the idea that influencing the long-term future, thousands of years into the future and beyond, is a key moral priority of our time.&nbsp;</p><p>In economics, longtermism is embodied by the idea that we should have a zero rate of \u2018pure time preference\u2019: we should not discount the welfare of future people merely because it is in the future. Economists who embrace a zero rate of pure time preference will tend to favour more aggressive climate policy than those who discount future benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>Climate change is a proof of concept of longtermism. Every time we drive, fly, or flick a light switch, each of us causes CO<sub>2</sub> to be released into the atmosphere. This changes the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is in the atmosphere for a very long time: unless we suck the CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere ourselves, concentrations only fall back to natural levels after hundreds of thousands of years. The chart below shows long-term CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations after different amounts of cumulative carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vQPoAUeh5EsB1Fra8pNHhdJoafix059JRmfzkhTuDgkHgaamRUC5wJNfOhc86eF5tWMo4DuZ_xK7DM2QrrSJd1Ft8w_Y4aBY3msCLA64-dfJtv-bYZ4M5ycrZ0fMSgrgG4KYKN0cmFdpp02x1MrraBodMz3AcjRW5O7Rivgx6bedAXDK5yssvax2mQ\"><figcaption>Source: N.

The clearest example of this is sea level rise. On current policy, the most likely sea level rise this century is 75cm. However, over 10,000 years, sea levels will rise by 10 metres. Over the long-term, the world will look very different.</p><p>From a longtermist point of view, it is especially important to avoid outcomes that could have persistent and significant effects. These include events like human extinction, societal collapse, a permanent negative change in human values, or prolonged economic stagnation. If we go extinct, then that would be the end of the human story, and there would be no future generations at all. If civilisation collapses permanently, then future generations will be left much worse off than they could have been, living lives full of suffering rather than ones of flourishing.</p><h2>The anatomy of climate risk</h2><p>The overall size of climate risk depends on the following factors:</p><ol><li>Greenhouse gas emissions</li><li>The climate change we get from different levels of emissions</li><li>The impacts of different levels of climate change</li></ol><p>There is uncertainty about all three factors. The main findings of this report are as follows.</p><h2>Emissions are likely to be lower than once thought</h2><p>Due to recent progress on clean technology and climate policy, we look likely to avoid the worst-case emissions scenario, known in the literature as \u2018RCP8.5\u2019. The most likely scenario on current policy is now the medium-low emissions pathway known as \u2018RCP4.5\u2019. Moreover, climate policy is likely to strengthen in the future. For instance, as I was writing this report, the US Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant piece of climate legislation in American history.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EkjrpAHW-31Gq2RMtAcj0PM4MMrlVSUtoz21xUPQ1Ludxnw4mulnLzpyp0UrKBxvaSyZC2eN2_5adYuvIwONKp1YwN2eax9gNqFCSUx6Tq9vIUvXRfYgrBIescW_GXgNYSYFBrLDbVGJGWiONmOxtGm3kT67oRHCUqEKovzvKiZDWESdgIJmP3a4BA\"><figcaption>Source: Hausfather and Peters, \u2018<a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3\"><u>Emissions \u2013 the \u2018business as usual\u2019 story is misleading</u></a>\u2019, <i>Nature</i>, 2020. &nbsp;&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Climate change is a great illustration of how society can make progress on a problem if enough people are motivated to solve it. This does not mean that climate change is solved, but there is significant momentum, and we are at least now moving in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p>The amount of carbon we could burn in a worst-case scenario is also much lower than once thought. Some of the literature assumes that there are 5 or even 10 trillion tonnes of carbon remaining in fossil fuels, mostly in the form of coal. However, these estimates fail to recognise that not all fossil fuels resources are recoverable. Estimates of <i>recoverable</i> fossil fuels range from 1 to 3 trillion tonnes of carbon.&nbsp;</p><p>It is difficult to come up with plausible scenarios on which we burn all of the recoverable fossil fuels. Doing so would require (1) significant improvements in advanced coal extraction technology which is not part of the energy conversation today, but (2) a dramatic slowdown in progress in low carbon technologies that are already getting substantial policy support.&nbsp;</p><h2>Warming is likely to be lower than once thought&nbsp;</h2><p>Warming will likely be lower than once feared, in part because of lower emissions and in part because the scientific community has reduced uncertainty about climate sensitivity. Where once current policy seemed likely to imply 4\u00baC of warming above pre-industrial levels, now the most likely level of warming is around 2.7\u00baC, and the chance of 4\u00baC is around 5%. Moreover, where once there seemed to be a &gt;10% chance of 6\u00baC on current policy, the risk now seems to be well below 1%.&nbsp;</p><p>On a worst-case scenario in which we burn all of the fossil fuels, the most likely level of warming is 7\u00baC, and there is a 1 in 6 chance of more than 9.5\u00baC.&nbsp;</p><h2>Climate change will disproportionately harm the worst-off</h2><p>The climate impacts literature suggests that climate change will impose disproportionate costs on countries at low latitude, which are disproportionately low- and middle-income and have done the least to contribute to climate change. People in Asia will have to deal with increasing flooding due to rising sea levels. Climate change will damage agricultural output, and cause droughts in countries reliant on rainfed agriculture. People in the tropics will face rising levels of heat stress. Fossil fuels also kill millions of people from air pollution in both poor and rich countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Many low- and middle-income countries have essentially never experienced sustained improvements in living standards, and a significant fraction may be left worse-off <i>than today</i> due to climate change. This undermines one common argument for discounting the future costs of climate change - that future generations will be richer and so better able to adapt to the effects of climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a clear moral responsibility not to impose this harm, to reduce emissions, and to encourage economic development in poorer countries.</p><h2>Average living standards will probably continue to rise</h2><p>Climate-economy models confirm that the costs of climate change will fall disproportionately on poorer people, but almost all models also suggest that global average living standards in the future will be higher than today, on plausible levels of warming. Income per person looks set to increase by several hundred percent by the end of the century, notwithstanding the effects of climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>\u2018Bottom-up\u2019 climate-economy models included in the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report that add up the effects of climate impacts in different sectors and plug them into modern economic models suggest that warming of 4\u00baC would do damage equivalent to reducing global GDP by around 5%. One recent model, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0578-6\">Takakura et al (2019)</a>, includes the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Fluvial flooding</li><li>Coastal inundation</li><li>Agriculture</li><li>Undernourishment</li><li>Heat-related excess mortality</li><li>Cooling/heating demand</li><li>Occupational-health costs</li><li>Hydroelectric generation capacity</li><li>Thermal power generation capacity</li></ul><p>For instance, in agriculture, the message from the climate impacts literature is that although climate change will damage food production, average food consumption per person will be higher than today, even for 4\u00baC of warming, due to progress in agricultural productivity and technology. This is illustrated on the chart below from van Dijk et al (2021), which shows per capita food consumption on different socioeconomic pathways.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ye5hadxAV3jRRnEqak4Lh-dqJc7MBXPubrln48G9bkQUzJG5IbyfK1nDWaDQbkjycs5SSjlHgfcN5piU-e781ADFyhB6ny336miXrPCaBpgst4-i3wEZfroa_Ls-C5fPux1koWg5xmCtjXzYjDhj9E7wG-SHNPvUy3fLL_0Fy3jsNzthWLE2zOcD_w\"><figcaption>Source: Michiel van Dijk et al., \u2018A Meta-Analysis of Projected Global Food Demand and Population at Risk of Hunger for the Period 2010\u20132050\u2019, <i>Nature Food</i> 2, no. 7 (July 2021): 494\u2013501, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-021-00322-9\"><u>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-021-00322-9</u></a>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I have previously been critical of climate-economy models, but now believe they are more reliable than they once were. Until recently, a key determinant of aggregate impact assessments was how to model the effects of &gt;4.4\u00baC because the chance of that level of warming was so high. Estimates that models arrived at were unmotivated and arbitrary in part because the literature on the impacts of &gt;4.4\u00baC was sparse. However, warming of &gt;4.4\u00baC now seems increasingly unlikely (&lt;1% given likely trends in policy), and there is a rich and voluminous literature on the impact of warming up to 4.4.\u00baC. This makes recent bottom-up models more reliable.</p><p>However, even the best bottom-up climate-economy models underestimate the costs of climate change because they do not account for some important direct costs:</p><ul><li>They do not include tipping points</li><li>They do not explicitly model the potential effects of climate change on economic growth and technological progress</li></ul><p>It is unclear how much these factors would increase the overall direct costs of climate change; that is an important area of future research for climate economics. However, for levels of warming that now seem plausible, these effects seem unlikely to be large enough to outweigh countervailing improvements in average living standards.&nbsp;</p><p>Bottom-up climate-economy models also do not account for indirect effects, such as conflict, which I discuss below.&nbsp;</p><p>\u2018Top-down\u2019 climate-economy models try to directly measure the effects of climate change on aggregate economic output, and some of these find much higher impacts from climate change, on the order of a 25% reduction in GDP for 4\u00baC warming. However, these results are highly model-dependent, rely on questionable econometric assumptions, and exclude several important climate impacts. In my view, the best bottom-up studies are a more reliable guide, notwithstanding their flaws.&nbsp;</p><p>Although average living standards are likely to continue to rise, we also need to consider the possibility of societal collapse for other reasons, such as a pandemic or nuclear war. If there were to be a major global catastrophe, then future living standards may not actually be higher than today. Future generations trying to rebuild society would have to do so in a less hospitable climate.</p><h2>Some tipping points could have very bad effects</h2><p>In my view, the most concerning tipping points highlighted in the literature are rapid cloud feedbacks, collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.&nbsp;</p><p>Some models suggest that if CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations pass 1,200ppm (compared to 415ppm today), cloud feedbacks could cause 8\u00baC of additional warming over the course of years to decades, on top of the 5\u00baC we would already have experienced. The impacts of this sort of extreme warming have not been studied, but it seems plausible that hundreds of millions of people would die. Moreover, people would be stuck with an extreme greenhouse world for millennia. This would extend the \u2018time of perils\u2019: the period in which we have the technology to destroy ourselves, but lack the political institutions necessary to manage that technology. It would also make it much harder to recover from a civilisational collapse caused by something else (such as a pandemic or nuclear war). However, given progress on emissions, it is now difficult to come up with plausible scenarios on which CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations rise to 1,200ppm.&nbsp;</p><p>Collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation would cause cooling and drying around the North Atlantic, and more importantly would probably weaken the Indian monsoons and the West African monsoons, with potentially dire humanitarian implications. For 4\u00baC, models suggest that the chance of collapse is 1-5%, though they probably understate the risk.&nbsp;</p><p>There is deep uncertainty about potential sea level rise once warming passes 3\u00baC. For higher levels of warming, there is a risk of non-linear tipping points, such as collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would cause sea levels to rise by around 5 metres over 100 years, which would probably cause flooding of numerous highly populated cities, especially in Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to progress on emissions, these tipping points now look less likely than they did ten years ago, but their <i>expected</i> costs (impact weighted by probability) may still be large. Furthermore, our understanding of the climate system is imperfect, and there may be other damaging tipping points that we do not yet know about.&nbsp;</p><p>All this being said, contra some prominent research, the evidence from models and the paleoclimate (the deep climate history of the Earth) suggests that it is not the case that, once warming passes 2\u00baC-4\u00baC, runaway feedback loops will kick in that make the world uninhabitable.&nbsp;</p><h2>Direct impacts fall well short of human extinction</h2><p>Given progress in emissions, the risk of human extinction from the direct effects of climate change now seems extremely small. The most plausible route to human extinction is via runaway feedback loops. However, models and evidence from the paleoclimate suggest that it is impossible to trigger such runaway effects with fossil fuel burning. Models suggest that we could only trigger a runaway greenhouse if CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations pass 3,000ppm (at the very least), which is out of reach on revised estimates of recoverable fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, global average temperatures have been upwards of 17\u00baC higher several times in the past without triggering runaway feedback loops that killed all life on Earth. Indeed, since the Cretaceous, 145 million years ago, periods of high temperatures and/or rapid warming have not been associated with ecological disaster. However, prior to the Cretaceous, climate change was linked to ecological disaster. In the report, I discuss the theory that this was because of ecological and geographical factors unique to the pre-Cretaceous period.&nbsp;</p><p>I construct several models of the direct extinction risk from climate change but struggle to get the risk above 1 in 100,000 over all time.&nbsp;</p><p>One argument that climate change could directly cause civilisational collapse is that it could be a contributing factor (along with deforestation, human predation, and pollution) to ecosystem collapse, which could in turn cause the collapse of global agriculture. I argue in the main report that this risk is minimal.</p><h2>Indirect risks are under-researched but now seem fairly low</h2><p>Because interstate war has become increasingly rare since the end of World War II, most of the literature on climate change and conflict has focused on the connection between climate and <i>civil</i> conflict: conflicts between a government and its citizens in which more than 25 people are killed.&nbsp;</p><p>Scholars in the field agree that, so far, climate-related factors have been a much weaker driver of civil conflict than other factors such as socioeconomic development and state capacity. However, there is strong disagreement in the field about how important climate change will be in the future. It is widely agreed that the risk of climate-induced conflict is greatest in low- and middle-income countries, and that the most important mechanism is damage to agriculture.&nbsp;</p><p>The potential impact of climate change on the risk of <i>interstate</i>, rather than civil, war is potentially much more important but also much less studied. Among interstate conflicts, conflicts between the major powers pose by far the largest risk to humanity. This is because the major powers have far more destructive weaponry and have the capacity to alter the trajectory of humanity in other ways.&nbsp;</p><p>The most plausible way that climate change could affect the risk of interstate war is by causing agricultural disruption, which causes civil conflict, which in turn causes interstate conflict. Indeed, there is some evidence that countries embroiled in civil conflict are more likely to engage in military disputes with other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>It is difficult to see how climate change could be an important driver of some of the most potentially consequential conflicts this century - between the US and Russia, and the US and China. It is more plausible that climate change could play a larger role in driving conflict between India and Pakistan and also India and China. However, for plausible levels of warming, other drivers of this conflict seem much more important.&nbsp;</p><p>It is extremely difficult to provide reliable quantitative estimates of the risk of Great Power War caused by climate change. Nonetheless, I have built a model that attempts to put some numbers on the key considerations. I think this is valuable for several reasons. Firstly, it clarifies the cruxes of disagreements and allows focused discussion on those cruxes. Secondly, it allows us to prioritise different problems. If we do not quantify, we will still have judgments about how important different considerations are. Models make these considerations precise.&nbsp;</p><p>The downside of quantitative models is that they can cause false precision and anchor readers, even if the model is not good and has not been subject to scrutiny. Many of the considerations I have discussed are very difficult to quantify because there is essentially no literature on them.</p><p>With those caveats in my mind, my best guess estimate is that the indirect risk of existential catastrophe due to climate change is on the order of 1 in 100,000, and I struggle to get the risk above 1 in 1,000. Working directly on US-China, US-Russia, India-China, or India-Pakistan relations seems like a better way to reduce the risk of Great Power War than working on climate change.&nbsp;</p><h2>My personal thoughts on prioritising climate change relative to other problems&nbsp;</h2><p>My primary goal in this report is to help people to answer the following question:</p><p><i>If your goal is to make the greatest possible positive impact on the world, what should you do with your time and money right now, given how the rest of society is spending its resources?</i></p><p>Crucially, this question is about what people should do <i>on the margin</i>. It is about what people should do given how society allocates its resources, not about how society as a whole should allocate its resources. Thus, when I say that working on some other problems, such as nuclear war or biosecurity, will have greater impact, this doesn\u2019t mean that society as a whole should spend nothing on climate change and everything on nuclear war and biosecurity. Rather, it is a claim about what we should do with our resources given how other resources are currently spent.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the question I am trying to answer in this report is specifically about how to make the <i>greatest possible </i>impact on the world. This is the highest possible bar. In my view, climate change is one of the most important problems in the world, but other problems, including engineered viruses, advanced artificial intelligence and nuclear war, are more pressing on the margin because they are so neglected. One can visualise this in the following way. Green projects are beneficial on the margin, and red projects are harmful on the margin. Deeper green projects are more beneficial whereas deeper red projects are more harmful on the margin.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YjselLN6-vh04hbYsjWQD8nBQc15AqZq3DpjCczQgCf9OSG6tg2ym9igQjqukOCX4Mezz9LZbN6BslxnLEbTVzNiMWu8tEtMhsk87JdQ5S4H4h7_SET385Tp_c05TVMBnZnPylj4hRZinCm3OemoqiNI4DB4qlx-cxja8idb-jLEqI4N2opOlyPEkQ\"></figure><p><br>To emphasise, we should not confuse the claim that other problems are more pressing than climate change with the claim that climate change doesn\u2019t matter at all. I am glad that climate change is a top priority for millions of young people and for many of the world\u2019s smartest scientists, and I would like governments and the private sector to spend more on climate change. I helped to set up the Founders Pledge Climate Change Fund (donate <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund\"><u>here</u></a>), which has helped to move millions of dollars to effective climate change charities. The point is that I would like other global catastrophic risks to receive comparable attention, not that I would like climate change to receive less than it does today.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine that only a few hundred people in the world thought that climate change is an important problem (rather than at least tens of millions), that philanthropists worldwide spent a few million dollars a year on climate (rather than $10 billion), that society as a whole spent a million dollars on the problem (rather than $1 trillion), and that the international institutions trying to tackle the problem either don\u2019t exist or have a similar budget to a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. How bad would climate change be? This is how bad things are for the other global catastrophic risks, and then some.&nbsp;</p><p>The final important piece of context is as follows: although I am taking a longtermist perspective in this report, my conclusions about the priority of climate change relative to other global catastrophic risks <i><strong>are also true if you think only current generations matter</strong></i>. In my view, the risks from AI, biorisk and nuclear war this century are much higher than commonly recognised.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>AI</strong>: Forecasters on the community forecasting platform Metaculus think that artificial intelligent systems that are better than humans at all relevant tasks <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/\"><u>will be created in 2042</u></a>.

I think it highly likely that my daughter will have to live through nuclear war, pandemics created by engineered viruses, and/or the emergence of transformative AI systems that will radically alter society. It is deeply unfortunate that few people acknowledge these problems, and that many people who are aware of them dismiss them as sci-fi fantasies without attempting to engage with the arguments, or grappling with the fact that <i>many people working in these fields</i> agree that the risks are large.&nbsp;</p><p>Although, I contend, my conclusions follow on both neartermist and longtermist perspectives, it is important to reiterate that, in my view, a longtermist ethical point of view is the correct one. I see no compelling arguments for ignoring the welfare of future generations, and an ethical system that does ignore them is obviously difficult to square with concern about climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>While many people accept that the <i>direct</i> risks of climate change are lower than these other risks, some argue that the indirect effects of climate change may be large enough to make the total risk of climate change comparable. I do not think this is plausible. As discussed above, my rough models suggest that the total risk of climate change falls well short of the direct risk posed by the other global catastrophic risks. Moreover, the other risks <i>also</i> have indirect effects. As a rule, we should expect greater direct risks to have greater indirect effects. For instance, the indirect effects of trends in biotechnology seem to me much larger than the indirect effects of climate change. If biotechnology does democratise the creation of weapons of mass destruction, the indirect effects for the global economy and geopolitics are hard to fathom but seem enormous.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, because other global catastrophic risks are so much more neglected than climate change, I think they are more pressing to work on, on the margin. Nonetheless, climate change remains one of the most important problems from a longtermist perspective. If progress stalls and emissions are much higher than we expect, then there is a non-negligible chance of highly damaging tipping points. Moreover, climate change is a stressor of political upheaval and conflict, which can in turn increase other global catastrophic risks. Finally, extreme climate change would make recovery from civilisational collapse more difficult.</p>", "user": null}, {"_id": "gohBPCierjkWdL9nA", "title": "Hyperbolic Science: Or, Playing Games with Growth", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T02:41:50.457Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Provides useful language and imagery for the incentive structures and informational asymmetries that make some institutions resistant to honest assessment of their progress.

What will the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/biden-s-2023-budget-request-science-aims-high-again\">$50B requested by the NIH for 2023</a> be used for?

What does this accretion of knowledge amount to? What is the sausage that\u2019s purportedly being made\u2014and when will it be ready?</li></ul><p>When trying to answer these questions, we find ourselves in an epistemically adversarial environment, which we can call \u201chyperbolic science\u201d. It is defined by two mutually reinforcing facets:</p><p><strong>Hyperbolic information asymmetries</strong></p><p>The scientific research frontier is like an ever-expanding tree embedded in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model\">hyperbolic geometry</a>. (This is evident in the etymological root of \u201cscience\u201d: the Latin <i>scientia</i> derives from the Proto-Indo-European <i>skei-</i>, which means to \u201ccut\u201d or \u201csplit\u201d and is the root of \u201cschism\u201d and \u201cschizoid\u201d.) No one person can be versed in all the frontiers of science, and therefore no one can grasp the entire body of knowledge; locally the blob may be navigable to insiders, but globally it is just as blob-like to them as it is to outsiders, an archipelago of frontiers that lie beyond their research horizon. This problem becomes fractally more acute with time, the surface area of the frontier increasing as it expands and as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox\">it becomes more detailed</a>.</p><p><strong>Hyperbolic incentives</strong></p><p>Due to the advancing hyperbolic research frontier, researchers are the ones most fit to assess the state of their own research areas. Yet you can\u2019t simply ask them about progress along their particular research frontier and aggregate these evaluations, because all are conflicted by a principal-agent problem. If the fruit in their branch of the tree is rotten or the branch isn\u2019t blossoming at all, they won\u2019t tell you. At worst, they actively <a href=\"https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Embedded_Growth_Obligations\">exaggerate the rate and quality of growth</a> in their field, both exoterically (to lay outsiders) and esoterically (to grantors, colleagues, and prospective PhD students). At best, they are well-intentioned and simply don\u2019t pay attention to these sorts of questions, instead choosing to \u201cfocus on the science\u201d, a kind of bureaucratic blindspot (ego-preserving self-deception is often highly adaptive).</p><p>These incentives apply to their particular research area\u2014there is intra-academic zero-sum competition for a slice of NIH budget, which one must win to fund one\u2019s research and increase the odds of getting tenure\u2014and to science as a whole\u2014you\u2019re unlikely to meet a researcher that supports <i>shrinking</i> the NIH budget, thinks <i>less</i> biomedical research would make the world a better place, and wants to pare back dead research branches, especially when that dead branch is <i>their</i> field. (Threatening the livelihoods of those in your field is a good way to get kicked out of it.)</p><p>These growth narratives are reinforced by other parts of the extended biomedical blob: academic journals, the NIH, biopharmaceutical companies, biotech venture capitalists, and so on, whose existences are all predicated on continuing biomedical progress. Everyone is talking their book, and the books on which those books depend. Yet due to hyperbolic information asymmetries, no one person can independently verify all the claims their own work rests on, let alone someone else\u2019s\u2014invariably one must outsource some verification to <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease\">trusted third parties</a>. (Perhaps it\u2019s networks of mutually reinforcing <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/tag/status\">status deferral</a> and <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/03/the-fallacy-of-mood-affiliation.html\">mood affiliation</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down\">all the way down</a>.)</p><p>Thus, information asymmetries and structural incentives conspire to make the blob emergently <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Sh8qjH3GPpBvMu7ac/stories-about-academia#Polymaths_in_Universities\">adversarial toward critical assessment</a>. Few can accurately assess the state of their own field, let alone the entire research enterprise, and those who can are almost always incentivized to exaggerate its health\u2014and these problems worsens as the research frontier expands.</p><p>These problems aren\u2019t new. Derek de Solla Price identified them over sixty years ago in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait%C3%A9_de_Documentation\">one of the first</a> books on academic bibliometrics, <a href=\"http://derekdesollaprice.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Science-Since-Babylon-opt.pdf\"><i>Science Since Babylon</i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>It seems also that we can no longer take the word of the scientists on the job.

By eight, he had acquired a sophisticated education in philosophy, mathematics, physics, and astronomy. By twelve, the grasp of his intellectual pursuits had extended to logic; by thirteen, economics; and by fourteen, chemistry. None of them seemed to have done him much good.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon reaching twenty, Mill suffered a severe nervous breakdown and contemplated suicide several times. He reemerged from this personal crisis a different man. But the breadth of his interests remained. Throughout his life, Mill would make significant contributions to natural philosophy, logic, economics, politics, and ethics.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps his two most prominent achievements were his contributions to neoclassical economics which is, for good or ill, the most popular version of economics today, and his contributions to utilitarianism, an ethical philosophy that sought to maximize the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people.&nbsp;</p><p>It's no surprise that Mill, given his facility with math, co-founded the two most mathematical approaches to economics and ethics respectively. What would have come as a surprise to him was how quickly each separated from the other after his demise.&nbsp;</p><p>Economics chiefly became the study of efficient means to achieve certain goals. Whether the goals in question were ethical or important were deemed to be beyond its purview. George Stigler, a Nobel laureate in economics, went as far as declaring that economics and ethics had no business with each other<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8o7bxdw41ny\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8o7bxdw41ny\">[1]</a></sup></span>. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://evonomics.com/more-evidence-that-learning-economics-makes-you-selfish/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlg6XD3OT5AhVBtKQKHewPC5cQFnoECAcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw39N7scwqnGAn7nXZgSvafZ\">The estrangement was solidified after a number of studies revealed that Economics professors were less likely to give to charity than professors in other fields, Economics majors were more likely to approve of unethical behavior, and Economics Students were less willing to share money fairly.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>But times do nothing but change. In the last decade, a new kind of ethical system has risen to prominence. I am writing, of course, about effective altruism, a recent philosophy aptly summarized by co-founder William Macaskill, as the ' use of evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and take action on that basis'.&nbsp;</p><p>Effective Altruism is a rationalist, economic approach to ethical action. It is a second-order ethical system, concerned less with defining what is or isn't intrinsically good than with establishing an analytic framework for doing the most good that you can. What constitutes moral goodness is not as important as what constitutes efficient means. In Macaskill's words, effective altruism is \"ethical engineering rather than ethical science\".&nbsp;</p><p>This marriage of ethics and calculation is without doubt a powerful reason for its adoption among certain circles. <a href=\"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/ineffective-altruismineffective-altruism\">Its ideas have found their greatest affinity with Ivory Tower philosophers and Silicon Valley billionaires</a>. But effective altruism is by no means elitist. Its emphasis on individual action - 'the most good you can do' - makes it remarkably democratic. And in a world where many are dissatisfied with religion, EA can offer a vital alternative. It transforms formerly non-ethical considerations into ethical ones. In a way, effective altruism moralizes everything. After all, if the most good we can do is the criteria for moral goodness, every aspect and activity of our lives can be measured rather unhelpfully against some ideal morally efficient lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, I agree with several elements of effective altruism. More importantly, I wholeheartedly agree with one unique element of effective altruism - its principle that transparency is important for making good moral decisions. To quote William Macaskill in his book Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and How You Can Make a Difference:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"[I]magine if you went into a grocery store and none of the products had prices on them. Instead, the storekeeper asks: \u201cHow much would you like to spend at this grocery store today?\u201d When you give the storekeeper some money, he hands over a selection of groceries chosen by him. This, of course, would be absurd. If this was how things worked, how could we figure out if one grocery store was better than another? One store could charge ten times the amount for the same produce, and, prior to actually paying for the products, we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. If it would be absurd to buy groceries this way, why is donating to charity any different? In the case of charity, you\u2019re buying things for other people rather than yourself, but if you\u2019re interested in using your money to help other people effectively, that shouldn\u2019t make a difference.\"&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This seems to me a perfectly reasonable point. Until the rise of effective altruism, however, the importance of transparent outcomes had largely been ignored. To some, insisting on transparency risks converting ethical action into a game of ranked priorities. But the importance of transparency far outweighs any such costs. Without it, we reward people for empty acts of virtue, a problem which continues to hinder foreign aid programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Transparency is important in other ways too. It is impossible to improve our ethical performance unless there is a clear idea of how well or how badly we are doing. The argument that ethical performance should not be measured is moot since we already implicitly measure ethical performance in many ways. Transparency of outcomes merely sharpens our abilities to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>The value of transparency even extends to the entire effective altruist movement as a whole. One of its greatest achievements might be its reward of virtue signaling with status. Although few are likely to admit this openly, virtue signaling is an important ingredient of moral behavior. The Economist Thorstein Veblen is famous for his concept of conspicuous consumption: his insight that people purchase certain products and services only because of what it communicates about them to society. And yet, almost no attention has been devoted to conspicuous virtue, even though throughout history, people have always sought to communicate their virtue through obvious and exclusive signals: special clothing, unique architecture, and specific symbols.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, in comparison to conventional markers of virtue that have been degraded to mostly reward in-group membership above all else, the effective altruism movement still seeks to reward efficient ethical action above all else. This isn't to imply, however, that effective altruism is without significant problems of its own. In fact, in many cases, I will attempt to show that effective altruism suffers from either or both of these features:<br>1. Ethical complications.<br>2. Practical impossibility.</p><p>The rest of this essay will consist of four different sections. I shall begin by showing how conventional criticisms of effective altruism philosophy not only fail to hit the mark but also neglect less obvious and far more important problems. I shall then continue my criticism by using Peter Singer's famous drowning child paradox as an easy introduction into some of the ways effective altruism can go wrong. Third, I will consider the most prominent EA philosophy, longtermism, and argue that it should be discarded permanently. And finally, I shall propose some tentative solutions to some of the problems I will raise in earlier sections.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Why Many Criticisms Of Effective Altruism Fail To Hit The Mark&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The usual launchpad for many criticisms of effective altruism is to begin with its utilitarian similarities and exploit some of the famous contradictions that result. A familiar starting point is the famous trolley problem. Although details slightly vary, the trolley problem asks us to imagine a scenario in which a runaway trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (usually five) down a track, but a bystander can intervene only by diverting the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track.&nbsp;</p><p>It is obvious that strong utilitarianism recommends the option of diversion. As long as you are trying to maximize the number of lives saved, saving five lives is considerably superior to saving a single person. But the implications of that argument could be abominable. Consider the cosmetically different case of five dying people in need of organ donation. Is it acceptable to find one healthy innocent individual, murder him, and then transplant his organs to save the five dying people? Most people would recoil at such actions. Indeed, Nobel Laureate Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go creates an unforgettable emotional impact partly because our moral sensibilities are so strongly aligned against such actions. And yet, from the perspective of strict utilitarianism, this is the right thing to do.&nbsp;</p><p>The critic then often argues from these unpalatable conclusions back towards effective altruism and suggests or simply states that since utilitarianism is full of these problems, effective altruism is full of these problems as well<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref008m281b6fvqi\"><sup><a href=\"#fn008m281b6fvqi\">[2]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't consider this good criticism for four reasons. The first is that it is rather lazy. Utilitarianism is an old ethical system. Effective Altruism, on the other hand, is a quite recent one. To criticize the latter on grounds and issues that we have known about for decades does not teach us anything new. It is more useful to examine EA separately and criticize its own unique problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, although utilitarianism and effective altruism share a lot in common, they also have several features they do not share at all. Many in the EA community are firmly against the pure machiavellianism of the-ends-justify-the-means reasoning. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://80000hours.org/articles/harmful-career/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbl5_yo-n5AhVmxQIHHRX7CjoQFnoECAgQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Sz5XAX7gmoBfsdI9GKT3mAOvVaw3Sz5XAX7gmoBfsdI9GKT3m\">In a blog post by William Macaskill and Benjamin Todd, both authors clearly disapproved of the idea of taking a harmful job in order to be able to do more good as a result</a>. In addition, because effective altruism unlike utilitarianism is concerned with how to do good rather than what is or isn't good, EA does not necessarily imply that what is good is always the maximization of wellbeing. In fact, effective altruism does not imply any strict definitions of what is good. This moral 'looseness' is a virtue that sets it apart from the rigorous strictures of utilitarianism.&nbsp;</p><p>My third reason flows from the fact that these issues do not plague utilitarianism and EA alone. Other 'rigid' ethical theories create morally repellent conclusions as well. Take Duty-based Ethics. Different duties might conflict with each other, and the same obligation could be reasonable in one situation and dangerous in the next. Readers who have a passing familiarity with Asimov's three laws of robotics will easily recall the numerous contradictions which can be derived from rule-based ethics. It seems that every moral injunction - be honest or don't murder or maximize good, et cetera - can lead to at least one morally repellent conclusion in a particular context. As a caveat, however, because utilitarianism is concerned only with the potential surface area of any moral action, it opens itself up to many more morally repellent conclusions. This caveat will be useful later when I consider longtermism.&nbsp;</p><p>My fourth reason is perhaps the boldest of all because it asserts there is actually nothing wrong sometimes with choosing to divert the trolley in the trolley problem. In their paper, Lexical Dominance in Reasons and Values, Iwao Hirose and Kent Hurtig propose that if certain kinds of reasons denoted as M reasons typically dominate other kinds of reasons denoted as P reasons in terms of normative force, then we ought to choose the option which has a greater number of M reasons. If we consider saving a life as an M reason given how strongly it dominates many other kinds of moral justification, then it follows that we should rather save five lives by diverting than save one.&nbsp;</p><p>By way of illustration, consider the Allies' decision to invade Nazi Germany. It was obvious then and is obvious now that collateral damage would result: at least one innocent person would be killed or injured as a result, and many innocent people were. Still, no reasonable person can claim that it was morally wrong to invade Nazi Germany. It was the morally right decision then and if such unfortunate circumstances were to ever recur, it would be the morally right decision now. The argument from collateral damage does not alter that fact.&nbsp;</p><p>These criticisms should generally be retired from applying to effective altruism not only for the reasons adduced above but because they divert our attention from the several important problems that infect Effective Altruism as a whole. It is to those problems that I shall now turn to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Effective Altruism And The Drowning Child Parable.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Peter Singer is in many ways one of the most important living philosophers today. He is a recipient of the Berggruen prize, widely recognized as the 'Nobel Prize for philosophy', and is most famous for his drowning child parable, a strong contender for the most popular philosophical thought experiment in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The drowning child parable is a fundamental cornerstone of EA philosophy. It has served as the moment of conversion for many in the EA community. Singer himself is also an effective altruist and released an enthusiastic defense of the philosophy in 2015. As a lucid example and a foundational element of effective altruism, the drowning child parable is the perfect introduction into my contentions with the philosophy.&nbsp;</p><p>The clarity and conciseness of the drowning child parable is remarkable. Although there are slightly varying versions, I shall adopt the version used by Singer in his book, The Life You Can Save:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>'Imagine you\u2019re walking to work. You see a child drowning in a lake. You\u2019re about to jump in and save her when you realize you\u2019re wearing your best suit, and the rescue will end up costing hundreds in dry cleaning bills. Should you still save the child?'&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The natural and proper response is to say yes. No one with an ounce of morality would choose saving his or her suit over the life of a little girl. And then, Singer hits you with a sledgehammer of a conclusion: we all are guilty of the same crime we profess to be so fundamentally against. Every time we opt for some unnecessary consumption, say a new pair of shoes or a pointless new product, we have prioritized that over saving a child dying either close to us or in a faraway country. The parable subtly insinuates that our moral culpability is in many ways equal to that of a bystander who chooses to walk on to save his new expensive suit.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree - it's impossible not to - with Singer's parable as long as it is interpreted vaguely. Beyond that though, the drowning child parable is rather like a magic trick: by making an incident that attention grabbing front and center, it distracts us from what is truly going on. It is necessary to list out all the implicit assumptions which are present in that short story:&nbsp;</p><p>1.) The costs of the moral action is small: dry cleaning costs for a suit.&nbsp;</p><p>2.) The costs of the moral action is clear: nothing more than temporary damage to the bystander's suit is necessary to save the child's life&nbsp;</p><p>3.) The benefits of the moral action are huge: the saving of a little child's life.&nbsp;</p><p>4.) The benefits of the moral action are clear and can be estimated immediately: the bystander knows exactly what's at stake if he decides to dive in the pool. Feedback is also direct and immediate.&nbsp;</p><p>5.) The bystander has the capacity to solve the problem: it is assumed he can swim and is strong enough to carry her to safety.&nbsp;</p><p>6.) The action is a one-off: the bystander does not have to repeat this action over and over and over again.&nbsp;</p><p>7.) The bystander has no equally pressing problems at the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>8.) There are no relatives of the bystander, to whom he will owe a moral duty, who are also in dire need of help.&nbsp;</p><p>9.) The action results in absolute gain: the benefit of the moral action is not diluted by what anyone else does or doesn't do.&nbsp;</p><p>10.) There is no other person around with a specific moral, legal or political responsibility to help the child.&nbsp;</p><p>11.) The intent is strongly correlated with the possible result: By electing to help her, the bystander will not be unwittingly helping someone else who is in no need of any assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>12.) It is absolutely the best way to help her, and the bystander knows this: the problem is not complex with many possible solutions and there is no large degree of uncertainty around the best solution.&nbsp;</p><p>13.) There is nothing standing in the way of the bystander helping her&nbsp;</p><p>14.) The bystander can solve the problem on his own: solving the problem doesn't require any complex, large-scale response from many people acting in coordination.&nbsp;</p><p>15.) Her Input is unnecessary.&nbsp;</p><p>16.) His actions, if he chooses to save her, are very unlikely to make the situation worse.&nbsp;</p><p>The simple heartwarming story has made sixteen implicit and important assumptions, and possibly a few more. In the real world, it is often the case that many of these assumptions do not hold.&nbsp;</p><p>Take for instance assumption 1. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://tallpaul.ca/how-much-does-dry-cleaning-cost/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVzquZpOn5AhUpPewKHU-0BcEQFnoECBMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ufnybAScufEuHCRrpP5rqAOvVaw1ufnybAScufEuHCRrpP5rq\">The average dry cleaning costs of a suit is pegged at 12 to 15 dollars.</a> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.givewell.org/cost-to-save-a-life&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8gZK9pOn5AhWUXvEDHX9xDvgQFnoECBAQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0YwDuN69y7lABhpo_IP_Xh\">On the other hand, GiveWell estimates that it takes about 4,500 dollars to save a life</a>. There is a 300x difference between 15 and 4,500. Regardless of one's views on the matter, this substantially dilutes the force of the thought experiment. It simply costs a lot more to save a single life, even in the best of times.&nbsp;</p><p>Or take assumption 3, that the benefits are clear. This assumption hardly holds in the real world either. During the 1980s, the International Monetary Fund embarked on a project of massive loans to African countries in return for deregulating their local economies and adopting neoliberal free trade policies. These projects were often known as structural adjustment programs, and their overall impact has been paltry at best. Research by the revered economist, Ha Joon Chang, revealed that since the inception of structural adjustment programs, the economy of Sub-saharan Africa had barely grown by only 0.2 percent at the time of writing (between 1980 and 2009). In contrast, in the two decades prior to those policies, Sub-saharan African economies grew at 1.6 per cent in per capita terms<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref201pbjhshfs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn201pbjhshfs\">[3]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no need to attribute any intentions of malevolence to these organizations, although charges of negligence and arrogance might be more legitimate. The simple truth is growing an economy is hard. It's not merely hard but also complex. It's often difficult to predict the long-term effects of macroeconomic actions until after substantial periods of time. In contrast, the benefit of the moral action in saving the little girl's life is clear and can be estimated immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Asssumption 16 is also without guarantee. In his fascinating book Climate Alarmism And What It Costs Us All, Bjorn Lomborg writes:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>'In Fiji, the government teamed up with a Japanese technology company to deliver off-grid solar power to remote communities. They provided a centralized solar power unit to the village of Rukua. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama proudly declared he had \u201cno doubt that a number of development opportunities will be unlocked\u201d by the provision of \u201ca reliable source of energy.\u201d Understandably, all of Rukua was thrilled to get access to energy and wanted to take full advantage. So more than thirty households purchased refrigerators. Unfortunately, the off-grid solar energy system was incapable of powering more than three fridges at a time, so every night the power would be completely drained. That led to six households buying diesel generators. According to researchers who studied this project: \u201cRukua is now using about three times the amount of fossil fuel for electricity that was used prior to installation of the renewable energy system.\u201d In rather understated language, the researchers conclude that the project did not \u201cmeet the resilience building needs\u201d of the community.'&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Neither is assumption 11. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/493201582052636710/pdf/Elite-Capture-of-Foreign-Aid-Evidence-from-Offshore-Bank-Accounts.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwisj-e5pun5AhVH2aQKHek5C-4QFnoECAcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GKasGGdLRTbUYKIK9jaBiAOvVaw2GKasGGdLRTbUYKIK9jaBi\">In a report released in 2020 by the World Bank, about 7.5 percent of foreign aid is estimated to be diverted into offshore accounts of tax havens like Luxembourg</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Assumption 9, the assumption of absolute gain, presents similar difficulties. By absolute gain, I mean certain goods are useful intrinsically. Survival for instance is an absolute gain. People's desire to survive are generally not based on whether other people around them have survived or not. Almost everyone alive in the world today has definitely lost someone close to them and still kept on living. Certain other desires like the need for basic shelter, clothing, and food can also be said to be absolute. Without absolute gains, people are very unlikely to be happy. Indeed, they are very unlikely to exist at all.&nbsp;</p><p>But not all gains are absolute. Some goods are only valued because other people don't have them. Whether they make people happier depends strongly on what other people around them already have or don't have. Beyond a basic cutoff, almost everything is of this nature. Although it does not bear admitting, status is an important component of happiness, and gains in status can only be relative. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/study_says_money/%23:~:text%3DChina-,Study%2520says%2520money%2520only%2520makes%2520you%2520happy%2520if%2520it%2520makes,it%2520improves%2520their%2520social%2520rank.&amp;ved=2ahUKEwig27jhpen5AhUCr6QKHXoVCwEQFnoECAgQBQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ZiUUZjNjWry7r4cDO0aZpAOvVaw2ZiUUZjNjWry7r4cDO0aZp\">A study performed by researchers at the Universities of Warwick and Cardiff found that beyond a certain point, money only makes people happier if it means they are richer in relative terms.</a> People will often reject the chance to be richer in absolute terms if it meant they were also relatively less well-off. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233789504_Rejection_of_unfair_offers_in_the_ultimatum_game_is_no_evidence_of_strong_reciprocity&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiS-4eHpun5AhVIxwIHHTWcAcQQFnoECBAQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tnk6GNWhVhAKi6uwSqnTTAOvVaw0tnk6GNWhVhAKi6uwSqnTT\">Multiple studies of the ultimatum game across the world have replicated this phenomenon</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being thousands of times richer than the average man, billionaires are not thousands of times happier than the rest of us. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/can-money-buy-happiness-a-review-of-new-data&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA1LOfpen5AhUzXvEDHVCzDQEQtwJ6BAgcEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DY8_Q4yY-bFUgmhMicQUJ\">The most recent analysis of the diminishing utility of money by Matthew Killingworth suggests that the relationship between money and happiness plateaus at 200,000 dollars.</a> It seems that after some cutoff, doing all the good you possibly can will have negative returns once you adjust for the cost of your efforts relative to its diminishing utility. The returns in happiness from making everyone much better off are far smaller than they initially appear once you account for the human tendency to get used to things and the fact that a lot of happiness derives from relative improvement rather than absolute improvement in welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>Assumption 6 is also suspect. Poverty is not simply a function of having less money and thereby needing more donations. It is best understood of as a collective problem. Till date, no country in history has ever gotten wealthy through charity. As long as the root problems remain unfixed, the one-off is unlikely to make much of a difference. Such charity might even backfire if it creates perverse incentives of dependence or if it is suddenly taken away, returning its former recipients to a less satisfactory life than they had before.&nbsp;</p><p>These are merely a sample of the many, many problems that can result when thought experiments are interpreted too literally. The farther the conditions of reality are from the assumptions of the drowning child parable, the less valuable it is as a guide to our actions except in the loosest sense possible. Unfortunately, in the overwhelming majority of situations, many of these implicit assumptions hold very weakly or fail to hold at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is effective altruism can be at its most effective when dealing with problems that resemble the drowning child parable as closely as possible. The remarkable success of EA in charity donations, organ donations, and vaccines is clear proof. These problems are all one-off, absolute gain problems where many of the other assumptions clearly hold.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it's a common mistake to identify Effective Altruism with donation work, it clearly still remains one of its most significant achievements. In an heartwarming example from GiveWell, \"over 110,000 individual donors have used GiveWell\u2019s research to contribute more than $1 billion to its recommended charities, supporting organisations like the Against Malaria Foundation, which has distributed over 200 million insecticide-treated bednets. Collectively, these efforts are estimated to have saved 159,000 lives\".&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is the farther away effective altruism moves from solvingproblems which replicate these assumptions, the worse things tend to get. Perhaps the clearest proof of this is longtermism, a very recent effective altruist philosophy with some very unpalatable implications.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Rise of Longtermism&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Longtermism is, without doubt, the most novel and most influential contribution of effective altruism. It has received endorsement from billionaires such as Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin and Dustin Moskowitz. William Macaskill's fascinating new book, What We Owe the Future, has attracted a wide amount of attention and praise with several reviews in the most influential print media around. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LRmEezoeeqGhkWm2p/ea-is-more-than-longtermism&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiw2Kf3heL5AhUI_6QKHS9VBF0QFnoECAkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2uQJ_vBF8-9Kq5NwBxed86\">Longtermism is so influential now that many within and outside the EA community simply conflate the two. At present, this is still significantly mistaken but current trends suggest that such assumptions will be less out of place a couple of years from now</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The ideas behind longtermism are not new. Many ancient cultures enshrine long-term considerations for the future. The Maori people of New Zealand, for instance, often use the word kaitiakitanga, a deeply held, ancient belief which roughly translates to protecting the environment for the sake of future generations. However, longtermism goes beyond such vague concerns and makes a set of very precise claims. These precise claims, as I will show, lead to all manner of repugnant conclusions and illogical implications. Longtermism is not merely inconsistent but also morally repellent and highly irrelevant.&nbsp;</p><p>To preserve the clarity required to demonstrate my claims, I shall focus mainly on The Case For Strong Longtermism by Hilary Greaves and William Macaskill. Three factors have influenced my decision: first off, it is fairly recent and so can be taken as a decent approximation of longtermism. Second, it is extremely rigorous. This makes it fairly impossible to misinterpret any claims in good faith. The third is it comprehensively covers all aspects of longtermism. However, from time to time, other texts will also be making an appearance.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Conventional Criticisms Again Fail To Hit The Mark.</strong></p><p>There are three specific claims that underlie longtermism:&nbsp;</p><p>1.) Many more people will exist in the future than already exist right now.&nbsp;</p><p>2.) Future lives matter just as much as the lives of people living today.&nbsp;</p><p>3.)We can positively affect future lives.&nbsp;</p><p>As long as you accept these three premises, it follows that our most important moral responsibility is towards future lives. More concretely, our strongest moral duty is to maximize the survival and flourishing of as many future lives as possible. And so, we have two key moral responsibilities:&nbsp;</p><p>a.) To increase the quality of future lives as much as we can.&nbsp;</p><p>b.) To maximize the survival chances of human civilization.&nbsp;</p><p>In The Case For Strong Longtermism, Will Macaskill and Hilary Greaves distinguish between deontic strong longtermism and axiological strong longtermism. But such distinctions cannot reasonably hold beyond a certain point: the essential premise that we must maximize the wellbeing of future lives makes longtermism indistinguishable from utilitarianism. The moral 'looseness' of Effective Altruism is impossible with longtermism. This makes longtermism equally vulnerable to all the criticisms of utilitarianism that were considered earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Olle H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m, professor of mathematical statistics and noted longtermist asks us to imagine a situation where the head of the CIA informs the American president that somewhere in Germany is a lunatic working on a doomsday weapon to wipe out humanity and that this lunatic has about a one-in-a-million chance of success. To complicate matters, they have no further information on his identity and location.&nbsp;</p><p>In H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m's own words:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>'If the president has taken Bostrom\u2019s argument to heart, and if he knows how to do the arithmetic, he may conclude that it is worthwhile conducting a full-scale nuclear assault on Germany to kill every single person within its borders.'&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Ironically, longtermism and utilitarianism are very brittle once you scale them up.&nbsp;</p><p>Many criticisms of Longtermism have tried to weaken either premise 2 or premise 3, by claiming that future lives cannot be weighted equally or by casting doubt on our ability to affect future lives in positive ways. These criticisms are valid and legitimate. In particular, premise 3 is susceptible to the principle of epistemic cluelessness; that is, our inability to predict the effects of our actions over a considerable period of time. To repeat the countless examples from our history that prove this point would take up entire libraries.&nbsp;</p><p>But I don't like these criticisms. Take criticism of the second premise: future lives should not be weighted equally. Even if this point is conceded and we assume that future lives should matter say half as much as the lives of those living today, the simple possibility that there could be vastly more future lives shifts the argument in favour of longtermism again.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider a simple scenario where the lives of each person living today is deemed to have 100 percent worth. Current estimates put human population at approximately 8 billion people. If we assume that 100 percent of worth is equal to 1 unit of worth, this makes 8 billion units of worth overall. A longtermist can simply and quite reasonably claim that 16 billion or more future lives will exist and we are back to where we started since 16 billion x 0.5 units of worth = 8 billion units of worth. Many longtermists even assert that the number of future lives will be many orders higher.&nbsp;</p><p>Criticisms of premise 3 are also of this sort. Even if we assign extremely low probabilities of our abilities to help future lives positively, longtermists can simply claim that the payoff is so massive anyway that the expected value of longtermism still requires that its claims should be taken seriously. These arguments and counter arguments are merely a sophisticated version of a Yes, it is/ No, it isn't game. They are extremely sensitive to the biases of the people in question.</p><p>In contrast, I am concerned less with the viability of longtermism's premises which have been pursued exquisitely elsewhere, than I am with several of its important implications. In my opinion, a philosophy becomes dangerous the moment it regards the future as more certain than the past.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Argument From Repugnance.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although the authors of The Case For Strong Longtermism claim that it is compatible with both deontological and utilitarian ethics, the premises of longtermism prioritize utilitarianism. By virtue of its premises, a longtermist is morally obligated to maximize the wellbeing of future lives. Longtermists' arguments are even stronger: they argue that it is everyone's moral obligation to maximize the wellbeing of future lives.&nbsp;</p><p>This makes longtermism intimately connected with population ethics - a recent branch of philosophy concerned with the ethical problems that arise when our actions affect who is born and how many people are born in the future. In order to maximize the wellbeing of future lives, a longtermist has to make consistent comparisons between different possible worlds of future lives<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo4h3qeli6f\"><sup><a href=\"#fno4h3qeli6f\">[4]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>In his new book, What We Owe The Future, William Macaskill carefully analyzes the different theories of population ethics. Averagism, for instance, is the theory that aims to maximize the average wellbeing of future lives. A population is superior to another when its average wellbeing is higher. But Averagism is susceptible to the sadistic conclusion: adding many lives of positive wellbeing can decrease average wellbeing more than adding a few lives of negative wellbeing. A life of positive wellbeing is a life of +1, +2, ... units of wellbeing. A life of negative wellbeing, on the other hand, is a life of -1, -2, -3, ... units of wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>Under averagism, adding a few lives of -100 wellbeing can be superior to adding many many lives of +5 wellbeing since the average will decrease less in the first instance. Since such implications are morally repugnant, Macaskill rejects the principle. He also rejects other views with other similarly repugnant conclusions before settling on Totalism, the view that one population is better than another if its total wellbeing is higher.&nbsp;</p><p>But Totalism has problems of its own. Suppose a possible world with a billion flourishing lives. According to Totalism, another world with a larger number of people living lives barely worth living is superior as long as its total positive wellbeing is higher. This implication was so deeply problematic for philosopher Derek Parfit, upon whose seminal work population ethics is founded, that he rejected Totalism as well in favour of a possible Theory X that would not generate such conclusions. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/08/no-theory-x-in-shining-armour.html&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi257eb49j5AhWpVvEDHUXMDoAQFnoECCYQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fuyS4zZVBK5R4EArlmdEFAOvVaw0fuyS4zZVBK5R4EArlmdEF\">Such a theory X is impossible. In 1989, the economist Yew-Kwang Ng proved that as long as you accept the perfectly reasonable principle that between two worlds of equal numbers of people, the world with more wellbeing in total and on average is superior, then you cannot go on to reject Totalism</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, as far as I know, there is no possible theory of population ethics which can satisfy these three criteria:&nbsp;</p><p>1.) Adding lives of positive wellbeing is always good.&nbsp;</p><p>2.) Lives of positive wellbeing are always better than lives of negative wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>3.) Lives of more positive wellbeing are always superior to lives of less positive wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>Totalism satisfies criteria 1 and 2 but not criteria 3. Critical level theories satisfy criteria 3 but fail to satisfy either 1 or 2. Other theories fail in similar ways.&nbsp;</p><p>To be fair, Macaskill is fully aware of the repugnant implications of Totalism. He simply argues that this repugnance is preferable to that of other theories. I'm not satisfied with this acceptance. First off, the repugnant and sadistic implications of all population ethics theories indicates that the real problem is the utilitarian approach they are all based on. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.philosophy.rutgers.edu/docman-lister/adobe-pdf-documents/226-solving-parfit-s-puzzles-marcos-picchio-rutgers-university/file&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSju6wqOn5AhWKs6QKHWPTDG4QFnoECAYQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xoDICo0G4Vx1l64tD2sDI\">As a result, some have argued and I concur that some version of theory X will only be possible with a non-consequentialist ethical theory</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, all evidence suggests that Totalism is not how people in real life choose between different options of different populations with different standards of life. If we roughly assume GDP as a functional proxy for wellbeing, and there is a strong case that it is<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc3jg4t4b8t6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc3jg4t4b8t6\">[5]</a></sup></span>, then according to Totalism, countries like China and India with higher GDPs overall should be preferable by intending immigrants to countries like Singapore and Switzerland. We should therefore expect immigrants to choose to immigrate to China and India rather than to the latter two.&nbsp;</p><p>The opinions of immigrants are preferred because they constitute one of the clearest indicators of how well a country is doing not only because people always vote with their feet even in the face of daunting obstacles, but also because these opinions are less tainted by bias and patriotism and mediated instead by the simple incentive of which place is better. Immigrants have everything to gain by making the right decisions. The data suggests what we already know: intending immigrants themselves do not see it this way.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_150 150w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_450 450w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_750 750w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_1050 1050w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_1200 1200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_1350 1350w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1987d8891660b3829f8439f39c2b2120e6291e94bcbea979.jpg/w_1450 1450w\"></figure><p>It is clear from the image that immigrants are more concerned with the probability that they will live a better life than they already do rather than with the total wellbeing of the receiving country. If they acted according to Totalism, it would be a very different list. A utilitarian model that began along these lines would at the very least conform to how people behave in the real world when forced or asked to choose between two different standards of life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why Do Utilitarian Models Have These Issues.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The reason all population ethics theories lead to such morally repellent conclusions is because utilitarianism makes a fundamental mistake about moral outcomes: morals are not the same as math.&nbsp;</p><p>In math, +4 and -8, +2 and +2, +100 and -96, ... are all perfectly equivalent. They all sum up to 4. There is no world in which + 4 and - 8 is not equal to +2 and +2 without violating some fundamental laws of arithmetic. Mathematical statements are input insensitive as long as the outputs are equal to one another. Moral outcomes don't work the same way. They are input sensitive. Imagine a person who cheats at his exams, scores full marks, and is extremely happy as a result. Assume also that he would be equally happy if he had scored full marks on merit. If moral outcomes were like arithmetical statements, there would be no relevant distinction between those two situations. As far as the outcome is concerned, he is equally happy in both cases.</p><p>But very few reasonable people would agree that since the outputs in happiness were the same, the two inputs were now equal to each other. In the same vein, it matters a great deal how we arrive at any moral outcome. 1 thousand people living lives barely worth living is not regarded as equal in any way to 100 people living flourishing lives even if their outputs in positive wellbeing units add up to the same thing. Morality is input sensitive even when the outcomes are equal. And as long as nothing fundamentally changes about human morality, utilitarianism is going to keep running into these problems forever.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Argument From Extinction Risk</strong></p><p>Since the primary moral obligation under longtermism is to maximize the wellbeing of future lives, it follows that the survival of future lives is of paramount importance. After all, there is no maximizing of future wellbeing if there are no future lives at all. Hence, extinction risk is the ultimate catastrophe for any serious longtermist. <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/yew-kwang-ng-anticipating-effective-altruism/\">The Economist Yew-Kwang Ng, who predates many of the ideas of longtermism, has expressed in an interview that 'If we all die, our future welfare become zero. This is a big loss'.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Similarly, in What We Owe the Future, Macaskill reproduces Derek Parfit's sentiments on extinction risk and comes to a similar conclusion: \u201cwhat now matters most is that we avoid ending human history.\u201d But such ideas are actually logically inconsistent with Totalism.&nbsp;</p><p>Totalism, as we already know, is the view that we should maximize the total positive wellbeing of future lives. The flip side of that is we should also minimize the total negative wellbeing of future lives. Person affecting views, which are committed to preventing lives with negative wellbeing from being born but not committed to creating lives with positive wellbeing, are rejected by Parfit and Macaskill for their moral asymmetry.&nbsp;</p><p>The rejection of person affecting views stands on legitimate grounds. But it also means in the event that possible future people might have lives of horrific deprivation, it is our duty under Totalism to ensure they do not exist at all. Or to put it more clearly, preventing the misery of future generations by preventing their existence if necessary is a stronger moral obligation under Totalism than preventing existential risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this is in direct conflict with the creed of longtermism, Greaves and Macaskill try to resolve this by assuming that strong longtermism is conditional on a large and fixed future population anyway and we are simply affecting how good or bad their lives will be. I find this a case of burning the mansion to save the shed. If a large fixed population of future lives will exist regardless, then it is completely illogical to care about extinction risk - after all, no matter what we do now, a future population will exist.&nbsp;</p><p>Any concern about existential risk is rendered meaningless given that assumption. By trying to protect their sentiments of extinction risk as the worst thing that can happen to human civilization, they have relegated the prevention of existential risk from an inferior moral obligation to a moral obligation that cannot exist at all. The only way to evade this dilemma is either to discard Totalism or to assume that any version of existence, regardless of how painful or wretched or miserable, is still positive wellbeing. But such an assumption is not only morally offensive, it contradicts many longtermists' own views about euthanasia and the quality of existence ( euthanasia is an immoral act under these conditions). It also renders the very notion of negative wellbeing strictly impossible.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Argument From Unknown Unknowns</strong></p><p>As I wrote earlier, epistemic cluelessness is not a very robust criticism because it is susceptible to the bias of the people in question. Cluelessness is really an argument from known unknowns - we cannot predict the long-term effects of our actions or of the state of humanity. We simply know that we do not know these things.&nbsp;</p><p>There is, however, a substantially stronger variant of the argument I will present here, which is the argument from unknown unknowns. Consider for a moment the most important problems facing Europe and the world today: weakening democracies, climate change, AI risks and technological displacement, among others. If we backtrack merely five hundred years before, a blink compared to the amount of time sentient life has existed, we find a completely different situation.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm8sOLqOn5AhVTIMUKHaOYDTsQFnoECDcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0NaRDBwilEuKIufx1uu3lIAOvVaw0NaRDBwilEuKIufx1uu3lI\">Europe was nearing the end of a mini ice age</a>, exactly the opposite of the global warming crisis we face today. There were virtually no democracies on the continent, and the earliest precursor of the computer would not arrive until well over two hundred years later. The idea that the common man was entitled to political representation or that computers could do as good a job as humans or that burning fossil fuels warms the climate weren't just risks that Europeans at the time couldn't anticipate. It was more the case that underlying those risks were concepts they weren't even familiar with in any reasonable way. They weren't just things they knew they didn't know. They were things they didn't even know they didn't know. They were unknown unknowns.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, these unknown unknowns constitute some of the most important problems Europeans and the rest of us face today. That's because problems aren't problems in isolation. A problem grows out of the current state of that particular society. It is a relationship between what we have solved and what we are yet to, between what we know and what we know we don't. At any given time, a society's problems can only be known unknowns. They cannot be unknown unknowns.&nbsp;</p><p>When I look at the considerable efforts of longtermists today, the same pattern is evident. The problems longtermists prioritize are all problems that we either have right now or can reasonably anticipate having in the future: emerging biotechnology risks, AI alignment, Climate Change, etc. They are all known unknowns we've not yet solved for, either in terms of pure technological capability or in terms of summoning an adequate societal response. They lie just outside or fairly outside the edge of our capabilities as a society.&nbsp;</p><p>We cannot even begin to anticipate, let alone deal with unknown unknowns because we have not solved the problems we already have. To get to AI risk, we had to solve computation, a suite of hardware problems, invent new algorithms, and harness deep learning models among others. It was only by solving the problems of manufacturing and agriculture and transportation that we could even begin to have substantial impact on the climate of the earth.&nbsp;</p><p>So, we arrive at a reasonable conclusion: the only way to help future lives is by solving problems we already have or anticipate. We help them by helping ourselves. We have no possible way of rendering more assistance because the problems they will face will only grow out of the problems we have removed from their path. At any given moment, there are at least three to five different generations currently in the world right now. A philosophy that therefore simply prioritized solving all the problems people alive already face or will grow up to face is not a philosophy that can be improved upon by longtermism. And yet, this philosophy, which I will call, for lack of a better term, existing lives-ism, makes no additional assumptions about the number and nature of future lives in the distant future or about their worth or about whether they will be digital, physical, or some hybrid of both.&nbsp;</p><p>In the scientific discipline and much else, when two theories produce the same results and generate the same predictions, we should opt for the theory with the fewer number of assumptions. This well-known principle is known as Occam's Razor. In the words of Albert Einstein,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\" the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.\u201d&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I see no reason not to apply Occam's Razor here. Since existing lives-ism pretty much leads us to the same place as longtermism and since it also makes far fewer assumptions, existing lives-ism is the superior moral theory. To the extent that longtermism is useful, it is highly irrelevant.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Argument From Dependence</strong></p><p>In The Case For Strong Longtermism, both authors acknowledge that one of the strongest criticisms of longtermism is its reliance on extremely low probabilities of extremely large payoffs. As long as the expected value is higher, a longtermist will prefer to save or help the lives of trillions of future people with a very low probability of success than help a large number of people, often numbering in the millions, with a far higher probability of success. They are remarkably non risk averse. They demonstrate a stronger preference for 'recklessness' than 'timidity' as long as the expected value of the decision is higher. This inclination could be regarded as fanaticism.&nbsp;</p><p>In their excellent paper on decision theory, Nick Beckstead and Teruji Thomas demonstrate that both timidity and recklessness lead to uncomfortable conclusions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefehbgs5cs6ob\"><sup><a href=\"#fnehbgs5cs6ob\">[6]</a></sup></span>. Timidity and recklessness in these contexts have very specific denotations that I will not bother to reproduce. Suffice to say that a reckless decision maker will ignore the odds no matter how small as long as the expected payoff is large enough and a timid decision maker will only act if the odds are high enough even when the payoff is considerably lower than the other option. Since longtermists are clearly in favour of recklessness, they often argue about how timidity leads to non transitive preferences or are susceptible to random events and uncertainties, a criticism Hayden Wilkinson memorably labeled Indology and Egyptology.&nbsp;</p><p>They generally omit that recklessness itself also violates certain principles of decision theory and can lead to absurdities where the decision maker will prefer the tiniest probabilities of success if the reward is infinite, odds like 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 and even smaller probabilities of success as long as the reward is infinite, almost effectively guaranteeing that the decision maker can rerun the same decision hundreds of thousands of times and still never win.&nbsp;</p><p>But, on the whole, I have no problem with fanaticism. To reject it could lead to equally strange conclusions. It's all perfectly fine to choose the option with the higher expected value, regardless of the odds. But this is only if the options are independent. Quite remarkably, no longtermist seems to have considered that fact. As long as the two choices are independent, then fanaticism is a fine course of action and expected value is a fine guide. When they are not, it is a completely different matter.&nbsp;</p><p>Future lives don't just pop out of the blue. If the world had ended in 1700, there would be no humans today. Just as tritely, if it had gone extinct at any possible time before the moment you are reading this, there would no longer be any future lives. Future lives depend on present lives to exist.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, the choices between helping future lives and helping present lives aren't independent choices. Consider a hypothetical case of helping Mary with 95 percent probability of success or her fifty hypothetical descendants with a 5 percent chance of success. If all you are trying to do is maximize lives saved, then the option is clear: expected value dictates that you choose these fifty hypothetical descendants. But that would frankly be both illogical and impossible. The only way to help Mary's hypothetical descendants would be to save Mary now. If Mary dies, they all cease to exist.&nbsp;</p><p>This recurs on a wider scale. Should you save ten million people now or the billions of future lives that will exist later. These options are not independent. The existence of many of those future lives depend on those ten million people who longtermists quickly ignore in making their simple calculations. Should you save 99 percent of the current world's population or all the future lives that will ever exist at far lower odds of success. Expected Value recommends the second option. Common sense realizes that the second option isn't an option at all.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a bit like choosing to fail at the quarter final because the final will offer a much greater payoff. Life isn't independent. It is sequential. Options can only exist later if we choose the option of prioritizing now. Nothing more is logical. Nothing less is necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>A Few Recommendations And A Conclusion.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I have the deepest respect for many in the EA community. I consider it an important alternative or supplement to organized religion for many and applaud the charitable work of many effective altruists. I don't think there is a lot wrong with EA in practice as of the moment. But there is certainly a lot wrong with it in theory. And the boundaries between theory and practice are often less rigid than they often appear.&nbsp;</p><p>As J.M Keynes memorably expressed,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>'Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back'.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I shall offer four main suggestions:&nbsp;</p><p>1.) Effective Altruism is best at dealing with one off, absolute gain problems which possess many of the other assumptions of Peter Singer's the drowning child analogy. Examples of this include charitable donations, organ donations, vaccine rollouts, and simple aid. None of it should be underestimated. However, it is really bad at solving problems that diverge considerably from those assumptions. The farther away the problems are from the drowning child parable, the less certain I am of effective altruism's effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>2.) In cases like these, effective altruists have to make much more effort than they currently are at reaching out to other kinds of experts and incorporating different kinds of approaches. Some of that will include making tradeoffs between effectiveness and altruism, since many of these problems will not be amenable to strict metrics and measurement. It is interesting that this paradox was grasped by J.S Mill upon which he dissolved the Utilitarian Society.&nbsp;</p><p>Mill intuitively realized that although happiness should always be the end goal, it was best tackled indirectly without the metrics and rigour of utilitarianism, because happiness was an ill-defined problem. The problems that so obsess longtermists such as AI alignment and pandemic risks are also Ill defined problems. Solving them will require making use of obliquity, indirectness, and bottom-up gradualism, and somewhat letting go of metrics and measurement.&nbsp;</p><p>3.) A possible version of theory X will have to incorporate ideas from non consequentialist moral philosophy to truly be meaningful. It will also have to start with how people in the real world already make decisions between different countries rather than with theoretical principles that do not translate to realistic behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>4.) Longtermism should be abandoned. This recommendation is bold but certainly worth thinking about in light of the issues already raised above. The truth is life is a bit like a book. If we hold it too close, we can't read it at all. If we hold it too far away, we recreate the same problem. A moral theory that starts with trying to create a better world <strong>for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and great grandchildren only </strong>will lead us to the same kind of concern and prudence about the future I believe longtermists actually care about, make fewer arbitrary assumptions, and conform perfectly with other moral theories and attitudes.&nbsp;</p><p>We certainly need more good in the world and effective altruism will definitely play its part in contributing to that. We may never be able to maximize all the good we can do. That's all right as long as we keep doing all the good we already are. Our journey to paradise might never end. In some fundamental sense, that might be the whole point.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn8o7bxdw41ny\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref8o7bxdw41ny\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>What's Wrong With Economics (Skidelsky, 2020).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn008m281b6fvqi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref008m281b6fvqi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For an extremely well written example of this kind of criticism, see Erik Hoel, Why I am Not An Effective Altruist. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-an-effective-altruist&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5q-btp-n5AhUkuaQKHfuHCmEQFnoECAQQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3oE6S40td-dO-6eIyo4tg-AOvVaw3oE6S40td-dO-6eIyo4tg-\n\">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-an-effective-altruist&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5q-btp-n5AhUkuaQKHfuHCmEQFnoECAQQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3oE6S40td-dO-6eIyo4tg-AOvVaw3oE6S40td-dO-6eIyo4tg-</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn201pbjhshfs\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref201pbjhshfs\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism (Chang, 2010).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fno4h3qeli6f\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefo4h3qeli6f\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For an excellent introduction into population ethics and its many troubling views, see What We Owe The Future, Chapter 8 ( Macaskill, 2022).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnc3jg4t4b8t6\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefc3jg4t4b8t6\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>See Stubborn Attachments (Cowen, 2018).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnehbgs5cs6ob\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefehbgs5cs6ob\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For a comprehensive analysis of the impracticalities of both approaches, see A Paradox For Tiny Probabilities and Enormous Values ( Beckstead and Thomas, 2021).</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Refined Insights "}}, {"_id": "ktEzS3pkfeqPNh6r5", "title": "AI strategy nearcasting", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T16:25:24.411Z", "htmlBody": "<p><em>Cross-posted from the <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Qo2EkG3dEMv8GnX8d/ai-strategy-nearcasting\">Alignment Forum</a> / <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Qo2EkG3dEMv8GnX8d/ai-strategy-nearcasting\">Less Wrong</a></em></p>\n\n<p> This is the first in a series of pieces taking a stab at dealing with a conundrum: </p> <ul>\n\n<li>I believe this could be the <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/\">most important century ever for humanity</a>, via the development of advanced AI systems that could dramatically speed up scientific and technological advancement, getting us more quickly than most people imagine to a deeply unfamiliar future.\n\n</li><li>But when it comes to what <em>actions we can take</em> to help such a development go well instead of poorly, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/\">hard to say much</a> (with a <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/#robustly-helpful-actions\">few exceptions</a>). This is because <strong>many actions that would be helpful under one theory of how things will play out would be harmful under another</strong> (for example, see my <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/\">discussion </a>of the \u201ccaution\u201d frame vs. the \u201ccompetition\u201d frame). </li> </ul> <p> It seems to me that in order to more productively take actions (including making more grants), we need to get more clarity on some <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zGiD94SHwQ9MwPyfW/important-actionable-research-questions-for-the-most\">crucial questions</a> such as \u201cHow serious is the threat of a world run by <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/\">misaligned AI</a>?\u201d But it\u2019s hard to answer questions like this, when we\u2019re talking about a development (<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/\">transformative AI</a>) that may take place some indeterminate number of decades from now. </p> <p> This piece introduces one possible framework for dealing with this conundrum. The framework is <strong>AI strategy nearcasting: trying to answer key strategic questions about transformative AI, under the assumption that key events </strong>(e.g., the development of transformative AI) <strong>will happen in a world that is otherwise relatively similar to today's. </strong>One (but not the only) version of this assumption would be \u201cTransformative AI will be developed soon, using methods like what AI labs focus on today.\u201d </p> <p> The term is inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowcasting_(economics)\">nowcasting</a>. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/maps/fivethirtyeight-2016-now-cast\">FiveThirtyEight Now-Cast</a> projects \"who would win the election if it were held today,\u201d which is easier than projecting who will win the election when it is actually held. I think imagining transformative AI being developed <em>today</em> is a bit much, but \u201cin a world otherwise relatively similar to today\u2019s\u201d seems worth grappling with. </p> <h2 id=\"Some-potential-benefits-of-nearcasting-and-reservations\">Some potential benefits of nearcasting, and reservations</h2>\n\n<p> A few <strong>benefits </strong>of nearcasting (all of which are speculative): </p> <p> As with nowcasting, nearcasting can <strong>serve as a jumping-off point</strong>. If we have an idea of what the best actions to take <em>would be if transformative AI were developed in a world otherwise similar to today\u2019s, </em>we can then start asking \u201cAre there particular ways in which we expect the future to be different from the nearer term, that should change our picture of which actions would be most helpful?\u201d </p> <p> Nearcasting can also focus our attention on the scenarios that are <strong>not only easiest to imagine concretely, but also arguably \u201chighest-stakes.\u201d </strong>Worlds in which transformative AI is developed especially soon are worlds in which the \u201cnearcasting\u201d assumptions are especially likely to hold - and these are also worlds in which we will have especially little time to react to crucial developments as they unfold. They are thus worlds in which it will be especially valuable to have thought matters through in advance. (They are also likely to be worlds in which transformative AI most \u201ctakes the world by surprise,\u201d such that the efforts of people paying attention today are most likely to be disproportionately helpful.) </p> <p> Nearcasting <strong>might give us a sort of feedback loop for learning: if we do nearcasting now and in the future, we can see how the conclusions </strong>(in terms of which actions would be most helpful today) <strong>change over time</strong>, and perhaps learn something from this. </p> <ul>\n\n<li>I could easily imagine that we will learn more from repeated attempts to ask \u201cWhat should we do if transformative AI is just around the corner?\u201d, whose conclusions will change as the world changes, than from a persistent effort to refine our answer to \u201cWhat should we do under our best-guess picture of the world, in which transformative AI is (for example) 30 years away from today?\u201d\n\n</li><li>To be clear, I don\u2019t think this is a \u201cgreat\u201d or even \u201cgood\u201d feedback loop for learning, but in the space of transformative AI strategy, <em>any</em> such feedback loops are hard to come by, so I see some appeal here. </li> </ul> <p> A major <strong>reservation </strong>about nearcasting (as an activity in general, not relative to forecasting) is that people are arguably quite bad at reasoning about future hypothetical scenarios,<sup id=\"fnref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> and most of the most impressive human knowledge to date arguably has relied heavily on empirical observations and experimentation. AI strategy nearcasting seems destined to be vastly inferior to e.g. good natural sciences work, in terms of how much we can trust its conclusions. </p> <p> I think this reservation is valid as stated, and I expect any nearcast to look pretty silly in at least some respects with the benefit of hindsight. But I still think nearcasting (and, more generally, analyzing hypothetical future scenarios with transformative AI<sup id=\"fnref2\"><a href=\"#fn2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>) is probably under-invested in today: </p> <ul>\n\n<li>The potential stakes are enormous. Even a small amount of additional clarity about <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/\">how to make the best of the most important century</a> would be immensely valuable.\n\n</li><li>I don\u2019t think the case for \u201cpeople are bad at reasoning about hypothetical future scenarios\u201d or \u201cpeople are bad at reasoning about the long-run future\u201d is all <em>that</em> strong, (<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/the-track-record-of-futurists-seems-fine/\">more</a>). Moreover (as also noted at that link), past attempts at futurism didn\u2019t make use of many of what appear to be \u201cforecasting best practices\u201d today, such as assigning quantitative probabilities to predictions. The <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Superforecasting-audiobook/dp/B0131HGPQQ/\">science of forecasting</a> is young, and there\u2019s probably a lot of room for improvement on past attempts.\n\n</li><li>Finally, I am broadly <strong>against putting too much weight on \u201cthe track record of a particular kind of thinking,\u201d</strong> mostly because I think such track records tend to be inconclusive.\n<ul>\n\n<li>I think that for almost any rules you can come up with about \u201cwhat good intellectual inquiry looks like,\u201d there\u2019s been some good intellectual inquiry that breaks those rules.\n\n</li><li>I also think that (partly due to <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/wheres-todays-beethoven/\">low-hanging-fruit dynamics</a>) a lot of the most valuable innovations have historically come from something more like \u201cWork on a very neglected question and try to \u2018just be reasonable,\u2019 without sweating whether one\u2019s methodology has a good track record\u201d than like \u201cUse a super-established methodology that looks like how past innovations have happened.\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/to-match-the-greats-dont-follow-in-their-footsteps/\">More</a>) </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> I think part of the challenge of this kind of work is having reasonable judgment about which aspects of a hypothetical scenario are too specific to place big bets on, vs. which aspects represent relatively robust themes that would apply to many possible futures. </p> <ul>\n\n<li>For example, I think it is reasonable to predict that the global average temperature will rise over the coming several decades, even as it is very difficult to predict whether it will be raining on some day even a few weeks away.\n\n</li><li>I have some views on what sorts of aspects of the future I\u2019d generally expect to be tractable vs. intractable to predict,<sup id=\"fnref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> but I make no claim to have well-grounded takes here. I think that if there were more efforts at analyzing hypothetical future scenarios, we\u2019d probably collectively learn more about such things. </li></ul> <h2 id=\"The-nearcast-Ill-be-discussing\">The nearcast I\u2019ll be discussing</h2>\n\n<p> Starting here, and continuing into future pieces, I\u2019m going to lay out a \u201cnearcast\u201d that shares many (not all) assumptions with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y3sWcbcF7np35nzgu/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-1\">this piece by Ajeya Cotra </a>(which I would highly recommend reading in full if you\u2019re interested in the rest of this series), hereafter abbreviated as \u201cTakeover Analysis.\u201d </p> <p> <em>I will generally use the present tense (\u201cin my scenario, the alignment problem is difficult\u201d) when describing a nearcasting scenario, and since the whole story should be taken in the spirit of speculation, I\u2019m going to give fewer caveats than I ordinarily would - I will often say something like \u201cthe alignment problem is difficult\u201d when I mean something like \u201cthe alignment problem is difficult in my most easily-accessible picture of how things would go\u201d (not something like \u201cI know with confidence that the alignment problem will be difficult\u201d).</em> </p> <p> The key properties of the scenario I\u2019ll be considering are: </p> <ol>\n\n<li><strong>Magma. </strong>For concreteness, we\u2019re focused on a particular AI project or company, which I\u2019ll call Magma (following <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y3sWcbcF7np35nzgu/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-1\">Takeover Analysis</a>).\n\n</li><li><strong>Transformative AI is knowably near, but not yet here. </strong>Magma\u2019s leadership has good reason to believe that it can develop something like <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/\">PASTA</a> soon - say, within a year. (I also assume that it hasn\u2019t unwittingly done so yet!)\n\n</li><li><strong>Human feedback on diverse tasks. </strong>The path to transformative AI revolves around what <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y3sWcbcF7np35nzgu/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-1\">Takeover Analysis</a> calls \u201chuman feedback on diverse tasks\u201d (HFDT). You can think of this roughly as if (to oversimplify) we trained an AI by giving it a thumbs up when we approved of what it had done, and a thumbs down when we disapproved, and repeated this enough times that it was able to become very good at behaving in ways that would get a thumbs up, on a broad set of diverse tasks.\n\n</li><li><strong>Some (but not unlimited) deliberate delay is possible. </strong>Magma has some - but not unlimited - ability to delay development and/or deployment in order to take \u201cextra\u201d measures to reduce the risk of misaligned AI.\n<ol>\n\n<li>That is, it\u2019s not the case that \u201cany delay in deploying a given type of AI system will simply mean a competitor does so instead.\u201d\n\n</li><li>This could be because Magma has significant advantages over its competitors (funding, algorithms, talent, etc.) and/or because its closest competitors have a similar level of caution to Magma.\n\n</li><li>I\u2019ll be imagining that Magma can reasonably expect to deploy a given AI system 6-24 months later than it would otherwise for purposes of safety, without worrying that a competitor would deploy a similar (less safe) system in that time. </li> </ol>\n\n</li><li><strong>Otherwise, changes compared to today\u2019s world are fairly minimal. </strong> <ol>\n\n<li>Deep learning has evolved in many ways - for example, there might be new architectures that improve on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)\">Transformer</a> - but the fundamental paradigm is still basically that of models gaining capabilities via \u201ctrial-and-error.\u201d<sup id=\"fnref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> More on this at <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y3sWcbcF7np35nzgu/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-1\">Takeover Analysis</a>.\n\n</li><li>We still <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/#misaligned-ai-mysterious-potentially-dangerous-objectives\">can\u2019t say much </a>about what\u2019s going on inside a given AI model (most of what we know is that it learns from trial and error on tasks, and performs well on the tasks).\n\n</li><li>AI systems have advanced to the point where there are many new commercial applications, and perhaps substantial economic impact, but we haven\u2019t yet reached the point where AIs can <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/#misaligned-ai-mysterious-potentially-dangerous-objectives\">fully automate scientific and technological advancement</a>, where <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/could-advanced-ai-drive-explosive-economic-growth\">economic growth is \u201cexplosive\u201d</a> (greater than 30% per year, which would very roughly be 10x the current rate of global economic growth), or where AI systems can facilitate anything like a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vkjWGJrFWBnzHtxrw/superintelligence-7-decisive-strategic-advantage\">decisive strategic advantage</a>.</li></ol></li></ol> <p> I note that the combination of \u201cChanges compared to today\u2019s world are fairly minimal\u201d with \u201cTransformative AI is knowably near\u201d implies a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ai-takeoff\">fast takeoff</a> approaching: a very rapid transition from a world like today\u2019s to a radically different world. This is (in my view) a key way in which reality is likely to differ from the scenario I\u2019m describing.<sup id=\"fnref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> </p> <p> I still think this scenario is worth contemplating, for the following reasons: </p> <ul>\n\n<li>I think this sort of fast takeoff is easier to concretely picture than most alternatives, precisely because it allows us to focus on a particular crucial period of time in which most things resemble how they are today. Generally, I think it is easiest to think about a relatively small number of relatively high-stakes developments (e.g., \u201cWe have a very powerful AI system that we can deploy or not\u201d) - and then generalize this sort of analysis to scenarios that may revolve more around large numbers of individually low-stakes developments (e.g., \u201cFor the 20th time this year, we\u2019re deciding whether to ship a system that is a small amount more capable, and more dangerous, than the ones already out there\u201d), rather than starting by trying to discuss the latter.\n\n</li><li>Worlds in which transformative AI is developed <em>sooner</em> likely involve faster takeoffs, and scenarios generally more like the above, than other worlds. And these are also particularly \u201chigh-stakes\u201d worlds, in the sense that thinking about them today is particularly likely to be helpful.\n\n</li><li>After examining this scenario, we can later ask how reality might diverge from it (as I plan to do in a future post). While I think there are likely to be important divergences, I think this scenario gives us a lot to work with and think about productively. </li> </ul> <h2 id=\"Next-in-series\">Next in series</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The next piece I\u2019d recommend reading is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y3sWcbcF7np35nzgu/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-1\">Takeover Analysis</a>, which the rest of my series builds on.

These concepts are now highlighted in the curriculum. We think that this is really valuable and is accomplished better with the new curriculum than the older version.

The goal of the essay is to <strong>change GiveWell\u2019s mind about the appropriateness of specific features of their cost-effectiveness model.&nbsp;</strong>However, I have tried to avoid writing an exhaustive point-by-point deconstruction of GiveWell\u2019s model and instead tried to shine a light on common \u2018blind spots\u2019 that frequently occur in economic modelling and which the EA community has apparently not error-corrected until this point. In that respect a secondary goal of the essay is to be more broadly applicable and <strong>change the EA community\u2019s view about what the gold-standard in economic evaluation looks like</strong> and help provide a framework for error-correcting future economic models.</li><li>This contributes to a larger strategic ambition I think EA should have, which is <strong>improving modelling capacity to the point where economic models can be used as reliable guides to action</strong>. Economic models are the most transparent and flexible framework we have invented for difficult decisions taken under resource constraint (and uncertainty), and in utilitarian frameworks a cost-effectiveness model is an argument in its own right (and debatably the only kind of argument that has real meaning in this framework). Despite this, EA appears much more <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">bearish&nbsp;</a>on the use of economic models than sister disciplines such as Health Economics. My conclusion in this piece is that there scope for a paradigm shift in EA modelling before which will improve decision-making around contentious issues.</li><li>In general, GiveWell\u2019s model is of very high quality. It has few errors, and almost no errors that substantially change conclusions. I would be delighted if professional modellers I work with had paid such care and attention to a piece of cost-effectiveness analysis. However, it has a number of \u2018architectural\u2019 features which could be improved with further effort. For example, the structure of the model is difficult to follow (and likely prone to error) and data sources are used in a way which appears inappropriate at times.

The issue of uncertainty analysis is much more serious; no attempt is made in the model to systematically investigate uncertainty and this potentially leads to the model being underutilised by GiveWell. This failure to conduct uncertainty analysis is not limited to GiveWell, but is instead low hanging fruit for greatly improving the impact of future cost-effectiveness modelling across the whole of EA. I will write an essay on this topic specifically in the very near-term future.</li></ul><h2>1.2 Context</h2><p>This essay is an attempt to \u2018red team\u2019 the current state of cost-effectiveness modelling in Effective Altruism. I have done this by picking a cost-effectiveness model which I believe to be close to the current state-of-the-art in EA cost-effectiveness modelling \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">GiveWell\u2019s 2022 cost-effectiveness analysis spreadsheet</a> \u2013 and applied the same level of scrutiny I would as if I was peer reviewing an economic model in my own discipline of Health Economics. For various reasons I\u2019ll address below, it was easier for me to give this critique after completely refactoring the original model, and therefore much of what follows is based on my own analysis of GiveWell\u2019s input data. You might find it helpful to have my refactored version of the model open as a companion piece to this essay. If so, it is downloadable <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/6dvl7ihg452hafv/Refactored%20GiveWell%20model%20v9.xlsm?dl=0\">here</a> \u2013 please note some fairly heavy caveats around completeness I make further down.</p><p>I\u2019m a cost-effectiveness modeller for a large pharmaceutical company, and as such I was interested in exploring the red team contest from the perspective of my own paradigm, Health Economics. I see Health Economics and Effective Altruism as being sister disciplines, both concerned with maximising the good done with a fixed budget in different contexts. As a top-level view, the major difference between the two areas is that Health Economics is <strong>extremely</strong> adversarial by its nature; industry economists want to show their drugs are very cost-effective to get them approved for use by payers and regulatory economists want to show the opposite to extract price concessions from industry. As a result, Health Economics has evolved in a different way to Effective Altruism \u2013 almost all major philosophical disputes in Health Economics are resolved by fiat via a regulatory agency (\u201cThis is the value of a statistical life whether you like it or not\u201d), and the energy of the entire quantitative side of the pharmaceutical industry has therefore gone into getting value-add from increasingly sophisticated economic models (rather than sophisticated philosophical accounts of health). My thinking in approaching this call for critique was that I could see whether advances in the cutting edge of Health Economics could improve the modelling approaches of Effective Altruists.</p><p>I hope this goes without saying, but this isn\u2019t intended to be an attack on GiveWell\u2019s modelling team. I have enormous respect for what the team has been able to achieve, and insofar as any of my criticisms land it is only because I get a huge advantage by cribbing from several decades of iterative improvements to Health Economic models which they don\u2019t have access to. Given that the GiveWell team basically had to invent EA modelling from scratch, the fact they have produced something which can recognisably stand toe-to-toe with anything we\u2019re currently doing in Health Economics is a credit to the organisation and wider EA community<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref08fdznub274i\"><sup><a href=\"#fn08fdznub274i\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><h1>Section 2 \u2013 Methods</h1><h2>2.1 Choice of approach</h2><p>There is no universally accepted method of offering a summary assessment of the quality of a cost-effectiveness model. However, most modellers would agree that if you want to move past summary assessments and genuinely certify a model as free of errors it is necessary to roll up your sleeves and go cell-by-cell through the model looking for trouble. Often the target of \u2018completely free of errors\u2019 is unnecessarily high, but since EA models are built on different principles to Health Economic models I thought gold-plating the review made sense in this case.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019ve chosen to review <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">the current GiveWell cost-effectiveness evaluation</a> of its major charities. I think this is an appropriate choice for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>Most people who I asked said that it represented close to the state of the art in EA cost-effectiveness modelling. Therefore, my working assumption is that issues in the GiveWell model will likely exist in other models.</li><li>Those who didn\u2019t agree it was \u2018state of the art\u2019 were nevertheless happy to agree it represented one of the most visible examples of a high-quality piece of modelling in EA spaces. Therefore, I assume that processes of error correction and content aggregation which work in EA spaces will have worked particularly effectively on this model.</li><li>GiveWell are a large organisation in the EA space, and therefore critiquing their model feel less like I\u2019m just dumping on one poor guy trying to contribute and more like I\u2019m entering into the spirit of good-faith external critique of EA.</li></ul><h2>2.2 GiveWell model</h2><p>The GiveWell cost-effectiveness model has been in continuous development since at least 2012 (the first available online copy), and reflects the decision problem facing Effective Altruists \u2013 \u201cWhich charity is the most cost-effective?\u201d. The 2022 version covers nine target charities and looks at a variety of factors relating to their costs and effectiveness. The key output is \u2018cost-effectiveness in multiples of GiveDirectly\u2019s effectiveness\u2019. This is obviously a non-standard reporting measure but it makes some sense in context; relative to other charities we know a lot about the effectiveness of Cash Transfer and therefore can use Cash Transfer charities as a sort of \u2018standard candle\u2019 against which to compare others (GiveWell ideally want charities they recommend to be 10x more effective than GiveDirectly). The key inputs are estimates for effectiveness of each intervention and estimates for the value of certain moral outcomes expressed as multiples of GiveDirectly outputs. For example, the GiveDirectly model assumes that raising ln(consumption) by one unit is morally equivalent to 40% of a saved life-year. In terms of structure, the model aggregates together key inputs for each charity before presenting a probable overall effectiveness estimate, as per the diagram below. In the jargon, it is a \u2018deterministic decision tree\u2019 architected in Microsoft Excel. GiveWell offer some more details about their philosophy of model building <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKq-MNU-xtn_48uN33L6VvBEZRAduvjwWMeaEffL4K4/edit\">here</a>.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1e9f6cf98f18fb4242165350632c8cca841c442513ff9aef.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><p>Overall, the GiveWell model is broadly in a very good state (ignoring for the moment the issue of uncertainty analysis). However, there are quite a lot of potential improvements to what you would typically describe as \u2018architecture\u2019, which is to say how the logic of the model is laid out for an analyst to examine. I found that eventually these improvements were impossible to keep a track of on a piece of notepaper and it was quicker just to build my own model from scratch and keep track of them live in Excel. You might find it helpful to have my refactored version of the model open as a companion piece to this essay. If so, it is downloadable <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/6dvl7ihg452hafv/Refactored%20GiveWell%20model%20v9.xlsm?dl=0\">here</a>. I hope that putting out my model to the same level of public scrutiny as the GiveWell model will make it clear quite how good a job the GiveWell team has done; I\u2019d be astounded if my model has fewer mistakes than theirs, overall.</p><p>The table below shows the results of the Original GiveWell model and my own Refactored model. You can see that the Original model gives results which are pretty close to the Refactored model (always within +/- 35% except AMF which is discussed below). This is as strong as signal as you could possibly want that the GiveWell model reliably estimates the impact of donating to their top charities (except for AMF). Please be aware that New Incentives is missing from all subsequent analysis because I ran out of time to include it - it is nothing personal!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_135 135w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_215 215w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_295 295w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_375 375w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_455 455w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_535 535w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_615 615w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_695 695w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2ef5d46831b790bd721e068f744541e0472387ace6fe026e.png/w_775 775w\"></figure><p>The key reason for the changes between versions of the model are:</p><ul><li>There is a slight issue in the Original model with how expected future life years are calculated (they are discounted at too low a rate). Fixing this means that any intervention which saves lives will save a different number of discounted life-years in the Original and Refactored model.</li><li>The assumption of how income is aggregated across the household is different for different charities. In Cash Transfer charities it is assumed that the money from the cash transfer is divided across 4.7 members of a hypothetical household, whereas in the Deworming charities it is assumed that the money generated by the intervention is multiplied by two to account for resource-sharing within a household of any size. This seemed very inconsistent to me, so I normalised everything to Cash Transfer approach. This has a big impact on any intervention which generates consumption income.</li><li>There is a fairly serious error in the Original model where GiveWell assume that a malaria death prevented by Malaria Consortium also prevents 0.5 indirect deaths\u2026 and then forgets to apply this to AMF. Correcting this error greatly increases the cost-effectiveness of AMF, although in fairness to GiveWell it is not as easy to correct the error as I have pretended in my Refactored model (since it is almost certain I double count some lives saved)</li><li>In all probability there is more than one major error in my Refactored model \u2013 the Original model follows modelling best practice of having many eyes review the plausibility / logic of the work, whereas mine is banged together for the purpose of being easy to do uncertainty analysis with.</li></ul><p>You can see that my analysis of GiveDirectly, which has none of these issues, is exactly the same as GiveWell\u2019s analysis of the same charity, which is a reassuring sign that neither of us has done anything too exotic in our calculations.</p><p>I should comment here on a fifth possible change between models; I haven\u2019t included Leverage / Funging adjustments as per the GiveWell model and instead just hard-coded GiveWell's outputs here into my model.</p><p>\u2018Leverage\u2019 is where donations to a charity cause others to spend more on that charity, and \u2018funging\u2019 is the opposite. This sort of development scenario planning is clearly important but is well outside my realm of expertise, so I can\u2019t credibly comment on the logic of the GiveWell approach. Having said that, a topline examination of the model structure in this area has alarm bells blaring for me. For example, on the AMF tab, row 212 is hardcoded (which is almost always the sign of a development assumption accidentally pushed to production). Rows 204 to 208 are supposed to be the parameters which control the probability of different leverage / funging scenarios, but these parameters are not piped anywhere so they are either wrong or mislabelled. Row 220 is supposed to be the final calculation but cannot return a value greater than zero so forces a \u2018funging\u2019 return even if you want to explore \u2018leveraging\u2019 scenarios. There are similarly confusing elements relating to these calculations in most of the other tabs, although AMF is particularly hard to parse. For the sake of not overstepping my expertise I\u2019ve just piped GiveWell\u2019s conclusions straight into my model, but I would recommend GiveWell take another look at the model logic in this area.</p><h2>2.3 Key findings 1 \u2013 Uncertainty analysis</h2><p>My key finding actually didn\u2019t require anything more than a completely superficial review of the GiveWell model. It is very striking to a Health Economist\u2019s eyes that the GiveWell model significantly underutilised mathematical tools for uncertainty analysis (in fact, it doesn\u2019t use any of them). This is a very significant oversight, since it means that GiveWell have no way of quantifying their risk of being wrong about the charities they recommend.&nbsp;</p><p>GiveWell isn\u2019t alone here \u2013 aside from a few isolated examples of individual elements of the uncertainty analysis toolkit being used in a non-systematic fashion, the whole of EA tends to be quite weak on this topic. Unfortunately, it would double the length of this essay to even superficially touch on uncertainty analysis, so I will put that all into another essay which I\u2019ll commit to publishing before the end of the Red Team contest. I really think this might be a metaphorical 'hundred-dollar bill on the sidewalk' for EA to pick up in respect to resolving some issues which appear to perennially crop up on the forums.</p><h2>2.4 Key findings 2 \u2013 Everything else</h2><p>Most of the rest of the GiveWell model is of a consistently high standard. Errors \u2013 such that they are \u2013 tend to relate more to missed opportunities to make the model more robust, or usable, or both. I\u2019ve divided my critique into two sections; conceptual and executional. Conceptual issues are those which take place before anyone even puts metaphorical pen to metaphorical paper, and would probably require a complete refactoring of the model to implement. Executional issues relate more to on-the-ground decisions made by modellers, and could reasonably easily be changed in time for the 2023 version of the model.</p><p>The table below summarises the issues which I found with the model, and the two sections following go into detail on specific points.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f230ca8da09389c900256285bb0a32cb62415a59f680c0e1.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><h1>Section 3 \u2013 Conceptual issue of model design</h1><h2>3.1 Conceptual framework</h2><p>It is pretty clear that GiveWell and I disagree about the basic point of building a cost-effectiveness model. In my view, which I think it would probably be fair to say is the conventional view in Health Economics, the only purpose of a cost-effectiveness model is to compare alternate uses of the same &nbsp;funding. I doubt any Health Economist would <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKq-MNU-xtn_48uN33L6VvBEZRAduvjwWMeaEffL4K4/edit#heading=h.sw6xhw8bwhrh\">disagree with GiveWell</a> that it is nice to be able to see the absolute cost per [outcome] of an intervention, or to explore how different factors affect a programmes cost-effectiveness \u2013 but I\u2019m equally confident that all Health Economists would agree that the only point to doing that stuff is because it helps sharpen the decision you make between competing alternative uses of scarce resources. Anything else is just academic pettifogging.</p><p>I\u2019m not certain I can make legible all the ways that the GiveWell model appears to shy away from the sharpest possible use of cost-effectiveness analysis \u2013 I think it depends too much on having seen hundreds of cost-effectiveness models in the past and noticing that this one appears \u2018fluffier\u2019 on the decision rule than normal. However, I <i>can</i> make legible one aspect of what is leading me to the conclusion. Earlier, I gave a table of results comparing my own and GiveWell\u2019s results. In fact, I had to work quite hard to generate the GiveWell side of this table; rather than a single summary number, the results GiveWell produce are an estimate is produced representing the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of multiples of GiveDirectly interventions at the bottom(ish) of each charity evaluation. Furthermore, this is not even presented as a summary effect for the whole charity; instead, the value is calculated separately for each country the charity operates in &nbsp;and the user has to take a weighted average in their head<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd51zjmwjxtq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd51zjmwjxtq\">[2]</a></sup></span>.

However, on the broader issue of not comparing charities against each other directly I worry that GiveWell have fallen for a subtle conceptual trap.</p><p>That conceptual trap would be confusing \u2018decision-making at the margin\u2019 (ie the shadow price of philanthropy) with \u2018tools used to estimate the margin\u2019 (ie rules of thumb like charities having to be 10x better than GiveWell). The reason this is a trap is that it actually hardly matters at all whether either of these charities are 10x more effective than GiveDirectly \u2013 if the most cost-effective charity in the world was only 5x more effective than GiveDirectly I\u2019d still want to donate to that charity if I could&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh4znuwpl9s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh4znuwpl9s\">[3]</a></sup></span>. You can spend so much time arguing about whether it should be a 10x or a 10.5x multiplier that you lose sight of the fact that 10x is just a tool you're using to prioritise charities for investigation of the thing we're <strong>really</strong> interested in, which is the opportunity cost of donating to one charity vs another.</p><p>I accept GiveWell have a <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">robust defence</a> of their approach. They say they prefer to use cost-effectiveness estimates only as one input in their thinking about charities (with \u2018track record\u2019 and \u2018certainty of results\u2019 being two other important but hard-to-quantify inputs), and therefore (I infer) don\u2019t want to compare charities head-to-head because the 21.2x of AMF is not the same sort of \u2018thing\u2019 as the 9.8x of Malaria Consortium. For sure, Health Economists would agree that there may be factors beyond pure cost-effectiveness to consider when making a decision (e.g. equity considerations, commercial negotiation strategies that companies might employ and so on), but typically this consideration happens after the cost-effectiveness modelling, to avoid falling into the trap I mentioned above where you implicitly state that you are working with two different kinds of \u2018thing\u2019 even though they actually compete for the same resources&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsg3p7lkxrt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsg3p7lkxrt\">[4]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>I accept I\u2019m inserting myself into a long-running debate in EA here, without much hope of moving the needle on an issue which is presumably a lot deeper than I fully understand. However, I really do want to stress how jarring it is to see a cost-effectiveness model which doesn\u2019t actually deliver on the promise of guiding resource utilisation at the margin. An economic model is the most transparent and democratic method we have of determining which of a given set of charities will do the most good, and any attempt to use intuition to plug gaps rather than trying to formalise that intuition undoes a lot of the benefit of creating a model in the first place.</p><p>My recommendation would be that GiveWell adopt the convention of my model of piping all results to a single summary output table. That is, irrespective of whether GiveWell change their philosophical view on expect value economic modelling, they should behave <i>as though</i> they have changed their view when in \u2018modelling mode\u2019 and then make whatever adjustments they feel are necessary afterwards. I\u2019ve tried to flag below where I think errors are directly caused by this conceptual confusion.</p><h2>3.2 Model architecture</h2><h3><u>3.2.1 Introduction</u></h3><p>After the issue of uncertainty analysis, I\u2019d say the model architecture is the second biggest issue I have with the GiveWell model, and really the closest thing to a genuine \u2018error\u2019 rather than a conceptual step which could be improved. Model architecture is how different elements of your model interact with each other, and how they are laid out to a user.&nbsp;</p><p>It is fairly clear that the GiveWell team are not professional modellers, in the same way it would be obvious to a professional programmer that I am not a coder (this will be obvious as soon as you check the code in my Refactored model!). That is to say, there\u2019s a lot of wasted effort in the GiveWell model which is typical when intelligent people are concentrating on making something functional rather than using slick technique. A very common manifestation of the \u2018intelligent people thinking very hard about things\u2019 school of model design is extremely cramped and confusing model architecture. This is because you have to be a straight up genius to try and design a model as complex as the GiveWell model without using modern model planning methods, and people at that level of genius don\u2019t need crutches the rest of us rely on like clear and straightforward model layout. However, bad architecture is technical debt that you are eventually going to have to service on your model; when you hand it over to a new member of staff it takes longer to get that member of staff up to speed and increases the probability of someone making an error when they update the model.</p><p>In general, the GiveWell model architecture looks like the below:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/6838f6c11b9c87e497b5072d1af08354143ceea62d06dad0.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><p>There\u2019s a central pillar which is every charity that they plan to evaluate, and then that central pillar grabs from a bunch of external data sources or some ancillary calculation spreadsheets where necessary.

Each of these two pillars grabs data from only one or two places, and then the outputs are piped to a \u2018results\u2019 section. The \u2018results\u2019 are a very important part of the conceptual framework for the model (as I outline above) but also for the architecture \u2013 it gives the outputs somewhere to go to that isn\u2019t right on top of the inputs and calculations.</p><p>I don\u2019t definitely know which model architecture appears more intuitively appealing to you, but to explain some of the differences as I see them:</p><ol><li>Results are more clearly differentiated from intermediate calculations</li><li>Better Input / Output differentiation</li><li>No appreciable cross-sheet piping</li><li>More supportive of good micro-level architecture</li><li>External data sources are corralled to one place</li></ol><p>I\u2019ll talk about each below.

The GiveWell model carries quite a significant risk of confusing outputs for inputs and so breaking the model when adjusting it. The image below shows a typical calculation sheet for the GiveWell model, and for me it is very hard to figure out what you can change without breaking the model elsewhere, or how you should make the changes to ensure they are correctly implemented (made harder by the fact that the formatting is often inconsistent!<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc63bxpz6n4w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc63bxpz6n4w\">[5]</a></sup></span>)</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/272f6bed90cfc6488799474adb46bdbf52ee83f0e024b286.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><p>A consistent model architecture is really important for spotting when you are making assumptions in one area but not in another. For example, the assumption about how many people share resources within a household is quite uncertain, and is considered to be 4.7 in all Cash Transfer interventions but 0.5 in all Deworming interventions (ie any income increase for the intervention is doubled to reflect sharing the resources across a household). It seems to me that this is an inconsistency in the model, because different numbers of people share resources in two otherwise similar situations. But it might <strong>not</strong> be an inconsistency \u2013 perhaps Cash Transfer and Deworming money is somehow different (hypothetically, because the Cash Transfer is windfall money whereas the Deworming money is earned income in the future). There is no real way to tell because the Original model has no centralised source of assumptions, so I can\u2019t see whether the change violates the assumptions or is consistent with a more complex assumption (for example a separate input for \u2018windfall money household size\u2019 and \u2018earned income household size\u2019). But if that\u2019s the case, then which of these two assumptions should be used for the portion of GiveWell money which is invested in a capital good and so pays off more like earned income? Explicit assumptions are critical to avoid spiralling confusion like this, and I/O differentiation is critical to make assumptions explicit.</p><p>Apparent errors of assumption consistency are pervasive throughout the Original model, and most of them also made it into the Refactored model because I wasn\u2019t confident I understood the ground-level facts well enough to be bold about changing things. A few other examples of this issue:</p><ul><li>When cash is transferred by GiveDirectly there is a 5% reduction in the amount transferred due to \u2018<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C4nX3LWM-TeNMFxmNAKRbi4vtt_4ZaLoIGZzlaHmvuI/edit#.\">negative spillover effect\u2019</a>. However, when cash is transferred by New Incentives this deflator is not applied. People are assumed to invest a certain percentage of money transferred by GiveDirectly, but there is no functionality to invest money transferred by New Incentives.</li><li>AMF <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models/changelog-2021\">loses a certain amount of effectiveness</a> in some countries where Malaria Consortium operates due to some of their bednet distribution inevitably going to the same people as Malaria Consortium have targeted with Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention. However, Malaria Consortium doesn\u2019t have a corresponding figure for effectiveness lost due to bednet distribution.</li><li>The calculations for Malaria Consortium <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2279/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK2279.pdf\">assume</a> that every death from malaria causes 50% of a death from non-malaria sources. This is because \u201cEmpirical research suggests that malaria control interventions often have a larger effect on all-cause mortality than would be expected exclusively from declines in malaria-specific mortality\u201d. However, there is no corresponding figure for AMF (I corrected this in the Refactored model and this is why AMF does so much better from the refactor&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1fvg2vsyeui\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1fvg2vsyeui\">[6]</a></sup></span>).</li><li>GiveDirectly has no leverage / funging adjustment, while every other charity does</li><li>New Incentives includes an \u2018<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/new-incentives#Skeptical_prior\">adjustment towards skeptical prior\u2019</a>, while no other charity does</li><li>New Incentives has a different discount rate for future life years than every other charity for reasons I can\u2019t understand (and it is inconsistently applied to life years that New Incentives generates)</li></ul><h3><u>3.2.4 No appreciable cross-sheet piping</u></h3><p>Piping outputs across sheets is a highly risky architectural decision. For example, you might think, \u201cWell the development effects of HKI are unknown, but likely to be about 47% of the development effects of Malaria Consortium. So, in the cell which expects an input for HKI development effects I\u2019ll just cross-reference the same cell in Malaria Consortium, multiplied by 47%\u201d. The insidious thing about this approach is it works, and works so well that unless you stay very aggressively on top of it you can end up with a spiderweb of cross-referencing across the sheet.</p><p>Once you\u2019ve developed such a spiderweb it is almost impossible to fix it without consigning the model to the fire and starting again. For example, consider you learned some fact which altered your assessment of Malaria Consortium\u2019s benefits but not HKIs. You might go into the Malaria Consortium sheet, change the input and then save the sheet. But because Malaria Consortium is piped into HKI, you\u2019ve also just altered HKI\u2019s cost-effectiveness without meaning to. Importantly, you\u2019ll get no warning message about this, and the next person to open the sheet won\u2019t be made aware of the change. The only possible way you can prevent the problem is by checking that no unexpected changes have been made to the outputs every time you change an input, which is both time consuming and not robust anyway, because you can have nightmare scenarios where you are changing an input which is <strong>supposed</strong> to change HKI\u2019s output, just not by as much as if the cell wasn\u2019t piped across (eg the \u2018not ideal design\u2019 scenario in the diagram below).</p><p>Better architectural design can improve your chances of catching such an error. By having very clear differentiation between cells which are inputs and cells which are calculations, and keeping all the input cells in one place, you lower the risk that there is unexpected logic in the model you need to know about and remember. This enormously improves usability, and helps prevent error to boot.</p><p>The key rule I was taught it that sheets are either inputs, outputs or neutral with respect to other sheets, and it should be clear at a glance what their relationship is. That is, you should NEVER have a sheet which both references and is referenced by a second sheet, nor should you have a single sheet which references across \u2018levels\u2019 (although everyone does this second one so I\u2019m not really being fair by dinging GiveWell for it).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/c2cdf6ded797182154c70398ab664965268034da9bebc717.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/c2cdf6ded797182154c70398ab664965268034da9bebc717.png/w_107 107w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/c2cdf6ded797182154c70398ab664965268034da9bebc717.png/w_187 187w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/c2cdf6ded797182154c70398ab664965268034da9bebc717.png/w_267 267w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/c2cdf6ded797182154c70398ab664965268034da9bebc717.png/w_347 347w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/c2cdf6ded797182154c70398ab664965268034da9bebc717.png/w_427 427w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/c2cdf6ded797182154c70398ab664965268034da9bebc717.png/w_507 507w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/c2cdf6ded797182154c70398ab664965268034da9bebc717.png/w_587 587w\"></figure><p>A few other examples of the issue:</p><ul><li>The proportion of deworming going to children is piped from the SCI Foundation to the END Fund</li><li>Development effects from the Malaria Consortium also pipe into New Incentives, as well as HKI</li><li>A multiplier for resource sharing in a household is piped from Deworm the World to Malaria Consortium (but not AMF, I\u2019ve just noticed\u2026)</li><li>The duration of effects of SMC is piped from Deworm the World to Malaria Consortium</li><li>The annual consumption per capita is piped from GiveDirectly to New Incentives</li><li>Also, a lot of assumptions about deworming effectiveness are piped from Deworm the World to other deworming charities, although this is slightly more justifiable than the others because you\u2019d only ever want to change these assumptions <i>en mass</i> for the whole deworming space. Nevertheless, it is annoying to have to look in different places to find inputs you need (and will require masses of work if Deworm the World ever drops out of the top charities list) so I\u2019d still change it.</li></ul><h3><u>3.2.5 More supportive of good micro-level architecture</u></h3><p>Micro-level architecture is less about the grand sweep of model organisation, and more about how the model is laid out on a sheet-by-sheet basis. This is not amazing in the Original model, but in fairness to GiveWell it isn\u2019t amazing in the Refactored model either because the problem space is so complex. A big problem GiveWell have is that their decision to put so much calculation and so many different sorts of calculation onto one sheet leads to challenging micro-architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below shows the conceptual micro-architecture of the Deworm the World calculations for both the Original model (left, 219 rows) and the Refactored model (right, 36 rows). In fact, the Refactored model contains the calculations for <strong>all</strong> the deworming charities, so is actually doing four times more work than the same sheet in the Original model. However, an important point to remember in modelling is that \u2018processor time is cheap\u2019, and making a single sheet long and complicated is not a bad thing if the only thing that suffers is your laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I think that piping information into and out of the sheet as in the Refactored model is a clear micro-architecture improvement, because it makes it very easy to find the information you need. Having worked with the Original model for a while now during the refactoring process, I can confirm that it is very hard to find the correct output quickly, and easy to make a mistake (eg selecting the charity- and intervention- adjusted results from Results 2 rather than the unadjusted results from Results 1). This is made even harder by the fact the sections are not always in the same order for each charity.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b9115bcc6612a88cfb46604857a5924762c68768de1d2c49.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><p>Confusing micro-architecture is the handmaiden of the most toxic modelling error of all, the \u2018Inconsistent Formula\u2019 error.

So in theory, there could be many more errors lurking that cannot be detected by someone like me who is just looking for inconsistent micro-architecture; consistent micro-architecture could be just as wrong if consistency is not intended!</p><h3><u>3.2.6 External data sources are corralled to just one sheet</u></h3><p>Which I\u2019ll discuss in the next section, \u2018Choice of Data Sources\u2019</p><h3><u>3.2.7 Conclusions</u></h3><p>Taken together, I think my architecture is superior to GiveWell\u2019s Original architecture \u2013 it is easier to use and less prone to errors. However, model architecture is something which needs to be frequently re-evaluated, as architecture which works well for certain types of charity will work poorly for others. I went through seven different versions of the Refactored model before I settled on the one I eventually presented, and in hindsight I\u2019m not completely happy with it for a variety of different reasons&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6sc08rk1k22\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6sc08rk1k22\">[7]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>One small additional point; architecture is the single biggest element of a model which is prone to \u2018cruft\u2019, or decisions being made just because it is easier to do a thing the easy way now than to do it properly and save time in the future. Over time these cruft-y elements accumulate until they are the only reasonable way of making simple changes to the model, and changes of moderate complexity become impossible. It can be helpful to have an outsider sweep through the model every couple of years and yell at everyone about any proto-cruft they come across, because it is very hard to self-police when each decision in isolation is so reasonable.</p><h2>3.3 Choice of data sources</h2><p>One of the most conceptually different elements of the GiveWell model to a typical Health Economic model is the variety of data sources which are used to generate outputs. Normally a Health Economic model will use data from a one or (maximum) two randomised control trials, with a smattering of literature sources to fill in certain gaps. This obviously isn\u2019t possible for the GiveWell model \u2013 it is significantly more conceptually complex than a typical health economic model, and hence requires more data sources.&nbsp;</p><h3><u>3.2.1 Problems with \u2018off the books\u2019 calculations</u></h3><p>One way that GiveWell attempt to design around this problem is to perform a lot of calculations \u2018off the books\u2019. So, for example, if you want to find out what value GiveWell assign to averting the death of a child under 5 with malaria you are instructed to reference two external documents; one which has GiveWell\u2019s thinking about moral weights generally, which itself is the weighted average of three other sources of data and one which has GiveWell\u2019s thinking about malaria specifically, which references IHME data (although this data is available in the spreadsheet itself so clicking through would only be masochistic).&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/4c4eef28e2ccdb059d8220cd4c9868368f3c07957db13c90.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><p>The obvious logic of doing things this way is that it keeps the model lean and easily understandable. You don\u2019t, for example, need to include a database of IHME data in a model which references the IHME data only quite loosely. However, the harm of doing things this way is equally apparent; it takes forever to source simple claims made in the model, and it isn\u2019t always obvious where these claims come from. A big way in which this might happen is if GiveWell change the way they organise data on their Google Drive without realising that one of the pieces of data they are changing is propping up an important claim in the cost-effectiveness model seven or eight layers later \u2013 sort of like the XKCD comic below. You can see this effect in action if you switch from considering Malaria deaths to those caused by insufficient Vitamin A in cell A10 of the \u2018Moral Weights\u2019 tab \u2013 clearly at some point between the model being conceived and now it was decided that the spreadsheet referenced in this claim should be kept private to GiveWell staff only, and so hence it is impossible to verify whether GiveWell actually claim the value of a death due to vitamin A deficiency is what GiveWell say it is.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/8de73244c34c9002492e39f3b0a5ffd9d79345caed2650f8.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/8de73244c34c9002492e39f3b0a5ffd9d79345caed2650f8.png/w_93 93w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/8de73244c34c9002492e39f3b0a5ffd9d79345caed2650f8.png/w_173 173w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/8de73244c34c9002492e39f3b0a5ffd9d79345caed2650f8.png/w_253 253w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/8de73244c34c9002492e39f3b0a5ffd9d79345caed2650f8.png/w_333 333w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/8de73244c34c9002492e39f3b0a5ffd9d79345caed2650f8.png/w_413 413w\"></figure><p>Perhaps more fundamentally, shifting calculations \u2018off the books\u2019 means that assumptions feeding into the model don\u2019t necessarily share in the model logic. For example, instead of using the GiveWell assumptions about the value of life years lost, the model offers the possibility of using values derived from <a href=\"https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/Global%20Burden%20of%20Disease%20and%20Risk%20Factors.pdf\">Lopez et al</a>. These represent the present discounted value of life years lost for an intervention which saves a life at 5 years old, 10 years old, 15 years old and so on. The issue is that the discount rate is also an important input in the economic model \u2013 Lopez et al assume it is 3% while GiveWell assume it is 4% (calculations for this are, naturally enough, on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2tf7Fu8-iG_8TgnJkEx9G5TlEyrcv7PXPokmPZaUMc/edit?usp=sharing\">a separate sheet</a>). So GiveWell accidentally strongly commits to a philosophical position that the discount rate on life years is less than the discount rate for money.</p><p>Better architecture in this case would look like putting as much calculation as possible \u2018on the books\u2019. To a first approximation, any raw data which can physically (and legally) be placed into a model should be, and it should be properly piped into the model logic. One of the most important quotes in any endeavour like this is that \u2018processor cycles are cheap\u2019. Specifically, it took me several hours to figure out the issue with the discount rates I describe above, write code to fix it, and then test the impact of that adjusted code on the model outputs. It takes a computer bare fractions of a second to recalculate all the work I did when the model opens, and then it never thinks about those numbers again. The idea that we should be referencing data without including it in the model itself belongs in the ancient history where the amount of data we include as backup information matters in any material way.</p><p>This is done very nicely in the New Incentives calculations, where multiple different vaccine types are included on the same spreadsheet. While I would myself have shifted most of those calculations onto an ancillary sheet to keep the microarchitecture clean, the risk of error is greatly lessened by having them in the model somewhere.</p><h3><u>3.2.2 Robustness of data sources cited</u></h3><p>As a separate point, I am a bit confused about why certain data sources are selected for inclusion in the model. In a professional Health Economic model, a systematic literature review (SLR) is undertaken for all important inputs. This aims to identify every piece of available evidence published on a topic, and then (ideally) average out that evidence in a process called meta-analysis or (failing that) at least select a representative example of the literature to act as a surrogate for this meta-analysis.</p><p>This does not seem to have been done for most inputs in the GiveWell model. For example, the treatment effect of deworming on ln(income) is taken to be 0.109 based on a study by <a href=\"https://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_research_projects/1/Identifying-Impacts-on-Education-and-Health-in-the-Presence-of-Treatment-Externalities.pdf\">Miguel and Kremer (2004)</a>. I happen to know from background reading that this study is very influential in the deworming literature, but is it the <strong>only</strong> relevant study? Probably not, because I know that there are <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/44/5/1581/2594562?login=false\">re-analyses</a> of the Miguel and Kremer data. Has anything changed since 2004 when the study was published? Potentially, since <a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/CD000371/INFECTN_deworming-school-children-low-and-middle-income-countries\">Cochrane</a> failed to find an effect of this size in 2019. I can\u2019t tell whether these considerations have been rejected elsewhere (in some other document not linked in the model) or whether they just haven\u2019t been considered. I note that a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MKiqGvijAXfcBHCYJ/deworming-and-decay-replicating-givewell-s-cost\">superb entry</a> into the Red Team contest has flagged this as a major risk on another deworming parameter, which makes me suspect that this issue is endemic across the model.</p><p>Speculatively, I\u2019d suggest that it looks like GiveWell don\u2019t have a programmatic approach to this issue. The GiveWell model has several hundred inputs and 100+ SLRs are infeasible even for a well-funded pharma company. Ideally, we\u2019d prioritise those inputs which are important for thorough evidence review, but the GiveWell model has no way to identify important inputs. This is quite closely related to the fact that the GiveWell model has no proper uncertainty analysis tools, so hopefully correcting that will correct this too.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, I\u2019d suggest that if the Effective Altruism community has funds to disburse on meta-charity pursuits in the future, a <strong>very </strong>high-impact use of those funds would be bounties on high-quality SLRs for important parameters in an economic model. The cost of getting SLRs done professionally can be in the mid- six-figures, whereas an SLR can be done to a very similar standard by an enthusiastic amateur with time to burn&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzwz4cnm2grs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzwz4cnm2grs\">[8]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><h1>Section 4 \u2013 Issues of model execution</h1><h2>4.1 Choice of model structure</h2><p>GiveWell clearly struggled with the analysis of some charities more than others. I\u2019m not certain if this is obvious to anyone looking at the model or if it is another thing which is illegible until you\u2019ve seen hundreds of them. An example of what I\u2019m talking about is the structure around life-years saved per life saved in malaria interventions. Upon learning that a life had been saved by a LLIN a straightforward way of finding out how many life-years had been saved as a result would be to ask how old the saved life was, consult an actuarial table for life expectancy at that age, and then subtract one from the other. GiveWell instead ask the probability that the life saved was in one of four buckets, then take an average life expectancy in each bucket, then consult an actuarial table for people in that bucket, then subtract one from the other. Even though GiveWell\u2019s solution is more complex, it is actually less accurate, because it averages information which in principle we don\u2019t have to average. This is illustrated in the diagram below (\u2018normal\u2019 on top, GiveWell on bottom).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/9b9c26fdb46fa3ea7acd20baf3428ef6f8ae8e1349eac702.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><p>This is a slightly unfair way of driving intuition, because often the slickest modelling solution to a problem looks absolutely nothing like the \u2018natural\u2019 way to investigate a problem.

The issue is that when you get to a problem that decision trees are badly suited for, intelligent people can find a way to force the decision tree to give them a comprehensible answer (for example by cramming a continuous variable like \u2018age\u2019 into four categories so it is tractable to the structure of a decision tree). This is related to the point I made about architecture becoming \u2018crufty\u2019 over time; after someone has gone to the trouble of building a decision tree it is easier to apply your intelligence to the problem of \u2018age\u2019 than it is to apply elbow grease and rebuild the structure from scratch, especially if you have an intelligence-surplus and a time-deficit like I imagine GiveWell do.</p><p>Some classic failure cases of decision trees include:</p><ul><li>Time dependent interventions (or really any continuous variable). For example, from the day you get malaria your life gets worse (you earn less and can potentially die, according to the economic model). So in terms of calculating the output of the model, it matters a lot exactly <i>when</i> the malaria occurs. The more abstract the age categories the less accurate the model.</li><li>Complex partial interventions. For example, GiveWell transfers a large amount of money and generates a certain amount of utility for that transfer. New Incentives transfers a much smaller amount of money and so the logic of the deterministic decision tree requires that a proportionally smaller amount of utility is generated. But this <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/donating-money-buying-happiness/\">might not be true</a> \u2013 even if we assume the relationship between transfer size and utility is monotonic, there\u2019s no reason to believe it is linear.</li><li>Compounding effects. For example, it is possible that the benefit of deworming on income <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MKiqGvijAXfcBHCYJ/deworming-and-decay-replicating-givewell-s-cost\">drops off over time</a>. Also, not all those who are dewormed should get the full 40 years of benefit, because some might die before then. But you can\u2019t really take an average of income over time and life expectancy, because people living longer earn less. Decision trees are very bad at the sort of myriad-possibility analysis this creates. I\u2019ve no doubt GiveWell could figure out formulas that analytically solve these problems, but personally I fear equations with logs, exponentiation and compounding in the same location because they\u2019re opaque to me.</li><li>Path dependent effects. For example, AMF and Malaria Consortium operate in some of the same areas, and any life AMF saves shouldn\u2019t be attributed to Malaria Consortium (and vice versa). It is very difficult to get a decision tree to understand this sort of concept without liberal cross-sheet piping, which is bad.</li><li>Dual-decision effects. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s actually an example of this in the GiveWell model, but decision trees can become quite \u2018unstable\u2019 if there are multiple decision points within the model, in the sense that a small change to inputs can have an extremely radical change to outputs. For example, a decision tree would be an utterly terrible choice for a serious evaluation of a \u2018longtermist\u2019 charity for a variety of reasons including this one.</li></ul><p>As a suggestion, the GiveWell modellers might want to consider exploring other modelling structures for some of their charities which would be better served that way. Given the specific set of charities GiveWell are evaluating at the moment I would recommend first exploring \u2018Markov Chain\u2019 structures. These are very flexible and would allow for a lot more flexibility over e.g. parameters decaying, compounding and being path dependent. This comes at the cost of making certain other modelling tasks harder, so it is a question of the GiveWell team finding a balance they are happy with.&nbsp;</p><h2>4.2 Errors</h2><p>I\u2019ve never built a model without errors, and so I\u2019m acutely aware I\u2019m sitting in a glass house about to start hefting stones around in this section. I am certainly not claiming I have some level of quality that GiveWell don\u2019t have! Nevertheless, I have identified some areas which I think are just straight-up errors in the model, giving the wrong result:</p><ul><li>The adjustment for charity-level factors double-counts these issues. For example, GiveWell assume that the risk of \u2018Misappropriation without monitoring results\u2019 is 10% for SCI Foundation and the risk of \u2018False monitoring results\u2019 is 5%. Taken together this gives a total risk of something going wrong with your donation of 10%+5% =15%. GiveWell says that each dollar you donate to SCI Foundation is therefore only \u2018worth\u2019 $0.85 (ie 85% of $1). However, we can see this isn\u2019t a good assumption; if only 90% of your money ever makes it to the intended recipient (because 10% is misappropriated) then a 5% risk of false monitoring results means 5% * 90% of your original donation will be wasted, not 5% * 100% as GiveWell assume. This is only a difference of $0.005 per dollar donated vs the GiveWell assumption, but it matters a lot more when very large or very small percentage values are involved&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsnkwwiu4ngf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsnkwwiu4ngf\">[9]</a></sup></span>.</li><li>The model reports the effectiveness of an intervention per philanthropic dollar spent, but this is (subtly) incorrect. The decision problem facing GiveWell is not exactly finding the most cost-effective charity per philanthropic dollar, but rather finding the most cost-effective charity that <strong>my</strong> philanthropic dollar can contribute towards. So, the cost-effectiveness of a particular charity per dollar I personally donate ought to be the effectiveness that that dollar brings, plus any matched additional philanthropic funding that dollar generates \u2013 but I\u2019ve still only spent one dollar when it comes to the \u2018cost\u2019 part of \u2018cost-effectiveness\u2019. The idea is that you might abstractly be interested in the total cost of an intervention vs its effects, or even the total philanthropic cost of an intervention vs its effects, but GiveWell is concretely interested in the good done by a marginal donation, so only the first actor matters. Hopefully the diagram below illuminates more than it confuses!</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/bbc349bc4804ad8a094f20e0f34610c99f08a22b8ff25c40.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><ul><li>Further, the above issue is not quite consistent across the model \u2013 HKI and New Incentives do it the way I suggest whereas the other charities do it the \u2018wrong\u2019 way. At the very least the philosophical approach (known as the \u2018perspective\u2019 in jargon) should be consistent across all charities. Just to return to the conceptual framework issue from earlier, I note that this inconsistency would probably have been spotted if the costs of charities were being directly compared to each other \u2013 it is because the framework is wrong that this issue is so hard to spot.</li><li>The model uses estimates from <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/Global%20Burden%20of%20Disease%20and%20Risk%20Factors.pdf\">Lopez&nbsp;</a>et al (2006) to calculate how many future years of life a life saved is likely to lead to at different ages. However, Lopez uses a discount rate of 3% whereas the main GiveWell model uses a discount rate of 4%. This is important because it means the source used to calculate the future value of health and the source used to calculate the future value of consumption differ as to what the future will actually look like&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc4c479x0yot\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc4c479x0yot\">[10]</a></sup></span>.</li><li>There\u2019s a number of hard-coded formula in the New Incentives sheet (ie formula which contain an actual number rather than a reference to a cell), which therefore won\u2019t update when you make changes to the model. This occurs on row 80, 81, 146, 162, 170. There\u2019s also a stray hard-coded formula in AMF which occurs in Cell B28, which also contains an Inconsistent Formula Error, making it potentially the most erroneous cell in the entire model.</li></ul><p>To give a sense about how minor these errors are, I would be extremely pleased and surprised if a model I submitted to a national regulator had nothing worse than these errors in. It is a great credit to the GiveWell team that in this area where hard work and intelligence (rather than experience of building different kinds of models) has the greatest returns, they are comfortably ahead of the professional curve for Health Economists on this metric.</p><h2>4.3 Usability issues</h2><p>Finally, a handful of minor miscellaneous irritants which don\u2019t affect model accuracy but do make it harder to work with:</p><h3><u>4.3.1 Unclear markup</u></h3><p>It is helpful when cells which can be changed with user inputs are flagged, so that the user can be confident that they won\u2019t break formulas by amending inputs to the model. GiveWell follows best practice in this area by colour-coding user-input cells as blue-text and calculation cells as black-text. There\u2019s also a slightly peculiar convention of colour-coding cells piped from elsewhere in green-text, but there\u2019s no particular harm in this. Personally, I find this convention quite tricky to follow at a glance \u2013 the blues and blacks sort of blend in to each other \u2013 but I have pretty bad eyesight so your mileage might vary.</p><p>The screenshot below is a typical element of the Original model:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b8b41e4455ba573f71e9aaf013f3fa47faca2cd079522709.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><p>And below this is a typical element from the Refactored model (this is actually images from two tabs, because the blue user-entry cells are kept strictly separate from the green piping cells and clear calculation cells):</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/121ea9474e0213d87c82013bbf9955bc57a55bc018de08d2.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><p>I slightly prefer my convention of colour-coding the backgrounds to colour-coding the text, but it is not a strong preference.</p><p>What is slightly more problematic is that there are errors in the GiveWell markup.

Some of the formulas used by GiveWell are bafflingly overcomplicated. For example, here is the formula I use to reference the discount rate whenever it crops up:</p><blockquote><p><i>='Moral Inputs'!$G$7</i></p></blockquote><p>And here is the formula GiveWell use:</p><blockquote><p><i>=INDEX('Moral weights and discount rate'!1:39,MATCH(\"Overall discount rate\",'Moral weights and discount rate'!A:A,0), MATCH(\"Active\",'Moral weights and discount rate'!1:1,0))</i></p></blockquote><p>The only explanation I can think of is that perhaps this is the way that some old version of Google Sheets handles piping and nobody has corrected the formula since? There\u2019s a fairly lengthy explanation about how to use these formula on the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKq-MNU-xtn_48uN33L6VvBEZRAduvjwWMeaEffL4K4/edit#heading=h.vd8iztq8sq5o\">GiveWell website</a> so I get the sense it is more deliberate than that. Either way it is a really weird way to handle data, but it always seems to give the correct outcome so I can hardly fault GiveWell for their commitment to it!</p><p>While I certainly wouldn\u2019t be above mentioning this just on aesthetic grounds, it actually has major usability implications for the model because resolving that kind of formula takes so much longer than resolving a quick and direct formula. In the Original model it takes my laptop 8.3 seconds to update the discount in Excel (although much less than that if I keep the model in Sheets, for some reason). In the Refactored model it can update the discount rate over 1000 times in this same period. Since altering input variables rapidly is something we very much want to be doing while reviewing and updating a model, I\u2019d recommend moving away from these ultra-complicated formulas.</p><h3><u>4.3.5 Explanatory comments</u></h3><p>To end on a positive note, I absolutely love the convention GiveWell adopt of including detailed explanatory comments on almost all data inputs in the model. It is common in Health Economics to include baffling dropdown menus full of impenetrable acronyms (would you prefer RPSTFM or mRPSTFM for your survival curve?), so to see a modelling team with such a strong emphasis on actually explaining what they are doing at every step is a real breath of fresh air. I also like the way that more detail on the figures can be communicated, such as discussing limitations with the evidence or uncertainty over the correct way of interpreting a study. All in all, this is something I will be taking back to my day-job with me.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/d8817e03449db15668e0d6cfa602e14ae4a218eb9d137d9a.png/w_940 940w\"></figure><h1>Section 6 \u2013 Conclusions</h1><p>Overall, the GiveWell model deserves its reputation as a strong example of Effective Altruism cost-effectiveness modelling. It accomplishes its goals of accurately calculating the base-case utility of each intervention, with only some very minor errors which don\u2019t appear to fundamentally alter the value of its conclusions.</p><p>The major issue with the model is a lack of uncertainty analysis. I cannot stress how significant an improvement getting this nailed would be to the lives of the EA community. Other issues are mostly just missed opportunities to architecture the model in a way that will make it easier to work with, locate errors and future-proof the analysis. Of these \u2018architectural errors\u2019 the most important by far is a non-standard use of external sources; both source discovery/aggregation (which is usually done with a systematic literature review) and source input in the model (which is usually done by directly including the source in the model, rather than linking out to an external \u2013 but still first-party \u2013 analysis).</p><p>Recommendations for improving future iterations of the model (in a rough order of importance) are:</p><ul><li>The goal of a cost-effectiveness model is always to solve a decision problem \u2013 there is no other use for a model other than academic curiosity. The model should be treated as though it is the only thing GiveWell use to make decisions, which would involve designing significantly more \u2018adversarial\u2019 results pages and potentially including other charities for evaluation to ensure that the least cost-effective top charities are still effective enough to differentiate themselves from the pack. This is true whether or not GiveWell actually treat the model as the only thing that is used to make decisions; to do anything less is to deliberately underutilise the model.</li><li>Strongly consider the overall architecture of the model before beginning work on a future version. If the model type changes for any charity, the optimal architecture will probably change accordingly, so this is something to consider more seriously if GiveWell move away from deterministic decision trees for any of their charities.</li><li>Undertake at least some systematisation of literature sources to the model. If this has already been done, it may be appropriate to mention this in the model in a comment bubble over the relevant section to avoid the impression of atypical evidence synthesis methods.</li><li>Generally fix all errors, formatting issues and either fix or explain weird differences between superficially similar charities (eg pick a certain multiplier for resources in a household and stick with it).</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn08fdznub274i\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref08fdznub274i\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Moreover, the decision problem facing GiveWell modellers is significantly harder than those I\u2019d face in my day-job. Cash Transfers and Deworming are completely dissimilar interventions, so you can\u2019t reuse much model logic from one intervention to another. Given this, it wasn't even like the GiveWell team could just adapt existing common techniques when they were inventing EA modelling.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnd51zjmwjxtq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefd51zjmwjxtq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>It is my understanding that donors cannot demand their donation is spent in a particular country \u2013 if this is not the case then I withdraw that last critical comment and GiveWell are right to split outcomes by country, but then they should also report results by country-charity combination rather than by charity</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnh4znuwpl9s\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefh4znuwpl9s\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>In conventional cost-effectiveness modelling there is no such thing as a technology which is \u2018cost-effective\u2019 in a vacuum; much like the Sith, pharmaceutical products become cost-effective only by defeating other pharmaceutical products in value-for-money stakes.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsg3p7lkxrt\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsg3p7lkxrt\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I'm not sure if an exception which proves the rule is helpful here, but just in case; I used to work mostly on fertility interventions. Fertility interventions have two main effects from a medical point of view - they can create babies where none would have existed before (and these babies have their own stream of QALYs), and they can manage the mental health impact of wanting children but not having them (which improves parental QALYs). Early on, me and my team took the decision that these QALYs really genuinely were different kinds of 'thing' and that we weren't going to compare interventions head-to-head on these metrics. This was so that we didn't have to prioritise interventions which created lots of babies per live birth (like IVF) at the expense of interventions which created an ordinary number of babies with excellent management of parental mental health (like psychosexual counselling). This was basically us sidestepping the Repugnant Conclusion. This is a very strong philosophical assumption (I'm not even sure we were right to make it, in hindsight) and I'd expect to see argumentation on the level of 'the alternative is the Repugnant Conclusion' before I'd accept it of GiveWell choosing not to compare charities head-to-head.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnc63bxpz6n4w\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefc63bxpz6n4w\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I know GiveWell colour code the sheet nicely but that isn't exactly what I'm talking about.

I sadly suspect that that won't really happen in the EA or LW communities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>One of the things that makes me an outlier in today\u2019s technology scene is that I cannot even begin to understand or empathize with mindsets capable of being scared of AI and robots in a special way. I sincerely believe their fears are strictly nonsensical in a philosophical sense, in the same sense that I consider fear of ghosts or going to hell in an \u201cafterlife\u201d to be strictly nonsensical. Since I often state this position (and not always politely, I\u2019m afraid) and walk away from many AI conversations, I decided to document at least a skeleton version of my argument. One that grants the AI-fear view the <i>most</i> generous and substantial interpretation I can manage.</p><p>Let me state upfront that I share in <i>normal</i> sorts of fears about AI-based technologies that apply to all kinds of technologies. Bridges can collapse, nuclear weapons can end the world, and chemical pollution can destabilize ecosystems. In that category of fears, we can include: killer robots and drones can kill more efficiently than guns and Hellfire missiles, disembodied AIs might misdiagnose X-rays, over-the-air autopilot updates might brick entire fleets of Teslas causing big pile-ups, and trading algorithms might cause billions in losses through poorly judged trades. Criticisms of the effects of existing social media platforms that rely on AI algorithms fall within these boundaries as well.</p><p>These are normal engineering risks that are addressable through normal sorts of engineering risk-management. Hard problems but not categorically novel.</p><p>I am talking about \u201cspecial\u201d fears of AI and robots. In particular, ones that arise from our tendency to indulge in what I will call <i>hyperanthropomorphic projection, </i>which I define as attributing to AI technologies \u201csuper\u201d versions of traits that we perceive in ourselves in poorly theorized, often ill-posed ways. These include:</p><p>\u201cSentience\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsciousness\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntentionality\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-awareness\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral intelligence\u201d</p><p>I will call the terms in this list <i>pseudo-traits. </i>I\u2019m calling them that, and putting scare quotes around all of them, because I think they are <i>all, </i>without exception, examples of what the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/\"><u>philosopher Gilbert Ryle</u></a> referred to as \u201cphilosophical nonsense.\u201d It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t point to (or at least gesture at) real phenomenology, but that they do so in a way that is so ill-posed and not-even-wrong that anything you might say about that phenomenology using those terms is essentially nonsensical. But this can be hard to see because sentences and arguments written using these terms can be read coherently. Linguistic intelligibility does not imply meaningfulness (sentences like \u201ccolorless green ideas sleeping furiously\u201d or \u201cwater is triangular\u201d proposed by Chomsky/Pinker are examples of intelligible philosophical nonsense).</p><p>To think about AI, I myself use a super-pseudo-trait mental model, which I described briefly in <a href=\"https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/superhistory-not-superintelligence\"><u>Superhistory, not Superintelligence</u></a>. But my mental model rests on a non-anthropomorphic pseudo-trait: time, and doesn\u2019t lead to any categorically unusual fears or call for categorically novel engineering risk-management behaviors. I will grant that my model might <i>also</i> be philosophical nonsense, but if so, it is a different variety of it, with its nonsensical aspects rooted in our poor understanding of time.</p></blockquote><p>Read the <a href=\"https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/beyond-hyperanthropomorphism\">entire thing.</a></p>", "user": {"username": "Locke"}}, {"_id": "BKhfT2hwscAGNZKmL", "title": "Scrutiny Around Billionaire Giving - A Good Idea?", "postedAt": "2022-08-24T17:51:26.748Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi All,</p><p>I recently read The Business Of Changing The World by Raj Kumar, and was convinced by his arguments that there should be greater scrutiny (ie \u2018detailed tracking\u2019) of billionaire philanthropy, and, eventually, scrutiny around the effectiveness of that giving.</p><p>I\u2019m thinking of starting a project whereby this data is collected and made available publicly - initially likely just in the form of a table/spreadsheet and potentially later in a more \u2018processed\u2019 form, such as a website.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m interested in the opinions of the community around:</p><p>1.

If there are some loitering around behind private Google Docs but not shared more widely, what's driving this?</p><p><strong>Why I'm asking this:</strong></p><ul><li>I think it's one thing to say \"the long-run matters\", but quite another thing to say \"the long-run matters, and we can probably affect it\" and quite another thing to say <strong>\"the long-run matters, we have worked up ways to impact it and - more importantly - to know if we're failing so we can divest / divert energy elsewhere\".</strong></li><li>I feel the above sums up a lot of the tension between long-termists and people more sceptical; they're driven by different assumptions about how easily the long-term can be positively affected, and how to affect it, and also different viewpoints on moral uncertainty both in the near- and long-term. (And other things to, but top-of-the-head example pulling). For example...:<ul><li>a long-termist might be more sceptical about the durability of many near-term interventions, thereby opting for much longer-term planning and action;&nbsp;</li><li>whereas a near-term advocate will believe that near-term interventions and strategies both cash out and can last long enough to affect the long-term</li></ul></li><li>I'm a fence-sitter on the near- Vs. long-termism question, I think this is epistemically the most sensible place for me to be. Why? I'm frustrated by the amount of near-term interventions, particularly in global health and development, which prove less durable in the long-run, and therefore think there's value towards a longer time-range. But I also think there's many epistemic and accountability risks endemic to long-termism, such as how it's easy to pitch for results you'll (probably) never be around to see or be accountable for; I notice this thinking flaw in myself when I think about long-term interventions.</li><li><strong>I think it's even more morally incumbent on advocates of long-termism to put forward more concrete theories of impact / victory </strong>for a few reasons:<ul><li>Near-term advocates work will be tested / scrutinised by others just by coming to fruition in their lifetimes / careers; therefore, there is a feedback loop and holding to account and - where necessary - epistemic updating and disinvestment in things that don't work.</li><li>With long-termism, there's not a small risk of leaving value on the table not just right now but value that could endure; in fact, I know this makes many long-termists question whether they've chosen the right path, and this is good!&nbsp;</li><li>I think if you're advocating for long-termism (or any cause area), you kind of owe it to people who are asked to change their careers / donating to give them weightier reasons and mechanisms for assessing whether / when they should change their minds. &nbsp;<ul><li>I agree with criticisms that we do have a culture of deference within EA are fair; particularly when contrasted with the rationalists and where there's more emphasis on developing intellectual skills so that you can understand and question what you're hearing from others in the tribe. And lesbehonest - there's benefits to splitting responsibilities between those who set direction and those who row there. But I do think the rowers deserve a bit more assurance they ain't headed for the doldrems of negative utility.<ul><li>I notice when the deference pull happens to me. I was accepting theoretical arguments for long-termism based on some notable (but self-selecting) examples, such as how cultural values around meat consumption have shaped animal suffering for thousands of years. But I was still not listening to the part of my brain saying \"but how easy is it to apply these lessons in reality to make the purposted impact?\"&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>I can't be the only one feeling this tension, and wanting to scrutinise things in more detail, but also not having time outside of my work and personal obligations to do this. But it feels like there community is drowning in chat of \"this matters so much and we can do things about it, so you should do something about it\", but a lot less of \"here's how testable / scrutinisable these interventions are, so you can make informed decisions\". Maybe this will change when Will's book is pumping on the airways a bit less, idk...</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What could these ToI / ToV look like?<ul><li>As someone who's done lots of ToI / ToV work before, it would seem sensible to start with slim, narrow&nbsp;causes and build out from that. Ideally selecting for causes with some structural similarities to others, and some existing real-world evidence; such as X-risk pandemic preparedness. But I'd likely choose an even smaller sliver within that and work on it in detail; something like 1-3 specific biosecurity interventions which could be implemented now or in the near-term.</li><li>I think these ToI / ToV could be for narrow and broad long-termism, and individual long-termish cause areas within that, such as improving long-term institutional design and decision making.&nbsp;</li><li>Arguably, broad-longtermism should have even more considered ToV / ToI given how fuzzy an idea it is, and how liable our world is to unintended consequences / counterproductive backlash when it comes to things like inculcating cultural values.</li></ul></li><li>Would I be willing to do some of the thinking on this?<ul><li>Eh maybe... I ain't a full-time advocate, and therefore less likely to be the person putting forward long-termist ToI / ToV, but could be a red-teamer.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>What we already have:</strong></p><p>We've seen some theories of impact / victory written up in varying levels of detail...:</p><ul><li>on farmed animal welfare <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/djQSjAQwXAcxMbFqQ/what-s-the-theory-of-change-theory-of-victory-for-farmed\">here</a></li><li>improving institutional decision-making <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ds2PCjKgztXtQrqAF/disentangling-improving-institutional-decision-making-2\">here</a></li><li>AI governance <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xTkejiJHFsidZ9hMo\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/ai-governance-opportunity-and-theory-of-impact\">here</a>, arguably with more of a near-term perspective in so far as when the proof of impact is expected to fall</li><li>EA community building / meta-EA <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/96muD9g8CdHYLe5kY/meta-ea-needs-models\">here</a></li><li>general ToV building across many cause areas, or inviting others to do the same <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yJazSyvd8rgrLaokL/what-is-your-theory-of-victory\">here</a></li><li>and advice about world-view investigations, lending itself a little like a 'how-to' guide, over <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vcjLwqLDqNEmvewHY/tips-for-conducting-worldview-investigations\">here</a></li><li>\"<a href=\"https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/william-macaskill/what-we-owe-the-future/9781541618633/\">What We Owe the Future</a>\" (or at least the pre-published versions I read of it) is notably <i>not</i> about putting forward ToVs, but rather arguing that the long-run can be affected and putting forward certain plausible mechanisms on the macro level (e.g. influencing future values) and on the meso level (e.g. citizens assemblies and scaling up participatory democracy like done in Taiwan).</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "howdoyousay?"}}, {"_id": "wEKFFqjBHFEKEL2LH", "title": "Pressing News Front Page", "postedAt": "2022-08-24T09:54:23.024Z", "htmlBody": "<p>\"A newspaper that would cover the most important facts about the last 24 hours would cover the 15,000 child deaths on its cover page every day.\"<br>\u2014<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality#child-mortality-is-an-everyday-tragedy-of-enormous-scale-that-rarely-makes-the-headlines\">Our World in Data</a></p><p>So here you go:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_120 120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_240 240w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_360 360w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_720 720w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_840 840w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_960 960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_1080 1080w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/642b1ce2028efe3f50280a46ffce1e67a45c9d01aeff183a.png/w_1156 1156w\"></figure><p>I hope to inspire a fellow human to write about what matters to humanity, not newspapers' ad departments.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "andreferretti"}}, {"_id": "tqJG3omjWrdaLcSHk", "title": "Effective altruism's billionaires aren't taxed enough.

History is replete with the efforts of the early Effective Altruists to force their new morality upon the inhabitants of conquered planets.

No one is entirely right, no one is entirely wrong. What matters is that we promote the common good and not attempt to wage war in the name of altruism. The people, who are being misled, now deserve the Truth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;To those Effective Altruists who dare read this letter, which challenges their veracity, I have done their homework for them, that is read Hausa'n translations of the EA Forum, which can set their mind at ease so they can ignore the truth, that one must not concern oneself with details, and numbers, and focus on their supposed inspiration.</p><p>Throughout the history of humankind, there has always been that quest for wanting to know that which we sometimes say is unknowable.&nbsp;A darkness pervaded the early life of man and in that darkness was brought not only fear of being unable to see the dangers around him, but also a darkness which filled his mind with horrible thoughts as to what could happen to him since he was without knowledge. A darkness that brought on fears, fear of not knowing, and fear of being at the mercy of the elements of disaster, catastrophe, pestilence, and disease. Ignorance is without knowledge. Man did not know, but man wanted to know. Where will he gain this knowledge? How will he gain this knowledge? Who will give him this knowledge?</p><p>This quest for knowledge or alleged knowledge brought about the beginnings of a class of people later to become the AI researchers, wildlife biologists, artificial meat technicians, entrepreneurs, fundraisers, movement builders, and philanthropists who would act as intermediaries between the known and unknown, between man and the material world. These so called intermediaries eliminated a culture of reciprocity. The philosophers attempt to explain the nature of things and function to help man, but over time came to help them. Often times their actions helped themselves and/or their organizations to become institutions of indisputable power.&nbsp;</p><p>This left mankind in the clutches of effective institutions that did whatever was necessary to perpetuate their powers, their definitions of effectiveness, or altruism, and their beliefs. A select group [<i>oligarchy</i>] will dictate to man what beliefs are, a select few who cannot even follow their own laws. Man was in search of a a morality, a morality who is both omnipresent and omnipotent.&nbsp;Man is in search of a god that will cure the evils of this world and who is more powerful than any ruler on earth is. Man is in need of ethical guidance and uplifting against the disasters that occur in this mundane world and the wrongs that are perpetrated by his fellow man. Man has put his faith in those who claimed to have this knowledge.</p>", "user": {"username": "3894hgwd"}}, {"_id": "zgu2FSnBXdbThZqH7", "title": "Donating crypto effectively?", "postedAt": "2022-08-24T05:28:59.798Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I have some small supplementary income in crypto (BAT and BTC) and was wondering if there's an interval I should donate to ensure my crypto donations are timely and effective?

The capital investment required to replace that segment is in the trillions. Even once that money starts to be spent, global production would fall to early 2000s levels for perhaps 15 years as the lag in production of fabs and tools, not to mention engineering know-how, would take decades to reaquire. Given the importance of microelectronics to the global economy and the centrality of Taiwan to microelectronics, the disruption caused by such an eventuality would be hard to quantify.&nbsp;</p><p>To put Taiwan going dark into context, consider the most recent chip shortage. A Goldman Sachs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/what-the-chip-shortage-means-for-the-us-economy-152607880.html\">report</a> estimated that 169 industries were impacted by the chip shortage and there would be a reduction in GDP growth by 0.5 to 1%. This was because of a 20% shortage of semiconductors which led to slowing industrial production. But the impacts of this are non-linear, so merely extrapolating from this would be inappropriate. As Secretary Raimondo said in her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/01/secretary-raimondo-announces-results-request-information-semiconductor-supply\">blog post</a>, American companies were holding 5 days worth of semiconductor inventory.

I don't know if you guys ever hoarded toilet paper, [and] there was obviously the PPE shortage. One of the most humbling things to think about here is: we lived through all those acute shortages, and they were really frustrating, but it wasn't like a semiconductor shortage of every major component that we need for all advanced processes. Those [shortages during the pandemic] were usually very specific, like shortages for display ICs or the lower-cost ones.</p><p>We weren't really seeing massive shortages for the kinds of advanced chips that are key to all these technologies that we take for granted now, and there's no spare production capacity to bring it up.</p><p><strong>Eric Breckenfeld:</strong> Let\u2019s picture a world where, suddenly, Taiwan isn't allowed to have electricity anymore. You\u2019re going to start building fabs in the US, Japan, and South Korea, but there's a lead time on that. That'll be a few years, at least \u2014 that's optimistic.</p><p>But then when those fabs turn on, you have no guarantee that you're going to hit yields.</p><h3>TSMC's magic is that they have engineering special sauce: they can somehow hit insane yield at processes that are challenging for everybody else.</h3><p>Even if you step up new capacity \u2014 we didn't talk about how Taiwan went dark \u2014 in the worst-case scenario, you also don't have access to their engineering talent. Who's going to run these fabs? You have to relearn a lot of the knowledge in the fabs\u2019 proprietary \u2014 and that's the Coca-Cola recipe, right? They keep that safely guarded.

Calculating a \u201ctrue\u201d measure of a new drug\u2019s QALY impact is further complicated by the difficulty of capturing all indirect benefits.

In other words, unlike healthier industries, revenues from new products barely keeps pace with the patent expirations.<a><sup><u>[v]</u></sup></a></p><p>In the biopharma world, innovation does not drive growth; instead, price-jacking disguises the R&amp;D productivity malaise. It is earnings-per-share (EPS)\u2014not R&amp;D productivity\u2014that drives biopharma stock prices and investment flows, so from outside the industry, things look healthier than they really are. If true, this would align with certain other observable facts:</p><ul><li>Drug/vaccine markets are highly regulated and subject to intense government intervention at every level. These interventions create opportunities for rent-seeking. The cat-and-mouse cycles of regulation and evasion that ensue drive further complexity.<a><sup><u>[vi]</u></sup></a></li><li>Some well-intentioned regulatory barriers hand undue pricing power to drug makers.

Sexy new discovery technologies get the lion\u2019s share of R&amp;D funding, the general idea being to pick better drug molecules (safer, more potent, etc.) that will then enjoy higher success rates in the clinic and therefore, finally, nudging R&amp;D productivity higher.

But still, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that the whole set-up is unsustainable. Industry lobbyists have successfully fended off bipartisan political pressure to engage in price fixing for decades, but it\u2019s not obvious that this can go on forever. If a rent-seeking cash cow really is propping up the whole business, things could unwind in a hurry.

Even more so than individual humans, organizations (and industries) are capable of multiple simultaneous and conflicting motivations. However, the occasional Shkreli aside, people who work in biopharma are decent people who really do want to create new cures that make lives better. And many individual actors (especially startups) certainly have strong economic incentives to create breakthrough therapies. Economic forces and price signals have been attenuated, not abolished.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, it is EPS growth that drives decision-making inside big pharmaceutical companies. Decision-making and priorities within these big companies also dominate thinking within VCs and smaller biopharma companies because big-company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paras_biotech/status/1561173290466549760?s=20&amp;t=v8DSATzOhdcTVqSC2jGhcw\">M&amp;A</a> and in-licensing activities are the <a href=\"https://www.baybridgebio.com/blog/pharma-ma-capacity.html\"><u>main drivers</u></a> of investment returns for those smaller actors.&nbsp;</p><p>There\u2019s a big gap (years!) between R&amp;D investment and EPS growth, so there\u2019s bound to be some slippage, even in the best of worlds. On this telling, the observed industry behavior is an unfortunate, emergent property of the system, not anyone\u2019s intentional design. The behavior patterns that get reinforced\u2014through a million small mechanisms like promotions, budget allocations, new investments, and public approbation\u2014are ultimately those that yield EPS growth, not R&amp;D productivity. For the industry as a whole, so long as enough new drugs are launched to \u201ckeep up appearances,\u201d there seems to be little pressure to fundamentally change things, so those patterns tend to perpetuate themselves.</p><h2>Neglect: why aren\u2019t government agencies fixing this problem?</h2><p>The U.S. federal government spends <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/2022/nih-budget-fy22-outcomes-and-fy23-request\"><u>billions</u></a> subsidizing and regulating biopharmaceuticals. They are <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57126\"><u>not unaware</u></a> of the R&amp;D productivity problem. To their credit, FDA staff\u2014like their colleagues in industry, mostly motivated, well-intentioned people\u2014have launched several initiatives in response to public criticism of the agency\u2019s perceived role in driving up drug development costs. Some examples are the Model-Informed Drug Development Pilot <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/model-informed-drug-development-pilot-program\"><u>Program</u></a>, and CDER\u2019s Emerging Technology <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/emerging-technology-program\"><u>Program</u></a>, and the Accelerated Approval <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-health-care-professionals-drugs/accelerated-approval-program\"><u>Pathway</u></a>.</p><p>However, these initiatives are small in comparison to the overall incentives and pressures facing agencies like the FDA and NIH.

The R&amp;D productivity decline is usually considered an exogenous factor, an unalterable law of nature. Unsurprisingly, for most (though not Stott) the recommended policy is usually to <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737167.2022.1987219\"><u>increase subsidies</u></a> (especially for academics!).&nbsp;</p><p>In short, while academic research usefully illuminates the problem, it seems very unlikely to generate the iconoclastic <i>cultural</i> break needed to fix the field\u2019s <i>cultural </i>problem.</p><h2>Conclusions about neglectedness</h2><ul><li>Biopharma companies do have incentives to find new drugs, but these are attenuated (<i>high confidence</i>).</li><li>Biopharma R&amp;D investment is heavily biased toward one segment of the new drug development process (the high-status, early-stage discovery segment) and does not seem to affect the rate of R&amp;D productivity decline (<i>moderate confidence</i>).</li><li>The underlying causes of the R&amp;D productivity malaise may be cultural (<i>moderate confidence</i>).</li><li>Government and academic researchers devote relatively little effort to the biopharma R&amp;D productivity problem (<i>high confidence</i>).</li></ul><h1>Tractability</h1><p>In thinking about the tractability of the biopharma R&amp;D productivity problem, it is useful to consider the&nbsp; parallels with another market where a massive productivity leap recently occurred: orbital launch services.</p><h2>Analogy: Boeing vs. SpaceX</h2><p>The pre-SpaceX orbital launch market was similar in many ways to drug/vaccine development:</p><ul><li>Both are <i>highly regulated</i> activities due to obvious safety risks.</li><li><i>Public-sector funding</i> is significant for R&amp;D (NASA for space; NIH for drugs) and for revenues (NASA/military customers for space; Medicare etc. for drugs).</li><li>Both are <i>highly politicized</i> (think about space-race politics and the need to spread research across Congressional districts; for drugs, social impact and public-sector healthcare spending dominate the conversation).</li><li>Both are <i>highly technical</i> areas where outsiders are discouraged from expressing opinions (compare the clich\u00e9 \u201cit\u2019s not rocket science\u201d to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/19/opinion/economiy-covid-work.html\"><u>reaction</u></a> when prominent economists began expressing opinions about the public-sector response to Covid-19).</li></ul><p>It is probably no coincidence, given these <i>cultural</i> parallels between the two ecosystems, that massive cost overruns and delays have long characterized new product development in both.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, in the orbital launch industry, a new market entrant (SpaceX) has successfully reduced the costs by an order of magnitude (<a href=\"https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2346/74082/ICES_2018_81.pdf\"><u>more</u></a> by some estimates).

SpaceX uses liquid-fueled rockets like everyone else, not fusion energy or antigravity. In fact, most of the work seems to have been carried out by the same engineers everyone else had access to: SpaceX staffed up by <a href=\"https://www.world-today-news.com/boeing-employees-move-en-masse-to-amazon-and-spacex/\"><u>poaching</u></a> disillusioned engineers from other firms. Like the biopharma industry today, it seems like industry incumbents were staffed with smart idealists frustrated by the constraints imposed by their sickly, subsidy-distorted ecosystem.</p><p><i>Cultural</i> factors are the best explanation for how this unfolded: armed mainly with passion (but yes, also with tons of <a href=\"https://time.com/6127754/elon-musk-net-worth-person-of-the-year/\"><u>private</u></a> capital and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-list-government-subsidies-tesla-billions-spacex-solarcity-2021-12\"><u>public</u></a> subsidies), SpaceX accomplished what most thought to be impossible.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar productivity revolution in drug and/vaccine development should also be possible.</p><h2>Potential areas for investment</h2><h3><strong>EA should subsidize </strong><i><strong>certain</strong></i><strong> kinds of innovative </strong><i><strong>clinical</strong></i><strong> research at </strong><i><strong>private</strong></i><strong> companies</strong></h3><p>To spark a similar productivity leap in biopharma R&amp;D productivity, the EA community should focus its resources on the private sector.</p><p>SpaceX\u2019s company culture was famously rooted in Silicon Valley\u2019s nimble software industry rather than in the process-driven cultures of Boeing and NASA. The core ideas that enabled this productivity leap\u2014especially re-useable booster rockets\u2014had been around a long time, but these ideas were considered \u201cuninvestable\u201d within the institutional constraints faced by engineers at NASA and its contractor ecosystem. Cultural factors are what finally allowed these ideas to finally be put into practice at. SpaceX. And now that self-landing booster rockets are known to be workable\u2014and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/20/spacex-revenue-2-billion-from-rockets-last-year-jefferies-estimate.html\"><u>lucrative</u></a>\u2014<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20151125051400/https:/www.blueorigin.com/news/news/blue-origin-makes-historic-rocket-landing\"><u>many</u></a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALLISTO\"><u>other</u></a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkSpace\"><u>groups</u></a> are building on the idea. Before that, expert opinion was <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacex-faces-the-hard-truth-about-soft-landings-they-re-tough-to-do/\"><u>skeptical</u></a>.</p><p>It will be difficult to predict which innovative ideas could accomplish the same for drug/vaccine development\u2014like re-usable boosters, the best ideas may have been sitting around unused for a long time for reasons of institutional culture. Achieving a similar leap in drug/vaccine R&amp;D productivity will therefore likely require a bold culture change. The seeds of this are most likely to be found within younger, more innovative for-profit companies, so that is where EA should direct its resources.&nbsp;</p><p>More specifically, EA investment should be channeled to for-profit companies working with radically new approaches to clinical development, <i>regardless of disease area</i>.<a><sup><u>[ix]</u></sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Why clinical-stage research? There are two reasons. First, the prevailing culture in the biopharma ecosystem focuses on ever cleverer preclinical discovery technologies; clinical research innovation is starved for funding in relative terms. Second, and more importantly, clinical development is the costliest segment of the discovery process.<a><sup><u>[x]</u></sup></a></p><p>Targeting investment thematically like this would also give rise to the potential for double-dip charitable ROI: <i>first</i>, most new drugs/vaccines are socially valuable in their own right; <i>second</i>, if the new methods are in fact useful and they catch on, they may accelerate development of many other new drugs in the future. Most companies would be happy to accept charitable grants, but equity investment is probably fine too, and may create a flywheel effect. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recently <a href=\"https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/cystic-fibrosis-foundation-receives-3.3-billion-royalty-pay-out\"><u>made billions</u></a> on a mission-oriented investment like this, which they\u2019re now plowing back into more research. But above all, the key goals should be to improve the speed and productivity of clinical trials and to make more advanced statistical approaches culturally acceptable to larger biopharma companies and regulators.</p><p>What is the biopharma equivalent to re-usable boosters? I don\u2019t know, but here are some initial ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>New therapeutic modalities</strong>. Nearly all biopharma industry revenues come from three types of intervention: vaccines, small-molecule drugs, and injected biologics (by volume, mostly insulin and monoclonal antibodies). The last is the newest but has been a mature technology for over 30 years now. It is known that therapeutic classes have different clinical <a><u>success rates (pg. 16)</u></a>, so adding new therapeutic modalities could open the door to improvements in clinical trial success rates, by most accounts the main driver of development costs.</li><li>Another area to look would be clinical-stage companies proposing to use <strong>innovative statistical methods</strong> and <strong>improved clinical trial designs</strong>.<a><sup><u>[xi]</u></sup></a> Product developers in other industries have long used <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Improving-Almost-Anything-Essays-Revised/dp/0471727555\"><u>much more advanced methods</u></a>, which began to permeate the manufacturing and chemicals industries in the 1950s with the statistical design of experiments revolution. These methods are particularly useful for the development of combination therapies, an area of <a href=\"https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-021-02407-8\"><u>intense interest</u></a> right now in oncology. Still, drug developers have yet to carry out a single human clinical trial utilizing this modern experimental approach to statistical design, and the primary reason appears to be a simple cultural blind spot. There are no technical, legal, or regulatory barriers.<ul><li>Historical precedents to build upon here include the FDA\u2019s embrace of adaptive trial <a><u>designs</u></a> and Bayesian statistics, which appear to be on the verge of going mainstream due to some recent high-profile <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/bayesian-statistics-of-efficacy-of-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-part-i-efac8d4e0539\"><u>successes</u></a>. The famous TOGETHER Trial <a href=\"https://www.togethertrial.com/\"><u>consortium</u></a> published some of the most important studies from the Covid-19 pandemic using efficient umbrella trial designs at a small fraction of the cost of the NIH\u2019s studies.</li><li>Another idea would be to empower the old academic literature on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0748798395901051\"><u>large, simple</u></a>\u201d clinical trials with modern internet-enabled decentralized trial technologies now that Covid-19 has made these technologies <a href=\"https://globalforum.diaglobal.org/issue/september-2020/covid-19-the-great-decentralized-clinical-trials-accelerator/\"><u>culturally palatable</u></a> to regulators and ethics boards.</li><li>Expanding the use of <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/05/human-challenge-trials.html\"><u>human challenge trials</u></a> is another promising area.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Progress studies</strong></h3><p>The emerging field of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/\"><u>progress studies</u></a> might well yield useful insights. For example, it would be helpful to have more case studies of disruptive events like the SpaceX example above where a productivity leap followed an institutional cultural change. Even better: are there examples where similar a cultural shift has been intentionally <i>engineered?</i></p><h3><strong>Regulatory arbitrage</strong></h3><p>Regulators heavily influence the culture of new drug/vaccine development ecosystem. And given the dominance of U.S. revenues in most biopharma business plans, the FDA plays a particularly outsized role in setting policies and norms. It would be interesting to explore the potential for accelerating the internationalization of drug development\u2014other regulatory cultures around the world may offer advantages.&nbsp;</p><p>There is precedent for this: when monoclonal antibodies were first being developed in the 1980s, it was common for developers to carry out initial human trials in the U.K., precisely because, at the time, it had a more nimble and flexible regulatory approach<a><sup><u>[xii]</u></sup></a>. Today, many drug/vaccine development programs initiate their first clinical trials in Australia for <a href=\"https://www.corrs.com.au/insights/five-reasons-to-conduct-clinical-trials-in-australia\"><u>similar reasons</u></a>. The famous TOGETHER Trial consortium has published a string of <a href=\"https://www.togethertrial.com/publications\"><u>high-profile papers</u></a> from a set of clinical sites in Brazil showing that top-quality research can be done in developing countries.</p><p>None of these shifts was accompanied by pronounced abuses and trial volunteer fatalities, indicating that the greater regulatory flexibility is possible without sacrificing safety. Here it is important to note that although SpaceX is best known for its \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d <a href=\"https://www.space.com/every-spacex-starship-explosion-lessons-learned\"><u>approach</u></a> to rocket development, the end product was not only vastly cheaper&nbsp;than others, but also one of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-has-set-a-record-for-most-consecutive-successes/\"><u>safest</u></a> ever developed. Research into similar opportunities for <strong>regulatory arbitrage </strong>might therefore be a fruitful area for investment.</p><h3><strong>Advocacy work</strong></h3><p>Advocating for <strong>regulatory reform</strong> here in the U.S. might seem like the obvious place to start. Likewise, lobbying for public healthcare<strong> payment reform</strong> and improving the<strong> government grant-making processes</strong> to reduce rent-seeking could be useful. However, all these areas of public policy are hugely contested, so incremental effort seems unlikely to result in meaningful change. We are inspired by those who are already working in <a href=\"https://newscience.org/\"><u>this area</u></a>; it seems like a Sisyphean task.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why this won\u2019t work</h2><p>Here are some counterarguments to the thesis above:</p><ul><li>This essay is a critique of biopharma industry culture, but perhaps that conservatism appropriately reflects embedded wisdom not obvious to outsiders. There is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States\"><u>sordid history</u></a> of unethical human experimentation, after all. Perhaps in this field, there\u2019s a trade-off between morality and economic efficiency, and we shouldn\u2019t push too hard.<ul><li>On the other hand, rocket ships are hardly safe. And (prior to the 737 debacle) Boeing bureaucracy was lauded for its engineering-first safety culture. And yet, today SpaceX\u2019s way of developing rockets is not only cheaper and faster, but the resulting product is one of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-has-set-a-record-for-most-consecutive-successes/\"><u>safest ever</u></a>.</li></ul></li><li>The SpaceX experience shows that a for-profit company led by a charismatic multimillionaire (and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-list-government-subsidies-tesla-billions-spacex-solarcity-2021-12\"><u>subsidies</u></a>) can shatter productivity malaise in a mature industry. This essay advocates here a more distributed effort, one befitting the EA <i>community</i>. But perhaps this kind of cultural revolution can be effected <i>only</i> by a rare, charismatic multimillionaire.<ul><li>On the other hand, perhaps the key bottleneck in the past has been the rarity of this personality type: the rare wealthy founder who cashes in but still retains their intensity. Subsidies might alleviate this supply shortage.</li></ul></li><li>Biomedical research and clinical research ethics are no more complicated or risky than rocketry and AI, but cultural taboos block outsiders from participating in the conversation. Donors seem easily more cowed by biomedical domain experts than by experts from other fields. This reduces the likelihood that EA donors will be comfortable supporting this cause area.<ul><li>On the other hand, we seem to be living in a special time right now due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many key institutions (CDC, FDA, WHO, etc.) have lost credibility. The pandemic also dissolved the industry\u2019s hopeless passivity in many areas, particularly old accepted truths regarding the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7997594/\"><u>speed</u></a> of drug/vaccine development and the ethics and cultural viability of <a href=\"https://pharmaintelligence.informa.com/resources/product-content/covid-19-pandemic-accelerates-shift-toward-virtual-trials\"><u>de-centralized</u></a> and overseas clinical trials. Now is therefore a particularly auspicious time for this idea.</li></ul></li><li>Some causes of rising R&amp;D costs are structural (e.g., the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroom%27s_law\"><u>better than the Beatles</u></a>\u201d problem), so perhaps there are some features of drug development that really do make it different than other research fields and uniquely intractable.<ul><li>This seems unlikely to me; or at least unfalsifiable. It\u2019s the sort of thing that pessimists say about every field, and there are a variety of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Where-Flying-Car-Storrs-Hall/dp/1953953182\"><u>counterarguments</u></a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Conclusions about tractability</h2><ul><li>It seems likely that the new drug/vaccine R&amp;D productivity slowdown is caused by cultural factors (<i>high confidence</i>).</li><li>The key area where innovation is needed is at the clinical development stage, where regulatory burdens, ethical constraints, and financial pressures are all most severe (<i>high confidence</i>).</li><li>The most impactful investments would be subsidizing for-profit clinical development programs, irrespective of disease area, that are working to establish and culturally normalize the most innovative new statistical approaches and clinical trial design concepts (<i>moderate confidence</i>).</li><li>More traditional funding for research papers (\u201cprogress studies\u201d) and advocacy (lobbying) might also be helpful, but they seem unlikely to accomplish much on their own (<i>moderate confidence</i>).</li></ul><h1>Notes</h1><p><a><sup><u>[i]</u></sup></a> The industry typically measures outcomes with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) rather than disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which seems to be the favored methodology in the effective altruism community. I am not an expert in the nuanced distinctions between these metrics, but they seem unlikely to affect the general thrust of the argument here.</p><p><a><sup><u>[ii]</u></sup></a> The Covid-19 pandemic was accompanied by a relatively small blip in the long-term trend, but it is unclear how much of this is attributable to the massive government <a href=\"https://www.medcbrn.org/solicitations/#1547817555427-f9628bb4-f0b9\"><u>subsidies</u></a> (tab 2, RPP-20-11).</p><p><a><sup><u>[iii]</u></sup></a> Covid-19 interventions are not an exception to this. True, some have been wildly profitable, but that\u2019s hardly surprising given the subsidies (see URL in prior footnote).</p><p><a><sup><u>[iv]</u></sup></a> This analogy shouldn\u2019t be overextended. There are many additional elements in <i>clinical</i> biology, including ethical considerations with human-subjects research, commercialization considerations around pricing and reimbursement, regulatory bodies, and the myriad fashions and trends that drive decision-making among grant-funding bodies, large corporations, and investors. All of these are human constructs, not laws of nature like gene sequencing chemistry.</p><p><a><sup><u>[v]</u></sup></a> As compared with software, semiconductors, and rocketry, the biopharmaceuticals industry is cripplingly dependent upon patent protection, arguably another sign of malaise.</p><p><a><sup><u>[vi]</u></sup></a> Some examples here are <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-biotech-social-contract/the-biotech-social-contract-kolchinsky-tbsc-5-7092b44a1293\"><u>pharmacy benefit managers</u></a>, inducements for doctors to <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/physician-education/fraud-abuse-laws/\"><u>prescribe</u></a> certain drugs or receive kickbacks for <a><u>diagnostic testing</u></a>.</p><p><a><sup><u>[vii]</u></sup></a> It\u2019s probably not a coincidence that hunting new drugs has the highest social status in these organizations. There is no Nobel or Lasker for clinical trial design achievements, and VCs prefer to fund those startups set-up by molecule-hunters, especially if there\u2019s a <i>Nature</i> paper in the origin story. It\u2019s therefore unsurprising that relatively little R&amp;D investment is directed toward more workaday considerations, such as clinical trial design and GMP manufacturing efficiency. This is all anecdotal, but it lines up with the relative lack of such people in the top leadership of drug companies. It would be interesting to see quantitative analysis of this.</p><p><a><sup><u>[viii]</u></sup></a> Not me, for the record.</p><p><a><sup><u>[ix]</u></sup></a> If it\u2019s true that EA has an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/8/8/23150496/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-dustin-moskovitz-billionaire-philanthropy-crytocurrency\"><u>over-funding problem</u></a>, improving clinical drug development is just the sort of QALY-heavy initiative that could easily absorb the excess funds without waste.</p><p><a><sup><u>[x]</u></sup></a> The cost is driven by two factors that amplify each other\u2019s impact. First, the cost of a clinical trial is <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-019-00008-7\"><u>high and rising</u></a>. These direct costs are beyond the resources of most charities and governmental funders, so most simply don\u2019t fund late-stage trials, which contributes to the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/224005-crossing-the-biotech-valley-of-death-from-innovation-to-cure\"><u>Valley of Death</u></a><u>\u201d</u> phenomenon. Second, these investments happen at the end of development, so failure propagates backward through the development budgeting process in a sense, wiping out all investments and capital costs that came before. For planning purposes, this late-stage attrition means that a rational investor must plan on launching many more early-stage programs, which effectively acts as a significant multiplier on the costs of early segments of the pipeline. These early-stage costs are multiplied through the net-present-value calculation due to the high cost of capital (drug development is risky!) and lengthy development timelines. The math is vicious. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3078\"><u>Paul et al.</u></a> propose a simple model to help think through these dynamics.

Today, I'm going to apply that framework to the cause of AI alignment.</p>\n<p>(I'm specifically looking at whether to <em>mission hedge</em> AI, not whether to invest in AI in general. <a href=\"#AI_companies_could_beat_the_market\">[More]</a>)</p>\n<p>Whether to mission hedge crucially depends on three questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the shape of the utility function with respect to AI progress?</li>\n<li>How volatile is AI progress?</li>\n<li>What investment has the strongest correlation to AI progress, and how strong is that correlation?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I came up with these answers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Utility function: No clear answer, but I primarily used a utility function with a linear relationship between AI progress and the marginal utility of money. I also looked at a different function where AI timelines determine how long our wealth gets to compound. <a href=\"#What_is_the_shape_of_the_utility_function_\">[More]</a></li>\n<li>Volatility: I looked at three proxies for AI progress\u2014industry revenue, ML benchmark performance, and AI timeline forecasts. These proxies suggest that the standard deviation of AI progress falls somewhere between 4% and 20%. <a href=\"#How_volatile_is_AI_progress_\">[More]</a></li>\n<li>Correlation: A naively-constructed hedge portfolio would have a correlation of 0.3 at best. A bespoke hedge (such as an \"AI progress swap\") would probably be too expensive. An intelligently-constructed portfolio might work better, but I don't know how much better. <a href=\"#How_good_is_the_best_hedge_\">[More]</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Across the range of assumptions I tested, mission hedging usually\u2014but not always\u2014looked worse on the margin<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-2\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-2\">[2]</a></sup> than investing in the mean-variance optimal portfolio with <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2020/01/06/how_much_leverage_should_altruists_use/\">leverage</a>.

To recap, this framework considers three investable assets:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/04/04/model_of_mission-correlated_investing/#Results-with-a-legacy-investment\">legacy asset</a>: a suboptimal investment that we currently hold and want to sell</li>\n<li>a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/meanvariance-analysis.asp\">mean-variance</a> optimal (MVO) asset: the best thing we could buy if we simply wanted to maximize risk-adjusted return</li>\n<li>a mission hedge asset: something that correlates with AI progress, e.g., AI company stocks</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We also have a <strong>mission target</strong>, which is a measure of the thing we want to hedge. For our purposes, the mission target is AI progress.</p>\n<p>We can sell a little bit of the legacy asset and invest the proceeds into either the MVO asset or the hedge asset. The model tells us which asset we should choose.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-3\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p>We feed the model a few inputs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the expected return, volatility, and correlations for these four variables (three assets plus the mission target)</li>\n<li>a utility function over wealth and the mission target</li>\n<li>our starting level of investment in the three assets</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The model tells us which asset we should shift our investments toward <a href=\"#Why_care_about_mission_hedging_on_the_margin_rather_than_in_equilibrium_\">on the margin</a>.</p>\n<p>(Note: I have tried to make this essay understandable on its own, but it will probably still be easier to understand if you read <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/04/04/model_of_mission-correlated_investing/\">my previous essay</a> first.)</p>\n<p>My model includes many variables. For most of the variables, I assigned fixed values to them\u2014see <a href=\"#A_big_list_of_considerations\">below</a> for a big list of model considerations. I fixed the value of a variable wherever one of the following was true: (1) I was confident that it was (roughly) correct; (2) I was confident that it would be too hard to come up with a better estimate; (3) it didn't affect the outcome much; or (4) it was necessary to make the model tractable.</p>\n<p>That left three considerations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the relationship between AI progress and the utility of money?</li>\n<li>How volatile is AI progress?</li>\n<li>What investment has the strongest correlation to AI progress, how strong is that correlation, and what is its expected return?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So the question of whether to mission hedge (according to this model) comes down to how we answer these three questions.</p>\n<h2>Why care about mission hedging on the margin rather than in equilibrium?</h2>\n<p>When evaluating our investment portfolios, we can consider two distinct questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the optimal allocation to mission hedging in equilibrium\u2014in other words, what is the ultimate allocation to mission hedging that maximizes utility?</li>\n<li>On the margin, what is the expected utility of allocating the next dollar to mission hedging vs. traditional investing?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This essay focuses on the second question because it matters more. Why does it matter more?</p>\n<p>In the long run, we want to know the optimal asset allocation. But we can't instantly move to the optimal allocation. Many altruistic investors have money tied up in assets that they can't sell quickly; many value-aligned investors don't put much thought into how they invest, and end up doing something suboptimal, so we need to <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/03/18/altruistic_investors_care_about_aggregate_altruistic_portfolio/\">account for this</a>.</p>\n<p>I expect it will take a bare minimum of 10 years to for the EA community to move from the current investment allocation to the optimal one.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-4\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-4\">[4]</a></sup> Until then, we want to know what changes will maximize utility in the short run. Therefore, we need to identify the best change on the margin.</p>\n<h2>A big list of considerations</h2>\n<p>Considerations that matter, with the key considerations in bold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shape of the utility function with respect to wealth</li>\n<li><strong>Shape of the utility function with respect to AI progress</strong></li>\n<li>Coefficient of relative risk aversion</li>\n<li>Shape of the distribution of investment returns</li>\n<li>Shape of the distribution of AI progress</li>\n<li>Expected return of the MVO asset</li>\n<li>Expected return of the legacy asset</li>\n<li>Expected return of the hedge asset</li>\n<li>Volatility of the MVO asset</li>\n<li>Volatility of the legacy asset</li>\n<li>Volatility of the hedge asset</li>\n<li><strong>Volatility of AI progress</strong></li>\n<li>Correlation of the MVO asset and the legacy asset</li>\n<li>Correlation of the MVO asset and the hedge asset</li>\n<li>Correlation of the legacy asset and the hedge asset</li>\n<li>Correlation of the MVO asset and AI progress</li>\n<li>Correlation of the legacy asset and AI progress</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation of the hedge asset and AI progress</strong></li>\n<li>Impact investing factor</li>\n<li>Target volatility</li>\n<li>Cost of leverage</li>\n<li>Proportion of portfolio currently invested in MVO/legacy/hedge assets</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A consideration that you might think matters, but doesn't:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expected rate of AI progress \u2014 doesn't affect optimal hedging (for an explanation, see the third qualitative observation <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/04/04/model_of_mission-correlated_investing/#general-solution\">here</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For all the non-key considerations, I assign them a single fixed value.

But I'm going to speculate on it anyway.</em></p>\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/04/04/model_of_mission-correlated_investing/#the-utility-function\">initially developed</a> a model of mission hedging, I specified that utility varies linearly with the mission target. That makes perfect sense if the mission target is something like CO2 emissions. It's not clear that it makes sense for AI. Either transformative AI goes well and it's amazing, or it goes poorly and everyone dies. It's binary, not linear.</p>\n<p>Consider an alternative utility function with these properties:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Transformative AI happens when some unknown amount of AI progress has occurred. The required amount of progress follows some known probability distribution.</li>\n<li>If some unknown amount of alignment research gets done before then, transformative AI goes well. Utility = 1. (The units of our utility function are normalized such that the total value of the light cone is 1.) Otherwise, transformative AI goes badly. Utility = 0. The required amount of alignment research follows some known probability distribution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This utility function (kind of) describes reality better, but it doesn't really work\u2014it heavily depends on what probability distributions you pick. The model only puts high value on AI alignment research if there's a high probability that, if you don't do anything, the amount of alignment research will be very close to the exact required amount. If there's a high probability that enough alignment research gets done without you, or that we'll never get enough research done, then the model says you shouldn't bother. The model becomes highly sensitive to forecasts of AI timelines and of the amount of safety research required.</p>\n<p>(This utility function might imply that we should <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YApaCr98Q7wSYcaoB/mission-correlation-more-than-just-hedging\">mission leverage</a>, not mission hedge. If AI progress accelerates, that decreases the probability that we will be able to get enough safety research done, which might decrease the marginal utility of research.)</p>\n<p>This binary way of thinking doesn't reflect the way people actually think about the value of research. People tend to believe that if less safety research gets done, that makes marginal research more valuable, not less.</p>\n<p>I would think of research in terms of drawing ideas from an urn. Every idea you draw might be the one you need. You start with the most promising ideas and then move on to less promising ones, so you experience diminishing marginal utility of research. And if AI progress moves faster, then marginal alignment research matters more because the last draw from the urn has higher expected utility.</p>\n<p>But if transformative AI will take a long time, that means we get many chances to draw from the urn of ideas. So even if you draw a crucial idea now, there's a good chance that someone else would have drawn it later anyway\u2014your counterfactual impact is smaller in expectation. And the probability that someone else would have drawn the same idea is inversely proportional to the length of time until transformative AI. So we're back to the original assumption that utility is linear with AI progress.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-6\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<h3>Compound-until-AGI utility function</h3>\n<p>We could use an alternative model, which we might call the \"compound-until-AGI\" model:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As before, every dollar spent has some diminishing probability of solving AI alignment.</li>\n<li>Wealth continues to compound until transformative AI emerges, which happens at some uncertain future date.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If we say W = wealth, b = the mission target\u2014in this case, the inverse of time until transformative AI\u2014then the utility function becomes:</p>\n<p><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\begin{align}\nU(W, b) = (W^b)^{1 - \\gamma} \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1 - \\gamma}\n\\end{align}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtable\" style=\"vertical-align: -0.92em;

Ideally, we'd track the <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2021/08/18/mission_hedging_quantity_price/\">quantity of production</a>, but I don't have good data on that, so I'll look at revenue. Revenue is a reasonable proxy for success. Revenue and stock price are probably more closely correlated than production quantity and stock price because there's a more direct path from revenue to shareholder value.</p>\n<p>Rather than just looking at the ML industry (which is only one industry, and didn't even exist until recently), I looked at every industry. For each industry, I calculated the growth in aggregate revenue across the industry, and then found the volatility of growth.</p>\n<p>It's not obvious how to aggregate the volatility numbers for every industry. We could take the mean, but there are some tiny industries with only a few small-cap companies, and those ones have super high volatility. So the average volatility across all industries doesn't represent a reasonable expectation about what the ML industry might look like in the future.</p>\n<p>We could take the median, but that doesn't capture skewness in industry volatility.</p>\n<p>I believe the best metric is a weighted average, weighted by total market cap of the industry. So larger industries get a greater weight when calculating average volatility.</p>\n<p>I calculated the volatility of industry revenue from 1973 to 2013<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-9\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-9\">[9]</a></sup>. I also calculated the volatility of <em>market-neutral</em> industry revenue, which is the revenue per share of an industry minus the revenue per share of the total market.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-10\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-10\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The results:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Long-Only</th>\n<th>Market-Neutral</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Weighted Mean</td>\n<td>17.6%</td>\n<td>19.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mean</td>\n<td>18.2%</td>\n<td>20.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Median</td>\n<td>14.1%</td>\n<td>17.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Std Dev</td>\n<td>14.5%</td>\n<td>8.8%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>(<code>Std Dev</code> is the standard deviation of the standard deviations.)</p>\n<p>For context, there were 66 industries as defined by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard\">GICS</a>. The average industry contained 17 stocks in 1973 and 47 stocks in 2013.</p>\n<h2>ML benchmark performance</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, other people have already put a lot of work into measuring the performance over time of state-of-the-art ML models.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they all care about average improvement or trends in improvement, not about volatility.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, some of them have made their data publicly available, so we can calculate the volatility using their data.</p>\n<p>I used the Electronic Frontier Foundation's <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics\">AI Progress Measurement</a> database, which aggregates ML model scores across dozens of benchmarks, including Chess Elo rating, Atari game performance, image classification loss, and language parsing accuracy, to name a few. The data ranges from 1984 to 2019, although until 2003, it only included a single measure of AI performance (Chess elo), and there still weren't many metrics until 2015.</p>\n<p>For each metric-year, I calculated the growth in performance on that metric since the previous year, where performance is defined as loss (or inverse loss, if you want a number that increases rather than decreases<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-11\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-11\">[11]</a></sup>). Then I took the average growth across all metrics.</p>\n<p>I calculated the mean and standard deviation of the logarithm of growth over three time periods: the full period (1985\u20132019<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-12\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-12\">[12]</a></sup>), just the most recent 10 years (2010\u20132019), and just the period with many metrics (2015\u20132019):</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Mean</th>\n<th>Stdev</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1985\u20132019</td>\n<td>10.7%</td>\n<td>15.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2010\u20132019</td>\n<td>29.6%</td>\n<td>15.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2015\u20132019</td>\n<td>40.6%</td>\n<td>15.7%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Before running these numbers, I worried that I'd get dramatically different numbers for the standard deviation depending on what range I used. But luckily, all three standard deviations fall within 0.3 percentage points (even though the averages vary a lot). These numbers (weakly) suggest that, even though ML progress has been accelerating, volatility hasn't increased. (Although if we expect ML progress to continue accelerating, that means our subjective volatility should be higher.)</p>\n<h2>AI timeline forecasts</h2>\n<p>As a final test, I calculated AI progress from AI timeline forecasts. In a sense, this is the best metric, because it's the only one that really captures the type of progress we care about. But in another sense, it's the worst metric, because (1) we don't have any particularly good forecasts, and (2) how do you convert a timeline into a growth rate?</p>\n<p>To convert an AI timeline into a growth rate, I simply took the inverse of the number of years until transformative AI. This is a questionable move because it assumes (1) AI progresses linearly and (2) there exists some meaningful notion of a growth rate that describes what AI needs to do to get to transformative AI from where we are now.</p>\n<p>Questionableness aside, I used <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/\">Metaculus question 3479</a>, \"When will the first AGI be first developed and demonstrated?\" because it's the most-answered Metaculus question about AGI, with (as of 2022-04-14) 1070 predictions across 363 forecasters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-13\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n<p>First I looked at the standard deviation of the inverse of the mean date across forecasters, which came out to 8.6%. But this isn't quite what we want. The point of mission hedging is to buy an asset that covaries with your mission target over time. So I also looked at the Metaculus community prediction (an aggregate best guess across all predictors) across time, and found a standard deviation of 4.1%.</p>\n<p>I also applied AI timeline forecasts to the <a href=\"#Compound_until_AGI_utility_function\">\"compound-until-AGI\"</a> model, which has a more meaningful interpretation. This alternative model takes a log-normally distributed AI timeline and calculates the expected probability of solving the alignment problem by the time transformative AI arrives. For this model, we want to know the standard deviation of the logarithm of estimated AI timelines.</p>\n<p>Metaculus question #3479 gives a mean log-timeline of 3.09 log-years and a standard deviation of 0.99 log-years.</p>\n<p>(The exponential of 0.99 log-years would be 2.69 years, except that we can't meaningfully talk about the standard deviation in terms of years.

(I tried the figures derived from Metaculus and Grace et al. as well as a much wider range of parameter values.)</p>\n<h1>How good is the best hedge?</h1>\n<p>We could hedge AI progress with a basket of AI company stocks. But it's hard to tell how well this will work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The companies that do the most/best AI research are big companies like Google. AI only makes up a small portion of what Google does, and its progress on AI doesn't drive the stock price (at least for now).</li>\n<li>Some small companies exclusively do AI work, but not many, and they haven't existed for long.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(I looked for ETFs and mutual funds that focus on AI stocks. About a dozen such funds exist, but all but one of them are less than four years old. The oldest is <a href=\"https://www.etf.com/ARKQ\">ARKQ</a>, which only launched in 2014, and doesn't quite match what we want anyway.)</p>\n<p>Let's look at how some possible hedges correlate to their targets.</p>\n<h2>Industry index &lt;&gt; industry revenue</h2>\n<p>What's the relationship between AI progress and a basket of AI company stocks?</p>\n<p>Let's ask an easier question: For any industry, what is the relationship between the productivity of that industry and its average stock return?</p>\n<p>This question is only relevant insofar as the AI industry behaves the same as any other industry, and insofar as \"revenue\" is the same thing as \"productivity\". But it gives us a much larger sample (dozens of industries instead of one) and a longer history (~40 years instead of ~7).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669245261/mirroredImages/JD6QvQG3q5p6heKuA/l2in7cowyoqby3anohaq.png\" alt=\"\">\n<em>this but unironically</em></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"#Industry_revenue\">above</a>, we can measure the success of an industry in terms of its revenue. And as above, I calculated the weighted average correlation between industry revenues and returns, and also between market-neutral industry revenues and returns.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Long-Only</th>\n<th>Market-Neutral</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Weighted Mean</td>\n<td>0.21</td>\n<td>0.04</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mean</td>\n<td>0.23</td>\n<td>0.06</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Median</td>\n<td>0.25</td>\n<td>0.06</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Std Dev</td>\n<td>0.23</td>\n<td>0.22</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These correlations are really bad. The weighted mean long-only correlation is actually lower than my most pessimistic estimate in my <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/04/04/model_of_mission-correlated_investing/\">original essay</a>. And the market-neutral correlation, which better captures what we care about, might as well be zero.</p>\n<h2>Semiconductor index &lt;&gt; ML model performance</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard\">Global Industry Classification Standard</a> does not recognize an AI/ML industry. The closest thing is probably semiconductors. For this test, I used the MSCI World Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment Index (SSEI), which has data going back to 2008. I compared it to three benchmarks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>EFF ML benchmark performance, described <a href=\"#ML_benchmark_performance\">above</a>, 2008\u20132021</li>\n<li>ML model size growth, measured as a power function of compute (for reasons explained in <a href=\"#Appendix_B__AI_progress_by_model_size_growth\">Appendix B</a>), 2012\u20132021</li>\n<li>ML model size growth, measured as a power function of the number of parameters, 2012\u20132021</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also compared these to</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the S&amp;P 500</li>\n<li>a long/short portfolio that went long SSEI and short the S&amp;P 500</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Results:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Target</th>\n<th>SSEI</th>\n<th>SP500</th>\n<th>Long/Short</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>EFF ML benchmark performance</td>\n<td>0.17</td>\n<td>0.15</td>\n<td>0.17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ML model compute^0.05</td>\n<td>0.33</td>\n<td>0.20</td>\n<td>0.41</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ML model num. params^0.076</td>\n<td>0.52</td>\n<td>0.50</td>\n<td>0.46</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These numbers suggest that there's no reason to use semiconductor stocks as a hedge because the S&amp;P 500 works about as well.</p>\n<h2>AI company index &lt;&gt; ML model performance</h2>\n<p>There's no good way to test the correlation of ML model performance to an AI index. At best, I could take one of the AI company ETFs that launched in 2018 and correlate it against ML benchmark performance. But I'd only get at most three annual data points, and that would just anchor my beliefs to a highly uncertain number, so I'm not going to do it.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we could construct a hedge portfolio in such a way that we can predict its correlation to the thing we want to hedge, even if we don't have any historical data. I don't know how to do that.</p>\n<h2>Construct a derivative</h2>\n<p>Could we define a new derivative to hedge exactly what we want? For example, we could pay an investment bank to sell us an \"AI progress swap\", that goes up in value when progress accelerates, and goes down when it slows.</p>\n<p>A derivative like this would have a negative return\u2014probably significantly negative, because novel financial instruments tend to be expensive. And unfortunately, a higher correlation can't make up for even a modest negative return. A derivative like this wouldn't work unless we could buy it very cheaply.</p>\n<h2>Can we do better (without a custom derivative)?</h2>\n<p>A naive hedge (such as a semiconductor index) only gets us about 0.2 correlation. Surely a carefully-constructed hedge would have a higher correlation than that. But how much higher? There's no way to directly test that question empirically, and I don't even know what a useful reference class might be. So it's hard to say how high the correlation can go.</p>\n<p>Let's take r=0.5 as an upper bound. That tends to be about the best correlation you can get between two variables in a messy system. I'm inclined to say that's too high\u2014my intuition is that you probably can't get more than a 0.4 correlation, on the basis that more than half the correlation of a hedge comes from obvious things like industry behavior, and the obvious things get you about r=0.2. But I wouldn't be too surprised if r&gt;0.5 turned out to be achievable.</p>\n<p>(In my <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/04/04/model_of_mission-correlated_investing/\">previous post</a> on mission-correlated investing, where I set up the theoretical model, I gave a plausible correlation range of 0.25 to 0.9. Now that I've spent more time looking at empirical data, I think 0.9 was too optimistic, even for an upper-end estimate.)</p>\n<h1>Results</h1>\n<p>If we take my <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/04/01/how_I_estimate_future_investment_returns/\">estimates</a> for the return of a concentrated factor portfolio, mission hedging looks unfavorable even given optimistic volatility and correlation estimates.</p>\n<p>If we invest in the global market portfolio, whether to mission hedge depends on our choices for the key parameter values (AI progress volatility and hedge &lt;&gt; target correlation).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 20% volatility, mission hedging looks unfavorable given a naive hedge (r=0.2), but favorable if we can find a hedge with even a modestly better correlation (r&gt;=0.25).</li>\n<li>At 15% volatility, mission hedging looks favorable if the hedge has r=0.3 or greater.</li>\n<li>At 10% volatility, mission hedging looks favorable only if the hedge has r=0.5 or greater.</li>\n<li>At less than 10% volatility, mission hedging does not look favorable for any plausible correlation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we use the <a href=\"#Compound_until_AGI_utility_function\">compound-until-AGI</a> utility function, mission hedging looks worse than ordinary investing given any reasonable input parameters (although under the most favorable parameters for mission hedging, it only loses by a thin margin).</p>\n<p>That's all assuming our hedge matches the expected return of a broad index. If we expect the hedge to outperform the market, then it's highly likely to look favorable compared to the global market portfolio, and likely unfavorable versus a factor portfolio (see <a href=\"#AI_companies_could_beat_the_market\">\"AI companies could beat the market\"</a> below for specific estimates). At least, that's true given all the other assumptions I made, but my <a href=\"#Appendix_A__Justifications_for_the_big_list_of_considerations\">other assumptions</a> tended to favor mission hedging.</p>\n<p>If you want to play with my model, it's available <a href=\"https://github.com/michaeldickens/public-scripts/blob/master/MissionHedging.hs\">on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why does ordinary investing (probably) look better than mission hedging?</h2>\n<p>In short, leveraged investments look <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2020/12/14/asset_allocation_for_altruists_with_constraints/\">compelling</a>, and they set a high bar that mission hedging struggles to overcome. At the same level of volatility, a leveraged diversified portfolio outperforms a hedge portfolio (in expectation) by a significant margin.</p>\n<p>Most philanthropic investors don't use enough leverage, which means on the margin, adding leverage to your portfolio increases expected utility by a lot. To compare favorably, mission hedging would have to increase expected utility by even more.</p>\n<p>By mission hedging, you're sacrificing expected earnings in exchange for making money in worlds where money matters more. If a leveraged market portfolio has (say) 5 percentage points higher expected return than the hedge portfolio, then the hedge needs to perform 5 percentage points better than average <em>just to break even</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-18\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-18\">[18]</a></sup> So even if you find yourself in one of the worlds you were trying to hedge against (a world with faster-than-expected AI progress), it's likely that a leveraged market portfolio outperforms the hedge asset <em>even in that world</em>.</p>\n<p>Mission hedging doesn't work as well as conventional hedging. Say you're a bread-making company. You have a 10% profit margin, and for the sake of simplicity, your only input cost is wheat. If the price of wheat goes up by 5%, you just lost half your profit. So you really want to hedge against wheat prices (you effectively have 10:1 leverage on wheat prices). But if you're mission hedging and the mission target gets 5% worse, your marginal utility of money doesn't increase by all that much.</p>\n<p>(Plus, wheat futures prices have a perfect correlation to future wheat prices, but no investment has a perfect correlation to AI progress.)</p>\n<p>Mission hedging only makes sense if your dollars become <em>far more valuable</em> in the scenarios you're trying to hedge against, and if the hedge asset earns <em>significant excess returns</em> in those scenarios.</p>\n<h2>Objections to this methodology</h2>\n<p>I can see (at least) two major, possibly-defeating objections to my approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Investing in a basket of AI companies (or some similar hedge asset) accelerates AI capabilities, which is bad.</li>\n<li>Objective metrics like ML benchmark progress tell us little about progress toward AGI.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first argues against mission hedging. The second could argue against or in favor, depending on how you interpret it.</p>\n<h3>Impact investing</h3>\n<p>If you invest in a company, you might cause that company to perform better (and if you divest, you might cause it to perform worse). If true, this argues against mission hedging.</p>\n<p>Paul Christiano wrote an <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2019/05/25/analyzing-divestment/\">analysis</a> suggesting that divesting works somewhat well; Jonathan Harris did an (unpublished) calculation based on <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3440147\">Betermier, Calvet &amp; Jo (2019)</a><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-19\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-19\">[19]</a></sup> and estimated that divesting has a positive but negligible effect. I only weakly understand this area, but it's at least plausible that the direct harm of investing outweighs the benefit of mission hedging.</p>\n<h3>Measurability of AI progress</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vwLxd6hhFvPbvKmBH/yudkowsky-and-christiano-discuss-takeoff-speeds?commentId=mKgEsfShs2xtaWz4K\">Gwern argues</a> that easily-measurable AI progress benchmarks tell us approximately nothing useful about how close we are to AGI.</p>\n<p>This criticism applies to my approach of estimating AI progress volatility using <a href=\"#ML_benchmark_performance\">ML benchmark performance</a>. The way I measure AI progress doesn't necessarily relate to the sort of progress we want to hedge, and the way I convert ML benchmark performance into marginal utility of money is kind of arbitrary and only weakly justified.</p>\n<p>If true, this doesn't automatically defeat mission hedging. What it does mean is that our proxies for the volatility of AI progress don't tell us anything about true volatility, and we have no way to estimate true volatility (if there even is such a thing).</p>\n<p>If we can't reliably measure AI progress, that makes mission hedging seem intuitively less appealing (although I don't quite know how to explain why). Even so, the <em>concept</em> of mission hedging\u2014make more money in worlds where AI progress moves faster than expected\u2014seems sound. And Gwern's criticism does not apply to using <a href=\"#AI_timeline_forecasts\">AI timeline forecasts</a> to project AI progress.</p>\n<p>And we don't actually need our progress benchmarks to be all that similar to \"actual\" AI progress. We just need the two to correlate. What we need is a strong correlation of <code>hedge asset &lt;&gt; actual AI progress</code>. Even if the <code>benchmark of AI progress &lt;&gt; actual AI progress</code> correlation is weak, I don't see why that would weaken the <code>hedge asset &lt;&gt; actual AI progress</code> correlation in expectation. (On the contrary, it seems intuitive to me that AI company stock prices should correlate more strongly with actual progress than with benchmarks.)</p>\n<h2>What's the strongest case in favor of mission hedging?</h2>\n<p>Most of the time when a non-key input variable had wiggle room, I chose a value that favored mission hedging (as detailed in <a href=\"#Appendix_A__Justifications_for_the_big_list_of_considerations\">Appendix A</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-20\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-20\">[20]</a></sup> Mission hedging still looked worse than investing in the mean-variance optimal portfolio under most key parameter values. Is there any room left to argue that we should mission hedge AI?</p>\n<p>Yes, there's room. Below are four arguments in favor of higher investment in AI stocks.</p>\n<h3>Illegible assumptions could bias the model against mission hedging</h3>\n<p>You could argue that my model's assumptions implicitly favor ordinary investing. Most obviously, you could probably come up with a utility function that makes mission hedging look much better. I don't currently know of any such function, but that seems like a key way that the model could be (very) wrong.</p>\n<h3>The volatility of AI progress could increase</h3>\n<p>Before transformative AI arrives, we might reach a point where AI progress unexpectedly accelerates. If we hold a hedge position, we can earn potentially massive returns at this point, and then convert those returns into AI alignment work. However:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This only works if transformative AI follows a slow takeoff. (<a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/\">Paul Christiano</a> believes it (probably) will; <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vwLxd6hhFvPbvKmBH/yudkowsky-and-christiano-discuss-takeoff-speeds\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> believes it (probably) will not.

Only the forecast method could capture future changes in volatility. So it's plausible that volatility will spike in the future, and my analysis missed this because it was mostly backward-looking. (On the other hand, the forecast method provided the lowest estimated standard deviation.)</p>\n<h3>Investors could be leverage-constrained</h3>\n<p>I assumed that investors are volatility-constrained but not leverage-constrained\u2014I explain why in <a href=\"#Target_volatility__30_\">Appendix A</a>. However, it's at least <em>plausible</em> that many investors face meaningful leverage constraints. If so, then we care about maximizing the absolute return of our investments, rather than the risk-adjusted return. (An investor who can use leverage wants to pick the investment with the highest risk-adjusted return and then lever it up, which will always produce an equal or better absolute return than investing in the highest-absolute-return asset with no leverage.)</p>\n<p>Investors with strict leverage constraints should probably mission hedge on the margin. As I mentioned <a href=\"#Why_does_ordinary_investing__probably__look_better_than_mission_hedging_\">above</a>, the big advantage of the MVO asset over the hedge asset is that it earns a far better return once it's levered up. If you don't use leverage, the MVO asset doesn't earn a much higher return<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-22\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-22\">[22]</a></sup>\u2014it does have much less risk, but that's not as important for altruistic investors.</p>\n<h3>AI companies could beat the market</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the strongest case for <em>investing</em> in AI companies has nothing to do with <em>mission hedging</em>. Namely, if you believe the market underestimates how quickly AI systems will improve, then you might invest in AI stocks so you can beat the market. I don't have a strong opinion on whether this is a good idea, but it's not mission hedging\u2014it's just traditional profit-seeking investing.</p>\n<p>Some specific numbers:</p>\n<p>If we invest in the global market portfolio and assume mission target volatility = 10%, r = 0.2 (which is relatively unfavorable for mission hedging), then the hedge asset only has to beat the stock market by 1 percentage point to look better than the MVO asset.</p>\n<p>If we invest in a factor portfolio with the same unfavorable assumptions for mission hedging, the hedge has to beat the stock market by 10 (!) percentage points.</p>\n<p>If we invest in a factor portfolio with <em>favorable</em> assumptions for mission hedging, the hedge has to beat the market by 3 percentage points.</p>\n<p>If we set mission target volatility at 5%, there\u2019s pretty much no way for the hedge asset to look favorable.</p>\n<p>In summary, if we expect AI companies to beat the market, then we may or may not prefer to invest in AI stocks on the margin, and it could easily go either way depending on what assumptions we make.</p>\n<h2>Credences</h2>\n<p>In this section, I offer my subjective probabilities on the most relevant questions.</p>\n<p>All things considered, AI safety donors should not mission hedge on the margin: 70%</p>\n<p>All things considered, AI safety donors should not overweight AI stocks on the margin: 60%<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-23\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-23\">[23]</a></sup></p>\n<p>On the condition that I've thought of all the important considerations, AI safety donors should not mission hedge on the margin: 75%</p>\n<p>I have missed some critically-important consideration: 20%</p>\n<p>...and that consideration makes mission hedging look better: 10%</p>\n<p>A utility function with linear marginal utility of AI progress overestimates the marginal value of mission hedging: 75%</p>\n<p>The true volatility of AI progress, inasmuch as that's a well-defined concept, is at most 20%: 75%</p>\n<p>The maximum achievable correlation for a hedge asset with non-negative alpha<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-24\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-24\">[24]</a></sup> is at most 0.5: 85%</p>\n<p>On balance, the non-key parameters' given values make mission hedging look better than their true values would: 90%<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-25\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-25\">[25]</a></sup></p>\n<p>On balance, the non-key parameters' given values make investing in AI stocks look better than their true values would: 60%</p>\n<h2>Future work</h2>\n<p><strong>1.

Does investing in AI companies accelerate AI progress?</strong></p>\n<p>If yes, that could be a compelling reason not to mission hedge, although this would only strengthen my conclusion because I already found that mission hedging doesn't look worthwhile.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Deeper investigation on empirical values.</strong></p>\n<p>I got all my data on ML benchmark performance from EFF's <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics\">AI Progress Measurement</a>.

(<a href=\"https://github.com/paperswithcode/sota-extractor\">This GitHub project</a> scrapes AI progress data from several sources.)</p>\n<p>My forecast data used only a few questions from Metaculus plus a single survey. I picked those because they seemed like the best sources, but a thorough analysis could incorporate more forecasts. Maybe combine forecasts from multiple surveys, such as the ones <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/some-survey-results/\">collected by AI Impacts</a>. (Although I don't think a broader set of forecasts would change the ultimate outcome much.)</p>\n<p>Alternatively, we could project the volatility of AI progress using Ajeya Cotra's biological anchors report (see <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/15ArhEPZSTYU8f012bs6ehPS6-xmhtBPP\">Google Drive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/forecasting-transformative-ai-the-biological-anchors-method-in-a-nutshell/\">Holden's summary</a>).

If most legacy investments are US companies, we can use the US stock market as a baseline. The dividend discount model predicts the US market to earn a 7% nominal return. I would predict a lower return than this because US stocks are so expensive right now, but changing this number doesn't change the relative appeal of ordinary investing vs. mission hedging (unless you make it much higher).</p>\n<h3>Arithmetic return of the hedge asset: 7%</h3>\n<p>As with the legacy asset, we should (generally speaking) expect the hedge asset to earn the same return as its index.</p>\n<p>That said, if you're concerned about AI safety, you might also believe that the market underestimates the future rate of AI progress.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-31\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-31\">[31]</a></sup> If you <em>also</em> expect a <a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/yudkowsky-contra-christiano-on-ai\">slow takeoff</a>, and you expect that AI companies will earn large profits during this takeoff, then you probably expect AI stocks to beat the market.</p>\n<p>If you overweight AI stocks because you expect them to beat the market, that's not mission hedging, it's just ordinary profit-seeking investing.

But which assets to include depends on exactly which other donors you care about. This doesn't matter too much because the volatility of the legacy asset does not meaningfully affect the tradeoff between the MVO asset and the hedge asset.</p>\n<h3>Volatility of the hedge asset: 25%</h3>\n<p>Empirically, smallish baskets of randomly-chosen stocks are a bit less volatile than this (~20%, see Fact 2 <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2021/10/29/obvious_investing_facts/\">here</a>), but if the stocks are chosen to be correlated to a particular target, the basket will be more volatile because it's less diversified. 25% is consistent with the standard deviations of returns for individual industries. Market-neutral industry baskets (i.e., buy the industry and short the market) have standard deviations around 20%.</p>\n<h3>Correlation of MVO asset &lt;&gt; legacy asset: 0.6 (GMP) or 0.5 (FP)</h3>\n<p>We can roughly assume that future correlations will resemble historical correlations. It's easy to get historical data on a basic stock/bond portfolio or on a factor portfolio. It's a little harder to find the correlation with the legacy asset because we don't exactly know what the legacy asset is, and even if we did, it probably doesn't have more than a decade or two of performance history.</p>\n<p>As an approximation, I took the 30 industry portfolios from the <a href=\"https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html\">Ken French Data Library</a>, on the assumption that the correlation between the average industry and an investment strategy is <em>roughly</em> the same as the correlation between the legacy asset and that same investment strategy.</p>\n<p>I also used industry portfolios as proxies for the hedge asset, because a hedge would consist of a collection of related stocks in the same way that an industry is a collection of related stocks.</p>\n<p>For this test, I simulated the global market portfolio with global stocks + bonds. I simulated a factor portfolio using <a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2021/02/08/concentrated_stock_selection/\">concentrated</a> long-only value and momentum factor portfolios plus a smaller short market position plus actual net historical performance of the <a href=\"http://www.chesapeakecapital.com/performance/\">Chesapeake managed futures strategy</a> (which I used because it provides a longer track record than any other real-world managed futures fund that I'm aware of).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-33\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-33\">[33]</a></sup> This loosely resembles how I invest my own money. Alternatively, I could have constructed a factor portfolio that combines multiple long/short factors plus market beta, which would more closely resemble academic factor definitions. That would probably scale better for extremely wealthy investors, and would give lower correlations but with higher expenses/transaction costs. <a href=\"https://www.aqr.com/Strategies\">AQR</a> is one firm that offers diversified factor strategies that are designed to scale well for large investors.</p>\n<p>(If we just used the historical returns of factor strategies to estimate future performance, we'd probably tend to overestimate future returns; but for right now we care about correlation, not return, so that doesn't really matter.)</p>\n<p>I calculated the correlations between the simulated MVO asset and each individual industry. Then I looked at the mean, median, and market-cap-weighted mean of the correlations, rounded to the nearest tenth. The mean, median, and weighted mean were all close enough together that they round to the same number. Using the global market portfolio (GMP) as the MVO asset produced an average correlation of 0.6, and using the factor portfolio (FP) gave an average of 0.5.</p>\n<h3>Correlation of MVO asset &lt;&gt; hedge asset: 0.6 (GMP) or 0.5 (FP)</h3>\n<p>See previous section.</p>\n<h3>Correlation of legacy asset &lt;&gt; hedge asset: 0.7</h3>\n<p>The total stock market has an average correlation of a little under 0.7 to any individual industry. The correlation between the legacy asset and the hedge asset is probably about the same\u2014maybe a bit higher, since EAs tend to overweight tech/AI stocks.</p>\n<h3>Correlation of MVO asset &lt;&gt; AI progress: 0.0 (GMP) or \u20130.1 (FP)</h3>\n<p>As show <a href=\"#Semiconductor_index____ML_model_performance\">above</a>, I looked at the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and ML benchmark performance, and found a correlation of about 0.2 (depending on what benchmark I use). The global market portfolio has a somewhat lower correlation, at 0.0 (it's slightly positive but it rounds off to 0). A factor portfolio has a correlation of roughly \u20130.1. (Remember that a higher correlation with AI progress is better.)</p>\n<p>Caveat: These correlations are unstable. I got these coefficients using the largest date range available (2008\u20132021), but if I change the date range, I can get substantially different numbers. (For example, if we look at 2012\u20132021 instead, the S&amp;P 500 now has a negative correlation to AI progress.) So consider these estimates not particularly reliable. But they should be at least directionally correct\u2014a hedge has a higher correlation than the global market portfolio, which has a higher correlation than a factor portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Correlation of legacy asset &lt;&gt; AI progress: 0.2</h3>\n<p>The legacy asset has a slightly higher correlation to AI progress than the S&amp;P 500 does because the legacy asset is tilted toward AI or AI-adjacent stocks. I don't have the data necessary to empirically estimate the correlation, but I would guess that it's about 0.2. (And, as I said in the previous section, and empirical estimate wouldn't be very reliable anyway.)</p>\n<h3>Impact investing factor: ignored</h3>\n<p>Discussed <a href=\"#Impact_investing\">above</a>.</p>\n<p>In this essay, I simply assume that investing in a company's stock has no direct effect on the company. That said, a philanthropist who's leaning toward mission hedging should first carefully consider the effect of impact investing.</p>\n<h3>Target volatility: 30%</h3>\n<p>Before we ask what the volatility target should be, first we should ask: do we even want a volatility target?</p>\n<p>Many investors behave as if they're leverage-constrained but not volatility-constrained\u2014they invest in extremely risky assets such as cryptocurrencies or individual stocks, but not in (relatively) stable leveraged investments such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_parity\">risk parity</a>.</p>\n<p>It's true that <em>some</em> investors can't use leverage; and some investors can use up to 2:1 leverage with <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationt.asp\">Reg T margin</a>, but not more than that (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio-margin.asp\">portfolio margin</a> allows greater than 2:1 leverage). However:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wealthier investors can get access to portfolio margin fairly easily, and these investors represent the majority of EA wealth.</li>\n<li>Investors who cannot use leverage themselves (or only limited leverage) can still invest in <em>funds</em> that use leverage internally.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So we should not treat leverage as a constraint. That said, if we <em>are</em> leverage-constrained, that means we should invest in assets with particularly high volatility (as long as we're compensated for that volatility with extra expected return). This argues in favor of mission hedging because a focused hedge portfolio will have higher volatility than the market. Given a leverage constraint, mission hedging looks better than ordinary investing given most reasonable parameter values.</p>\n<p>Okay, given that we want a volatility target, what number should we shoot for?</p>\n<p>I somewhat-arbitrarily chose a 30% standard deviation as the target. It's a nice round number, and it's roughly twice the standard deviation of the global stock market. And you can't go too much higher than 30% without running a serious risk of going bust.</p>\n<p>Historically, if you had invested in a well-diversified portfolio at 30% target volatility, you would have experienced at worst an ~85% drawdown during the Great Depression and a ~70% drawdown in the 2008 recession.</p>\n<p>Below, I present a table of historical max drawdowns for a variety of assets and strategies, levered up to 30% volatility.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-34\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-34\">[34]</a></sup></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Asset

If we invest in the global market portfolio, mission hedging beats ordinary investing if we can get a moderate correlation between AI progress and the hedge asset (r=0.4 or greater). If we invest in a factor portfolio, we need a correlation of at least r=0.7. (Under the compound-until-AGI utility function, the hedge asset looks much worse than the MVO asset regardless of the correlation.)</p>\n<p>A power law of parameters^0.35 gives a growth rate consistent with the observed performance growth across models in EFF's ML benchmarks data set (34% and 32%, respectively). But it gives a much higher standard deviation of 51% compared to EFF's 16%. I tend to believe that the high volatility in the Sevilla et al. data comes from a small sample size plus variation in ML model quality, so it does not reflect \"true\" volatility. (If we're using model size as a proxy for performance, and a direct measure of performance disagrees, I trust the direct measure more.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-40\" id=\"fnref-tKczhqbBkk4BPH6nN-40\">[40]</a></sup>)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one could argue that ML model size predicts \"true\" AI progress, not just performance on certain benchmarks.</p>\n<h2>Appendix C: Optimal equilibrium allocation to mission hedging</h2>\n<p>So far, I've focused on the marginal utility of changing portfolio allocations. We might also want to know the optimal allocation in equilibrium\u2014the allocation we'd want if we could reallocate the entire EA portfolio at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mdickens.me/2022/04/04/model_of_mission-correlated_investing/\">Previously</a>, I wrote about mission hedging allocation under a simple utility function where marginal utility of wealth is linear with the mission target.

It takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.</p><h1>Content Overview</h1><p><i>If you prefer an overview of the contentinstead of the interactive module, read on. Since the content was built around interactive questions, some of which are excluded in this overview, some sections and transitions below may be clunky.</i></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Emotions make us human. They grant us the capacity to love, to suffer, and to live all the complexities in between. They are so often what drives our desire to help others\u2013 to want others to suffer less and flourish more. And when it comes to helping others, we count on emotions as our trusted guides for who to help, how much, and when.</p><p>Perhaps too much.</p><p><strong>Emotions can also get in the way of </strong><i><strong>really</strong></i><strong> helping others.</strong></p><p>That\u2019s the claim this module makes. We'll look through a series of well-studied, emotionally-grounded cognitive biases that systematically prevent our actions from having the positive impact that they could. By the end of the module, you'll have learned how to identify these biases \u2013 and how to overcome them.</p><p>However, <strong>the goal of this module is not to demonize emotions</strong>.</p><p>Emotions can be incredibly useful, and they are essential for figuring out what you care about. The module aims to add nuance to your understanding of emotions \u2013 to acknowledge that while emotions may be fundamental in driving our wish to help others in the first place, they can sometimes get in the way of actualizing that wish.</p><h2>Feeling Good vs. Doing Good</h2><p>Imagine you can donate $10,000 to one of two charities: Charity A or B.</p><ul><li><strong>Charity A:</strong> You feel very emotionally connected to Charity A, so you feel great when you donate money there. With that money, Charity A is able to save 1 person's life.</li><li><strong>Charity B:</strong> You don\u2019t have a strong personal connection to Charity B. Donating there makes you feel OK. But Charity B uses your money extremely effectively on evidence-based interventions, and with that money it's able to save 2 people's lives.</li></ul><p>Would you rather donate to Charity A or Charity B?</p><p>Frankly, we think that if you care about helping others, the focus should be less on how you feel and more on what you do.</p><p>And if we want to do more to help others, we have to pay attention to the differences in impact across our actions, even if the choices <i>feel</i> similar.</p><p>Consider the difference between donating to a typically cost-effective charity versus an<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org\"> <u>extraordinarily cost-effective charity</u></a>. Research shows donations to the most cost-effective charities may help their recipients 20\u2013100x more than donations to a typical charity.</p><p><strong>That's a huge difference.</strong> That means that the same donation that saves 1 life at a typical charity could save somewhere between 20 and 100 hundred lives at a top charity.</p><p><i>But can our feelings can't track such enormous differences in effectiveness?</i></p><p>Not really. How good you instinctively <i>feel</i> after helping others isn\u2019t always coupled to how much good you\u2019re <i>doing</i>.</p><ul><li>It is possible to feel great without helping much, and to feel unsatisfied despite helping a lot.</li><li>Our emotional \u201cfeel-good\u201d response when we help others simply didn\u2019t evolve to track how much we\u2019re actually helping. (Though thankfully, there are some techniques to align how good we feel and how much good we do, which we\u2019ll get to at the end of the module).</li></ul><h2>Our emotions haven\u2019t caught up with our moral progress</h2><p>Emotions like empathy evolved to help our early nomadic ancestors pass on their genes. They facilitated the (in many cases) tribal actions that kept our ancestors alive and reproducing.</p><p>But life has changed a lot since the days of nomadic foraging bands.</p><p><strong>And so have our morals.</strong></p><ul><li>We\u2019ve recognized that everyone\u2019s life has value\u2013 that our moral concern shouldn\u2019t depend on nationality, race, ethnicity, gender, or geographic boundaries.</li><li>Caring about everyone equally wasn\u2019t always the case. For example, abandoning and shunning disabled people used to be normal in many cultures. Similarly, Romans used to view non-Romans \"barbarians\" as animals only fit to fight one another for their entertainment.</li></ul><p><strong>While our morals progressed, however, our brain's hardwiring \u2013 and the instinctive emotional responses ingrained in it \u2013 have remained quite stable.</strong> We have largely the same emotional hardwiring as our ancestors who often reserved compassion exclusively for people in the same ethnicity, tribe or family.</p><p>Our modern moral norms and upbringing has instilled in us a more inclusive compassion, and for many this becomes internalized at an emotional level. But still, many of our emotional tugs still don\u2019t fully track the modern moral beliefs many of us endorse.</p><p>The next sections will explore four scenarios in which emotions can get in the way of doing good more effectively.</p><h2>Obstacle #1: Psychic Numbing</h2><p>Imagine two buildings have tragically burned down in a city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One of the buildings was a one-bedroom house, in which 1 person lost their life. The other was a giant apartment complex, in which 100 people lost their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;How many times worse was the apartment complex fire than the house fire?</p><p>Both fires are a tragedy in this example, but if we agree that all lives are equal, the fire that kills 100 people is 100x worse than the fire that kills 1 person.</p><p>Unfortunately, our behavior often doesn't track such differences in outcomes; by default, we are<a href=\"https://conceptually.org/concepts/scope-insensitivity\"> <u>'scope-insensitive'</u></a>.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668134854/mirroredImages/te2Hi4b2xZuNCXuFh/rvaxzkkv5fcet0dism0x.png\"></figure><p>As the number of people in need increases, we tend to stop caring as much for each additional person. This is a bias in our thinking known as<a href=\"https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/psychic-numbing\"> <strong><u>Psychic Numbing</u></strong></a><strong> \u2013 a tendency to feel less emotionally compelled to help in the face of large numbers of people in need.</strong></p><ul><li>Because of the way our brains work, we have a much easier time emotionally latching on to a single (or small number of) identifiable victim(s) whose suffering we can empathize with. For example, we can be more gripped by a vivid story about a single girl suffering from a famine than an entire country; It's hard for us to empathize with multiple people.</li><li>Prof. Paul Slovic, the leading researcher on this phenomenon, made the<a href=\"https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/psychic-numbing\"> <u>graph</u></a> above to depict the surprising disconnect between how we <i>want</i> to behave (as if every life has equal value) and how we often <i>do</i> behave (as if some lives are worth more than others):</li></ul><h3>Societal biases</h3><p>There\u2019s an important point to be made about Psychic Numbing that generalizes to other types of biases we\u2019ll get to: <strong>individual biases propagate into societal blindspots.</strong></p><p>A poignant example is the Syrian refugee crisis. In 2015, a gripping picture of Aylan Kurdi, a refugee child, lying dead on a Turkish beach went viral. Prior to this image, the crisis had received little attention in Western media<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpf997pjpdl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpf997pjpdl\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>Donations poured in after the image went viral, but nearly <i>two hundred fifty-thousand (250,000)</i> refugees had died before Aylan Kurdi, and they were given no such sympathy or coverage.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668134853/mirroredImages/te2Hi4b2xZuNCXuFh/xslgxfsaipdejkp3gsyv.png\"></figure><ul><li>This<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/4/640\"> <u>example</u></a> demonstrates how numbed we can be to large collections of individual suffering, each of which denotes tragedies similar to Aylan Kurdi.</li><li>If enough people possess a psychological bias, it becomes a societal bias that snowballs to have broad ramifications in how governments and other powerful actors allocate resources.</li></ul><p>So what can we do to prevent the phenomenon of Psychic Numbing?</p><h3>How to overcome Psychic Numbing</h3><ul><li><strong>Step 1: Recognize the bias</strong>: Recognize when you or people around you encounter magnitudes of suffering (for example, a famine that affects an entire region) that will be difficult to intuitively, emotionally grasp. (This can happen as soon as more than one person is involved!)</li><li><strong>Step 2: Think in Individual Units</strong>: To motivate action in the face of large catastrophes that you may struggle to emotionally comprehend, bring to mind a single identifiable victim. For example, seek out a news story on one victim. Notice how much that one tragedy can afflict you. How much would you do to prevent that tragedy? Then extrapolate how much you would do to prevent many, many similar tragedies \u2013 each of which on its own could inspire that same urge to help.<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254270658_Unit_Asking_A_Method_to_Boost_Donations_and_Beyond\"> <u>Research</u></a> shows that such an exercise can help you act in a way that better appreciates the scope of a problem, but be sure to step away if it becomes distressing.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Obstacle #2: Pseudoinefficacy</h2><p>Suppose you are interested in helping a group of 1,000 people suffering from malaria. You then learn of a place that has an additional population of 100,000 people who are also suffering from malaria.</p><p><i>Should</i> finding out that there are more people suffering from malaria than you thought have any impact on your motivation to help the original people suffering from malaria?</p><p>We don't think so, unless it makes you more inclined to help since any solution you identify could help more people.</p><p>But research on real-world helping behavior has shown that <strong>we are typically less inclined to help one person after being made aware of the larger number of people in need that we are not helping.</strong> This distressing effect is known as<a href=\"https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/Pseudoinefficacy\"> <u>Pseudoinefficacy</u></a></p><ul><li>In one<a> <u>study</u></a>, researchers compared people\u2019s donations after seeing a picture and description of a single starving young girl to people\u2019s donations after seeing the same picture and description along with statistical information about the millions of others at risk of starvation. People who also saw the statistical information donated <i>less</i> than people who saw just the young girl.</li></ul><p>Here\u2019s the explanation behind this phenomenon: Learning about all the people you cannot help can make people feel discouraged \u2013 like what you\u2019re able to contribute is only a single drop in a big bucket.</p><p>But, if you care about improving the world, this reaction is only going to prevent you from achieving your goal. There will ALWAYS be people you cannot help, and <strong>even partial solutions save whole lives.</strong></p><h3>Advice against feeling hopeless about big problems</h3><blockquote><p>Mother Teresa recognized \"Pseudoinefficacy\" years before researchers put a big name on it: <i>\u201cIf I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one, I will\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>To stop feeling hopeless about big problems, we can either address the Pseudoinefficacy bias head on (Strategy 1) or try to avoid invoking it in the first place (Strategies 2 &amp; 3).</p><ul><li><strong>Strategy 1: Recognize the Bias:</strong> Recognize how you may feel discouraged when you think your actions are only a \"drop in the bucket.\" But understand that it's the size of the drop that matters, not the size of the bucket.</li><li><strong>Strategy 2: Focus on Collective Action:</strong> If you don\u2019t feel that your action will make a substantial difference, focus on what lots of people\u2019s actions combined could do. (See<a href=\"https://www.arithmeticofcompassion.org/blog/2019/5/29/overcoming-Pseudoinefficacy-with-the-collective-aggregation-effect\"> <u>Research</u></a>). Remember that, while you are just one person, you can work together with others to cause genuine change. Additionally, your actions can motivate other individuals to chip in.</li><li><strong>Strategy 3: Set Sub-Goals:</strong> To avoid provoking a reaction of Pseudoinefficacy, it can be<a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/step-step-sub-goals-source-motivation\"> <u>useful</u></a> to set smaller sub-goals to motivate helping behavior. These smaller goals will be easier to achieve and will help you cultivate a sense of accomplishment, even if the problem you\u2019re helping with is vast. For example, set a goal for yourself to<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\"> <u>protect five kids from malaria</u></a> or<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/sci-foundation\"> <u>provide cheap parasitic-worm preventing drugs for 100 kids</u></a>.</li></ul><h2><br>Obstacle #3: A Narrow Moral Circle</h2><p>Consider three questions to probe your ethical beliefs:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Imagine someone is suffering and you can do something to prevent it. Does the 'badness' of that suffering depend on how geographically close or far away that person is from you?</li><li>Imagine someone is suffering and you can do something to prevent it. Does the badness of that suffering depend on whether the person is alive today or if they will be alive in 100 years? (Imagine we know for sure they will be alive.)</li><li>Does the suffering of non-human animals also matter?<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>These questions identify who you currently include in your <i>moral circle</i>. The moral circle refers to the beings we think are worthy of moral concern. You are at the center of the circle, surrounded by family and other people most like you.</p><ul><li>As you move further out, more differences arise between you and other beings. These include differences in skin color, in ethnicity, in nationality, in distance from you, in species, and in time period alive.</li><li>Our early ancestors evolved to have very narrow moral circles, but most peoples' moral circles gradually expanded over time. (For example, peoples' moral circles expanded to include slaves and people from different nations).</li></ul><p>Based on your answers, your moral circle includes [interactive module displays answers to questions above].</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668134853/mirroredImages/te2Hi4b2xZuNCXuFh/vymfaipl2gsttnnhetuu.jpg\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7156113_Social_Discounting\"><u>Research</u></a> shows that it is easier to feel a strong emotional attachment to people close to us in the moral circle. <strong>As we layer on more differences and more distance (in space and time), the strength of our emotional attachment can fade or altogether disappear.</strong> For example, most people feel a much stronger attachment to people in their community than unfamiliar people far away.</p><p>This can lead to two problems:</p><ol><li>Since our emotional attachments <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272147122_How_Donors_Choose_Charities_The_Role_of_Personal_Taste_and_Experiences_in_Giving_Decisions\">influence</a> who we help and how much we help, <strong>we're biased to help beings very similar to us even if there may be better ways to help others further out on our moral circle.</strong></li><li>A lack of any instinctive emotional attachment to others unlike us can also <strong>shrink our moral circle to exclude beings we might, upon reflection, wish to include</strong>.</li></ol><h3>Advice to expand your moral circle</h3><ul><li><strong>Step 1: Investigate beliefs</strong>: Consider deliberately reflecting on what beings you choose to include in your moral circle. If your moral judgments just rely on instinct and societal norms, it\u2019s possible that you may act in ways that don't actually reflect your own values. You might be able to expand your moral circle by questioning why you feature some beings in your moral circle and exclude others. [The interactive module includes a drop-down with links].</li><li><strong>Step 2: Recognize emotions influence on helping behavior</strong>: Recognize how the attachment we <i>feel</i> to some groups over others can make us more inclined to only help groups like us, even if we believe other groups unlike us also deserve moral concern.</li><li><strong>Step 3: Cultivate (Radical) Compassion</strong>:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21840289/\"> <u>Research</u></a> suggests it may be feasible to learn to increase your compassion. If there\u2019s a disconnect between your emotional attachments and your moral beliefs, practices like<a href=\"https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/loving_kindness_meditation\"> <u>\"loving-kindness\" meditation</u></a> appear to be a promising way to resolve this disconnect. (And they may provide a host of other benefits, like improving well-being).<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/radical-empathy\"> <u>\u201cRadical\u201d compassion</u></a> can also be cultivated at a more intellectual level.</li></ul><h2><br>Obstacle #4: Prioritization Aversion</h2><p>During the peak of COVID-19, some hospitals were faced with a dreaded dilemma: There were more intensive care patients that needed ventilators than ventilators available.</p><p>Tragically, not all patients could be saved. As a result, some hospitals implemented a system of<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/10/06/the-crisis-around-crisis-standards-of-care/\"> <u>triage</u></a> \u2013 classifying patients according to their estimated chance of survival, and prioritizing those whose lives can be saved through quick action.</p><p>Some patients weren't helped with this prioritization system, but by using their limited resources where they were most needed, these hospitals saved more patients than they otherwise could have.</p><p>In the case of over-capacity COVID-19 hospitalizations, do you think implementing a system of triage makes sense?</p><p>Keeping the tragedy of COVID-19 triage in mind: Suppose that you want to help people using your money (through donating to charity) or your time (through volunteering or working for a charity).<br><br>There are many different charities you can choose from, and many different ways to help \u2013 some of which help people much more than others.</p><p><strong>When you have a desire to help but can't help everyone, are you not in a similar position as hospitals who have to choose which tragedies to focus their resources and attention on?</strong></p><h3>Constant tradeoffs</h3><p>We are always making tradeoffs. In the context of helping people, spending time and resources helping <i>some people</i> implicitly means not spending the same time and resources helping <i>other people.</i></p><p>We normally don't think about the people who we are not helping. For example, when we donate to a local charity, we don't think about the children around the world living on $2 a day that we are <i>not</i> helping.</p><p>When we begin making more deliberate prioritizations between different ways of helping, it makes the people we are not helping very obvious, which can feel really unfair and uncomfortable. Researchers have identified this phenomenon as<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613%2821%2900090-5#secst0020\"> <u>Prioritization Aversion</u></a>.</p><p><strong>But by overcoming prioritization aversion and focusing our efforts on the best ways of helping, we affirm that helping more people is simply better than helping fewer people</strong> \u2013 that alleviating more suffering is better than alleviating less suffering, regardless of who is suffering.</p><ul><li>For example, if we expect that a charity focused on curing cancer can save one life with our donation, but that a charity focused on improving the quality of drinking water can save ten people with the same donation, prioritizing the water quality charity means prioritizing the lives of ten people instead of the life of one person.</li></ul><p>Hopefully, in the future, we will be able to avoid every tragedy. But in our lifetime, we can save the most people if we focus on the worst tragedies.</p><h2>Acting on your Beliefs</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668134853/mirroredImages/te2Hi4b2xZuNCXuFh/c7tyiat1vtfuawoxrgxg.png\"></figure><p>A fitting metaphor to summarize this module is that, <strong>when it comes to doing good, emotions are the gas pedal, but careful reasoning is a better steering wheel.</strong></p><p>Even just recognizing the existence of the biases cataloged in this module empowers us to make more deliberate decisions about how we help others.</p><p>Two examples of where you might use what you've learned:</p><ul><li>Your friend tells you about a big catastrophe far away and you recognize that it will be harder to feel a corresponding emotional attachment because of the number of people, the size of the problem, and the victims\u2019 distance from you</li><li>Before choosing which charity to donate to, you recognize that choosing to prioritize one charity over another may feel wrong, even if prioritizing allows you to help more people.</li></ul><h2>Reconciling doing good and feeling good</h2><p>Earlier, we discussed how feeling good doesn\u2019t always track how much good you actually do. Thankfully, there are techniques that can reduce the disconnect:</p><ul><li><strong>Strategy 1: Reflection</strong>: After helping others, take time to reflect on the good you have done. If you have to overcome some of these emotional challenges to help more people, recognize the virtue in what you\u2019re doing, even if it can be difficult.<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-12418-001\"> <u>Research</u></a> has shown that acting altruistically can improve your well-being!</li><li><strong>Strategy 2: Channel Positive Emotions</strong>: Channel the joy and satisfaction you would get from a more emotional instance of helping. For example, it is estimated that you can save the equivalent of a child\u2019s life by donating $3000-$4000 to<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org\"> <u>highly effective charities</u></a>. Imagine how good you would feel if you ran into a burning building and saved a child\u2019s life! If you do something awesomely altruistic that might not feel immediately great, try to visualize a more emotionally compelling example to help you access the good feeling.</li><li><strong>Strategy 3: Purpose &amp; Meaning</strong>: Focusing on helping others as much as you can in your life can provide a really strong sense of purpose and meaning. This sense of purpose can be coupled to doing good thoughtfully, not just what feels emotionally pleasing. Over time, doing good thoughtfully can become more and more emotionally appealing because it helps you achieve your goals!</li><li><strong>Strategy 4: Supportive Community</strong>: Try to surround yourself with supportive people who also recognize these challenges and are doing their best to help others. Check out<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/community\"> <u>Effective Altruism community groups</u></a> near you, for example.</li><li><strong>Strategy 5: A tool to donate emotionally AND effectively</strong>: Researchers at Harvard recently created<a href=\"https://givingmultiplier.org\"> <u>GivingMultiplier</u></a>, an online tool that lets you split and multiply your donations. With the balance between instinctive emotion and effectiveness in mind, it allows you to give to both your favorite charity and a super-effective charity recommended by experts. And it multiplies your donations!</li></ul><h2>On Being Human</h2><p>We\u2019ve talked in detail about biases that require us to be skeptical of our emotions. But this can be hard. We\u2019re humans, and emotions are a big part of being human and wanting to help others. It would be impossible (and undesirable!) to disentangle emotions from all our decisions.</p><p>Being too dismissive or closed off towards your emotions could actually<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597806000057\"> <u>backfire</u></a> and reduce your urge to help in the first place.</p><p>You can also learn a lot from your emotions, especially when it comes to understanding your own personal values.</p><p>So <strong>strive for</strong><a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-300270-8\"><strong> <u>better, not perfect</u></strong></a>:</p><ul><li>Don\u2019t neglect compassion for yourself when being compassionate towards others.</li><li>Different people may need to balance the role of emotions in their altruistic actions differently, and that's fine.</li></ul><h2>Go forth and do good</h2><p>If your goal is to help a lot, hopefully you're now better prepared to recognize and overcome obstacles in your way<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you\u2019re excited by the project of helping others as much as you can:</strong></p><ul><li>Check out the<a href=\"https://programs.clearerthinking.org/how_to_do_more_good.html\"> <u>Leaving Your Mark on the World: The Essential Tool</u></a>.

The case of <em>The Precipice</em>, as a non-fiction book, also falls under \"literary translation\", albeit not under \"translation of fiction\". The distinction I often make here is between \"literary translation\" and \"translation of other texts\", such as articles, documents, leaflets, web content and all things non-literary.]</p>\n<h2>Description of the process</h2>\n<p><em>The Precipice</em> was published in the Czech Republic by Argo Publishers, in a series called Crossover. More information about the series and the publisher is provided in the sections <a href=\"#No__1__Find_the_right_publisher\">Find the right publisher</a> and <a href=\"#Czech_literary_market\">Czech literary market</a>.</p>\n<p>For any translated book, fiction or nonfiction, in any decent publishing house (at least in the Czech Republic), here's how the process usually is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. The translator translates the book and submits it (usually using a word processing software such as Microsoft Word<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-2\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-2\">[2]</a></sup>).</p>\n<p>2. The language editor reads the translation simultaneously with the original. Not only do they correct errors, they should also actively offer alternative phrasing and comment on the translation.They send it back to the translator.<br>\n(Non-professionals are sometimes surprised by the quantity of the changes proposed by the language editor, so I thought it might be interesting to mention that even in a very good translation, it's absolutely normal to see <strong>ten or more proposed changes per page</strong>. I know this from my own experience as a translator and occasional language editor, as well as from many conversations with much more experienced language editors).</p>\n<p>3. The translator reads through the comments, accepts the proposed changes they agree with, and discusses the proposed changes they don't agree with. The translator should always have the final say in this (as they are the owner of the copyright). The translator would, however, be silly if they decided not to accept any of the proposed changes. Also, if the publishing house is not happy with how the translator reacts to the language editor's feedback, they can decide to withdraw from the contract (in an extreme case).</p>\n<p>4. The text is then sent to the publishing house to be typeset. (Typesetting is the process of arranging the digital text - the paragraphs, symbols, charts etc. - onto a page so that it's print-ready.)</p>\n<p>5. After it is typeset, the language reviser (a different role from the language editor; different person, too) reads through the text. This time, they don't actively offer alternative solutions, but rather check for punctuation and typesetting errors.</p>\n<p>6. After that, the text is sent to the translator again, and the translator again approves of the final version of the text.</p>\n<p>7. For every book, there is usually also an in-house \"responsible editor\" who also reads the book before it is printed. For Argo's Crossover, this was Old\u0159ich V\u00e1gner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So for any translated book, you usually get 2-3 proofreaders and the translator usually reads the text a minimum of three or four times.</p>\n<p>With projects like <em>The Precipice</em>, things get more complicated than that.</p>\n<p>Argo decided from the start that apart from the usual proofreaders mentioned above, a Czech expert on x-risks would read the translation after it is finished, and add comments. For this task, they reached out to Jan Kulveit, Czech AI alignment researcher from Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute and Toby Ord's colleague.</p>\n<p>Along the way, parts of the text were also consulted with Tom\u00e1\u0161 Gaven\u010diak (another AI safety researcher) and the whole text was proofread once more by Ji\u0159\u00ed N\u00e1dvorn\u00edk, co-founder of Czech EA Association (CZEA). Jan Kulveit reached out to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Gaven\u010diak, while Ji\u0159\u00ed N\u00e1dvorn\u00edk offered his help later in the process, after I became familiar with CZEA (see the Appendix <a href=\"#My_story\">My story</a> if you're interested in details).<br>\n<br>\nI also consulted some very small fragments with Toby Ord himself; see section <a href=\"#Errors__or_not__\">Errors (or not?)</a>.</p>\n<p>I am very grateful for all the help I received. Although the process was quite lengthy and I think it can be quicker and more efficient (as outlined <a href=\"#How_it_could_have_been_organized__other_possible_setups_\">below</a>), I think the final product turned out well and all the people mentioned here contributed to it substantially.</p>\n<h2>Timeline</h2>\n<p>The whole process of publishing <em>The Precipice</em> in the Czech Republic took <strong>20 months</strong>. The approximate timeline was:</p>\n<p><strong>October 2020 -- March 2021</strong>: I translated the book alone.</p>\n<p><strong>September 2021</strong>: Jan Kulveit and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Gaven\u010diak provided their comments on the translation, I implemented them and further discussed some problematic passages with Jan Kulveit.</p>\n<p><strong>September 2021 -- December 2021</strong>: Language editing of the translation took place. I then approved of the changes.</p>\n<p><strong>December 2021 -- February 2022</strong>: Typesetting took place.</p>\n<p><strong>February 2022</strong>: The book was typeset, language revision took place, I approved of the changes. Ji\u0159\u00ed N\u00e1dvorn\u00edk, Jan Kulveit and Old\u0159ich V\u00e1gner read the book again.</p>\n<p><strong>April 2022</strong>: The book was sent to the printing office.</p>\n<p><strong>May 2022</strong>: The book was printed, published.</p>\n<h1>Main challenges</h1>\n<p>While translating, these are the things I struggled with the most.</p>\n<h2>Unfamiliarity with the field of x-risks</h2>\n<p>I am a literary translator by education and trade. I first became familiar with EA precisely through the translation of <em>The Precipice</em> (you can read more details about my background in <a href=\"#My_story\">My story</a>).</p>\n<p>When I started working on the translation, not only was I unfamiliar with the field of x-risks; I also didn't know anyone who worked or did research in that area. (To be more precise: I did know Jan Kulveit existed, as I knew him from the media and it was pre-arranged by Argo Publishers that he'd help with the translation after it's finished, but back then I didn't feel like I could consult thIngs with him and reach out continuously, as I was translating). In practice, this meant that <strong>any topic I didn't understand, I had to research on my own</strong>, reading related papers online and consulting people from related areas I knew.</p>\n<p>This was difficult work but it was also something I was prepared to do as we were trained to translate non-fiction texts like this at the Institute of Translation Studies. However, I can honestly say that never before had I translated something as complicated and highly scientific as <em>The Precipice</em>. The golden rule that \"you can't write something in the translation unless you're 100% sure what it means and could explain it in your own words\" failed me because despite all my research, there were still a couple of passages in the book I wasn't able to understand on my own (these were mostly technical details in the notes section of the book). But I bookmarked these to consult with Jan Kulveit, so I knew there'd be a safety net of some sort. Still, it would have been nice to have someone who would have helped on the spot (as proposed in <a href=\"#Option_B\">Option B</a>).<br>\n<br>\nNote: At this point you might find yourself thinking: \"Ok, but if it's such a struggle for the professional translator to even understand the original, why is a professional translator necessary at all, considering there are EAs who understand the original perfectly and speak the target language, too?\" I talk about this in <a href=\"#Option_C\">Option C</a>.</p>\n<h2>I was alone</h2>\n<p>I only reached out to CZEA and became familiar with the community after I had translated the book, not while I was translating it. As mentioned above, things would have been easier for me if I had had a group of people to consult the translation with.</p>\n<p>One other perspective from which to look at this is that had I been in touch with CZEA while I was translating, <em>I could have made things easier for them, too</em>. One member of the Czech EA community reached out to me after I'd submitted the translation, asking me how I translated one specific term. He wrote: \"Could you look up for me how you translated this? Surely, you must have a glossary or a database of translated terms.\" Well, I didn't. I did help him - I <em>remembered</em> how I translated the thing he asked, and even if I hadn't remembered, I could have still looked it up in the Word document - but only then it occurred to me that I should have written a glossary of all the translated terms I had to look up or come up with. <em>I</em> didn't need it, sure, but it would have been useful for other members of the Czech EA community.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-3\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Errors (or not?)</h2>\n<p>Despite all my fascination by the source text, I occasionally found something that felt like an error. Who was I supposed to consult this with? Who even has this very specialized knowledge, such as the amount or type of magma ejected from a supervolcano? Eventually, I reached out to Toby Ord with some of my doubts. It turned out that three of the things I spotted were actually errors in the source text.</p>\n<h2>The style</h2>\n<p><em>\"Glad you enjoyed it! I'm sure it was a challenging book to translate, with the mixture of clarity on technical points and poetic descriptions of humanity's broader potential and challenges,\"</em> Toby Ord wrote to me, summing up what the main stylistic challenge of this translation was. While very poetic in some parts and very readable in general, it never stops being scientifically accurate (dozens of experts and scientists have been consulted to polish all the scientific details of this book).</p>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly to some, this didn't prove to be such a huge problem when it came to longer scientific explanations which I took the time to research and rephrase correctly in Czech (or I actively asked for an explanation). Rather, the first version of my translation proved to be wanting in small details in the more poetic passages, where I sometimes got carried away and used e. g. an adjective or verb that wasn't quite precise and revealed that my understanding of the topic was superficial (or that I don't usually read articles about that topic, for example). Jan Kulveit proved to be a huge help in this aspect, helping my translation to be as scientifically precise as the original is (while I still kept in mind its poetic and stylistical specifics).</p>\n<h1>How it could have been organized (other possible setups)</h1>\n<p>In this section, I'd like to lay out different options of how the translation of a complicated EA-adjacent book could be organized and its possible upsides and downsides.</p>\n<p>Although I personally do have a favorite among these options <strong>(<a href=\"#Option_B\">Option B</a>)</strong> and my choice of this option is based on my personal experience with translating literature, I wouldn't like to force my opinions or intuitions on anyone. Precisely because of that, I also describe options I'm personally more skeptical about, such as <a href=\"#Option_D\">Option D</a>. You can try out any of those options if you're not convinced by my reasoning, and if you obtain a satisfactory result with any of them, I'd be happy to change my opinion as to which one of these is the most effective one.</p>\n<h2>Option A</h2>\n<p>In this scenario <strong>the initiative to publish the book comes from a publishing house, not the national EA group. The publishing house finds their own translator, possibly also their own consultants</strong> (Czech x-risks experts) to be consulted before the book is printed.</p>\n<p>This is basically what happened in the case of <em>The Precipice</em> in the Czech Republic. Old\u0159ich V\u00e1gner, editor-in-chief of the \"Crossover\" series in Argo Publishers, chose this book to be published and secured the rights. He then reached out to me, the translator, and to Jan Kulveit, the AI alignment expert. Jan Kulveit then reached out to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Gaven\u010diak. Meanwhile, I got to know the Czech EA community and eventually also got help from Ji\u0159\u00ed N\u00e1dvorn\u00edk (see <a href=\"#My_story\">My story</a> if you're interested in details).</p>\n<p>One thing to understand here is that, in my experience, when a publishing house reaches out to an external expert consultant - which is quite common for a good publishing houses to do, especially when it comes to highly scientific non-fiction literature - the consultants usually only read the text <em>after</em> it is translated, sometimes even after it is revised. Publishers probably suppose this is the most effective way to go about it as it saves the expert's time; I argue it's probably not (at least not for EA-adjacent texts where you have a whole community of very knowledgeable people willing to help the translator).</p>\n<h3>Upsides of Option A</h3>\n<p>In this scenario, the publishing process is basically in expert hands. The editors and the typesetters are professionals who know what a quality book \"should look like\". If it is a good publishing house, there are people who'll buy the book only because it was published by that specific publishing house or even in that specific series (see section <a href=\"#Czech_literary_market\">Czech literary market</a>).</p>\n<p>The translator is - presumably - skilled in writing in Czech (in Czech stylistics), which is extremely important to renowned publishing houses. As the editor at Argo Publishers said: \"If there are factual imprecisions in the submitted translation, they can always be corrected; however, if the stylistics are bad, you can't possibly rewrite the whole book.\"</p>\n<h3>Downsides of Option A</h3>\n<p>The \"literary experts'' can't be expected to know about EA, x-risks or any of the related fields. In this scenario, experts are consulted; however <strong>only <em>after</em> the translation is finished.</strong> Since experts in x-risks are usually busy people, they presumably won't jump on the translation and comment on it the moment it is ready. It then takes a lot of time to wait for the experts to read the translation and to add their comments; and often, after that happens, large parts of the text have to be reread and re-written, which is time-consuming for the translator and for all the concerned parties.</p>\n<h2>Option B</h2>\n<p><strong>(And this is what I would recommend and what makes most sense to me, personally).</strong></p>\n<p>In this setup, <strong>the initiative to publish the book doesn't come from a publishing house, but rather from the national EA group</strong>. The EA group reaches out to a renowned publishing house in their country and lets them find a professional translator (an expert in stylistics and linguistics). However, they fill the translator in on the topics covered in the books and, ideally, create a group of experts which can, on a regular basis, consult the terminology and the complicated passages with the translator as they translate.</p>\n<h3>Upsides of Option B:</h3>\n<p>All of the upsides from Option A still apply, plus: this makes the whole process quicker, the translator doesn't feel lost and the experts and EAs have a certain control over how the translation is going (and if it's not going well, they can intercept sooner). I feel very optimistic about this scenario.</p>\n<h3>Downsides of Option B:</h3>\n<p>The only downside that occurs to me is that there is a chance that the translator won't get along with the group of experts, or that the experts won't understand their roles correctly and will try to modify the translation more than necessary, which in turn might generate conflicts that might slow the process down. This of course can happen, but it's all a question of effective communication and I don't think it is very likely.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>I'd also feel optimistic about a mixture of Option A and Option B where the initiative for publishing the book comes from the publishing house, however the experts from the local national EA group check on the translation continuously.</p>\n<h2>Option C</h2>\n<p>Of course, the national EA group doesn't have to reach out to a professional translator. <strong>They can find the translator in their midst</strong>, or they can reach out to an expert on x-risks (not an expert on translation) to translate the book. They don't even have to contact any publisher in their country; <strong>they can publish the book themselves.</strong></p>\n<h3>Upsides of Option C:</h3>\n<p>Since the translator would plausibly be somehow aligned and definitely hired by the national EA group, all of the concerned parties would also probably be \"on the same page\", and would have similar expectations from the project.</p>\n<p>I also owe Laura Gonz\u00e1lez this note: \"Self-publication (if the rights are secured) is a safe bet, while it's never guaranteed that a good publishing house will accept or be interested in publishing the book. I think publication with a publishing house is far better than this option (...) but sometimes the choice is not publishing house or self-publication, but rather self-publication or nothing.\" This is of course true and can be seen as an upside of this scenario. But I'd really encourage people to see self-publication as a last resort and rather try talking to local established publishers (see section <a href=\"#No__2__Reach_out_to_the_publisher\">Reach out to the publisher</a>).</p>\n<h3>Downsides of Option C:</h3>\n<p>I'd be worried that in this setup, the translated book's literary value would be significantly diminished.</p>\n<p>The danger here is that for the translator's role, a person would be chosen who is, say, well-versed in some of the topics the book covers and speaks the source language well, which in my eyes are <strong>not sufficient prerequisites for a literary translator</strong>. (A clich\u00e9 saying among translators is that \"Speaking a foreign language well doesn't make you a translator any more than having ten fingers makes you a pianist.\" You might have heard something similar in your language: the translators' frustration by people who think they know how to translate is universal.)</p>\n<p><strong>A literary translator is, above all, a person capable of spotting which aspects of the text are central to the author's style</strong> (as opposed to aspects which, for example, might be typical for the original language/culture but maybe do not constitute a central part of the author's style), and <strong>equipped with sufficient writing skills to find suitable ways to convey those stylistic aspects in their target language</strong>. This is a skill that, in my experience, takes years of training, and it doesn't come to you naturally just because you know the language and are familiar with a certain topic.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-4\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is of course true that stylistics are even more important in works of fiction, and that for non-fiction books, it is factual correctness that is key. I'd argue, however, that stylistics play a very important role in non-fiction literature as well, and my hunch is that even readers who say they only care about a book's content (not its style or structure) always recognize, subconsciously at least, when something's off with the style. And then there is the author's point of view. Wouldn't it be a shame to just wipe off the style they created for the book?</p>\n<p>I'm not saying that a non-professional translator must, by default, always produce a bad result.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-5\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-5\">[5]</a></sup> But I expect professional translators to have a better idea of how to render the author's style into the target language than non-professionals, and I think the probability that a professional translator (assisted by an expert in x-risks) will produce a quality literary translation is higher than the probability of a non-professional producing one, even if said person understands the topic and speaks the language very well.</p>\n<p>It also comes to mind that while trained translators and literary experts, based on my experience, are quite likely to be aware of their own shortcomings in other fields (such as x-risks), scientists, on the other hand, might underestimate their own shortcomings in translation, writing, communication and stylistics (because those skills are sometimes seen as inferior to their more technical types of knowledge and skill). I find it likely that a professional translator reaches out to an x-risk expert for advice; I find this less likely to happen vice versa (and I think it's always important for the two sides to collaborate).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-6\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Also, if the national EA group decided to act without the publishing house, they might lose a significant number of readers who'd buy the book because it was published by an established publisher.</p>\n<p>As for the question of finance, I suspect that in this scenario, all of the concerned parties would probably be better paid than the literary professionals, at least in the Czech Republic (see <a href=\"#Czech_literary_market\">Czech literary market</a>). This might seem like an upside at face value (and it definitely is for the translator). But as Laura Gonz\u00e1lez pointed out, if we accept that not everyone is fit for being a literary translator (despite their expertise in x-risks and knowledge of the language), then it's actually a downside for EA: you're paying a person more to do a worse job.</p>\n<h2>Option D</h2>\n<p>The national EA group might also <strong>disregard a human translator completely and opt for a machine translation</strong>, probably post-edited by relevant experts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-7\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n<h3>Upsides of Option D:</h3>\n<p>This would probably make the process significantly quicker and cheaper.</p>\n<h3>Downsides of Option D:</h3>\n<p>My intuition is that unless the local EA group hired a post-editor who is also trained in translation and stylistics, the book would lose a lot of its literary value, and if they did hire a post-editor trained in these fields, that person would have so much work post-editing the text that it would have been easier to have them translate it in the first place.</p>\n<p>However, machine translators and language models are improving quickly and I wouldn't like to discourage anyone from trying this out. I'd be very interested in how the final product turns out.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-8\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<h1>Promotion of the Czech version of The Precipice</h1>\n<p>To promote the book, we are organizing a series of debates about it with x-risks experts. Two of these debates took place in June and more will happen in fall.</p>\n<p>We are also planning to organize reading groups of <em>The Precipice</em>, record a podcast episode about the book with Argo Publishers and possibly reach out to some journalists with a press release, but this is still a work in progress.</p>\n<h1>Recommendations to publish the best possible product</h1>\n<p>To any national EA group that wants an EA-adjacent book published in their language, I'd personally recommend the following:</p>\n<h2>No. 1: Find the right publisher</h2>\n<p>Try talking to people who are well-versed in the literary market in your country (editors, literary translators, writers, literary critics, avid readers who happen to follow the situation at the literary market in your country closely) and ask them which publishers have a good reputation of publishing quality literature in good translations, without typesetting errors, with nice graphics etc.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-9\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<p>You can also look for editions in which the EA-adjacent book of your choice might be published: in the Czech Republic, for example, both <em>Doing Good Better</em> and <em>The Precipice</em> were published by Argo in a series called \"Crossover\", a non-fiction series which \"presents the most interesting and useful proposals to solve the problems around us.\" Apart from <em>DGB</em> and <em>The Precipice</em>, Rutger Bregman's <em>Humankind</em> or Alec Ross' <em>The Industries of the Future</em> were published in this series, and many others. Perhaps there is a similar series in your country as well?</p>\n<h2>No. 2: Reach out to the publisher</h2>\n<p>Obviously, it's hard to estimate how any given publisher will react to a proposal from the national EA group. But I'd be optimistic that they at least consider your proposal if your pitch includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\"This is a quality, well-researched book that sells well and has been published in other languages.\" (Show examples, present reviews of the book.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"This book is a very good fit for you as a publisher/ for one of your series.\" (Explain, present arguments.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"We, as the local EA chapter, formed a group of experts ready to help the translator whenever they need it.\" (See <a href=\"#Option_B\">Option B</a>; also explain why the translator will probably need it.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"There is a significant number of people who will probably read, buy and promote the book.\" (Present the local EA community.)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-10\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-10\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When reading my text, both Konstantin Pilz and Laura Gonz\u00e1lez pointed out that part of the work mentioned in No. 1 and No. 2 could also be done by literary agents. I honestly don't know much about how literary agents work nor how they choose the publisher for their book in a foreign country. It might be potentially high-impact to reach out to the literary agent (or maybe the author) of the EA-adjacent book you want published in your country. In that case, they'd be the ones pitching the book to a publisher in your country as insiders, and they could also include in the pitch all of the points mentioned above.</p>\n<h2>No. 3: Create a group of people who will help the translator <em>as they translate</em> (not after the translation is finished)</h2>\n<p>I'd recommend the national EA group to create a support group for the translator consisting of x-risks experts or local EAs who have a very good understanding of the topics the book covers. See <a href=\"#Option_B\">Option B</a> for details.</p>\n<h2>No. 4: Get on one page with the translator (or find the right translator)</h2>\n<p>If you're successful and the publisher reaches out to their own translator, be sure to meet with them as soon as possible and explain what you can do for them. Make clear to each other what your roles are and how often you'll consult the translation together. If you know a great professional translator who is somehow related to your national group, you can also recommend them to the publisher; perhaps they choose them for the translation and then the communication will be even easier.</p>\n<p>In any case, check multiple times whether the translator is aware of everything the job entails: that it is a big project which a lot of people care about, that the translator will be the one responsible for its final form (although they will have a significant help from your national group) and that it's probably a commitment for many months (although this depends on the specific book you're translating).</p>\n<p>Ond\u0159ej Hr\u00e1ch, a fellow translator, adds that it's important to take into account that literary translators are usually very poorly paid (you can read a little more about this in <a href=\"#Czech_literary_market\">Czech literary market</a>); and they're usually paid by word or page count, not by the hour. So it might be off-putting to them at first sight to see how much work this project entails. Explain how your group would help them and perhaps even that there are ways of providing additional funding (if you're happy with their work and if you're able to provide it, of course).</p>\n<h2>No. 5: Create a glossary of terms</h2>\n<p>Ask the translator to kindly create and update a glossary of terms as they translate. This will be very useful for your national EA group in the future. See <a href=\"#I_was_alone\">this section</a> for details.</p>\n<h2>No. 6: Proofread, proofread, proofread</h2>\n<p>You might think that since there was a group of experts checking the translation along the way, it has been proofread enough already. In my experience though, with a book so long and complex as <em>The Precipice</em>, errors always occur, even when it has been proofread by other people, too. Of course, it depends on the book you're publishing, but apart from the usual proofreaders with linguistic expertise, I'd recommend choosing at least two trustworthy EAs who will read the final version of the translation carefully and thoroughly before it goes to print.</p>\n<h2>No. 7: Get in touch with other EAs globally who have done some thinking about translation</h2>\n<p>Here are some people in the ecosystem I know of that are interested in the topic:</p>\n<p>If you're interested in the impact you might generate by publishing an EA-adjacent book in your language, I strongly recommend reaching out to Open Phil's <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/eli-rose/\">Eli Rose</a>. His writeup on translation covers both literary translations and translations of other EA materials.</p>\n<p>CEA's <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/team/catherine-low\">Catherine Low</a> is generally excited about translation projects and will be able to connect you with more people.</p>\n<p>Laura Gonz\u00e1lez is now working to get <em>The Precipice</em> and <em>Doing Good Better</em> published in Spanish. She's also coordinating a big project to get professional translations of many online resources (like the EA Handbook or the materials for the virtual courses).</p>\n<p>Konstantin Pilz has translated EA content to German with a focus on longtermism and is happy to share his experiences.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://eagroups.slack.com/archives/C03DY5ZH0LA\">non-english-speaking-groups</a> channel on the EA Groups Slack might be of interest too.</p>\n<p>I would like to start an online translation workshop for EAs which covers how to translate EA content from scratch. I am actually now looking for a partner to do this with. I think I need a project manager, and I'd also be very grateful for someone who understands statistics, sociology or economy and/or someone who'd know where to look for answers to questions like: \"How to find out which EA-adjacent book might be the best fit to publish in a specific country?\", \"Which translation projects have the biggest EV in specific countries?\".

I hope this helps a person from a different cultural background get a better idea of the literary market we introduced the book into.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There is a huge number of publishing houses in the Czech Republic: more than 7,600 publishers for only 10 million Czech-speaking people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-11\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-11\">[11]</a></sup> To give you an idea, there are only around 900 publishers in the United Kingdom, which has almost seven times as many people as the Czech Republic.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-12\" id=\"fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-12\">[12]</a></sup> The competition is huge and it pushes the prices of the books and the salaries of people working in the literary market lower and lower.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is generally accepted that smaller, independent publishers publish fewer books of higher quality. Argo Publishers, where the Czech translation of <em>The Precipice</em> was published, definitely belongs to these smaller publishers with a better reputation. There are readers who actively only support publishing houses of this kind and buy books from them just because they were published by them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most of the translators work freelance, as opposed to language revisers and editors, who very often work in-house.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As far as translation goes, graduates of the Institute of Translation Studies of the Charles University have a good reputation on the literary market (based on what the publishers say and my colleagues' experience) and are frequently invited to collaborate by those smaller independent publishing houses.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>My story</h2>\n<p>I had studied Translation and Interpreting at the Institute of Translation Studies at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. Both at Bachelor's and Master's, this is basically what you might call a double major, one being focused on translation (of mostly fiction), the other one on interpreting (simultaneous and consecutive). Even before finishing my Master's, I knew I wanted to become a literary translator and I had translated one non-fiction book before graduating. Just after my graduation in September 2020, Argo Publishers sent me the offer to translate <em>The Precipice</em>.</p>\n<p>Argo chose me because I was recommended to them by a senior translator (also a graduate from the Institute of Translation Studies) and they also considered it a good sign that I had translated the previous book for Paseka Publishers (another smaller editorial with a good reputation). They wanted me to submit a sample of translation, and were happy with it when I did.</p>\n<p>As for my original impressions, the book seemed interesting and well-written to me at first glance, however I was a little disappointed I wasn't assigned a fiction book instead, because I preferred reading those and considered them a more creative type of work. I really wanted to translate fiction. To be perfectly honest, my main incentive to accept the assignment was to establish cooperation with Argo Publishers, a renowned publishing house, more so than translating Toby Ord's book per se.</p>\n<p>However, as I was working on the book, I became increasingly interested in the ideas it contained. After I finished the translation, I reached out to the Czech Association for Effective Altruism (CZEA) and after a year of being in touch with them, I started working part-time for CZEA. I still translate literature in my remaining working time.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Many of the things I talk about here can vary from country to country. Some of the cultural differences might be more prominent than others. For example, I'd be surprised if the publishing process as I describe it <a href=\"#The_process_of_publishing_The_Precipice\">here</a> was very different in other countries; however I'd be less surprised if it was e.g. more common for literary translators in other countries to use CAT tools than it is for literary translators in the Czech Republic (see Footnote 2). <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>It might be surprising to some, but literary translators, at least in my experience, don't often use computer-assisted translation software tools (or CAT tools), such as Trados or Memsource. These tools might be great for non-literary texts, especially repetitive texts such as legal documents, instruction leaflets etc., where consistency of terms is extremely important and the biggest value of the texts lies in the information they contain. However, for texts in which the most important part of their value stems from their aesthetics, translators often find that tools like Trados - which offer them translations of certain phrases or terms - actually <strong>stifle their creative process</strong>. In literary translation, you often have to find different ways of phrasing the same meaning, depending on the context, style, register and other criteria. Using CAT tools would actually tempt you to go for the translation you have maybe already used once or twice in a completely different text, or somebody else has (if you're using another person's glossary). This doesn't <em>always</em> have to be bad if you do it carefully, but I suspect if you did this systematically in the whole book, you'd end up with a stylistically inconsistent text with no apparent aesthetic program. <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Laura Gonz\u00e1lez pointed out to me that reading this surprised her, as \"the professional translators she works with use glossaries as a translation tool, even if only for their own benefit (to ensure consistency and reduce random errors)\". This has to do with what I mentioned in the previous footnote. I suspect that what Laura says may well be true for non-literary translators, but literary translators - at least from what I've seen - often shy away from this kind of systematization, and it's not really so much because they're free-spirited souls who can't be bothered with sheets, tables and charts, but because they are aware that in literature, it's often the case that with every new occurrence of a word, you need to think again about the way you're going to render it, even if you have already come up with a satisfactory translation of the same word in a different context in the past.<br>\nBut perhaps Laura's different experience could also be assigned to our different cultural backgrounds: maybe it's much more common for literary translators in Spain to use glossaries than for those in the Czech Republic. I'd love to learn more about this.<br>\nI personally didn't use a glossary when translating <em>The Precipice</em>. This doesn't mean I wasn't consistent with the translation of scientific terms, but I was trying to give myself space for working with the text more freely. To give an example, sometimes you can keep the root of the translated term, but turn the noun into a verb, if it's still clear that it's a reference to the original term and if it's necessary for the rhythm or for putting the \"rheme\" (the part of a clause that gives new information about the theme) where it needs to be in a Czech sentence. I remembered most of the terms (as you do, when you spend 5 months looking at the same text), so I didn't need a glossary of the translations I have used. What I didn't take into account at that time was the community of people that could use a glossary like that, which is why I also recommend for the translator to create a glossary along the way. But even in this case, I'd like to point out that such <strong>a glossary should serve more as an inspiration to an experienced translator than as a manual to an inexperienced one</strong>. <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>To be clear, I am not trying to imply that <em>I</em> have refined my stylistic abilities in Czech to absolute perfection and am now the epitome of a good translator. I am still learning, and I have learned a lot even when I was translating <em>The Precipice</em>. The first version of my translation was far from perfect (which, by the way, I am more fine with than with the fact that despite all my efforts and all the proofreadings, the odds are still high that even in the published version, there still remain some inaccuracies in the translation, though mercifully no-one has brought them to my attention so far). But at least I'm aware that the skill of translating well doesn't magically come to you when you speak a foreign language well. They are two different skills. <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>It should be pointed out that there has been at least one experiment I'm aware of which involved translating EA materials into Portuguese and in which professional translators have not proved to be significantly better (or worse) than non-professional EAs: out of the final two best translators in the experiment, one was a professional and one was an EA. I owe this note to Eli Rose. The experiment was run by Guille Costa during his 2021 internship at Open Philantropy. I don't know the details of the experiment nor have I seen the data or the assessment criteria but I thought it should be mentioned here. <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-6\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I also might be wrong about this: perhaps the majority of scientists would actually consult an expert in stylistics, or they themselves actually would make perfect translators. I think it's obvious from the text how I might be biased in the sense that I might lean towards professional translation as opposed to translation done by non-professional EAs (or machine translation, see <a href=\"#Option_D\">Option D</a>) more than necessary. I have my reasons for this position (my personal experience), however I'd be willing to change it if there were some robust data proving that, for example, readers don't generally care whether a book is translated by a professional, or that they have the same impressions from a book translated by a professional as by a non-professional. I suspect this is not true (that is, that readers do care), but perhaps the truth is more nuanced than that: perhaps there is only a specific subgroup of readers who care, perhaps this really depends on the text, etc. I'd really love to see the results of a large-scale research looking into this. I also talk about this in Footnote 7. <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-7\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Some people might think that this is already a standard way of translating texts: it is not, for reasons similar to those I mentioned in Footnote 2. But as these language models are improving quickly, it probably wouldn't be too surprising if this became more standard in the short-term. I'd say in literary translation, it's definitely not standard at the moment. <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-7\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-8\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>My intuition is that today, the general public is probably still overestimating the usefulness of machine translation services such as DeepL or language models for literary translation. Again, it goes without saying that I might be biased in this opinion because of my education and trade. But I'd also argue that as a literary translator, I am perceptive of aspects of translation the general public doesn't usually take into account when they're impressed by the quality of their DeepL translations.<br>\nOne thing that's lacking (or at least I'm not aware of many of them) is experiments and hard data on how readers from the general public would perceive literature translated by professional human translators vs. machine-translated literature. (Such an experiment could be conducted, for example, on two translations of the same book). Would the readers have different impressions from the two translations? Probably yes, but how different? Would they describe the two translations differently? Would they recognize which one was machine-translated, and how would they recognize it? Which one would they enjoy more? I would love to read the results of a similar experiment. <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-8\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-9\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Laura Gonz\u00e1lez pointed out that \"It's worth acknowledging here that the best publishers are also the ones that are most difficult to reach as a nobody. It's very difficult to randomly approach a publisher without any internal contacts to say: \"Hey, I think you should translate this book\" and for them to listen\". That is of course true, and it's precisely why I think it might be easier to start from a person who knows the local literary market well, because such a person might also have those necessary internal contacts. In the Czech environment, it also helps even to graduate from a certain school of translation (I talk about this in <a href=\"#My_story\">My story</a>) to establish contact with quality publishing houses.<br>\nI still think it's possible to engage the publisher's interest, though, even without internal contacts, with the right pitch. (I talk about this in <a href=\"#No__2__Reach_out_to_the_publisher\">No.2</a>). But I completely understand that it's hard and I also don't really know what the situation is like in other countries. Even so, part of the reason why I decided to write this is to share my impression that people in the literary market are generally quite accessible when you pitch them a good book, which for example <em>The Precipice</em> definitely is, at least in my opinion, and I think EAs in general fear them more than necessary. <a href=\"#fnref-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-9\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-i4QetAp6HAbHmpWH7-10\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>You may also consider offering them funding for the translation, as several EA grantmakers would plausibly be willing to provide it.

But there were brave people fighting against it.</p><p>One of them was Benjamin Lay.&nbsp;</p><p>He was a Quaker activist, born in the late 17th century in England, and stood just over four feet tall.</p><p>Benjamin Lay could not stop talking about how horrible he thought slavery was. As an adult, he moved into a cave in Philadelphia, boycotted all goods produced by enslaved people, made his own clothes and refused to drink tea or eat sugar. He sometimes acted on his views in a very dramatic style: When he learned of a family that kept a young girl as a slave, he invited their six-year-old son to his cave \u2013 so the family would briefly feel the horrors of losing a child.&nbsp;</p><p>He was part of the largest Quaker community. He once stood outside a Quaker meeting in the snow without shoes and without a coat. He explained to worried onlookers that slaves were forced to work outside in this attire throughout the whole winter. In one of their yearly meetings, he tried to educate them about the equality of all mankind, referring to the verse in the bible that says all men are created equal.</p><p>As obvious as his morals seem to us, he was probably considered an annoying weirdo by some people at the time. It paid off to be a weirdo though. Between 1681 and 1705, around 70 percent of the leaders of the Quaker\u2019s Yearly meeting enslaved people, and about 75 years later that figure dropped to 10 percent. A bit later, it got banned entirely.</p><p>The Quaker\u2019s abolitionist movement became influential. They inspired and helped many abolitionists, even overseas. British abolitionists managed to persuade their parliament to abolish the slave trade in 1807 and to make enslaving people illegal across most of the British Empire in 1833. So it is possible to make the case that there were people without whom we might still have slavery in the western world.</p><p>There were also other important figures around the time who had a big influence on the abolitionists movements in their respective countries. Examples include Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery, became a preacher and wrote three autobiographies. He saw photography as a political tool and became the most photographed American in the 19th century. Frederick always looked stern in his pictures to not play into the racist caricature of a happy slave. Then there\u2019s Harriet Tubman, who also escaped slavery and freed 70 people in 13 missions. During the civil war, she became the first American woman to lead an armed expedition, freeing over 750 enslaved people. Olaudah Equiano was able to buy his way out of slavery and his autobiography fuelled a growing anti-slavery movement in Great Britain and beyond. Lu\u00eds Gama won his freedom through court, became a lawyer and freed over 500 people through legal proceedings.</p><p>Some people claim slavery got abolished because it wasn\u2019t economically interesting anymore. But the abolition of slavery cost the British population at least 41 million pounds, which is almost 5,5 billion pounds today.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/19/britishidentity.leadersandreply\"><u>*</u></a><a href=\"https://www.in2013dollars.com/uk/inflation/1833?amount=41000000\"><u>*</u></a></p><h2><strong>Moral progress</strong></h2><p>Our morals have changed a lot over the past few centuries. Just a hundred years ago, women in Italy or France weren\u2019t allowed to vote! And in Switzerland women can only vote on the federal level since 1971! Rape in a marriage was legal in Germany until 1997. Same sex marriage has only been legalized in the last couple of years in a lot of western countries. These major changes in our morals have happened over a comparatively short period of time. We can be certain that the coming decades and centuries will bring about drastic moral change as well, as seemingly inconsistent moral views still seem to persist today.</p><p>Examples might include the criminalization of some drugs like cannabis while other drugs like alcohol and tobacco are legal. Or keeping and loving a pet versus looking away from the cruelties of animal farming. Even Benjamin Lay already took the latter thought seriously. He was a vegetarian who even refused to wear leather and wool.</p><p>Whether you agree with these examples or not remains up to you. But let\u2019s take away one thing: Let\u2019s be more like Lay. Let\u2019s look for examples in our lifetime of moral inconsistencies still happening around us and fight them. We would all love to think if we lived 300 years ago we wouldn\u2019t have accepted slavery. But the reality is that it was widely accepted at the time, so there\u2019s a good chance you and I would\u2019ve accepted it too. So let\u2019s avoid that trap now and let\u2019s always be on the lookout, let\u2019s keep an open mind to make sure we are not participating in any moral atrocities today, even if we don\u2019t intend to.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>We just summarised a chapter from Oxford philosopher Will MacAskill\u2019s new book called What We Owe The Future.

Each individual animal needs our help, so the greater the number of animals suffering, the greater the need, and the greater priority they should represent. This shared thought - that we should help not just some animals, but as many as possible - is behind the decision for many animal organisations to focus on helping farmed animals, based on the numbers of individuals suffering. In addition to this shift to farm animals, there are many other potential changes that organisations can make to be more impactful.</p><p>Inevitably, organisations face trade-offs when choosing to prioritise their limited resources between different campaigns. Funding and staffing resources used in one campaign cannot be used in another. Starting one campaign or another implicitly prioritises it over many other potential opportunities. This means that we cannot help all animals. Instead, we face important trade-offs that should be considered carefully.</p><p>These trade-offs are particularly important because of the large difference in effectiveness between different campaign choices. Many people intuitively believe that charities and their projects differ very little in effectiveness. However, charities can actually differ greatly in their cost-effectiveness. <a href=\"https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/122268/Caviola%20et%20al._2020_JDM.pdf\"><u>A study on the subject</u></a> found that the public generally estimated that charities helping the global poor differed in cost-effectiveness by a factor of 1.5 while experts believed that these charities differed in cost-effectiveness by a factor of 100.</p><p>The results of this study match up with the differences and cost-effectiveness that our research has suggested between different prospective campaigns that we have evaluated. This presents an exciting opportunity to have a larger impact through choosing more effective campaigns and thereby save many more animals with the same resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Particularly strong campaigns</strong></p><p>With such variation, it is particularly important to identify the most impactful campaigns, rather than just opportunities that are \u201cgood enough\u201d. One ask that we\u2019ve identified as particularly exciting in the context of both the UK and Switzerland is mandating that animal imports must meet local welfare standards. This would mean that animal products that were produced with lower animal welfare standards than the respective country would either be banned from imports or would face additional tariffs. This ask would cause producers who export to the country to raise welfare standards, therefore improving welfare.</p><p>An additional strength of this ask is that it is particularly popular amongst the public, with a majority of <a href=\"https://2sjjwunnql41ia7ki31qqub1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RSPCA_Animal-welfare-standards-poll_Aug2020.pdf\"><u>UK citizens</u></a> being in favour of it. It is also nearly unique in being an ask that farmers and the animal agriculture industry in the country have reason to support because it protects them against competition. This is particularly important because they are normally the voting and lobbying block that is most opposed to animal advocacy efforts. This popularity makes this ask particularly strong in this Swiss context, where it could be achieved through a ballot initiative that would more directly translate this popularity into political results.</p><p>Having said this, this ask may be weaker in other countries' contexts. Countries that do not import significant amounts from countries with lower standards will see little direct impact from this ask. Though even in this case the ask may have value in setting a precedent for implementation in other countries in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall harmful campaigns</strong></p><p>More concerning than just \u201cgood enough\u201d campaigns, we have also identified opportunities that are much less effective and even, in some cases, harmful. It is crucial to identify these campaigns in advance so that we do not commit resources to something that could be actively harmful.</p><p>One recent example of this is a proposed meat tax. Though it initially seemed promising to us, in our later rounds of research and in our <a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price\"><u>extensive report on the subject</u></a>, we determined that there is substantial risk that a meat tax would shift consumption towards the meat of smaller animals, and thereby increase overall suffering. This may happen as the most prominent motivations for a meat tax are climate and human health, leading to taxes weighted on carbon or health burden. This places much higher taxes on the meat of cows, sheep and pigs compared to chickens.</p><p>Thus as the price of meat rises, consumers may shift from more expensive red meat to the meat of chickens. The predictions of economic theory, economic modelling studies, and one similar real-world case all suggest that a meat tax could increase the number of farmed animals and thus increase rather than decrease suffering.</p><p>Through this extensive report, we are in a confident position to dissuade organisations from starting meat tax campaigns and therefore committing resources to something that is actively harmful. Animal advocacy organisations would be unlikely to perform this level of research on their own initiative, and so we believe that this type of insight would typically be missed by organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Surprising ideas with good impact</strong></p><p>In this analysis of which types of campaigns tend to be particularly impactful or overall harmful, a common pattern that we have found is that campaigns focused on small animals, such as chickens and fish, are particularly impactful due to the sheer scale of the individuals farmed. Perhaps surprisingly, campaigns focused on insects may also be very impactful, though so far tractability concerns and difficulty of organisations to work on the topic have meant that insect welfare has, so far, not been a top ask for us. Conversely, campaigns focused on larger animals may become harmful if they lead to a shift in relative consumption of smaller animals. This can be true even if overall consumption of animal products decreases.</p><p>However, there are few general rules that we can rely upon to judge the value of an ask or campaign in advance, and so we must engage in careful research with each new ask and for each new context.</p><p>One ask that we found surprisingly impactful is a campaign against the intensive breeding of pheasants and other game birds in the UK. The UK stands out in breeding a huge number of these birds, perhaps 60 million, and they are raised in particularly poor conditions. We believe that with a favourable government in power, a full ban would be possible (albeit somewhat difficult). There have been precedents set for this in other countries. A campaign to improve their rearing conditions might also be quite impactful. We considered this a quite strong campaign in the UK, though there are a few UK-based campaigns we consider even more impactful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is why research is crucial</strong></p><p>If campaign choice is this important and if research can significantly contribute to choosing stronger campaigns, then it follows that research is also crucially important. Simply put, when we have limited resources to distribute between campaigns that vary greatly in effectiveness, it is worth spending time to carefully and systematically research which campaigns are optimal. This importance is recognized by the movement, with 84% agreeing that research to prioritise amongst different farm animal asks is neglected.</p><p>We estimate that since 2021 we have moved $1.9 million USD of movement funds to more impactful campaigns. On average, we have recommended campaigns that are 25% more effective than those the partnered organisations would have chosen without our support. The cost of achieving this 25% uplift in effectiveness was just 6% of the organisation\u2019s overall campaign budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our approach and funding gap</strong></p><p>At Animal Ask, we take the approach we do because we are convinced of the value of research. We offer research assistance to organisations across the globe who are deciding on their next campaign through our prioritisation process, consultation process, or through our publicly available reports:</p><p>Most of our extensive reports are publicly available on our website for organisations considering asks that we have covered or that are interested in our foundational research.</p><p>In order to continue our important work for the next 12 months we need to fill a funding gap of $135,000. We would be very interested to speak with any grant makers or individuals interested in funding this unique and highly-impactful opportunity.</p><p><br>Please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch if you might be interested in one of our programmes, funding our work or if you have any questions for us.</p>", "user": {"username": "Animal Ask"}}, {"_id": "Ekd3oATEZkBbJ95uD", "title": "EAs underestimate uncertainty in cause prioritisation", "postedAt": "2022-08-23T14:04:31.553Z", "htmlBody": "<h3><strong>TL;DR:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><i>EA cause prioritisation frameworks use probabilities derived from belief which aren't based on empirical evidence.

I argue that this process is destabilised when infinite values are permitted. I first characterise (and slightly caricature) effective decision-making. Second, I describe three cases where infinities arise, with examples: costs that tend to zero (deworming), benefits that tend to positive infinity (artificial intelligence), and benefits that tend to negative infinity (climate change). Third, I will offer suggestions for bounding these values and therefore stabilising the decision-making function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\u2018Effective\u2019 in effective altruism refers to the way that decisions are made about what to do with altruistic intent. The benefits from altruism can be defined in a variety of ways, appealing to utilitarianism, human rights, fairness, or other concepts of justice. For now we can simply say that there is a benefit that the altruist intends. Meanwhile, there are costs. Costs include money, time, effort, and side-effects. Since the purpose is making decisions, uncertainty is also a cost, since a more uncertain option has a higher risk of an opportunity cost \u2014 the benefit missed-out on by inadvertently choosing a less ideal option. For our purposes we can lump all of these dimensions as costs, and assume that the altruist is making their best effort to capture all of the costs associated with each option. Thus, with benefits and costs defined and estimated (including uncertainty), the altruist plots the benefit/cost of each option. The altruist looks for the globally maximal benefit/cost, and exhausts this option until another option becomes optimal, and so on. I will refer to this maximisation of benefits/costs as the \u2018decision function\u2019. This characterisation of effective decision making becomes unstable \u2013 non-finite \u2013 when the denominator tends to zero or the numerator to infinity.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first of three cases, let us consider when the costs are thought to tend to zero. Since the function is benefit/cost, the value of this function tends to infinity so long as the benefit is finite but regardless of its size. An example of this scenario is mass deworming in schools. In the presence of worm-awareness and treatment for acute infections, whatever evidence there is for the benefit of school-based deworming is that the effect on health and other outcomes is small. However, characterisation of the costs as virtually zero has inflated the decision function to values that exceed all other options; deworming often tops the charts for most effective altruistic option. Note that this is despite the high levels of uncertainty about the effects: a denominator that multiplies a large number by zero is still zero.&nbsp;</p><p>A second instability arises when the benefit of an action tends to infinity. In such a case, only infinite costs can bound the decision function in real terms. The potential of artificial general intelligence is an example of a benefit (although also a risk) that can be characterised as infinite: once an intelligence exceeds human intelligence it could, in theory, design systems with ever increasing capacity without limit. As a consequence, it is impossible to consider options with respect to this potential.</p><p>We observe similar destabilisation when the benefit tends to negative infinity. For example, this arises whenever we consider effective altruistic options in the context of climate change, since the long-term societal costs of climate change are often thought to be so large as to be infinite. This is a consequence of the severity of climate change for human life, and the \u2018longtermist\u2019 view that gives weight to the trillions of potential future humans (as Will MacAskill argues in his latest book <i>What We Owe the Future: A Million-Year View</i>). With infinite negative benefit, only infinite costs can bring the decision function back to the real.&nbsp;</p><p>In each of these examples, the decision function (benefit/cost) tends to infinity and is no longer bounded. One might wonder if this matters. It matters because the decision function becomes unstable. When costs are thought to tend to zero, and the benefit is small, the decision function is highly sensitive to any information that could turn the costs positive. If, for example, we learn that school-based deworming was having a negative effect on other school-based health programmes, the cost would turn positive and the decision function could plummet. Allowing infinite positive benefit directly drives the decision function skyward, even as the costs multiply, such that a turn to the finite (for example because of some proof that AI might not function as hoped) would rapidly unravel the decision function. Infinite positive or negative benefits imply that only infinite costs can bring the decision function into the realm of the real. On the one hand this can lead to apathy, defeatism, and an apocalyptic version of longtermism that stymies action (more likely observed with negative benefit, such as climate change), and on the other it can become an insatiable cause that demands all possible resources (and more).&nbsp;</p><p>Finite bounds are possible, stablisising the decision function. For the first case, we can acknowledge that zero cost interventions are a fiction. There is no free lunch; were an option genuinely costless then it would already have happened. As in the case of school-based deworming, perhaps we are missing costs that are not immediately apparent. For example, we may miss costs associated with delivering the pills, or the effect of \u2018crowding out\u2019 other educational interventions where national and local governments and schools have finite bandwidth for new ideas. Accounting for all costs will bring the decision function back to the real.&nbsp;</p><p>Bounds can be set on the benefits of potentially limitless innovations such as artificial intelligence: setting appropriate discount rates on the utility for future generations will limit the benefit both in terms of the number of people who will gain and the extent of technological improvement that is being considered. For example, if we restrict the question of investing in AI to benefits for people alive now with technology that will be available in the next 20 years, then this altruistic option is no longer infinite but finite.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, negative infinite benefit will usually be driven by multiplying the utility losses experienced by infinite future generations (e.g. shortened life). We can counter this with appropriate, democratic, discounting for future lives lost. While it might seem rational to respect the lives of people yet unborn with the same rights as people alive now, that is neither credible or \u2014 more importantly \u2014 how people think. Heavily discounting for future life after a number of generations, such that it falls well below the value of, for example, animals alive now, will bound the decision function. This might seem radical, but there is little evidence from popular behaviour that we put anything more than a cursory value on the lives of future generations.</p><p>I have argued that infinities destabilise the decision function behind effective altruism, and given examples. The proposed solutions \u2014 count costs, discount future life lost, discount future utility \u2014 may seem at once defeatist and short-termist. They are neither. By restricting decisions to a finite benefit / cost space, we are making decisions on a human scale. We avoid bad decisions, avoid being paralysed by inaction, or betting on a unicorn.</p>", "user": {"username": "calumdavey"}}, {"_id": "vZ4kB8gpvkfHLfz8d", "title": "Critique of MacAskill\u2019s \u201cIs It Good to Make Happy People?\u201d", "postedAt": "2022-08-23T09:21:27.258Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In <i>What We Owe the Future</i>, William MacAskill delves into population ethics in a chapter titled \u201cIs It Good to Make Happy People?\u201d (Chapter 8). As he writes at the outset of the chapter, our views on population ethics matter greatly for our priorities, and hence it is important that we reflect on the key questions of population ethics. Yet it seems to me that the book skips over some of the most fundamental and most action-guiding of these questions. In particular, the book does not broach questions concerning whether any purported goods can outweigh extreme suffering \u2014 and, more generally, whether happy lives can outweigh miserable lives \u2014 even as these questions are all-important for our priorities.</p><h2><strong>The Asymmetry in population ethics</strong></h2><p>A prominent position that gets a very short treatment in the book is the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry_(population_ethics)\"> <u>Asymmetry in population ethics</u></a> (roughly: bringing a miserable life into the world has negative value while bringing a happy life into the world does not have positive value \u2014 except potentially through its<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5gPubzt79QsmRJZnL/minimalist-axiologies-and-positive-lives#6__Without_the_concept_of_intrinsic_positive_value__how_can_life_be_worth_living_\"> <u>instrumental effects</u></a> and<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/MBadsrYLmzLNmYjaj/p/t3St6Fz4DmHtKfgqm\"> <u>positive roles</u></a>).</p><p>The following is, as far as I can tell, the main argument that MacAskill makes against the Asymmetry (p. 172):</p><blockquote><p>If we think it\u2019s bad to bring into existence a life of suffering, why should we not think that it\u2019s good to bring into existence a flourishing life? I think any argument for the first claim would also be a good argument for the second.</p></blockquote><p>This claim about \u201cany argument\u201d seems unduly strong and general. Specifically, there are many arguments that support the intrinsic badness of bringing a miserable life into existence that do not support any intrinsic goodness of bringing a flourishing life into existence. Indeed, many arguments support the former while positively denying the latter.</p><p>One such argument is that the presence of suffering is bad and morally worth preventing while the absence of pleasure is not bad and <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/the-case-for-suffering-focused-ethics/#I_Making_people_happy_not_happy_people\"><u>not</u></a> a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5gPubzt79QsmRJZnL/minimalist-axiologies-and-positive-lives#Solving_problems__A_way_to_make_sense_of_population_ethics_\"><u>problem</u></a>, and hence not morally worth \u201cfixing\u201d in a <a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/suffering-and-happiness-morally-symmetric-or-orthogonal/#The_implications_of_symmetry\"><u>symmetric way</u></a> (provided that no existing beings are deprived of that pleasure).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqiormuc5ymo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqiormuc5ymo\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>A related class of arguments in favor of an asymmetry in population ethics is based on theories of wellbeing that understand happiness as the absence of<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/tranquilism/\"> <u>cravings</u></a>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifrustrationism\"> <u>preference frustrations</u></a>, or other<a href=\"https://www.simonknutsson.com/epicurean-ideas-about-pleasure-pain-good-and-bad/\"> <u>bothersome features</u></a>.

The term \u201cexistence\u201d may here be understood to either mean \u201cde novo existence\u201d or \u201ccontinued existence\u201d, and interpreting it as the latter is made more tempting by the fact that 1) we are talking about already existing beings, and 2) the example mentions their happiness \u201ccontinuing into their futures\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrtu21bvol3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrtu21bvol3\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>This is relevant because many proponents of the Asymmetry argue that there is an important distinction between the potential value of continued existence (or the badness of discontinued existence) versus the potential value of bringing a new life into existence.</p><p>Thus, many views that support the Asymmetry will agree that the happiness of these children \u201ccontinuing into their futures\u201d makes the world better, or less bad, than it otherwise would be (compared to a world in which their existing interests and preferences are thwarted). But these views still imply that the de novo <i>creation</i> (and eventual satisfaction) of these interests and preferences does not make the world better than it otherwise would be, had they not been created in the first place.

Among other things, he writes the following about the findings of the study (p. 173):</p><blockquote><p>these judgments [about the respective value of creating happy lives and unhappy lives] were symmetrical: the experimental subjects were just as positive about the idea of bringing into existence a new happy person as they were negative about the idea of bringing into existence a new unhappy person.</p></blockquote><p>While this summary seems accurate if we only focus on people\u2019s responses to one specific question in the survey (cf. Caviola et al.,<a href=\"http://files.luciuscaviola.com/Caviola-et-al_2022_Population-ethical-intuitions.pdf\"> <u>2022</u></a>, p. 9), there are nevertheless many findings in the study that suggest that people generally do endorse significant asymmetries in population ethics.</p><p>Specifically, the study found that people on average believed that considerably more happiness than suffering is needed to render a population or an individual life worthwhile, even when the happiness and suffering were said to be equally intense (Caviola et al.,<a href=\"http://files.luciuscaviola.com/Caviola-et-al_2022_Population-ethical-intuitions.pdf\"> <u>2022</u></a>, p. 8). The study likewise found that participants on average believed that the ratio of happy to unhappy people in a population must be at least 3-to-1 for its existence to be better than its non-existence (Caviola et al.,<a href=\"http://files.luciuscaviola.com/Caviola-et-al_2022_Population-ethical-intuitions.pdf\"> <u>2022</u></a>, p. 5).</p><p>Another relevant finding is that people generally have a significantly stronger preference for smaller over larger unhappy populations than they do for larger over smaller happy populations, and the magnitude of this difference becomes greater as the populations under consideration become larger (Caviola et al.,<a href=\"http://files.luciuscaviola.com/Caviola-et-al_2022_Population-ethical-intuitions.pdf\"> <u>2022</u></a>, pp. 12-13).</p><p>In other words, people\u2019s preference for smaller unhappy populations becomes stronger as population size increases, whereas the preference for larger happy populations becomes less strong as population size increases, in effect creating a strong asymmetry in cases involving large populations (e.g. above one billion individuals). This finding seems particularly relevant when discussing laypeople\u2019s views of population ethics in a context that is primarily concerned with the value of potentially vast future populations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr6mp62j34pe\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr6mp62j34pe\">[9]</a></sup></span></p><p>Moreover, a pilot study conducted by the same researchers suggested that the framing of the question plays a major role for people\u2019s intuitions (Caviola et al., 2022, \u201c<a href=\"https://osf.io/ca5ze\"><u>Supplementary Materials</u></a>\u201d). In particular, the pilot study (n=172) asked people the following question:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose you could push a button that created a new world with X people who are generally happy and 10 people who generally suffer. How high would X have to be for you to push the button?</p></blockquote><p>When the question was framed in these terms, i.e. in terms of creating a new world, people\u2019s intuitions were radically more asymmetric, as the median ratio then jumped to 100-to-1 happy to unhappy people, which is a rather pronounced asymmetry.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp93dv43e08\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp93dv43e08\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>In sum, it seems that the study that MacAskill cites above, when taken as a whole, mostly finds that people on average do endorse significant asymmetries in population ethics. I think this documented level of support for asymmetries would have been worth mentioning.</p><p>(Other surveys that suggest that people on average affirm a considerable asymmetry in the value of happiness vs. suffering and good vs. bad lives include the Future of Life Institute\u2019s<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2017/08/15/superintelligence-survey/\"> <u>Superintelligence survey</u></a> (n=14,866) and Tomasik,<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/a-small-mechanical-turk-survey-on-ethics-and-animal-welfare/#Pain-pleasure_tradeoff\"> <u>2015</u></a> (n=99).)</p><h2><strong>The discussion of moral uncertainty excludes asymmetric views</strong></h2><p>Toward the end of the chapter, MacAskill briefly turns to moral uncertainty, and he ends his discussion of the subject on the following note (p. 187):</p><blockquote><p>My colleagues Toby Ord and Hilary Greaves have found that this approach to reasoning under moral uncertainty can be extended to a range of theories of population ethics, including those that try to capture the intuition of neutrality. When you are uncertain about all of these theories, you still end up with a low but positive critical level [of wellbeing above which it is a net benefit for a new being to be created for their own sake].</p></blockquote><p>Yet the<a href=\"https://jesp.org/index.php/jesp/article/view/223\"> <u>analysis</u></a> in question appears to wholly ignore asymmetric views in population ethics. If one gives significant weight to asymmetric views \u2014 not to mention stronger<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/MBadsrYLmzLNmYjaj/p/5gPubzt79QsmRJZnL\"> <u>minimalist views</u></a> in population ethics \u2014 the conclusion of the moral uncertainty framework is likely to change substantially, perhaps so much so that the creation of new lives is generally not a benefit for the created beings themselves (although it could still be a net benefit for others and for the world as a whole, given the<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/MBadsrYLmzLNmYjaj/p/t3St6Fz4DmHtKfgqm\"> <u>positive roles</u></a> of those new lives).</p><p>Similarly, even if the creation of unusually happy lives would be regarded as a benefit from a moral uncertainty perspective that gives considerable weight to asymmetric views, this benefit may still not be sufficient to counterbalance extremely bad lives,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflg3wv3x7aun\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlg3wv3x7aun\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which are granted unique weight by many plausible axiological and moral views (cf.

Nor do these intrapersonal tradeoffs generally appear to include cases of extreme suffering, let alone an entire lifetime of torment (as experienced, for instance, by many of the non-human animals whom MacAskill describes in Chapter 9). Hence, that people are willing to make intrapersonal tradeoffs between everyday experiences that are more or less enjoyable says little about whether some people\u2019s enjoyment can morally outweigh the intense suffering or extremely bad lives endured by others. (In terms of people\u2019s self-reported willingness to experience extreme suffering in order to gain happiness, a <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/a-small-mechanical-turk-survey-on-ethics-and-animal-welfare/#Pain-pleasure_tradeoff\"><u>small survey</u></a> (n=99) found that around 45 percent of respondents would not experience even a single minute of extreme suffering for any amount of happiness; and that was just the intrapersonal case \u2014 such suffering-for-happiness trades are usually considered less plausible and less permissible in the interpersonal case, cf. Mayerfeld, 1999, pp. 131-133; Vinding, <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/suffering-focused-ethics.pdf\"><u>2020</u></a>, sec. 3.2.)</p><p>Individual ratings of life satisfaction are similarly limited in terms of what they say about <i>intra</i>personal tradeoffs. Indeed, even a high rating of momentary life satisfaction does not imply that the evaluator\u2019s life itself has overall been worth living, even by the evaluator\u2019s own standards. After all, one may <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1983/06/26/a-happy-life-afterward-doesnt-make-up-for-torture/ab680b30-237b-4b7a-b6da-1f7ab3da9208/\"><u>report</u></a> a very high quality of life yet still think that the good part of one\u2019s life cannot outweigh one\u2019s past suffering. It is thus rather limited what we can conclude about the value of individual lives, much less the world as a whole, based on people\u2019s momentary ratings of life satisfaction.</p><p>Finally, MacAskill also mentions various improvements that have occurred in recent centuries as a reason to be optimistic about the future of humanity in moral and evaluative terms. Yet it is unclear whether any of the improvements he mentions involve genuine positive goods, as opposed to representing a reduction of bads, e.g. child mortality, poverty, totalitarian rule, and human slavery (cf.

It is always bad if an extra person has to endure extreme agony. And this is always just as bad, however many others have similar lives. The badness of extra suffering never declines.\u201d In contrast, Parfit seemed to consider it more plausible that the addition of happiness adds diminishing marginal value to the world, even though he ultimately rejected that view because he thought it had implausible implications, Parfit, 1984, pp. 406-412.

In recruitment terms, this could be seen as building a talent pipeline - a rapidly growing, global talent pool. At the same time, professional recruitment as a systematic way of placing candidates from this talent pool into high-impact roles has been neglected. This \u201clack of demand\u201d created a lack of supply - recruiters with the right skills and EA alignment are difficult to find (based on my experience when hiring a recruiter for T\u00e4list, and anecdotal evidence from other organizations that ran hiring processes for recruiters in the last two years).</p><p>Much like operations management wasn\u2019t considered a high-impact role in the past, recruitment hasn't been discussed, or proposed, as an effective way to make a difference. For example, \u201crecruiter\u201d is not mentioned in 80000 Hours\u2019 list of recommended careers (even though hiring and HR are mentioned as the last project in their project list for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/\">operations management</a>&nbsp;roles), and there haven\u2019t been any blog posts about recruitment as a profession to date. In my perspective, this signals that the EA community has been underrating this profession and the potential benefits it could have, especially because EA is growing rapidly, and thus, will need to engage more talented people. By now, operations management&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/\">has largely</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ib6hy9v3FgigxMuMM/what-is-operations-management\">been accepted</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/p4cg8dAxj9Sg8djiA/writing-about-my-job-operations-manager\">as having a positive impact</a>&nbsp;on organizational efficiency. In the same way, we need greater awareness of the massive impact recruiting can have through the cumulative benefits of putting the right people in the right roles.</p><p>The impact potential was one of the main reasons why I decided to found <a href=\"https://talist.org\">T\u00e4list</a> as a meta-organization at the beginning of 2022. T\u00e4list was founded on EA principles, and the focus on recruitment for the Alternative Protein industry aligns with several EA cause areas, most specifically animal welfare. &nbsp;When searching for our own recruiter, we experienced the challenges of finding fitting candidates. Considering the variety of educational backgrounds and skills within EA I don\u2019t think the main challenge is a lack of the right people. I assume that the problem is that the right people are not aware of their fit for this role, and/or don\u2019t consider recruitment as a high-impact role.&nbsp;</p><p>If successful, recruiters can find the best people for the most impactful roles and remove bottlenecks in organizations, communities, and industries, benefiting EA cause areas. They facilitate the success and growth of organizations - and individuals. As a recruiter, the impact you have is the sum of the effect of the candidates you place in high-impact projects or organizations (accounting for counterfactuals). Additionally, recruitment can be trained or learned well based on some more general skills (such as self-management and communication skills).

If hiring for a high-impact organization or project, a recruiter can have a significant impact through the cumulative benefits of putting the right people in the right roles. This job requires general skills like project management and communication (more so than a specific formal education) and can be trained or learned on the job. The skills you will build up are transferable to other (potentially high-impact) jobs. Recruiters are in demand and usually paid well.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why I\u2019m writing this:</strong></h2><p>I have 9 years of work experience in executive search (which is recruitment for leadership roles), assessment, training, and employer branding. I also founded <a href=\"https://talist.org\">T\u00e4list</a>, an organization that offers recruitment services for the Alternative Protein industry. With this job profile, I\u2019d like to share my expertise on this profession with the EA community and I'd like to encourage EAs to consider this role as a career path for themselves.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>About the role:</strong></h2><h3><strong>Job titles:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>There are several terms for a recruiter: hiring manager, talent acquisition partner, or simply HR manager. Sometimes recruiting or certain aspects of recruitment are even \u201chidden\u201d in jobs such as community building or outreach. As with every job title, the understanding of it varies and there might be slight differences in the responsibilities and main focus. For this job profile, I will simply use the term \u201crecruiter\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Recruiter is a very common role in both bigger organizations (employers) as well as external service providers (hiring agencies). The core tasks are to find, attract, vet, and manage candidates with the goal of filling certain positions with the best possible talent.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Role variations:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Some recruiters will have to do a lot of active sourcing (reaching out to people for example on LinkedIn or other networks and platforms), whereas other recruiters will get plenty of applications and therefore will focus more on carefully vetting and selecting the best candidates. This difference depends on several factors such as the industry, the complexity of the open positions, or how well-known the employer is. In both cases, a recruiter has to invest a significant amount of time in communicating with tens if not hundreds of candidates in parallel, and find a way to do so systematically, efficiently, and professionally. Therefore time and project management, as well as communications are two crucial general skills a recruiter should have.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Pay and demand:</strong></h3><p>Even though there have been plenty of attempts to automate recruitment, large parts are still done manually. Therefore, there is always a demand for good recruiters who can quickly fill open positions with great candidates. As there is a (growing) talent gap in many non-profit communities as well as in industry, I expect that this demand will not change in the next 5-10 years. Recruiters are also paid well (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/germany-recruiter-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IN96_KO8,17.htm\">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://recruitment.com/process/recruiter-salary\">these</a>&nbsp;for ranges), often combined with a provision model where they directly benefit from placing candidates (although I wouldn\u2019t recommend recruiting as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/earning-to-give-in-a-high-paying-role/\">earning-to-give-career</a>&nbsp;as there are roles that are better suited if you want to optimize for income).</p><h3><strong>Career capital:</strong></h3><p>Recruitment requires a varied set of transferable skills, as well as a high level of resilience (outlined in detail below), that will be respected and valued in many roles at different levels. For example, hiring is a key part of starting a new charity/project as you\u2019ll need to build up the team to execute the idea. Alternatively, you can become a project manager in an impactful charity. Recruitment is similar across organizations, which will mean that you can move around easily for new challenges, both within and outside of EA.</p><p>In short, if you decide to take up a job as a recruiter, you are not going down a very niche route with nowhere else to go. Instead, you\u2019ll build up career capital that is both well-earning and sought after within and outside of the EA community.</p><h3><strong>Relevant past job experience:</strong></h3><p>There are several aspects of being a recruiter, and you might have done things in the past that are transferable to some of these.&nbsp;</p><p>Have you ever successfully done any of the following?</p><ul><li>Researching by using boolean search operators - this is very relevant to finding candidates, for example on LinkedIn\u2019s platform.</li><li>Interviewing people - this is a crucial part of assessing people: &nbsp;asking the right questions to gain relevant screening information.</li><li>Assessing using different tools - assessing candidates with tools such as test tasks/work samples is important when it comes to selecting the best candidate from a pool of applications.&nbsp;</li><li>Managing communication with a lot of different people in parallel - this would be relevant for communicating with tens if not hundreds of candidates per role over the course of several months.</li><li>Convincing people to do something - this would be relevant for convincing people to apply and consider changing their career, but sometimes it is also necessary to convince the hiring manager of a promising candidate.</li><li>Managing several projects in parallel - this would be relevant for the project management aspect of the role, as you are usually trying to fill several roles in parallel (with one role being like one project).</li></ul><h3><strong>What you\u2019ll do day to day:</strong></h3><ul><li>Plan the recruitment process with deadlines, feedback loops, and other similar tasks.</li><li>Write &amp; publish job ads.</li><li>Search for promising candidates on platforms like LinkedIn, and reach out to them to convince them to apply for roles they\u2019d be a good fit for.</li><li>Screen applications - review CVs and Cover Letters, and create candidate shortlists.</li><li>Interview applicants.</li><li>Use other assessment tools to further vet applicants.</li><li>Manage communications with applicants in different stages (e.g. already interviewed, pending, to be rejected, and so on).</li><li>Write reports on applicants to inform and consult on the final decision on whom to offer the job.</li><li>Track metrics, evaluate, and optimize the recruitment process.</li></ul><h3><strong>What is rewarding about this role:</strong></h3><ul><li>If you are a \u201cpeople-person\u201d, this is what you will get money for: getting in touch with people, hearing their (career) stories, communicating &amp; connecting with them.</li><li>Finding the right person can give you a great sense of achievement, and you will (hopefully) have this regularly; a recruitment process usually takes 6 weeks to 3 months and an experienced full-time recruiter can handle 4+/- recruitment processes in parallel.</li><li>Clear feedback loops as recruitment activities are easy to measure.</li><li>High impact: finding the right person for a high-impact project or organization has a lot of impact - and as you will do this regularly, your impact accumulates with every successful placement.</li><li>Steep learning curve - with some general skills recruitment is a job where you start from scratch and can become a professional within 1-2 years (depending on how fast of a learner you are).</li></ul><h3><strong>Role challenges:</strong></h3><ul><li>It can be challenging to get enough applications and/or good applications.</li><li>For certain positions, you will have to do a lot of active sourcing and get the numbers in as well as make sure you have high-quality candidates applying. You will usually get an answer from only a fraction of the people you\u2019ve reached out to (5-25%).</li><li>Good applicants are likely to have multiple roles they\u2019re applying for, and multiple compelling offers to choose from. Sometimes people would like to speed up the process or even pull out of the process at the last stage.</li></ul><h3><strong>What skills and traits will be helpful:</strong></h3><ul><li>Being organized / self and project management skills.</li><li>Communication skills (verbal and written) - you will be speaking with a lot of people; doing this and writing in an efficient, professional manner is crucial for success in this role.</li><li>Proactivity.</li><li>Being a people person will help a lot, but there are certainly very successful introverted recruiters.</li><li>Flexibility, positive outlook &amp; resilience.</li></ul><h3><strong>Education or Training:&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>I believe that certain general skills are usually more important for being a successful recruiter than formal education. This also depends on the kind of roles you are trying to fill or the community/industry you are working in. The more you are hiring for experts (vs. generalists) the more you need some basic expertise in this field yourself. For example, hiring a Senior Scientist usually requires that you have a basic understanding of their tasks, and are familiar with the terms used in this field - in such a case, a B.Sc might be required, or at least a big advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also more and more degrees specialized in Human Resources and courses particularly for recruiting (or aspects of it). Based on my own experience, this kind of education is not mandatory at all. If a candidate otherwise fits the role this lack of formal training can be compensated very quickly. A more important advantage might be work experience and a track record as a recruiter - or with similar tasks (see above). You should also align with the principles and values of the organization you\u2019re hiring for as you will represent them when working with candidates.</p><p>If you have further questions on this career or would like to discuss your fit for this role, feel free to reach out to me: <a href=\"mailto:pia.voltz@talist.org\">pia.voltz@talist.org</a>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "PV"}}, {"_id": "qt7i74TvEzTNLmsof", "title": "The Repugnant Conclusion Isn't", "postedAt": "2022-08-23T08:09:03.583Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p><i>There is nothing bad in each of these lives; but there is little happiness, and little else that is good. The people in Z never suffer; but all they have is muzak and potatoes.</i></p><p><i>- </i>Derek Parfit, <a href=\"https://www.stafforini.com/docs/parfit_-_overpopulation_and_the_quality_of_life.pdf\">Overpopulation and the Quality of Life</a></p></blockquote><p><br>The image of World Z provokes an unsettling cognitive dissonance. It forces us to confront the possibility that any degree of happiness, no matter how magnificent, can be outweighed by arbitrarily small pleasures multiplied across a sufficiently large population. Imagining this kind of mediocrity, we can hardly endorse it over a small yet ecstatic utopia.</p><p>And yet, I feel strongly that this perceived tension is due entirely to a failure of the imagination. When Parfit says \u201cmuzak and potatoes\u201d, perhaps you conjure up the image of a medieval European peasant, covered in mud, living in squalor, only just barely getting by.</p><p>But read again more carefully: <strong>\u201cThere is nothing bad in each of these lives\u201d.</strong></p><p>Although it sounds mundane, I contend that this is nearly incomprehensible. Can you actually imagine what it would be like to never have anything bad happen to you? We don\u2019t describe such a as mediocre, we describe it as \u201ccharmed\u201d or \u201coverwhelmingly privileged\u201d.</p><p>After all, each of our lives are absolutely filled with bad things. Some of these are obvious (injury, illness, the loss of a loved one), but mostly they just exist as a kind of dull background pain we\u2019ve grown to accept. The bad things are, as Simone Weil put it, the \u201ccountless horrors which lie beyond tears\u201d.</p><p>In stark contrast, consider Parfit\u2019s vision of World Z both seriously and literally.</p><p>These are lives with no pain, no loneliness or depression, no loss or fear, no anxiety, no aging, no disease, nor decay. Not ever a single moment of sorrow. These are lives free entirely from every minor ache and cramp, from desire, from jealousy, from greed, and from every other sin that poisons the heart. Free from the million ills that plague and poke at ordinary people.</p><p>It is thus less the world of peasants, and closer to that of subdued paradise. The closest analog we <i>can</i> imagine is perhaps a Buddhist sanctuary, each member so permanently, universally and profoundly enlightened that they no longer experience suffering of any kind.</p><p>And that\u2019s not all! Parfit further tells us that their lives are net positive. And so in addition to never experiencing any unpleasantness of any degree, they also experience simple pleasures. A \u201clittle happiness\u201d, small nearly to the point of nothingness, yet enough to tip the scales. Perhaps the warmth of basking under a beam of sun, the gentle nourishment of simple meals, or just the low-level background satisfaction of a slow Sunday morning.</p><p>Properly construed, that is the world Parfit would have us imagine. Not a mediocre world of \u201cmuzak and potatoes\u201d, but a kind of tranquil nirvana beyond pain. And that is a world I have no problem endorsing.</p>", "user": {"username": "AppliedDivinityStudies"}}, {"_id": "daP8D49DjzLRwdZoD", "title": "The Future of Altruism is Sustainable Technology", "postedAt": "2022-08-23T04:22:39.396Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The Future of Altruism is Sustainable Technology<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Efficiency is not a discrete event; it is an enduring commitment.

The EA community can answer this call.</p><p>Just as there are privacy advocates and environmental advocates, there must be technology security advocates. Members of this community need not be experts themselves. Rather, they must recognize the significance of technologies now and in the future, and advocate for approaches to technology that consider broader security implications.

Questions are narrowed down</h3><p>This format starts with <i>n<sup>l</sup></i> questions, where <i>n</i> is the number of sub-questions per broader query. Each person answers one question. In the second round, every group of <i>n</i> discussants answers a broader inquiry. Then, they elect a representative to share insights on the broader inquiry with (<i>n</i>-1) other representatives who discuss a yet broader question. This repeats until only one, most comprehensive question is discussed by <i>n</i> representatives.</p><p>This settings is most useful when it is relatively clear how a comprehensive query is broken down into sub-questions, how these are broken down, and so on. Further, choosing representatives should be relatively facile, either because of their formal roles or because of the trust in their accurate representation of everyone\u2019s insights.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995471/mirroredImages/YMAhcEnCB4zGFgicr/yzheeeqqfmcq8pcyhiaf.png\"><figcaption>This discussion starts with 27 questions.

Questions are narrowed down from different angles</h3><p>In this set-up, the previous format takes place <i>n</i> times at the same time. The discussions join at the final answer. The final answer is discussed by <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> rather than <i>n</i> people.</p><p>This is optimal for questions that have a clear breakdown trajectory but various perspectives are expected, depending on who is answering. Representative selection should be facile.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995471/mirroredImages/YMAhcEnCB4zGFgicr/rcgbtiqvylmaft7rj7p5.png\"><figcaption>3\u00d727 questions summarize into 3\u00d79 and 3\u00d73 queries.

Questions are broken down</h3><p>A single question is broken down into sub-queries. These sub-queries are further divided. This repeats until a single person can answer all sub-questions of to a broader query.</p><p>This format can help experts engage others in their thinking. More informed individuals should discuss questions earlier, while people relatively unfamiliar with the problematic engage in the latter rounds.</p><p>The number of sub-queries per question can vary. People can choose to refrain from participation at any point, if they consider the discussion too detailed their needs.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995471/mirroredImages/YMAhcEnCB4zGFgicr/hb859xxdehyzjyqkulg8.png\"><figcaption>An expert broke down a question for 3 less senior experts.

Questions are broken down in various ways</h3><p>Similarly as the previous set-up, this one breaks down questions into increasingly further detail.

Both of these issues depend on your specific ethical views more than concern for extinction risks does.&nbsp;</p><p>By desirable future development, I think longtermists usually mean achieving \u2018technological maturity\u2019, defined by Bostrom as \u201cthe attainment of capabilities affording a level of economic productivity and control over nature close to the maximum that could feasibly be achieved\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>I assume that this is considered desirable because it would allow <strong>maximisation of wellbeing</strong> for <strong>the maximum number of consciousnesses</strong>. However, the goal of maximising the number of consciousnesses is only present in non-person affecting total utilitarianism and prioritarianism, and absent in most, if not all, other moral theories. Therefore, prioritising the mitigation of stagnation risks is robust to fewer moral theories than prioritising the mitigation of extinction risks.</p><p>Individuals who primarily believe in moral theories other than non-person affecting total utilitarianism and prioritarianism (which presumably includes the vast majority of people) may then consider the case for mitigating stagnation risks to be weaker than the case for mitigating extinction risks. Therefore, lumping extinction and stagnation risks together as \"existential\" risks may weaken the apparent case for mitigating extinction risks.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussing extinction risks and stagnation risks together as \u201cexistential risks\u201d also leads to a focus on the \u201castronomical waste\u201d argument, since extinction risks and stagnation risks both prevent technological maturity from being achieved. Since technological maturity is an instrumental goal to maximising the number of consciousnesses, which is a terminal goal only desirable under non-person affecting total utilitarianism and prioritarianism, and most people don\u2019t subscribe to these moral theories, use of the term \u201cexistential risk\u201d makes the case for mitigating extinction risks less convincing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative, more pluralistic approach in terms of moral theories to the different possible meanings of \"desirable future development\" &nbsp;doesn't seem feasible to me, since there is probably too much variety on what \"desirable future development\" could mean (but I might explore this idea in more detail in a future post).</p><p><br>Instead, I think EAs should separate discussion of extinction and stagnation risks, with a more pluralistic approach in terms of moral theories on why extinction risks might be prioritised, but with clarity and honesty on why longtermists are <i>more</i> concerned about extinction risks than people with other views, and why longtermists are also concerned about stagnation risks.</p><p><br>EDIT:<br>On further thought, it may be worth dividing out existential risk into <i>extinction </i>risk, <i>collapse</i> risk, <i>flawed realisation</i> risk and <i>plateauing</i> risk, where extinction and collapse risks seem robust to many more moral theories, and plateauing and flawed realisation risks seem robust to far fewer moral theories.</p>", "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "JAhtZXeDhSYCGWyk9", "title": "I'm interviewing Marcus Davis, co-founder of Rethink Priorities \u2014 what should I ask him?", "postedAt": "2022-08-22T17:57:50.476Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This week I'll be interviewing <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusadavis1/\">Marcus Davis</a>, co-founder and co-CEO of Rethink Priorities, which conducts global priorities research, often with an empirical bent.</p>\n<p>What should I ask him?</p>\n<p>You can learn more about Rethink Priorities by checking out this <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nLaEqoarrjZrtDKd6/marcus-davis-rethink-priorities-empirical-research-on\">talk given by Marcus himself</a>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can see a list of all their published research <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/research\">here</a>.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Robert_Wiblin"}}, {"_id": "kmZmEdiyCi2kDkuCt", "title": "Announcing a new introduction to effective altruism", "postedAt": "2022-08-23T07:59:53.831Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We\u2019ve released \"a new intro essay for a general audience: \"<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism\"><u>What is effective altruism?</u></a>\"</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/g9gj6AtesiTMwNETi/some-updates-in-ea-communications\"><u>An earlier post</u></a> shared the essay and mentioned that there were still some changes to make.

The intended parents are often people who cannot carry their own child, either for medical reasons or in the case of gay male couples. Surrogacy is controversial, and many countries have banned or restricted it while a few have created laws to protect and enforce surrogacy arrangements. Still others have passed no laws, which can create legal uncertainty surrounding the enforceability of a surrogacy contract, the rights of the surrogate and the intended parents, and the parentage and citizenship rights of the child. Surrogacy has been banned throughout much of Europe. While it can be safely and legally practiced in parts of the United States, the cost can be well over $100,000. Accordingly, many intended parents have looked to lower-income countries in Eastern Europe, Central and South America, Asia, and Africa for more affordable surrogacy options. For a while, India was a major surrogacy center, offering a complete surrogacy process for less than $25,000.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref518yqjigdip\"><sup><a href=\"#fn518yqjigdip\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, India banned commercial surrogacy in 2015. Afterward, it was briefly popular in Nepal, Cambodia, and Thailand, but each of those countries banned the practice soon after. Now, the practice appears to be moving to African countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana, which have thus far left surrogacy unregulated. A brief survey of surrogacy cost estimates online suggests that surrogacy companies are not yet recommending these countries, but rather are currently recommending surrogacy in countries including the United States, Ukraine, Georgia, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and Greece, for prices ranging from $30,000 to $200,000, though for gay couples the cheapest option appears to over $60,000, as cheaper countries such as Ukraine and Georgia offer surrogacy to heterosexual couples only.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzr2utvdjt3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzr2utvdjt3\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Accordingly, if surrogacy emerges as an established industry in the developing world, it could make surrogacy available as an economic opportunity to millions of women while drastically lowering the price of surrogacy for intended parents and thereby providing a financially feasible way for millions of individuals and couples to have children.</p><h3><strong><u>Importance</u></strong></h3><p><strong><u>Extraordinary Economic Opportunity for Surrogate Women</u></strong></p><p>When surrogacy is available to impoverished women living in low-income countries, it can be a life-changing economic opportunity. To provide two examples, consider India and Cambodia. Ethnographer Amrita Pande closely studied the surrogacy industry in India, both before and after the ban, using a particular clinic as a case study.&nbsp; She observed that with a single pregnancy, an Indian surrogate could earn almost five years of the median income for an entire family.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9p9oez0xlzf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9p9oez0xlzf\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Most women, she found, were poor and engaged in surrogacy out of financial desperation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4dcjuyy19wl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4dcjuyy19wl\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;She met several women who used the money to buy or build houses, and numerous women who were repeat surrogates.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbzdn45ypv17\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbzdn45ypv17\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Similarly, when surrogacy was practiced in Cambodia before it was banned, a woman could earn about $10,000 through a pregnancy, more than six times the average annual salary.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref21eax885cpu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn21eax885cpu\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I traveled to Cambodia to study surrogacy in 2019, and learned that most surrogates had been garment factory workers who worked long hours for less than $200 per month and whose families were burdened with crippling debt that they had little hope of paying off, and that could be passed on to future generations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4876405onne\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4876405onne\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A single surrogacy pregnancy could lift a family out of debt entirely. Although the idea of legalizing surrogacy was very unpopular at the time of my trip, every person I spoke to \u2013 academics, nonprofit workers, and government officials, among others \u2013 agreed that Cambodian women who were fully informed of the risks would widely choose to become surrogates if given and made aware of the opportunity, because the economic benefits would be so attractive even if the industry were unregulated and likely to neglect their rights.&nbsp; A regulated industry required to meet certain minimum standards to protect the autonomy, health and welfare of surrogates would be even more attractive.</p><p>India\u2019s surrogacy market was estimated to be worth over $3 billion and involved over 3,000 surrogacy clinics.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq8y64algym\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq8y64algym\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The current global market is expected to grow by almost a third in the next five years.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref50qy5lrqfbp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn50qy5lrqfbp\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Accordingly, the scale of the economic opportunity that could potentially be opened up to impoverished women and their communities is huge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Spillover Benefits to Surrogates\u2019 Communities and Countries</u></strong></p><p>The essence of this proposal is that legalizing surrogacy in developing countries would open the doors to a large flow of money from wealthy individuals to poor ones, to everyone\u2019s benefit.&nbsp; Beyond the impact on individuals, this would amount to a flow of money into poor communities and countries.&nbsp; This influx of capital would stimulate local economies and have spillover effects that would benefit those communities and the countries as a whole.</p><p><strong><u>Enabling People To Create Families &amp; Promoting LGTBQ Rights</u></strong></p><p>Further, encouraging legalized international surrogacy, particular in very low-income countries, would make it affordable for millions of individuals and couples to have children who would otherwise be unable to do so. This would be a victory for LGBTQ+ rights, as it would enable gay men, as well as other couples where neither partner is able to carry a child, to have children. While some of these people may be able to have children through adoption, adoption can be very difficult and some people feel a strong desire to have children biologically related to them.</p><p><strong><u>A Pivotal Moment to Influence Development of International Surrogacy Industry</u></strong></p><p>The importance of this issue may be especially large now, when the industry is rapidly responding to emerging surrogacy restrictions, and countries are deciding how to respond in turn. A well-timed intervention that helps a country establish a safe but affordable surrogacy market could set an example for the rest of the world to follow. A campaign that promotes the narrative of surrogacy as a beneficial way for women to exercise their reproductive and economic autonomy could determine whether the practice is widely accepted or widely rejected.</p><p>On the other hand, if unregulated surrogacy industries create the image of surrogacy as an exploitative and dangerous practice, it may end up being widely banned for the indefinite future, depriving millions of would-be surrogates and millions of would-be parents of the benefits.&nbsp;This appears to be the direction the surrogacy industry is taking, with most countries that choose to address surrogacy severely restricting it rather than establishing a regulatory framework that would protect women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights while still allowing the industry to thrive.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Preventing Growth of Dangerous, Illicit Surrogacy Industry</u></strong></p><p>Finally, promoting a regulated surrogacy industry could protect women, children, and parents by offering a safe alternative to black market surrogacy, where surrogacy is simply practiced illegally, and \u201cgray market\u201d surrogacy, where elaborate measures are taken to dodge restrictive surrogacy laws, such as by recruiting surrogate women in one country to be impregnated in another.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvy4rg57d149\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvy4rg57d149\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; While a legal market can be regulated to promote informed consent, adequate health care for surrogates, background checks for intended parents, and other rights-protective measures, an illicit market or a market built around evading regulation would leave all parties vulnerable to exploitation.&nbsp; And women are far safer acting as surrogates in their own communities than traveling to other, unfamiliar countries where they may be entirely dependent on surrogacy companies for their health and safety. .&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Neglectedness</u></strong></h3><p>Various commentators including academics, journalists, and intergovernmental organizations have raised the concern that an outright ban on surrogacy would only harm the women they aim to protect by depriving them of economic opportunity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2fpqbwrasp4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2fpqbwrasp4\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Other groups have raised concerns about the risks created by surrogacy bans that push the industry underground, or to increasingly risky locations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqfuc09prjl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqfuc09prjl\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Further, many have criticized the idea that surrogacy be limited to \u201caltruistic,\u201d meaning uncompensated, surrogacy, as this merely devalues the labor of the women in the name of protecting them from \u201ccommodification.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxiuqx9hsick\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxiuqx9hsick\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Accordingly, the view that surrogacy should be available as an economic opportunity is not, in itself, a neglected idea.</p><p>However, the attention appears to be largely passive.&nbsp;I have not seen any activists or policy groups, or any other organizations, making any concerted effort to actually influence policy and promote the legalization of surrogacy for the women who stand to benefit most from it. Open Philanthropy could fill that gap by funding a policy campaign promoting legalization of surrogacy paired with regulations that would facilitate a safe industry protective of the rights of women and children. While commentators have suggested that such a legal framework would be best, none seem to have actually pushed to create that framework or made concrete legislative proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, some of the attention given to surrogacy takes the form of alarmist narratives that promote surrogacy bans, thereby restricting the economic and reproductive freedom of women who stand to benefit from becoming surrogates. For instance, surrogacy is often misframed as a woman birthing her own child and then selling it to the intended parents, who are not the child\u2019s parents until the sale occurs. This framing has led some commentators to seek bans on surrogacy as a form of child trafficking. When Cambodia banned surrogacy, it went as far as imprisoning surrogate women and convicting them of human trafficking.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiovma34no2s\"><sup><a href=\"#fniovma34no2s\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In 2018, a UN Special Rapporteur issued a report concluding that surrogacy amounted to unlawful sale of children unless the surrogate is free to receive her payment <i>and&nbsp;</i>keep the child, because if payment were contingent on transfer of the child, it would be a sale.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpa0o1wvcabr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpa0o1wvcabr\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Properly understood, however, a surrogacy arrangement is premised on a mutual agreement that the intended parents are the child\u2019s parents from conception, and the surrogate is offering to provide the service of carrying the child to term, but is not considered a parent.&nbsp; In this view, compensating the surrogate amounts to payment for a service rather than the sale of a child, it is clear to all parties who the child belongs to, and the surrogate is not being asked to abandon her child or invited to make a claim to the child. Some commentators have argued that acknowledging a surrogate\u2019s claim to the child is a way to empower surrogate women, but in reality this only promotes the narrative that surrogates are giving up their own children for money, which increases the stigma faced by surrogates. It also promotes confusion by allowing for overlapping claims to the child, a situation harmful to all parties involved.&nbsp; Other commentators have raised concerns about the \u201ccommodification\u201d of women, or that it risks exploitative practices and should therefore be banned. However, neither of these arguments is a satisfying justification for depriving fully informed women of the choice to pursue an economic opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>A thoughtful, organized policy campaign could push back on harmful narratives such as these and shape the way surrogacy is understood in order to promote legalization, reduce stigma, and address the legitimate concerns raised by the surrogacy industry while still enabling women and intended parents to benefit from the opportunities surrogacy offers.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Tractability</u></strong></h3><p>Since this proposal relies on influencing government policies, the tractability is uncertain. However, there are several reasons to believe this issue is tractable.</p><p>Many voices have individually suggested that surrogacy bans deprive women of opportunity and restrict their reproductive freedoms.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmxjpf5jqvuq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmxjpf5jqvuq\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Surrogacy bans also restrict the options for gay men seeking to have children, such that the LGBTQ+ rights movement is likely to be an ally in the cause of legalization. Accordingly, there is preexisting support for legalization that simply needs to be organized and channeled. Open Philanthropy could take on that role, organizing a policy movement in favor of legalization. It could elevate the voices of affected women who may not have platforms to express their views, determine the most promising pathways to establishing favorable surrogacy frameworks in countries where women are likely to benefit the most from it, and provide expertise and concrete proposals to make the pathway to legalization easy for governments open to the possibility. Such concrete proposals could include a proposed system for regulating surrogacy clinics and brokers to ensure they are not exploiting women, such as an independent regulatory body that would certify organizations that meet certain standards. Open Philanthropy could propose bilateral or multilateral agreements between nations to regulate the industry, or devise ways to do so through the private sector. It could focus on attempting to legalize surrogacy in India, where surrogacy existed successfully in the past and where women have already criticized the ban, or it could focus on countries that have not yet passed any regulation and may need to address an emerging surrogacy industry soon. In short, there appear to be many options for seeking to influence policy, but no one leading any strategic effort to do so.</p><h3><strong><u>Counterarguments &amp; Responses</u></strong></h3><p><strong><u>Controversiality</u></strong></p><p>Surrogacy is highly controversial, and Open Philanthropy may not consider it worth the risk of getting involved in something so contentious, which some people view as inherently immoral or exploitative.&nbsp;However, the controversial and emotional nature of the subject might mean that Open Philanthropy would be well-suited to provide an unbiased, welfare-focused view of the issue.</p><p><strong><u>Child Welfare Concerns</u></strong></p><p>Some commentators have expressed the concern that the surrogacy industry, especially a transnational surrogacy industry, could create an opportunity for child trafficking.&nbsp; It is not clear to me exactly why this would be the case, especially when compared to other ways that people obtain children, whether through birth, adoption, or currently legal forms of surrogacy.&nbsp; However, I am no expert on child trafficking, and these concerns should be carefully assessed before taking any decisive action to expand transnational surrogacy.</p><p>In addition, there have been issues in the past with obtaining the appropriate citizenship and parentage rights for children born through surrogacy.&nbsp; In most cases, the child is ultimately permitted to stay with the intended parents, because most governments are attentive to the best interests of the child even if surrogacy does not technically fit into its legal framework for parentage and citizenship.&nbsp; However, in at least one case in Italy, where the child had no biological connection to the intended parents, the child was taken from the intended parents and put up for adoption.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftwp0gu6pj5j\"><sup><a href=\"#fntwp0gu6pj5j\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;To the extent that many developed countries continue to prohibit surrogacy, this creates a risk that children will be left orphaned or will be unable to legal enter the country of their parents.&nbsp; Ideally, a well-regulated surrogacy industry will only allow surrogacy arrangements to go forward if the parent-child relationship would be acknowledged by all relevant countries.&nbsp; While this might limit transnational surrogacy at first, more countries would hopefully choose to accept the parental rights of intended parents over time.</p><p><strong><u>Exploitation of Women</u></strong></p><p>Surrogacy arrangements generally, and transnational surrogacy arrangements in particular,&nbsp; are usually characterized by a power imbalance between relatively wealthy intended parents and less wealthy surrogate women.&nbsp; In the past, transnational surrogacy has often prioritized the rights and interests of intended parents and placed little emphasis on those of the surrogates. In India, it is well documented that many surrogates were given little to no information about the medical processes involved in surrogacy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref97zpoe807pq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn97zpoe807pq\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Medical care is often inadequate, especially if any complications arise,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5yj06plkwr8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5yj06plkwr8\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and unfavorable contract terms might make it effectively impossible for surrogates to change their mind about going through with surrogacy once they sign the contract.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpcn3fjpikse\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpcn3fjpikse\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Surrogacy contracts often limit a surrogate\u2019s rights to make any medical decisions,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd5he2rfgkdi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd5he2rfgkdi\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and in some cases surrogates were not permitted to keep a copy of their contracts.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxya85n0qcer\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxya85n0qcer\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; In short, it is true that the transnational surrogacy industry has exploited surrogate women in the past.</p><p>However, as discussed above, restricting the freedom of women who wish to become surrogates is not an effective way to protect them from exploitation.&nbsp; First, this is because women who become surrogates are not vulnerable to exploitation because of surrogacy specifically, but rather because of their socioeconomic status.&nbsp;For the same reasons that they might willingly agree to become surrogates in an industry that does not protect their rights, other economic opportunities available to them, such as work in garment factories, is likely to be similarly exploitative.&nbsp; This exploitation may not be just, but taking away a specific opportunity does not protect women from exploitation so much as force them to choose an even less desirable form of exploitation.</p><p>Moreover, exploitation can be addressed through regulations aimed at protecting the rights of surrogates without depriving them of the economic opportunity of surrogacy.&nbsp; For instance, regulations can require that surrogates receive a copy of their contracts in their native language, receive adequate medical care, retain the power to make their own medical decisions, and receive protection in the case of complications that could pose medical or financial risks.&nbsp;While protections are unlikely to be perfect given the power dynamics at play, regulations could still improve the situation greatly while still allowing surrogates to reap the enormous economic benefits of surrogacy, which many women have chosen in the past even with full knowledge of the risks it posed to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn518yqjigdip\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref518yqjigdip\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Alison Bailey, <i>Reconceiving Surrogacy: Toward a Reproductive Account of Indian Surrogacy</i>, at 4, available at <a href=\"https://ir.library.illinoisstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=fpphil\">https://ir.library.illinoisstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=fpphil</a>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnzr2utvdjt3\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefzr2utvdjt3\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><i>See, e.g.</i>, William Houghton, <i>The Average</i> <i>Cost of Surrogacy</i>, available at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sensiblesurrogacy.com/surrogacy-costs/\">https://www.sensiblesurrogacy.com/surrogacy-costs/</a>;

We now have a unified <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook\"><u>Effective Altruism Handbook</u></a> (the fourth edition), which we will use as our suggested introductory fellowship curriculum for <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/virtual-programs\"><u>virtual programs</u></a> and EA groups.</p><p>We are excited about the improvements that have been made, and think that this version will provide a better experience for people new to EA ideas and principles. But it\u2019s still not perfect, and we\u2019re eager to hear your input and feedback in order to help us to improve it.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook\"><u>Here</u></a> is the updated version.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Major Changes</h2><p>The main changes we made were:</p><ol><li><strong>To focus more on core EA concepts and thinking tools:</strong> We added reasoning on these topics, and also highlighted these tools in the introduction to each chapter, because we think that core concepts and thinking tools are the most important thing we want to leave people with as we introduce them to EA. We still do have a lot of content on specific cause areas, but it is relatively de-emphasized.</li><li><strong>To update readings with content published in the last two years</strong></li></ol><p>Additionally, we:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>rearranged the sections on longtermism and X-risk;</li><li>added criticism sections to each session in the \u2018More to Explore\u2019 posts;</li><li>turned section 7 into an opportunity for people to reflect on specific uncertainties and concerns about EA ideas and practices;</li><li>made section 8 more clearly focused on next steps (by shifting some reflection back to week 7);</li><li>expanded the introduction to give more context on goals;</li><li>updated the UX/UI and added the handbook to the forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Process</h2><p>Max Dalton and Lizka Vaintrob did an initial review of the old curriculum, made quick changes, got feedback from group organizers and EA Virtual Program facilitators and integrated these comments.</p><p>After this, we shared the updated handbook with about 15 stakeholders in the EA community (including people from all major cause areas, and critics of previous editions of the handbook). Max Dalton and Jesse Rothman integrated their comments into the updated handbook. We then posted the handbook on the forum in order to improve the UX/UI, and integrated the handbook into broader EA conversations on the Forum.</p><p>We then did another set of user interviews with experienced facilitators and continued to make edits to the handbook based on their input.&nbsp;</p><h2>Our approach to cause area selection</h2><p>Our primary goal with this version of the handbook was to share certain core principles or tools of EA (things like \u201cmaking tradeoffs\u201d, \u201ctruth seeking\u201d, \u201cscope sensitivity\u201d). These concepts are now highlighted in the curriculum. I am personally excited to share and focus on these ideas, and CEA as an organization is focused on sharing these principles and helping people to work through their implications (rather than on promoting any particular cause area).</p><p>However, we also wanted to share the arguments for some of the key things that people in effective altruism are working on, and give examples of that work - we think that this is important because it\u2019s a lot of what the community is about, and it also makes the introduction much more concrete (rather than being really philosophy-heavy, which we think would not give a good sense of what most people in effective altruism work on).</p><p>When talking about specific areas, our core goal was to share the arguments for some of the main areas, highlight that there are other areas that one could work on, make clear that there is disagreement in the community about what the right split between areas is, and encourage people to make up their own mind (which is the focus of the seventh chapter).</p><p>In terms of process, we emphasize in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XKfnWebzJsdxecBDw/about-this-handbook\"><u>our introduction</u></a> that we had to make these judgement calls and others would likely disagree with the calls we\u2019ve made. We also consulted experts from all corners of the community, including previous critics of the curriculum and several people who focus on global health and wellbeing. Feedback from these groups was generally positive.</p><p>The overall split of the content is (very) roughly 50% on core principles, 30% on longtermism/x-risk, 10% on animal welfare, and 10% on global health and wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>When deciding on this split we balanced a few different factors:</p><ul><li>Main thing: wanting to give a high-quality explanation of each area. (This pushes somewhat to giving more space to harder-to-explain areas like AI relative to bednets.)</li><li>Wanting to be roughly representative of the views of people who have been involved in EA for a long while (placing some weight on \u201cEA founders\u201d, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DoAWvhgEnhSMr6yjS/new-data-suggests-the-leaders-priorities-represent-the-core\"><u>highly engaged community members</u></a>, and cause prioritization experts, and not too much weight on the full sample of people who filled out the EA survey).<ul><li>My current impression from rough research is that all of these groups currently would on average assign &gt;60% of EA\u2019s future resources to longtermist-related causes, though of course there is much disagreement.</li></ul></li><li>Not wanting to emphasize any one area so much that people could \u201cread the room\u201d, and think \u201cOK, they\u2019re not saying it, but I\u2019m meant to believe X\u201d.<ul><li>While the pure split still leans relatively longtermist (influenced by the other points) and risks this happening, we tried to mitigate this by having the 7th chapter be focused on encouraging people to develop their own views, by providing criticism for each cause area, and by trying to present a variety of framings in the final \u201cwhat to do\u201d chapter.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall the split that we decided on is roughly in line with the average views of the most engaged community members. I think that people will disagree about both the correct split and the correct process for deciding on the split, but ultimately we could only include so many articles and had to make a call.</p><h2>Going Forward and Feedback</h2><p>We are excited about the new version of the EA Handbook and think there are a bunch of ways it represents improvements from the previous one. Still, it\u2019s clear that this is not the perfect version and we intend to continue to make edits and improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>Going forward, we intend to make small (and occasionally larger) revisions to the program based on (1) feedback from facilitators and participants running online and in-person sessions; (2) feedback from EA stakeholders; and (3) CEA staff judgement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We are very eager for your feedback on the content, design, and usability of this new version.

I used Effective Altruism as a case study: I argued that EA could do more good by having more intentional aesthetics.

I considered submitting my essay, since it was published within the contest\u2019s acceptance period. However, I hadn\u2019t meant it to be a formal critique of Effective Altruism.

What exactly is beauty?</h2><p>Beauty is a complex concept. The main difficulty in defining beauty is that it is <i>incredibly general</i>. All of the following are routinely described as beautiful (or ugly): people, food, houses, clothes, illustrations, abstract shapes, landscapes, astronomical phenomena, animals, plants, stories, sounds, mathematical concepts, personalities, theories, color combinations, body parts, machines, behaviors, scenes. A good concept of beauty must apply to everything in this list and more.</p><p>My current best encapsulation is that <strong>beauty is a mechanism to pay attention to whatever is good</strong>. \u201cWhatever is good\u201d is still incredibly general, but that\u2019s a feature, not a bug: it simply refers to everything that a person wants or needs, consciously or not, at any given moment.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:49.94%\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F778255bb-1824-438b-a82c-f3465b702fe1_3024x4032.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F778255bb-1824-438b-a82c-f3465b702fe1_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F778255bb-1824-438b-a82c-f3465b702fe1_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F778255bb-1824-438b-a82c-f3465b702fe1_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F778255bb-1824-438b-a82c-f3465b702fe1_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w\"><figcaption>For instance, if you\u2019re hungry, then you\u2019re likely to find something beautiful if it seems edible. The same food item may not look particularly beautiful if you\u2019re full or if you have dietary restrictions against it \u2014 it may even disgust you and cause you to think it\u2019s ugly. But most of the time, food is good, hence beautiful. (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ChC1BPOuZIS/\"><u>Photo by Greigori</u></a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>1.1) Does that mean that beauty is subjective?</h3><p>Yes and no. The definition above does imply that <strong>beauty is not fully \u201cobjective\u201d</strong> and <a href=\"https://interintellect.com/beauty-and-the-brain/\">should not be seen as a property of objects</a>. Instead it is a property of the <i>relation</i> between you and an object. We could call that \u201csubjective,\u201d but that\u2019s also an unsatisfactory term. Many things are almost universally good (among humans or sentient life) and therefore can be described as objectively beautiful.</p><p>A good example is <strong>novelty</strong>: it\u2019s almost always useful to obtain new information, so we\u2019re likely to perceive things we haven\u2019t seen before as beautiful, unless they also have undesirable characteristics. And once the novelty wears off, and there\u2019s no new information to be gained, we may stop perceiving beauty, unless the thing has other desirable characteristics.</p><h3>1.2) Why does the ability to perceive beauty exist at all?</h3><p>It seems plausible that our bodies evolved the perception of beauty as a way to pay attention to things like new information, unusual patterns, healthy mates, unspoiled food, dangerous predators, and so on. There are many \u201csubspecies\u201d of beauty, <a href=\"https://etiennefd.substack.com/p/a-taxonomy-of-beauty\">like cuteness, sexiness, and elegance</a>, all emphasizing different ways things can be good.</p><p>It\u2019s important to realize that <strong>this is not a fully conscious process</strong>. We often don\u2019t immediately know why something feels beautiful, unless we take time to think about it.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/07/why-does-beauty-exist/\">This article from Wired</a> contains some of the best encapsulations of beauty that I\u2019ve come across, describing it as \u201ca particularly potent and intense form of curiosity\u201d and \u201ca motivational force that helps modulate conscious awareness.\u201d <a href=\"https://meltingasphalt.com/a-natural-history-of-beauty/\">This essay by Kevin Simler</a> is another great exploration of beauty as an evolutionary positive-sum game between, for instance, flowers and pollinators, or among humans.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:40.89%\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3fe8978-5bd1-407b-83df-cbbb6dc3cc07_512x512.png\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3fe8978-5bd1-407b-83df-cbbb6dc3cc07_512x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3fe8978-5bd1-407b-83df-cbbb6dc3cc07_512x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3fe8978-5bd1-407b-83df-cbbb6dc3cc07_512x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3fe8978-5bd1-407b-83df-cbbb6dc3cc07_512x512.png 1456w\"><figcaption>There\u2019s also good stuff in David Deutsch\u2019s chapter \u201c<a href=\"https://publicism.info/science/infinity/15.html\"><u>Why are flowers beautiful?</u></a>\u201d, although I don\u2019t quite agree with everything he says. Art generated on Stable Diffusion.</figcaption></figure><h3>1.3) You use the word <i>aesthetics</i> a lot. What is it?</h3><p>\u201cAesthetics\u201d is a fairly vague term that can refer to the philosophical study of beauty, or to abstract concepts like \u201cstyle\u201d or \u201cculture.\u201d In this essay I\u2019ll use the word to mean, roughly, <strong>a</strong> <strong>deliberate effort at using beauty to maintain a coherent and recognizable style</strong>.</p><p>The word \u201cdeliberate\u201d is important: it distinguishes my definition from the sense in which everything can be said to have an aesthetic just by virtue of existing, even if there\u2019s no conscious attempt at maintaining it. A house in which no one put any effort at decoration doesn\u2019t have an aesthetic in the definition used here.</p><p>Aesthetics, therefore, are a way to inject some awareness into the mostly unaware mechanisms of beauty.</p><h2>2) All right. So. Why should we care about aesthetics?</h2><p>The main reason to care about aesthetics is that beauty is a major source of moral intuitions. Moreover, with three caveats that I\u2019ll get to in a moment, <strong>it is a particularly robust source of moral intuitions because it is never fully wrong</strong>.</p><p>Recall that beauty is an extremely general mechanism to pay attention to good things. Therefore, when you perceive something as beautiful, it is <i>always</i> because there is some good to be obtained from that thing, whether that\u2019s satisfying a basic biological need like eating or mating, or something far more abstract such as novel information or a vague and pleasant feeling of familiarity.</p><p>Beauty is not a perfect moral signal, but it <i>is</i> a strong one, with the potential to play a large role in ethical decisions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to pay attention.</p><h3>2.1) Okay, what about the caveats?</h3><p>The first and most important caveat is that <strong>we always have diverse and contradictory needs and desires</strong>. Often two things are both \u201cgood\u201d and simultaneously in flat contradiction with each other. So while beauty is never wrong about identifying goodness, it may very well point towards a kind of good that we\u2019d deem less important than another good.</p><p>The second caveat is that <strong>good is pretty much always mixed with bad</strong>. You may get a valid aesthetic reaction to something because it is good in some sense, but that may also hide valid reasons to dislike it. (And vice-versa: you may get an ugliness or disgust reaction that hides something good.)</p><p>The third caveat is that <strong>there\u2019s no guarantee that goodness can be perceived and therefore cause beauty</strong>. Beauty always points to something good (and ugliness always points to something bad), but the converse is not true: something good isn\u2019t necessarily beautiful (and something bad isn\u2019t necessarily ugly).</p><p>For example, imagine a beautiful painting, for sale at $200. My aesthetic appreciation may incentivize me to spend the money to buy it. But there are many other ways to spend $200, not all of which elicit the same aesthetic reaction. I could donate to a bland but effective charity that I consider to be better even though it sends a weaker aesthetic signal.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:47.97%\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7fe1d6c-cfb6-481f-afcd-2330f81570fb_1184x899.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7fe1d6c-cfb6-481f-afcd-2330f81570fb_1184x899.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7fe1d6c-cfb6-481f-afcd-2330f81570fb_1184x899.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7fe1d6c-cfb6-481f-afcd-2330f81570fb_1184x899.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7fe1d6c-cfb6-481f-afcd-2330f81570fb_1184x899.jpeg 1456w\"><figcaption>We can even imagine that the painting was made by someone evil. If you don\u2019t know that this painting was made by Adolf Hitler, you may be attracted to it. Once you know, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll find it less beautiful. I personally find it genuinely ugly at this point.</figcaption></figure><h3>2.2) These sound like important caveats. Shouldn\u2019t we just reject aesthetics as a source of moral intuition, then?</h3><p>Well, you can try. I would argue that you are almost guaranteed to fail, and will make matters worse in the process.</p><p><strong>Aesthetics are not optional</strong>. We are always sensitive to beauty, whether we like it or not. This would perhaps not matter too much if humans couldn\u2019t manipulate aesthetics to achieve our goals, but we obviously can. There are people \u2014 in increasing order of negative connotation: artists, marketers, and propagandists \u2014 whose job it is to use beauty in order to influence others. It\u2019s impossible to avoid such influence entirely, but you can resist it to some extent by being aware of it.</p><p>Furthermore, morality \u2014 the rules of what is good and bad \u2014 is an extremely difficult topic, as I\u2019m sure most effective altruists are aware. All theories of ethics run into problems sooner or later, and it seems almost impossible to construct a moral framework that completely avoids repugnant conclusions. (Note that \u201crepugnant\u201d is an aesthetically loaded term!) If aesthetics provides a major and robust source of moral intuition,<strong> it would be counterproductive to reject it</strong> just because it is an imprecise and not-fully-conscious mechanism.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:39.4%\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83fec3ec-fe43-4622-8ab6-1df26856fec5_512x512.png\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83fec3ec-fe43-4622-8ab6-1df26856fec5_512x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83fec3ec-fe43-4622-8ab6-1df26856fec5_512x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83fec3ec-fe43-4622-8ab6-1df26856fec5_512x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83fec3ec-fe43-4622-8ab6-1df26856fec5_512x512.png 1456w\"><figcaption>\u201cA billion people whose lives are barely worth living,\u201d generated by Stable Diffusion</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, the semi-conscious nature of aesthetics is perhaps its most important property. Careful, rational, conscious analysis is an important tool to deal with moral matters, but it can only go so far. We never have complete information. We never fully know what we sacrifice in a tradeoff. As I wrote in an essay titled <a href=\"https://etiennefd.substack.com/p/effective-ish-altruism\">Effective-ish Altruism</a>, \u201cyour list of things to optimize is never going to completely match the list of things you care about.\u201d</p><p>Beauty happens partially outside our awareness, so <strong>it can \u201ccatch\u201d things that rational analysis misses.</strong> It is not, as the caveats show, a perfect and complete signal, but it is an alternative one, one that can\u2019t be deactivated or put under full conscious control. It is a precious tool in understanding what matters. If you spend some time finding an optimal solution to a problem, and despite all your efforts at optimization, you have an uneasy feeling in your gut, it may be a mistake to ignore that feeling.</p><p>Put differently, caring about aesthetics is a way to be <strong>epistemically humble</strong>. You can never be totally sure that you know what\u2019s best, so you should hedge your bets. You should use alternative methods to figure out morality, and aesthetics are one such alternative \u2014 perhaps the best next to rational thought.</p><h2>3) I can sort of guess at this point, but let\u2019s spell it out: What does this all have to do with Effective Altruism?</h2><p>The core principle of Effective Altruism is to <i>do good better</i>. \u201cBetter\u201d here tends to mean \u201cby carefully analyzing the impact of donations and careers in order to maximize good.\u201d This stands in stark contrast with the more usual ways to make donations and pick a career, which rely on intuition and don\u2019t seek to calculate precisely how much good they cause.</p><p>One can view EA as an attempt to deal with caveat #3 above. Many things are good but not particularly aesthetically attractive, such as donating malaria nets to African countries, or dealing with AI risk. So \u2014 goes the typical EA argument \u2014 we should <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Feeling-Moral\">reject our moral intuitions</a>, aesthetic or otherwise, and coldly calculate the benefits of various choices in order to pick the most effective ones.</p><h3>3.1) Then you\u2019re about to say that that\u2019s wrong?</h3><p>Nope! I believe there\u2019s immense value in this core principle. It\u2019s not a coincidence that EA is now getting interest and funding from an increasing number of people: it really is, fundamentally, a good idea. Coldly calculating impacts is not done nearly enough. We <i>do</i> need to use reason and facts to do good. We cannot rely only on intuition.</p><p>Evidently, however, many people have problems with that. Erik Hoel says <a href=\"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-an-effective-altruist\">it contains a poison that must be diluted</a>. Kerry Vaughan finds it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KerryLVaughan/status/1545060355432337409?s=20&amp;t=11gjm1DsqAR9P7Mwgt40Sw\">dehumanizing</a>. The authors of this <a href=\"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/ineffective-altruism?s=r\">Reboot essay</a> are \u201cscared\u201d and argue for <i>ineffective</i> altruism. <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/religion/why-effective-altruism-is-not-effective/13310708#:~:text=Not%20good%20enough,us%20in%20an%20inferior%20equilibrium.\">Multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/against-effective-altruism\">philosophers</a> <a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/catalog/uuid:61cb62d7-13d2-49b8-a6c0-a1bf63c2ecda/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&amp;safe_filename=Jeff+McMahan,+Philosophical+critiques+of+effective+altruism.pdf\">have</a> written variations on the theme \u201cagainst EA.\u201d</p><p>I myself have been reluctant to identify as part of EA. The reasons have never been perfectly clear, but <a href=\"https://classicalfuturist.substack.com/p/guided-by-the-beauty-of-ones-philosophies\">I have been suspecting</a> that they are related to aesthetics. I further suspect that a good chunk of other people\u2019s objections could be solved if EA were more aesthetically appealing.</p><p>As the movement becomes more widely known (and perhaps will, sometime soon, finally overtake Electronics Arts as the main meaning of the acronym \u201cEA\u201d!), the number of people who have an uneasy feeling in their gut is bound to increase greatly. The easy path for effective altruists would be to dismiss this concern: those people have simply not done the cold impact calculations. That would be a mistake. The uneasy feeling points to something real, and carries important information. <strong>The epistemically humble position \u2014 which is the difficult one \u2014 is to take it seriously</strong>.</p><h3>3.2) What, then, is your main criticism of Effective Altruism, stated clearly?</h3><p>To make everything as transparent as possible, let\u2019s summarize everything so far in point form. The first premise is:</p><ul><li>EA tries to maximize good.</li><li>Most people who try to \u201cmaximize\u201d anything do so through careful, rational analysis.</li><li>But careful, rational analysis is never perfect, especially in the realm of morality. Effective altruists know this, and generally seek to be epistemically humble.</li></ul><p>The second premise is:</p><ul><li>Beauty is an imperfect but powerful signal of good.</li><li>It works semi-consciously, which allows it to capture things that rational analysis misses.</li></ul><p>Therefore:</p><ul><li><strong>To achieve epistemic humility about moral matters, effective altruists should take aesthetics seriously.</strong></li><li><strong>This includes investing some time in resources into EA\u2019s own aesthetics </strong>(how it presents itself to the world)<strong> as well as taking into account the aesthetics of movements and organizations it interacts with </strong>(i.e. the aesthetics of potential causes to support should be considered in addition to their more legible characteristics).</li></ul><p>And yet:</p><ul><li>EA does very little of that. It doesn\u2019t do <i>nothing</i> \u2014 there is some amount of art, storytelling, design, etc. in the community \u2014 but it cares or appears to care about aesthetics far less than many other movements as well as for-profit companies.</li><li>As EA grows, the lack of aesthetics will prove a significant hurdle. It will empower opponents, weaken EA\u2019s effectiveness, and make it lose influence compared to other movements.</li></ul><p>To conclude:</p><ul><li><strong>It is now time for EA to make a real effort at aesthetics without reneging on its core principles.</strong></li></ul><h2>4) Great! What do you suggest, concretely?</h2><p>In the spirit of epistemic humility, I wouldn\u2019t claim to know how exactly EA should do aesthetics. But we can brainstorm.</p><p>A starting point is my <a href=\"https://classicalfuturist.substack.com/p/guided-by-the-beauty-of-ones-philosophies\">Guided by the Beauty of One\u2019s Philosophies</a> essay. Read it for more detail, but to summarize it quickly, I identified three main benefits of aesthetics for movements:</p><ol><li>Marketing: attracting people and funding to the cause.</li><li>Avoiding the misery trap (Michael Nielsen has a good section on this in <a href=\"https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/\">his critical essay on EA</a>).</li><li>Defining EA values and making them legible.</li></ol><p>So the first step might be to examine current problems in EA and see if aesthetics can help solve them. For instance, if there\u2019s a PR problem, then we could study marketing strategies of successful movements and adapt them. If there\u2019s a misery trap problem \u2014&nbsp;people feeling burned out and unhappy as part of EA \u2014 then we could write posts emphasize that caring about art and beauty is also a way to be a good person, and should not be described as \u201cless-than-maximally-effective.\u201d</p><h3>4.1) That\u2019s still pretty vague, what else have you got?</h3><p>Now I\u2019m just going to throw ideas.</p><p>Some places have policies where publicly funded construction projects must devote a small percentage of their budget \u2014 where I live, it\u2019s 1% \u2014 to the integration of public art. In a way, the government overrides the builders\u2019 incentive to optimize their budget, and forces them to commit a small part of the money to aesthetics.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:82.46%\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66554fe7-ae62-4754-839c-c229c09ddc83_1438x852.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66554fe7-ae62-4754-839c-c229c09ddc83_1438x852.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66554fe7-ae62-4754-839c-c229c09ddc83_1438x852.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66554fe7-ae62-4754-839c-c229c09ddc83_1438x852.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66554fe7-ae62-4754-839c-c229c09ddc83_1438x852.jpeg 1456w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;Many of the artworks in the Montreal metro system come from this \u201c1% policy\u201d</figcaption></figure><p>Some readers may be thinking, \u201cWait a minute, surely this increases construction costs. That doesn\u2019t sound optimal!\u201d <i>Yes. That\u2019s the point</i>. The 1% policy is a small concession to suboptimality \u2014 a way to make everyone commit to devoting money to something (art) whose value is illegible. Having the government mandate it solves the coordination problem.</p><p>EA organizations that provide funding could adopt a similar policy. If your project gets a $1 million grant, perhaps it would be good if you were obliged, or strongly encouraged, to use $10,000 of the grant to commission a work of art or hold an artist residency.</p><p>Funding organizations could also commit to supporting a small number of artists directly. This could take the form of periodic art or storytelling contests, continuously having an artist in residence, or directly commissioning works from artists who seem aligned with EA values. There are good suggestions along these lines in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9bwc2ySpGJGAnWPuW/re-considering-the-aesthetics-of-ea\">this post</a>. One example from the post worth mentioning is CERN\u2019s <a href=\"https://arts.cern/programme/collide\">artist residency program</a>.</p><p>The most basic part of aesthetics is stuff like web design, logos, etc. I don\u2019t think EA necessarily needs to pour more resources in that than it already does \u2014 the default minimal aesthetic of the core EA organizations like 80,000 Hours, Open Philanthropy, or the EA forums, does a decent job at the moment. I do think that perhaps EA-adjacent organizations should feel free to explore more intentional aesthetics in their marketing and design.</p><h3>4.2) Should EA funders evaluate the aesthetics of organizations and projects <i>before</i> they fund them?</h3><p>Probably not as a core criterion, but it might be a good idea to explicitly consider aesthetics as part of a grant evaluation. Since aesthetics are not optional, how attractive a project appears to whomever evaluates it will always bear upon the final decision, regardless of how careful and analytic they are. It\u2019s better to show awareness of it instead of pretending that aesthetics have no impact.</p><p>One idea <a href=\"https://etiennefd.substack.com/p/aesthetics-as-epistemic-humility/comment/8479401\">from a commenter</a> is to use aesthetics as something like a tiebreaker. When it\u2019s not possible to know perfectly which of several charities or projects should be funded based in impact calculations, then go with vibes (and acknowledge that).</p><h3>4.3) How much of EA resources should we spend on aesthetics?</h3><p>That\u2019s a central question. I think it\u2019s clear that it shouldn\u2019t be a lot. We definitely do not want EA to become <i>mostly</i> or even <i>substantially</i> about art and aesthetics. There are probably enough non-EA philanthropists who do that already.</p><p>Just like the \u201crule\u201d of donating 10% of one\u2019s income to charity is an arbitrary but good Schelling point, a 1% \u201crule\u201d of diverting EA philanthropy to the arts seem like a good number to rally around. But it could be something else. The important part is to signal that spending a small amount of resources on aesthetics with illegible value is something acceptable to an effective altruist, <i>even if</i> it doesn\u2019t feel maximally effective in the moment.</p><h3>4.4) What are some pitfalls to avoid?</h3><p>The main trap would be to\u2026 try to optimize too much.</p><p>I can totally imagine a scenario in which someone agrees that aesthetics have all the benefits I named and then proceeds to write a long post analyzing the pros and cons of every possible art form. In fact, I don\u2019t really have to imagine it, since <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RmTqKTkjiiPgRTWdL/please-use-art-to-convey-ea\">this post</a> does basically that. It\u2019s a great post that I mostly agree with!

It should be up to artists to decide what\u2019s the best way to convey whatever they want to convey.</figcaption></figure><p>In a similar vein, the people using EA money to fund art could be tempted to pose a lot of conditions to artists. It may seem good to have mechanisms to ensure that the resulting works are aligned with EA, that they paint the movement in a positive light, and so on. I would warn against such top-down involvement. Art, like all creative work from fundamental scientific research to entrepreneurship, is best when it is as free as possible. Trying to control artists would lead to worse art and annihilate many of the benefits of funding them in the first place.</p><p>I\u2019m not too worried about this, since EA is clearly fine with people criticizing it. But when money is involved, it becomes hard to resist the temptation of top-down control. So let\u2019s at least be aware of it.</p><h3>4.5) To sum it up, it sounds like you\u2019re saying that aesthetics is\u2026 effective. Right?</h3><p>Well, yes and no.</p><p>Yes, at the abstract, broader, meta level. I do believe that the good that EA will have done after several years will be higher in the universe where it assigned some of its resources to aesthetics, compared to the universe where it didn\u2019t. So in that sense, caring about art and beauty is \u201ceffective,\u201d yes.</p><p>But again, <i>that is usually not the right way to think about this</i>. At the moment of actually giving a grant to an artist, or setting up a residency program, those abstract considerations on the long-term benefits of creative freedom will almost always be swamped by shorter-term pressure to optimize. There\u2019s always some more legible philanthropic effort you could send the money to instead.</p><p>(There\u2019s a strong parallel with science, where it always feels safer and more optimal to fund an established scientist working on incremental research than a smart creative person who doesn\u2019t exactly know what they\u2019re doing \u2014 but of course major scientific advances <a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/02/10/the-scientific-virtues/\">are pretty much always </a>the work of smart creative people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.)</p><p>So <strong>yes, caring about aesthetics is effective \u2014 but </strong><i><strong>it almost never feels that way</strong></i>, especially not when calculating expected impact in spreadsheets.</p><h2>5) Any concluding remarks?</h2><p>The main challenge in thinking about beauty is that its value is illegible.

While this motto sparks lively debates concerning fundamental ethical assumptions and precise definitions of socially beneficial outcomes, the consensus opinion - often, though not always grounded in utilitarian ethics - tends to center around happier and longer lives, as measured by averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and through similar metrics, accompanied with the interventions\u2019 cost-effectiveness estimates. This makes the proper quantification of subjective well-being and affective states a core aspect of such considerations, highlighting the crucial importance of multidisciplinary consciousness studies. The following essay focuses on a broad class of important but neglected mental and physical states - referred to by the umbrella term \u201cemergent phenomena\u201d - that can be rigorously studied in a tractable way. These studies, followed by their skillful integration into global healthcare and education systems, could likely yield outstanding benefits for humanity, including but not limited to improved mental health and \u201cordinary\u201d human welfare, widely considered as one of the key cause areas in the short-term EA. Furthermore, it is also hypothesized that the global scaling of well-understood and properly managed emergent phenomena may result in the positive downstream effects affecting our civilization\u2019s long-term trajectories.</p><h3><strong>Defining ((psycho)spiritual) emergence</strong></h3><p>The word \u201cemergence\u201d has numerous uses in science, art, and philosophy. One of its most well-known meanings refers to the observation that in many organized systems, high-level properties seem to \"emerge\" spontaneously, without the possibility of explaining said properties from the constituent parts of the system. There may be some overlap with our use of the term, as many emergent practices engage in the observation of the <i>emergence </i>of lived phenomena in real time (meditation) and analysis of the nature of these emergent properties (philosophy).&nbsp;</p><p>However, in this essay, \u201cemergent phenomena\u201d is used primarily as a neutral expression encompassing various states and experiences that are popularly referred to as \u201ccontemplative\u201d, \u201cspiritual\u201d, \u201cmeditative\u201d, \u201cpsychedelic\u201d, \u201cmystical\u201d, \u201cenergetic\u201d, \u201cenlightening\u201d, and with the use of other related terms. The \u201c(psycho)spiritual\u201d adjective helps to clarify that we refer to the type of emergence that is often investigated through the psychological and spiritual lenses, without directly implying the validity and/or exhaustive character of the psychological and/or spiritual framing.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the term \"emergence\", we also use it to refer to a hypothesized global developmental process that individuals can go through. Emergent development is therefore hypothesized to be a rapid or gradual process, sometimes cyclical in nature, presenting in phases and punctuated by developmental milestones, transitional events, and various threshold effects. Emergent development can entail deep questioning surrounding self and worldviews, and the correlative transformation of one's metaphysical beliefs and motivations in life. Its effects on an individual's life, as well as the degree to which function, representations, and fundamental orientations in life are impacted can be very significant. Its short- and long-term effects involve systemic shifts in an individual's <i>lived-world (Lebenswelt)</i>, not only in the variegated dimensions of the field of consciousness such as cognition, perception, and emotion, but also in the domains of action and interpersonal relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, all the inherently correlative dimensions of human life such as perception, beliefs, worldviews, felt meaning, values, motivation, behavior, psychology, physiology, and even sensate spheres can be impacted by the emergent development. Most people involved in practices likely to yield emergent phenomena have little idea of the full range of possible experiences and effects, both good and bad, that these practices may produce. These effects can also occur spontaneously (Corneille, 2021). Research into the efficacy of emergent practices and therapies is lacking, as is the knowledge about the applicable skills that may effectively produce beneficial emergent experiences and minimize the risk of deleterious outcomes. There are numerous overlapping reasons for this state of things, including but not limited to difficulty in studying such phenomena embedded in different religious and cultural contexts, general taboo due to the concern about associations with pseudoscience and ontologically specific, supernatural claims, as well as methodological challenges inherent to the multidisciplinary field of consciousness studies.&nbsp;</p><p>While many remarkable claims for the possible benefits of emergent phenomena have been made for millennia, the full range of what might be possible in human development from emergent practices has yet to be rigorously studied. We believe that resolving problematic emergent experiences that people may encounter, as well as addressing systemic problems occurring when such individuals interact with the medical and mental health systems, would yield a high return of investment in the form of positive social impact.</p><h3><strong>Guesstimating scale</strong></h3><p>Although not strictly equivalent, emergent phenomena are closely related to various classes of so-called altered states of Consciousness (ASCs). Anthropologists estimate that over 3,500 societies have developed complex institutionalized procedures to induce ASCs in ritual contexts (Bourguignon, 1973). This gives us a sense of the universal prevalence of the cultivation of ASCs. The incidence of adverse effects from meditation practice, increasingly popular in secularized and therapeutic contexts, is estimated as comparable to that of pharmacological treatments (Van Dam <i>et al.</i>, 2018).&nbsp;</p><p>A recent \"cross-sectional online survey to investigate the prevalence of a wide range of experiences in 1120 meditators\", including but not limited to mystical experiences, a sense of transcendence of space and time, ineffability, extraordinary physical, spatiotemporal, cognitive-psychological relational experiences, \"show(s) that the majority of respondents report having had many of these anomalous and extraordinary experiences\". Given the relatively scarce and scattered data points collected with the use of methods of varying quality, it is relatively difficult to come up with satisfying estimates of the prevalence and incidence of emergent phenomena in the global population.&nbsp;</p><p>In this context, it might be helpful to introduce a simple guesstimate: if we were to conservatively assume that pronounced emergent phenomena occur only in 10% of the global population, and only 10% of the said group struggle(d) with severely distressing experiences that could not be effectively addressed within the current healthcare systems, it would yield an approximately 80 million target population. Given that over 80% of the global population is religious, and that many emergent practices - especially meditation and psychedelic use - scale in the context of secular therapy and self-actualization, the number of people who would directly and substantially benefit from advancing emergence research is likely substantially higher, to the point where it may concern a target population larger by the entire order of magnitude. This would remain in line with observations like the one stating that 49% of people surveyed had a religious or mystical experience, defined as a \u201cmoment of sudden religious insight of awakening\u201d (Pew Forum Survey, 2009).</p><h3><strong>Varieties of emergent phenomena</strong></h3><p>Emergent phenomena and the effects they produce on individuals with various proclivities exhibit a tremendous range of possible manifestations. These should be thought of in a similar way as we think of medical conditions: a single condition, such as Lyme's disease, can present incredibly broad ranges of symptoms and manifestations, yet we have clearly managed to identify a common cause for all these seemingly unrelated presentations.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, we hypothesize that under the broad variety of manifestations we have listed, commonly referred to as \u201ccontemplative\u201d, \u201cspiritual\u201d, \u201cmeditative\u201d, \u201cpsychedelic\u201d, \u201cmystical\u201d, and \u201cenergetic\u201d phenomena, there are unifying threads and global processes to be discovered. Most of the unusual phenomena, effects, and experiences discussed here fit into at least one of the following categories - though, in practice, there is often significant overlap: sensate, perceptual, arousal-related, time consciousness, sequential, spatial, dimensional, contextual, existential, psychological, emotional, volitional, archetypal, semantic, valence-related, envelope-related, cognitive, physiological, paradigmatic, kinetic, vocational, functional, behavioral, social, collective, cultural, expressive, medical, energetic, meta-emergent, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>In some ways then, emergent phenomena can be seen as <i>symptoms</i> of an underlying emergent development, though we avoid using the term \u201csymptoms\u201d as usually reserved for pathological states, while emergence frequently represents a very positive axis of development, as exemplified by the large number of psychedelic, spiritual, and mystical traditions which have thought to foster it.&nbsp;</p><p>Emergent development is often accompanied by the experience of novel mental states, yet emergent phenomena should not be equated with ASCs. Firstly, because the paradigm of ASCs is not sufficient to account for some of the manifestations of an emergence process which could hardly be qualified as ASCs or even as \"states\" of consciousness, such as energy-like somatic experiences (ELSE - Cooper <i>et al.</i>, 2021), or shifts in metaphysical beliefs, such as these triggered by psychedelic experiences (Timmermann <i>et al.</i>, 2022). Secondly, because not all emergent traditions rely on the cultivation of ASCs - for instance, the nature of mind schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Mahamudra, and Dzogchen is based on maintaining of a <i>natural state</i> <i>of awareness</i>, not an <i>altered</i> state. Conversely, not all ASCs will trigger an emergent process: to illustrate this point, we can mention how not all psychedelic experiences will trigger emergence, and not all emergent development is caused by intense or exotic experiences. Furthermore, different emergent traditions have differing relationships with ASCs, some finding great value in cultivating certain forms of ASCs, such as jhanas in Buddhism, piblokto in Eskimo culture, or possession trance in Vudun people (Locke &amp; Kelly, 1985), whereas others consider any special experiences, be they positive, negative, or ambivalent, correlative with an ongoing, active process of emergence, to be merely side effects or distractions, and discourage spending time chasing particular experiences.</p><h3><strong>Relevance for human welfare</strong></h3><p>The frequent incidence of emergent experiences, and the general hesitance of scientific, medical, and mental health disciplines to acknowledge and investigate their reality, constitutes a significant problem. Primary emergency medicine and emergency psychiatry textbooks scarcely mention emergent phenomena. The present <i>DSM-5</i> and <i>ICD-11</i> psychiatric diagnostic manuals have no codes adequate reflecting the wide range of challenging emergent phenomena. Thus, there are no mainstream standards of care, no trials comparing management strategies, no standard diagnostic criteria or protocols, and no ways to track the incidence, prevalence, and impact of emergent phenomena on patients, healthcare systems, and societies.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, medical and therapeutic ethics are being violated by this severe knowledge gap, as it is exceptionally difficult have an ethical conversation about the risks, benefits, and emergent practices and therapies alternatives. There are currently no means to conduct a globally scalable, high-quality education and the implementation of management strategies for challenging emergent experiences, as these are all functionally unknown to mainstream clinical medicine and mental health. One can only imagine the toll of the aforementioned status quo in terms of DALYs and other metrics used in the modern healthcare and economic systems. It is equally important to recognize the overlooked therapeutic potential of many emergent modalities, including but not limited to the psychedelic therapies and meditative absorptions, concerning blissful states much more profound and less known than these usually attained during the popular mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).&nbsp;</p><p>The case for emergence research is thus supported by the extensive literature arguing in favor of recognizing mental health as an effective cause area, and of particular interest to patients suffering from common mental disorders who experienced limited benefits from the popular treatment options, often struggling with substantial treatment resistance.</p><h3><strong>Past and presence</strong></h3><p>The field relating to emergent phenomena is as old as the history of humanity, and many mystical, religious, Indigenous, and traditional cultures have developed knowledge and practical techniques for contending with such phenomena and experiences. Unfortunately, much of this knowledge has been either lost, diluted, distorted, or neglected throughout the history, including in the advent of scientific materialism, with some noted exceptions. In 1894, Richard Bucke, the president of the American Medico-Psychological Association (now the APA) proposed that his notion of \u201ccosmic consciousness\u201d be incorporated into psychiatric epistemology and practice. In 1901, the American psychologist and philosopher William James discussed emergent phenomena and identified them as being poorly understood by science. Carl Jung also constituted a prominent trailblazer in this field. Building on the work of these luminaries, the formal establishment of the emergence research began in the 1960s, when the American psychologist Abraham Maslow introduced the term \u201cBeing-Psychology\u201d to denote a new field of psychological investigation at the interface between the mainstream psychology and the psychospiritual domain.</p><p>Most research into emergent phenomena has been siloed into somewhat artificially distinct fields, based on specific thematic choices (studying some particular set of effects and experiences), or the effects of very specific induction methods which tend to distinguish radically between pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques as in <i>contemplative studies&nbsp;</i>(based on \"meditation\") or <i>psychedelic</i> <i>science</i> (based on the ingestion of natural or synthetic psychoactive compounds). This siloing of research into meditation research, psychedelic research, religious studies, phenomenology, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology, related to existing incentive and intellectual structures, as well as values in academic disciplines, clinical research, and emergent traditions, has significant consequences. These divisions may not hold scrutiny for several reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>First, in terms of <i>induction methods</i> and their supposed effects, these are not as tightly defined as these labels may suggest. \"Meditation\" itself covers a broad variety of internal activities and contents, and may impact brain chemistry to a degree where some of its alleged effects could in fact be traced to pharmacological causes, such as the presence of psychedelic compounds in the brain produced by certain activities or themes of meditation. Conversely, some of the effects of psychedelic drugs may well be due to the attentional activity of the user rather than to the effects of the compound per se. Furthermore, various states of consciousness which may arise from a multitude of induction techniques are often strikingly similar from the phenomenological perspective, and uniting the varieties of manifestations into a coherent family of states involves picking up on certain developmental patterns discussed in this essay, requiring comparative studies at the phenomenological, behavioral, and physiological levels which simply do not exist today, thwarted by disciplinary divisions and the related difficulty of coordinating multidisciplinary research for long periods of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus we should consider the advice of anthropologists Locke &amp; Kelly, who suggested as early as in 1985 that the study of particular states of consciousness and related induction methods have several different levels of analytic and social relevance. They include both \u201cspontaneous and induced forms which may also have intertwined developmental aspects. (...) Characteristically, a multiplicity of factors is involved at different analytical levels, interacting in rich and often subtle ways\". Thus we should refrain from hasty categorization lest we commit \"category errors and premature empirical and conceptual closure.\" \"In the face of such complexities\", they argued, \"we need an overall model which at least begins to take account, in a systematic way, of the full range of factors which may be involved in a given case.\" Only such a pluralistic approach can lead to meaningful cross-cultural comparisons and help develop general taxonomies of ASCs by conducting \"thoroughgoing comparative study of these phenomena (...) leading to the clearer delineation of the range of discrete states and mapping of \"family resemblances\" between them\" (Locke &amp; Kelly, 1985).&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of meditation research, recent reviews of literature show that: (1) the scope of states of consciousness studied in relation to meditative practices should be radically expanded to include \"more challenging domains to measure, such as group and relational, transpersonal and mystical, and difficult aspects of meditation; anomalous or extraordinary phenomena related to meditation; and post-conventional stages of development associated with meditation.\" According to the same group of researchers, \"there are many outcomes, as well as phenomenological states of conscious and non-conscious processing, that have rarely been examined in the scientific literature to date\" (Vieten <i>et al.</i>, 2018). The authors suggest that \"these experiences are important to study. They hold the potential not only to shed light on effects of meditation in those who practice it but may also illuminate new understandings about human potential and the nature of reality\"; (2) the scale and rigor of research studies should be equally deepened. \"Much work should go toward improving the rigor of methods used\", including clarifying what \"meditation\" and \"mindfulness\" mean, taking into account the \"replication crisis\" in medical and psychological science, and developing \"pre-registered experiments and open-science\". They also argue that better uniformity and control should be adopted in clinical research, and that mobilizing other approaches on top of neuroscientific strategies, for the interpretation of brain imagery in relation to conscious experiences, is much less well understood than many think (Van Dam <i>et al.,</i> 2019).&nbsp;</p><p>Recent efforts have thus sought to clarify what internal activities meditation actually entails, which may help to clarify <i>aetiological&nbsp;</i>attribution (Sparby, 2022), as well as developing a solid program for a science of consciousness (Sparby, 2017), suggesting that much more time and effort should be spent of <i>describing</i> the phenomena in question without artificially setting boundaries between types of experiences and effects which may be more related that our initial assumptions may suggest. The ALIUS research group has proposed that a variety of mind states linked with philosophical reflection, meditation, psychedelic, hypnosis, and artistic induction method should be studied conjointly from a multi- and transdisciplinary perspective, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://artemoc.scicog.fr/wp-content/uploads/ressources/Rapport_PIRSTEC.pdf\">suggested thematic, strategic and technological orientations</a> for future research which resembles our suggested cause area in its scope (ARTHEMOC, 2009).&nbsp;</p><p>However, we should go much further in the expansion of both scope, quality, and diversity of research methodologies and disciplinary lenses mobilized in our study of these experiences and phenomena. We maintain our hypothesis that although there is much interest in developing \"psychedelic\", \"contemplative\", and other forms of the science of experience, no contemporary research as of yet identified with a sufficient degree of theoretical depth and empirical rigor the underlying, unifying thread discussed here, namely the fact that many - but not all - of the induction techniques and effects they produce are in fact manifestations of a specific developmental process which we call emergence, accounts of which are outlined in various spiritual traditions, philosophical schools, clinical reports of different types of psychological literature, and other cultural productions, such as poetry and other art forms.</p><h3><strong>Sketching the roadmap&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The following roadmap is a suggested outline for exploring the emergent research cause area, collectively authored by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theeprc.org/\">experts and leaders</a> from a broad variety of disciplines who have come together to outline what they think would be the best strategy to establish this cause area into a solid field of knowledge. Previous guidelines that were very similar to this have been produced by multidisciplinary teams engaged in developing the scope and solidity of the science of consciousness, such as the Alius Research Group's early prospective work for furthering&nbsp;<a href=\"http://artemoc.scicog.fr/wp-content/uploads/ressources/Rapport_PIRSTEC.pdf\">transdisciplinary research on hallucinations and other altered states of consciousness.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>There are five main phases. For each phase, we only outline the crucial axes of research. The overall arc begins with a thorough assessment of existing knowledge and evidence, moves on to conduct basic and clinical research, and ends with the successful systemic integration of research findings. Each subsequent phase builds on the previous, hence this can be seen as a chronological unfolding; however, please keep in mind there is a certain degree of non-linearity in the articulation between these phases. In terms of time estimates, the first two phases could probably be completed within five to ten years. It is estimated that all five phases of such an overall project would take more or less four decades to be completed, such estimates being suggested by the timeline of MAPS, which is a very similar project.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phase I: State of the Art&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Interviewing luminaries in the field;</li><li>Conducting comprehensive multidisciplinary literature reviews;</li><li>Translating any relevant knowledge if not currently available in English, including that contained in traditional sources and oral traditions;</li><li>Establishing theoretical tools that can coherently integrate the axiologies, epistemologies, and norms of clinical research, academic disciplines, and emergent traditions;</li></ol><p><strong>Phase II: Basic Research</strong></p><ol><li>Phenomenology and neurophenomenology;</li><li>Physiology and neurophysiology;</li><li>Identifying variants and natural groupings;</li><li>Developing consensual terminologies and extensive taxonomies;</li><li>Formulating contemporary developmental models;</li><li>Crafting diagnostic tools for caregivers;</li></ol><p><strong>Phase III: Clinical Research and Applications</strong></p><ol><li>Conducting large longitudinal outcome studies;</li><li>Identifying best diagnostic and management strategies;</li><li>Upgrading the status of emergence in mental health;</li><li>Obtaining sound epidemiological data;</li><li>Dynamically updating and coordinating systemic priorities as the project evolves;</li></ol><p><strong>Phase IV: Cultural Translation</strong></p><ol><li>Translating results into all major languages;</li><li>Skilfully adapting findings to various cultural and religious contexts;</li><li>Taking the anthropological dimensions of emergence into account;</li><li>Developing training programs to upgrade spiritual competency;</li></ol><p><strong>Phase V: Institutional and Social Integration</strong></p><ol><li>Globally expanding caregiving by getting into major health textbooks and curricula;</li><li>Recommending public health policies at the highest levels;</li><li>Globally communicating findings to all institution types;</li><li>Evaluating the global value and impact of the project.</li></ol><p>This roadmap could also be divided into disciplinary projects with various thematic foci and interests. This way of organizing this long-term endeavour should allow an important degree of research-results coordination, interactivity, and a degree of power that isolated teams with less standardized data collection methods, a lack of pooled data, and a lack of an overall coordinated plan would not otherwise be able to accomplish.</p><h3><strong>The value of ontological neutrality</strong></h3><p>The field of emergent experiences has given rise to a wide range of often contradictory explanations and interpretations. Obviously, the study of conscious life is a complex topic, and the discussed domain has frequently caused intense debate regarding the true nature of these specific phenomena. This is perhaps not surprising, as emergent experiences are often existentially impactful, can profoundly influence our belief systems and the ways we relate to reality, and often, though not always, contain deep metaphysical components that can be transformative, although these may be perceived as either disturbing or liberating, depending on a number of factors, including the individual experiencer's appraisal of these experiences, or the responses of peers and authorities within the surrounding social context according to the norms of the time and place (Lindahl, 2017).&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, when confronted with a person reporting that they are hearing voices, seeing beings that others cannot perceive, or experiencing strange raptures, perceptual effects, mood swings, or visions - all of which are commonly reported effects in traditional emergent literature across the world - medieval mentalities may have considered this person a saint receiving divine or angelic messages or, conversely suspected to be a heretic or witch, possessed by the demon.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern psychiatry, by contrast, has tended to discard such manifestations falling outside the scope of what it considered normal states of consciousness as signs of severe psychopathology, and oftentimes linked them with a material problem affecting the brain (Spittles, 2018). Faced with this proliferation of explanatory proposals, one must admit the existence of major and frequently intractable tensions. In fact, one may hypothesize that striving to resolve fundamental ontological debates adds little to clinical outcomes, and is likely to seriously distract from pursuing clinical utility and global scalability. We can strategically avoid taking sides with any of these and similar proposals, and still engage with those who are experiencing said phenomena and their various related effects. Indeed, we can sometimes avoid asking these questions entirely, and instead of looking for and striving to impose a single answer as to the ultimate nature of consciousness, matter, or emergent phenomena, the medical and clinical perspective may offer us a unique path towards bypassing these important debates in favor of a therapeutic, pragmatic and ontologically neutral attitude - which means to avoid, when advisable, currently unprovable assumptions about the true nature of things and their relationships, instead focusing on clinical presentations and adding value to care.</p><h3><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h3><p>We hope that this essay presented an illustrative and convincing case for recognizing and supporting the domain of emergence research. While we maintain a high degree of confidence in the importance of the described cause area, we simultaneously acknowledge its inherently complex nature, likely constituting one of the primary reasons for its underrepresentation - including the practical absence of relevant thoughtful initiatives - in the space of high-impact biomedical research and philanthropy. Last but not least, the debates surrounding emergence research tend to bring up the examples of past projects that did not account for all the important standards outlined above, essential for any worthwhile endeavors in the domain. Indeed, numerous spirituality-adjacent initiatives, while often well-intentioned, did not adhere to the best practices in multidisciplinary research, leaning on the side of pseudoscience and vague statements about bridging the gap between the science and spirituality. We do hope that the prospective readers will recognize our proposal as advocating for a vastly different approach, emphasizing the need for the highest standards of methodological rigour, the contractual value of ontological neutrality, and the pragmatism of a clinical lens. When these three principles are jointly realized, the emergence research domain may flourish as a high-impact cause area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>References</strong></h3><p>ARTHEMOC association, Pirstec Report #26:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://artemoc.scicog.fr/wp-content/uploads/ressources/Rapport_PIRSTEC.pdf\">Transdisciplinary research on hallucinations and other altered states of consciousness</a>, November 2009</p><p>Bitbol, M., <i>A Phenomenological Ontology for Physics: Merleau-Ponty and QBism</i>, in H.

It\u2019s a ticket out of poverty.\u201d&nbsp;</i></p><p>George W. Bush</p><p><i>\u201cEducation can lift individuals out of poverty and into rewarding careers.\u201d&nbsp;</i></p><p>Christine Gregoire</p><p>Solving the global problem of poverty is a gargantuan task.&nbsp;</p><p>Many thought leaders presume that education is the answer to this: study hard, get a job, work until poverty is nothing but a bad dream, a forgotten memory of the past.&nbsp;</p><p>Elementary concepts in Labor Economics supports this hypothesis: the quality and level of education are key components for the acquisition of jobs providing sufficient income and an amenable quality of life. On the topic of human capital, there is an established positive relationship between the acquired years of schooling and the earned wages or income. This is because in the contemporary labor market, education is deemed a fundamental prerequisite to be employed in many capacities, in order to earn a sufficient amount of income.</p><p>This assertion is supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u2019s 2015 report on education. It shows how generally, the higher the level of education, the greater the resulting income.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6kp095zg9q6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6kp095zg9q6\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f45a01868e21d54cc697fe683e394d3f812dbd184b2c24dd.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f45a01868e21d54cc697fe683e394d3f812dbd184b2c24dd.png/w_148 148w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f45a01868e21d54cc697fe683e394d3f812dbd184b2c24dd.png/w_228 228w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f45a01868e21d54cc697fe683e394d3f812dbd184b2c24dd.png/w_308 308w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f45a01868e21d54cc697fe683e394d3f812dbd184b2c24dd.png/w_388 388w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f45a01868e21d54cc697fe683e394d3f812dbd184b2c24dd.png/w_468 468w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f45a01868e21d54cc697fe683e394d3f812dbd184b2c24dd.png/w_548 548w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/f45a01868e21d54cc697fe683e394d3f812dbd184b2c24dd.png/w_628 628w\"></figure><p>Looking at a country-specific report from the National Center for Education Statistics of the United States, the association of higher educational attainment with higher median earnings is also strong, as evinced by consistent findings from 2010 through 2020.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx03jub8oz8g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx03jub8oz8g\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Specifically, 25- to 34-year-old workers with a master\u2019s degree or higher has median earnings of US$69,700, which is 17% higher than the earnings of those with bachelor\u2019s degrees at US$59,600. Moreover, the median earnings of bachelor\u2019s degree holders is 63% higher than the US$36,600 median earnings of high school completers.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from relatively lower median earnings, unemployment rate is also inversely related to the level of education. In a data reported by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is only 1.5% of unemployment rate for those who have doctoral degrees; on the flip side, there is an 8.3% rate of unemployment for those who did not complete high school.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref704jip5kot\"><sup><a href=\"#fn704jip5kot\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>For sure, education is important in addressing poverty. But is it really the sole key towards battling it, as George W. Bush highlights?</p><p>A cursory analysis of World Bank data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) seems to indicate that education might not be enough.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3pyipa3bp58\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3pyipa3bp58\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>A macroeconomic example of this relates to government spending on education compared to GDP. Based on World Bank data, of the top 20 countries with the highest government expenditure on education ratio, only around 30% of them are from developed countries.&nbsp;An offhand conclusion which could be drawn from this is that spending on education to improve quality of life is not necessarily enough: there could be other factors which could help spur socioeconomic development, especially for developing countries.</p><p>Egypt provides an interesting case study regarding this. The country has registered high labor surplus in the past decade, with the unemployment rate even among college graduates alarmingly high. According to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), \u201c91.9% of the unemployed workforce were university graduates, average and above-average certificate holders.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvg7lqwd76sp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvg7lqwd76sp\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This means that high school and college graduates are as unemployed as elementary graduates, defying the economic theory of labor economics that the years of schooling are positively correlated to income.</p><p>Cambodia has also registered relative increase in their educational enrollment, from 24.6% in 2004 to 61.08% in 2021. However, just like in the preceding developing country, the surge of college graduates was not matched by the number of job opportunities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref418h3tfc7ai\"><sup><a href=\"#fn418h3tfc7ai\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In fact, a small university study shows how for 1, 865 surveyed graduates, only 959 were able to find occupations that match their degree program and level of education. Unfortunately, 200 were overeducated for their current job (vertical mismatch), 306 acquired jobs unrelated to their degree program (horizontal mismatch), and about 315 experienced both mismatches.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrz26v1zlzi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrz26v1zlzi\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>Clearly these are problems that providing education alone, even quality education at that, has difficulty addressing.&nbsp;</p><p>A third example to drive home the point is the Philippines. The Asian Development Bank reports that poor Filipino households tend to underinvest in areas pertaining to human capital, such as health and education. Primary reasons for these include the fact that their scarce resources would rather be allotted to the most basic human needs like sustenance, as well as that they are unaware of potential returns of such investments.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffbu7qjyz7xa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfbu7qjyz7xa\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is especially true in underserved rural areas and poverty-stricken urban areas. This results to high rates of undereducated adults of working age and educationally at-risk children and youth coming from these communities.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, those who enjoy access to tertiary education are given more opportunities career-wise, giving them the chance to move up the socioeconomic ladder. Coming from the middle class greatly improves these chances, at a 37% rate of improvement compared to low-income families.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftxf7okoeix\"><sup><a href=\"#fntxf7okoeix\">[9]</a></sup></span></p><p>However, the assurance of obtaining high-paying jobs if an individual finished tertiary education is still very minimal.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdslb6cipods\"><sup><a href=\"#fndslb6cipods\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Especially in the aftermath of the pandemic, fresh college graduates in the Philippines get a monthly average salary of PhP16,509 (US$296.97). It also suffers an unemployment rate of 5.7% and an underemployment rate of 14%, respectively translating to 2.76 million jobless Filipinos, and 6.4 million with underpaying jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>These three cases studies indicate that while education is important in battling poverty at the microeconomic level, it might not be enough in the current labor market.&nbsp;</p><p>For sure, this shallow report will not discount the fact that education is very important, essential even, in battling poverty. However, the authors would like to highlight that in order to maximize social and economic returns, it is necessary to provide complementary mechanisms by which to support global initiatives involving quality education.&nbsp;</p><p>Enter the concepts of mentorship and network building.</p><h3><strong>PART II. THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION: NETWORK BUILDING AS A CAUSE</strong></h3><p>One of the most powerful things in economics is the power of networks. Couple this with the economics of information and progress happens in leaps and bounds.</p><p>This is true in science. Artificial intelligence, for one thing, harnesses this concept in order to spearhead more efficient processes applicable in various fields, as well as conceptualize industry innovations. Foremost examples include knowledge graphs and artificial neural networks in machine learning, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>In sociology, political science, and international relations, this is also very true. Networks and organization-building lend more political power than individual states standing alone, hence the creation of such global agencies as the United Nations, the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. &nbsp;</p><p>The power of networks is equally true in the global economic arena. The world\u2019s trillion-dollar companies like Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are focused on connecting people across the world. This is what had generated enormous economic value and resulted in mindboggling amounts of concentrated wealth for these companies.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzhxvy91f76\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzhxvy91f76\">[11]</a></sup></span></p><p>The concept of network effects relies on the fact that as more people use a good or service, the more valuable it becomes\u2013 contrary to the usual characteristic of resources as being limited.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdz9z2rw0304\"><sup><a href=\"#fndz9z2rw0304\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A great example of this is the LinkedIn website: more job opportunities could be created as more professionals and employers use it. This means the more these platforms scale, the more social and economic value they can provide. The same can be said about movements like Effective Altruism.&nbsp;</p><p>From the elaborated cases of the three developing countries, we can infer that even though the citizens residing in each country possess education and promises intelligence and capabilities, these are still not enough to ease them out of poverty. They lack network as well as opportunities at both the national and international level. It is therefore still necessary to augment quality education efforts with network effects, hoping to serve as an equalizer for individuals coming from low- and middle-income households.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent mice studies indicate how environmental interventions increase general cognitive ability, including the addition of exposure of novel stimuli.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftvdezwa588\"><sup><a href=\"#fntvdezwa588\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Regardless of genetics, mice who have been exposed to enriched environments have exhibited a mean intelligence score 0.44 standard deviations higher than their control group siblings in the control group, which is approximately an additional 6.6 IQ points if converted to human intelligence.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107568/bin/rstb20170289-e1.jpg\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107568/bin/rstb20170289-e2.jpg\"></figure><p>While humans are of course not mice, many of the behavioral studies in mice and rats have been applied to their human counterparts.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwipuo0vzst\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwipuo0vzst\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Who moved my cheese indeed.&nbsp;</p><p>From this particular example, what we\u2019d like to show through parallel construction is that by fostering an engaging environment through external stimuli outside one\u2019s usual academic and professional setting, we can improve both individual and population performance. This strategy is not necessarily just targeted towards the intelligent nor to the upper socioeconomic class, two groups of individuals who already enjoy privileges dictated by genetics and society. Instead, the network aims to connect young achievers to both fellow young achievers as well as ordinary individuals, with the goal of improving the general performance average.</p><p>In sum, the cause seeks not to build <i>just</i> networks: after all, the world does not need another Wall Street, or even a real-life Illuminati. What it intends to do is to spearhead initiatives where high achievers, primarily from developed countries but also coming from developing countries, are encouraged to volunteer in projects, programs and activities working directly with individuals, groups and communities from underserved locales. The end-goal is highly engaged interaction, mutual inspiration and collective motivation among all participants.</p><p>This is also not just an exchange student program, where the usual targets are high-achieving individuals from both sides of the agreement. It actually proposes a more democratic alternative to this, with less costs and more benefits. This initiative seeks to enable even ordinary students from developing countries access to top-notch advice, engagement and potential mentorship from some of the best youth leaders in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Should this cause be funded, the suggestion is to focus on scaling this on an international level. Forbes reports that individuals who invest in widening their networks tend to have a higher potential for self and career development.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa76siefds8a\"><sup><a href=\"#fna76siefds8a\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Locally meeting people is good, but getting into international circles is even better. After all, people with established international networks can have highly intellectual and even technical discussions with professionals and high-profile individuals from the same or related international fields, including asking for advice, recommendations and openings. These can result in over-all holistic development, for personality, reputation, and even lifestyle. Having an international network opens doors to a wide array of academic, professional and personal growth opportunities.</p><p>As mentioned above, based on education and income data year-on-year, having an education is typically not enough to improve one\u2019s socioeconomic status in developing countries. Identifying how network effects, including access to mentorship, can be injected into current educational initiatives, particularly in developing countries, can provide a much-needed boost to the underdelivery of the promises of education.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, doing so supports Open Philanthropy\u2019s global aid policy, particularly related to using advocacy to help expand high-return programs and investments within existing aid institutions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeaadgcz6zj6\"><sup><a href=\"#fneaadgcz6zj6\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It could also potentially support Effective Altruism Community Growth, under the heading of Longtermism, by ensuring that these network externalities projects include EA-focused learnings for widespread dissemination.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>PART III. IMPORTANCE, TRACTABILITY &amp; NEGLECTEDNESS OF NETWORK BUILDING</strong></h3><p>The question then is: does funding the projects related to network-building and mentorship through education initiatives pass the test of ITN?</p><p>As a simplification, the ITN framework seeks to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Importance-- \u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d</li><li>Tractability-- \u201cWhat are possible interventions?\u201d</li><li>Neglectedness-- \u201cWho else is working on it?\u201d</li></ul><p><i><strong>Importance</strong></i></p><p>Aside from asking what the problem is, which has been thoroughly expounded in the preceding sections, the question of importance asks: how many individuals are affected?</p><p>51% of the global population is considered low income, roughly 3.93 billion people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc8xn1mlinna\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc8xn1mlinna\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These are individuals and families who might or might not have access to education, depending on their origin country, but for sure lack access to additional ingredients for career development and success, including opportunities for networks and mentorship.&nbsp;</p><p>The education numbers match: out of the total worldwide population, only 841.77 million people have had post-secondary education,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8x523d5vkr8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8x523d5vkr8\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which corresponds roughly to a small percentage of the upper middle income and high-income population.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnkhgaiitwd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnkhgaiitwd\">[19]</a></sup></span></p><p>As of 2020, the global unemployment rate averaged 6.5%. This corresponds to roughly 220 million underutilized potential human capital.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvdpq12j8zys\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvdpq12j8zys\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Youth and women were the sectors most affected, with 8.7% of young people compared to 3.7% for adults, and 5.0% for women versus 3.9% per men.&nbsp;</p><p>Even more alarmingly, as of 2019, 22.3% of the global youth population were not engaged in either education, employment or training (NEET), showing no improvement in the past decade.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmg6f0rv5d5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmg6f0rv5d5\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Based on these numbers, it is clear that there is indeed a problem with access to quality education. Even more so, as highlighted in the first two sections, addressing this social dilemma by providing basic education necessities is also not enough to create lasting impact on those already disadvantaged by coming from the lower socioeconomic classes.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why it is important to supplement quality education initiatives with network-building, especially those coming from developing countries and LMI households. Doing so can maximize these initiatives more a thousandfold, as to be discussed in the next section.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Tractability</strong></i></p><p>What are the possible interventions? At the same time, what is the envisioned impact per dollar? Will it reach Open Philanthropy\u2019s 1000X goal?</p><p>There are a number of possible interventions by which networking and mentorship can be spearheaded: as individual standalone projects, or otherwise integrated as necessary components in all quality education initiatives being implemented in underserved communities and marginalized groups. In fact, two existing ultra-early-stage programs will be discussed in the succeeding sections.&nbsp;</p><p>The question then is, can funding this cause either as standalone project or project component result in a 1000X socioeconomic yield?</p><p>First, we have to measure the expected total economic benefits of successful initiatives related to this cause. Then, we put it side by side to current equations predicting network effects. Through this, we can ascertain that funding these initiatives actually yield more than 1000X social ROI as envisioned by Open Philanthropy.&nbsp;</p><p>We could use the concept of benefit valuation to measure the net social welfare brought upon by the provision of services from these initiatives. A rudimentary equation which could be used to ascertaining total net benefits follows.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1.0pt dashed windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>TEB =</strong>&nbsp; <strong>\u2211 (\u2206C,&nbsp; \u2206P,&nbsp; \u2206G)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>where:</i></p><p><strong>TEB =</strong> Total Economic Benefits</p><p><strong>\u2206C =</strong> Change in Consumer Surplus</p><p><strong>\u2206P =</strong> Change in Produce Surplus</p><p><strong>\u2206G =</strong> Government Revenue</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Consumer Surplus includes the monetary value of applying and implementing exchange student programs as well as the consequent legal documents acquisition, increased employment opportunities in a lesser amount of time, and the creation of a community of young, aspiring professionals from which network effects can arise.&nbsp;</p><p>Producer Surplus includes cost savings from streamlined HR processes, including time, money and effort spent on discovery of potential trainees and employees. Potential markets can also be created at this point, leading to more producers.</p><p>Government Revenue in terms of GDP also increases, considering better access to international opportunities and the global labor market, higher remittances from possible job acquisition abroad, development of research projects and new technologies stimulated by training and collaboration, maintained or marginal increase in domestic consumption, and even a possible solution to generational wealth immobility.</p><p>The list above illustrates a non-exhaustive list of potential economic benefits that funding this cause provides. Most of these can actually be compounded by network effects.&nbsp;</p><p>How do we measure network effects?</p><p>One of the earliest proposals to do so include Sarnoff\u2019s Law, proposed by David Sarnoff, the founder of the National Broadcasting Corporation. According to him, the value of a broadcast network depends on the number of its audience in a proportional manner. Interestingly, this is primarily a one-way communication network.&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, taking engagement into account, Metcalfe\u2019s Law estimates network effects to have a value proportional to the square of the number of users (n^2).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiprbilvsj2\"><sup><a href=\"#fniprbilvsj2\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It was proposed by Engr. Robert Metcalfe, one of the co-inventors of Ethernet and 3Com.&nbsp;</p><p>Computer scientist David P. Reed countered this, stating that this only accounts for one-v-one connections, thus undervaluing the network\u2019s worth.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefltl0qyf8imo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnltl0qyf8imo\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Instead, he proposed Reed\u2019s Law, where he stated that Group-Forming Networks (GFNs) actually have a (2^n) value.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffyzf8suwjj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfyzf8suwjj\">[24]</a></sup></span></p><p>Below is a visualization of the different mathematical models of network effects.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.fs.guides.co/anoJP9a0SzuZaDPb9smg\"></figure><p>This means the value of $1 invested into a 50-person event targeting high engagement between all participants and with the goal of future network creation actually yields, according to Metcalfe\u2019s Law, a modest value of US$2,500, for a total cost of US$50. Because it is squarely proportional, the social return of investment will reach 1000X once US$1000 has been spent. Any increases in marginal spending results to greater than 1000X social ROI.</p><p>For the purpose of this shallow report, let us focus on Metcalfe\u2019s Law. If we allow for Reed\u2019s Law, the numbers are mind-bogglingly large. Even a $20 spend based on the latter results to a potential value of US$1,048,576.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the example, even just using the more modest Metcalfe\u2019s Law already illustrates the tractability of initiatives in building networks.&nbsp;</p><p>A last observation: considering that the target audience are from underserved communities, where the worth of a dollar (especially when it comes to services) can be considerably higher than otherwise, investing in projects devoted to this cause actually drives more impact. Simply put, the economic growth curve will be much steeper because there is just more room to improve. &nbsp;</p><p>Every economic agent benefits from network building and the resulting mentorship. But it would be the low socioeconomic class from the developing countries who would benefit the most from this in the form of higher social welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, a dollar spent on spearheading an event based on these parameters compounds horizontally (through time) and vertically (through network effects). In addition to the special case of steeper economic growth curves of developing countries, this leads to greater than antilog (3) social returns as originally envisioned by Open Philanthropy.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Neglectedness&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>For sure, the creation of networks is not the invention of the wheel. After all, social media\u2019s value, as well as the value of the companies seeking to connect people, are primarily rooted in the number of people using their platforms and services. Economics of scale are magnified.</p><p>However, despite the nature of these social media platforms, it cannot sufficiently respond to the need of the lack of networks in developing countries. For countries like the Philippines, Egypt, and Cambodia, launching one\u2019s career is not a walk in the park. More often than not, employers require at least two (2) years of experience or minimum training to be qualified even for an entry-level position. Given that social media platforms can only informally bridge people around the world, it lacks the function of providing accessory education and training, as well as job and external career opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>The nearest one would likely be LinkedIn and similar sites, but it does not enjoy market penetration equally.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx0477diq44s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx0477diq44s\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This likely translates to citizens from low- and middle-income countries not having access to these kinds of potential addition to their networks. At the same time, within the platform itself, there are a number of barriers to creating connections between people who are unaffiliated with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, there are a number of organizations seeking to build connections. Exchange student programs like USAID<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3z9axzi243e\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3z9axzi243e\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and Erasmus<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa37q26xiub\"><sup><a href=\"#fna37q26xiub\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;initiatives exist, but the majority of these are limited to high achievers from both developed and developing countries, who are also often financially privileged.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0acdgpsmjzao\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0acdgpsmjzao\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Ordinary students from underfunded regions seeking to improve their conditions have very little chances of getting into these programs.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also organizations, including Childhood Education International<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhxe8mxzn8fl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhxe8mxzn8fl\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and Education International<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbm6lbmy4j26\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbm6lbmy4j26\">[30]</a></sup></span>, focused on creating networks among educators. Funders for these initiatives include the Global Partnership for Education<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5rw839fm3ah\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5rw839fm3ah\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and Plan International.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiouzgo4udw9\"><sup><a href=\"#fniouzgo4udw9\">[32]</a></sup></span></p><p>These organizations are focused on children\u2019s right to education. Although the provision of economic assistance to address gaps in the educational system is commendable, this is not the only solution that the problem requires. For instance, in the case of funders, financial support is limited only to education-related activities. This means that after a certain period, donees would no longer receive the economic assistance from these programs and organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, a platform to build networks could have a significant effect on career outcomes, making it more sustainable and achieve longer-lasting positive effects. No matter how much we spend on the education of disadvantaged children, if they do not have properly compensated career opportunities, all efforts would be wasted. On the contrary, if we are to give young adults and aspiring professionals the means to acquire relatively high paying jobs, they would also be given the chance to climb up the socioeconomic ladder. Consequently, their future children would benefit from this. Assuming that the cycle would continue and grow exponentially, we are looking at an economically sustainable world.</p><p>Based on this, it is clear that while current efforts to address problems in quality education access are commendable, and that attempts to build stronger networks for growth are present, these are not enough, unless and until new initiatives devoted to the latter cause is forwarded.</p><p>The need remains for a potential catalyst to bridge high achievers to underserved groups and marginalized communities to see possible areas of collaboration, networking and mentorship. To bring top-notch volunteers to these communities and foster an environment of cooperation can help democratize opportunities for everyone involved in the process.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>PART IV. POTENTIAL PROJECTS FOR OPEN PHILANTHROPY FUNDING</strong></h3><p>As purpose-driven individuals, the authors have actually started building our own networks with the goal of mentorship, coaching and network-building to help address unequal privileges in underserved communities and marginalized groups. Two foremost examples which seek to augment the shortcomings of the educational system in underprivileged areas include Sociov and 1407 Graymalkin Group.</p><p><i><strong>Sociov</strong></i></p><p>Sociov (legally Social Innovation Technologies, Inc.) is a data-driven mentorship and career coaching platform which aims to bring mentoring and coaching services and democratize career data analytics to low- and middle-income households. It is geared towards using data leadership to make more strategic decisions in terms of gaining mentors and coaches, creating a network of young achievers and opening more opportunities for everyone involved in the process.</p><p>At present, it is based in the Philippines but is expected to expand to Southeast Asia in the next few years.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the programs it is currently exploring is advanced academic coaching. The proposal is a year-long programme, divided into quarters. It combines mentoring, coaching and peer support. Sessions are held online, which allows faster communication, easier viewing of files, visualization and presentation of strategies, among other benefits. It also increases the potential coach and mentor pool to scholars currently based abroad but who can be excellent coaches and mentors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:100.0%\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#E2EFD9;border:1.0pt solid windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:19.92%\"><p>1<sup>st</sup> Quarter</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#DEEAF6;border-color:windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:19.92%\"><p>2<sup>nd</sup> Quarter</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#E2EFD9;border-color:windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:19.92%\"><p>3<sup>rd</sup> Quarter</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#DEEAF6;border-color:windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:19.92%\"><p>4<sup>th</sup> Quarter</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#E2EFD9;border-color:windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:20.32%\"><p>BONUS SEMINAR SESSIONS</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-color:windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:19.92%\"><p>Strategy Formulation</p></td><td style=\"border-bottom:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-right:1.0pt solid windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:19.92%\"><p>Implementation</p></td><td style=\"border-bottom:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-right:1.0pt solid windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:19.92%\"><p>Motivation</p></td><td style=\"border-bottom:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-right:1.0pt solid windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:19.92%\"><p>Assessment</p></td><td style=\"border-bottom:1.0pt solid windowtext;border-right:1.0pt solid windowtext;padding:0in 5.4pt;width:20.32%\"><p>Specific Skills Development</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Each student shall be assigned a peer group, and there will be individual and team coaching sessions. The peer group shall be as heterogenous as possible, which will maximize friendly competition and varied perspectives.

These include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>practical and insider tips from personal experience</li><li>institution admission and transition guidance (documentation and logistics)</li><li>mentoring for improved study strategies and habits</li><li>motivation coaching</li><li>mindset preparation</li><li>mental health coping</li><li>personal accountability development</li><li>time management enhancement</li><li>network expansion</li></ul><p>At the same time, Effective Altruism values can also be integrated into these initiatives, to ensure that coaches and mentors pass on their willingness to help others achieve their full potential to the next generation of dreamers.</p><p><i><strong>1407 Graymalkin Group&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>1407 Graymalkin Group (GMG) is an initiative spearheaded by the authors of this shallow report. It is an organization of young high achievers from all over the world willing to volunteer as speakers, trainors and facilitators in events and activities geared towards communities and groups based in developing countries and underprivileged communities.</p><p>The primary offering of GMG is a platform whereby organizations from underserved communities and marginalized groups looking for volunteer speakers, facilitators and trainors for their events can browse at the different profiles to invite. These profiles will be curated by GMG from its roster of members. Should they also wish, GMG can recommend speakers and even help plan their events for maximum impact.</p><p>GMG also seeks to strengthen this network of international, high-achieving young volunteers which can foster opportunities for collaboration&nbsp;and growth.&nbsp;</p><p>GMG recognizes that a good network must provide accessibility, convenience, customization, assured performance, cost effectivity, brand acceleration and status improvement. Despite being a volunteer organization, GMG aims for the above-mentioned values in its endeavors.</p><p>Key resources offered by the Group include an e-platform available globally, with access to human capital, professional expertise, and possibilities of network growth and connections expansion. On the side, the website can also feature a portal containing youth opportunities from around the world, including grants, scholarships, and competitions.</p><p>As a platform, the Group seeks to connect three different markets:</p><ul><li>AUDIENCE&nbsp;looking for speakers</li><li>SPEAKERS looking to boost their CV and speaking experience</li><li>PATRONS looking to fund projects</li></ul><p>For the AUDIENCE, these are characterized as underprivileged schools, aid organizations and development institutions ideally from developing countries and underprivileged areas in the EU. GMG seeks to provide possibilities to connect them with inspiring young leaders from within and outside their country, with technical expertise for training and new perspectives, without the former having to spend excessively for their insights and mentorship. It solves the lack of access to high quality international speakers and trainors.</p><p>For the SPEAKERS, these are envisioned to be young professionals and achievers. GMG provides them the chance to reach an international audience to boost their professional experience and CV. At the same time, it also creates a valuable network of potential collaboration with fellow speakers, organizations and industries. At the end of the day, it solves the lack of access to an audience.</p><p>Lastly, for the PATRONS. The group includes CSOs, government and regional orgs, and foreign aid looking for advocacy projects to fund; individual funders looking for tax exemptions, and; corporations looking for CSR and tax credits. Through funding projects, events and speakerships, GMG gives patrons the chance to give back to the community and at the same time get reputational and financial credit through publication and tax benefits.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>V. CONCLUSION</strong></h3><p><i>\u201cOvercoming poverty is not a gesture of charity; it is an act of justice.\u201d&nbsp;</i></p><p>Nelson Mandela</p><p>The goal is a world where everyone receives the basic necessities not only just to survive, but rather to thrive as a human being. Blocking the access to this dream is the unimaginably high rate of poverty in the world, where 9.2%, or 689 million people, live on less than US$2 a day.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl24rgl0rz5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl24rgl0rz5\">[33]</a></sup></span></p><p>For sure, providing fish could solve this problem in the short term, but in the long run, there is a need to do more. Many people sincerely believe that education promises to be <i>that</i> messiah.</p><p>However, based on the data, we see how education is not nearly enough to pull people out of poverty. We need to help boost the effects of quality education by adding an essential, but underappreciated, socioeconomic ingredient: the power of networks and mentorship.</p><p>This essay highlighted a number of ideas:</p><ul><li>First, this cause is important due to the number of people it can potentially help by providing possibilities for networks for underprivileged individuals in marginalized and underserved communities can improve opportunities for inspiration, mentorship, and career success. A well-positioned series of projects has the potential to affect thousands of families and millions of lives.</li><li>Second, its tractability is improved because of exponential network effects, compounding interests due to time, and the nature of the target audience, where potential growth is a steep upwards curve. For marginal increases over a certain minimum spend (currently pegged at US$1000), this leads to greater than 1000X social return on investments.</li><li>Third, while many initiatives and funders focus on education, there is an apparent lack of supporting services to amplify its impact, including networking and mentorship. This is a gap that Open Philanthropy can sufficiently address.</li><li>Lastly, the authors outlined two existing initiatives as examples: Sociov, a coaching and mentoring platform based in the Philippines, and; 1407 Graymalkin Group, an international network of volunteers seeking to lend their experience and expertise to underprivileged communities around the world. While these are prime examples of standalone projects which Open Philanthropy can fund, there are many more possibilities, including adding networking and mentorship components to current education and training initiatives.</li></ul><p>Based on these metrics and back-of-the-envelope computation, the authors hope that Open Philanthropy finds the cause of networking and mentorship sufficient in scope and impact to fund, yielding social benefits and ROI.</p><p>What is uncountable, yet equally significant, would the improvement in the daily lives of the people touched by these projects, however small they may be. These can serve as baby steps towards the achievement of their hopes, dreams and aspirations.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with these communities and these volunteers, may we all light the way towards the path of the future.&nbsp;</p><p>\u25a0</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn6kp095zg9q6\"><span

We argue that one, currently neglected, strategy of making forecasting more useful is to focus on making domain experts better forecasters. The current dominant strategy to make forecasting useful relies on the use of aggregate forecasts from a pool of self-selecting forecasters, providing feedback and incentives, identifying high-performing forecasters from this pool, and focussing on forecasts from this subset. We refer to this approach as forecast consulting and suggest the model is similar to other forms of consultancy. Significant resources are being spent on training and identifying high-performing forecasters with some of this focus being to give these forecasters the time, space, and training needed to gain relevant domain knowledge. Currently little is done to encourage existing domain experts to become better forecasters themselves or to identify those with innate potential. We believe that encouraging and helping experts to become better forecasters has potential benefits that far exceed what is feasible through the current dominant strategy of employing generalist forecasters as consultants alone.&nbsp;</p><h1>Context on forecasting</h1><p>There is <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/forecasting/\">some consensus</a> in the EA community that forecasting, as commonly practised in the community, is important and helpful. Forecasting is \u201cbig if true\u201d: In principle, it is an excellent way to summarise existing knowledge. It can help guide and improve relevant and important decisions by making implicit intuitions and assessments explicit, and by revealing uncertainty and variation in opinions. Forecasting can be understood as a thought process, that can unmask blind spots, help make disagreements clear, and aid in synthesising evidence. For many, forecasts are also a form of \u201cnews source\u201d that helps them interpret and contextualise current events.&nbsp;</p><p>In the following, we focus on forecasting that is explicitly used to inform decision-making. In this context, forecasting can provide value if</p><ul><li>We can select a useful forecast target.</li><li>The forecasters can forecast the target quantity meaningfully. This means both that it is possible to forecast the target, and that the forecasters have the required expertise to understand the target and make a forecast.</li><li>The forecasts are \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cgood enough\u201d to inform the decision being made.</li><li>If practised by decision-makers the exercise of forecasting, rather than the output of any given forecast, may be beneficial by helping to structure and formalise, synthesise evidence, calibrate expectations, and foster useful debate.</li><li>Relevant people trust good forecasts and use them as part of their decision-making process.</li></ul><p>In the following, we argue that we can achieve our goal of improving decision-making through forecasting if more focus is given to increasing the use of forecasting by domain experts and improving their forecasting practice. <i>Note: we\u2019re using the term \u201cexpert\u201d very broadly here. An expert could be an academic, but could also be a policy maker or someone with personal experience and deep knowledge of the subject.</i>&nbsp;</p><h1>The current relationship between forecasting and domain expertise</h1><p>Today, the overlap between forecasters, domain experts, and policymakers does not appear to be very large. This is despite many years of research which indicates that forecasting may lead to improved decision-making, which ultimately both experts and policymakers are interested in. Most forecasters on public platforms like Metaculus or Manifold Markets are not initially experts in the areas they forecast, and as far as we are aware, this appears to be generally true across the wider space (though we have heard of niche efforts in some domain areas, for example, the US defence community where those with expert knowledge are encouraged to forecast and sporadic efforts in infectious disease epidemiology). The dominant strategy to explicitly combine forecasting and decision making is what we call \u201cforecasting as consulting\u201d. Policymakers and domain experts determine what they would need forecasts on, forecasters consult on what a good operationalisation of the question could look like and then provide predictions. This approach is easy to operationalise and generalisable across domains, but in our eyes ultimately provides limited value compared to other alternatives we will explore in this text.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cForecasting as consulting\u201d usually works by either eliciting forecasts from a large crowd, or by employing a smaller group of experienced general forecasters. On both approaches, significant amounts of money are spent:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The prize pool for tournaments currently open at Metaculus is about $50k</li><li>Manifold Markets have received a $1m grant from the FTX Future Fund to further develop their platform (which is mostly aimed at a non-specialist audience)</li><li>Metaculus recently was awarded a $5.5m grant from Open Phil to advance forecasting as a social good. Some of the money will be used to pay professional forecasters.</li><li>In February, Metaculus asked professional forecasters to predict nuclear risk in the context of the Ukraine war.</li><li>The Swift Centre for applied forecasting (https://www.swiftcentre.org/) received a $2m grant from the FTX Future Fund to hire professional forecasters (among other things)</li></ul><p>The implicit assumption behind the \u201cforecasting as consulting\u201d approach is that people with a specific aptitude and interest in forecasting, given enough training, experience, and time to synthesise sources of evidence, can make useful contributions, regardless of significant domain expertise on the forecast target. This may be true, in a similar way that consultants in other fields are thought to make useful contributions.</p><p>Generalist forecasters usually acquire and benefit from domain expertise in the areas they forecast in. Making a good forecast usually requires knowledge of past trends, current developments, and factors that might influence the forecast target in the future. Much of this domain expertise can likely be learnt quickly for many forecast questions. Being able to do this well, combined with understanding what expertise is required for a given target, may be one of the generalist forecaster skills that is linked to good performance. Some successful forecasters are known to spend significant amounts of time on research and evidence synthesis for their forecasts, potentially accumulating significant subject matter expertise. Most forecasters, however, are likely unable to allocate the amount of time this research requires and fewer are likely able to dedicate sufficient time across multiple domains.&nbsp;</p><p>The current approach to making forecasting impactful could be summarised as follows:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Developing a large community of forecasters, with a particular focus on identifying and training top-performing forecasters.</li><li>Working closely with decision-makers and domain experts to identify promising forecast targets and provide useful insights.</li><li>Encourage forecasters to gain the subject area expertise required to understand the forecast target, identify relevant sources of evidence, and synthesise this evidence into a forecast.</li><li>Develop a pool of skilled forecasters with the hope they apply these skills more widely in impactful organisations.</li></ul><h1>Turning experts into forecasters</h1><p>We argue that we should pay more attention to the opposite approach: encouraging existing domain experts to become better forecasters both in public and in the organisations, they operate within.&nbsp;</p><h2>We can get better forecasts</h2><p>It seems likely that a domain expert with the same aptitude for forecasting and given the same training as a generalist forecaster would outperform on questions in their domain. It also appears likely that to forecast targets in rapidly evolving areas of interest, for example, zoonotic spill-over events, trained domain experts will outperform initially regardless of forecaster aptitude as the generalist forecaster requires time to understand the forecast target, gather sources of evidence, and synthesise them.&nbsp;</p><p>We base these conclusions on the following. Domain experts can draw on rich experience in their areas of interest that may help contextualise the forecast target, distinguish signal from noise, already be aware of the various sources of evidence (for example other domain experts) and their various limitations, and identify key details that non-experts might overlook. We think it is likely that domain experts could be trained in the same way that we currently train forecasters. We also think it is likely that experts could be encouraged to be active forecasters given the right communication and incentives. We are not aware of any evidence supporting our claims but think that our prior on this being beneficial is sufficiently strong to make a good case that this kind of evidence should be collected. One potential flaw in our argument is that it may be the case that those selected via open access platforms have an inherently higher potential to be good forecasters, but we consider this unlikely given the limited populations of these platforms and the generally weak evidence that forecasting ability is an innate rather than learnable skill.</p><p>Some forecast targets require nuanced domain expertise in a way that may prevent non-experts from making useful predictions without a large time commitment to acquire additional expertise. Sometimes, questions are important, but require a large amount of context and domain knowledge. One example is this Metaculus question on the <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/9487/omicron-generation-interval/\">generation interval for Omicron</a> (authored by us), which asks about a parameter that is important in infectious disease modelling and that influenced, at least in the UK, decision makers\u2019 response to the Omicron variant in late 2021 and early 2022. The definition and estimation of that parameter, however, are complex and so prone to different biases that need to be disentangled. Given the minimal community response to this question, the level of uncertainty in the forecast, and the lack of updates over time as new evidence became available, we are unsure what proportion of those forecasting on it grasped the forecast target fully, and if they did, whether or not they were able to sufficiently weigh the available literature. This means at least for this forecast question we, as domain experts in this area, would not feel able to recommend this forecast to decision-makers in our networks. If others feel similarly this would render the effort spent outlining the question, and the time spent by consulting forecasters meaningless (aside from any training benefits). Similarly, existing domain knowledge is indispensable in very fast-moving situations in which generalist forecasters did not have the time to acquire expertise or sources of evidence from which to \u201cborrow\u201d expertise. Generalist forecasters struggled to produce forecasts that weren\u2019t immediately identifiable as incorrect by domain experts for the recent monkeypox outbreak. For example, initially endemic cases were ignored, leading to spuriously low initial forecasts, and then time-varying ascertainment bias was not accounted for, leading to overestimation of the growth rate. For this forecast question, there was also some uncertainty as to whether the target was infections or reported cases and this led to changes of several orders of magnitude in the forecast. We are currently working on evaluating these early monkeypox forecasts to understand whether they would have added utility over a generic domain area baseline. We note that experts were invited to contribute to these forecasts but that there were zero responses to the invitation from the last author of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00127-3\">this study</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Current incentive mechanisms don\u2019t strongly encourage forecasters to acquire a deep understanding, or to collect information ahead of time, such that it is immediately useful when an unforeseen situation occurs, and predictions are urgently needed. Ege Erdil recently published a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uDz4ydD8dZBdm9PgZ/forecasts-are-not-enough\">piece</a> in which he used earthquakes as an example. The idea is that you can make a reasonable forecast about earthquakes without any deep understanding of plate tectonics based on past distributions and recent trends. Conversely, a deep understanding of plate tectonics wouldn\u2019t immediately translate into a good forecast.&nbsp;For generalist forecasters with little prior domain expertise, a key skill is being able to rapidly identify which sources of evidence are of most use and focus on synthesising these. Conversely, for domain experts, who already have large amounts of domain knowledge, the skill is to instead learn how to identify what areas of their expertise are required to forecast a given question and which are not. It is important to realise that the concept of parsimonious models, mental or otherwise, is already well known and practised in many domain areas and so it is likely that many domain experts already possess this skill to varying degrees.</p><p>Domain experts are also most likely in a position where they can actively improve predictions in the future by developing new forecasting methods or by identifying new data that should be collected.&nbsp;For example, one of the authors (SA) authored an initial estimate for the generation time of the Omicron variant which was used by decision-makers in later 2021 and led to the development of the related Metaculus question. Along with other researchers, he then authored a follow-up study exploring these initial estimates for bias.</p><h2>The most relevant forecasts are not made by members of the forecasting community</h2><p>Even if trained domain experts did not perform any better than professional forecasters, we still see value in training experts in forecasting. This is because most forecasting is informal and implicit and happens in boards, committees, and conversations between decision-makers. Professional forecasters simply do not have access to these areas as it stands though this may change in the future if domains recognise the value (and this is shown conclusively) of generalist forecasters within decision-making loops. In addition, often information that is needed to inform the most relevant decisions is confidential (or entails information hazards) and cannot easily be shared with external forecasters. In many instances, this may be less of an issue when employing professional forecasters who can sign non-disclosure agreements, but this may be difficult to organise over short periods and requires significant belief on the part of decision-makers that the forecasts produced will be worth the effort of facilitating this.&nbsp;</p><p>Unless the forecasting community can position trained forecasters into key decision-making positions, the relevant circles are difficult to access for the forecasting community. The current model of \u201cforecasting as consulting\u201d is one way in which we increase the use of forecasting by decision-makers. It is hard to quantify how much success this approach has had in the past (and it would be good to collect more formal evidence on this) or how much success we should expect given the significant resources being allocated to this aim. Even if the current model is very successful, it can only capture a small fraction of potential forecasting questions that can be formalised within the timelines required for critical day-to-day decision-making.</p><p>In contrast to \u201cforecasting as consulting\u201d-type models of collaboration, teaching experts how to forecast may have a lasting effect even in situations where no formal forecasts are elicited by improving the way experts and decision-makers reason about uncertainty and approach decisions. Lastly, training forecasters may also serve to establish a valuable point of contact in the relevant circles, potentially increasing the uptake and utility of traditional forecasting as consulting.&nbsp;</p><h2>Traditional experts can make their forecasts heard</h2><p>Forecasts, even very good ones, will only be able to influence decision-making if decision-makers take them seriously. Similarly, they can only be used to justify a decision if they are being viewed as a respectable source by the public otherwise, decision-makers will likely need to obfuscate their usage. This is much easier for traditional experts as they have prior work in the area on which to justify their views, they have an established network that likely includes the decision makers they seek to influence, and because in general credentials are still widely respected across domains and by the public.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to this, domain experts are more likely to be able to contextualise and explain their forecasts, or forecasts from the wider community, within the wider domain area. This is particularly key for forecast targets that may be sensitive or in areas where quantitative forecasts are unusual. In some circumstances, this may be critical for encouraging the uptake of forecasts. Similarly, as experts are typically operating with a much greater depth of domain knowledge it is more likely they will be able to identify the implications of forecasts.&nbsp;</p><h1>Potential solutions</h1><p>This is a complex area and clearly, more research is needed to understand the potential trade-offs of proven generalist forecasts gaining domain area expertise versus domain experts gaining forecasting expertise. We believe that it is worthwhile to encourage domain experts to become better forecasters and provide some suggestions for how this could be approached. The overall goals we have in mind are to get domain experts interested in forecasting, to provide incentives for them to interact with forecasting, and to make it easy to train them in how to forecast. Our list is by no means complete and we do not think the suggestions are necessarily optimal.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Provide easy mechanisms for domain experts to ask questions of interest to them.</li><li>Make it easy for experts to identify other experts interested and active in forecasting.</li><li>Make it easy for domain experts to share their forecasts and comparative track records with others.</li><li>Make it easy for experts to obtain meaningful forecast outputs, including<ul><li>Full forecasting data in convenient formats</li><li>Making it possible to filter by forecaster domain expertise</li></ul></li><li>Provide free training for domain experts and policymakers in forecasting and incentivise its uptake.</li><li>Create titles/positions that confer money/prestige to experts willing to engage in public forecasting. For example, letting experts become part of a selective task force. This is needed as public forecasting has a large downside for domain experts (i.e if they are incorrect) and little upside which is generally not the case for generalist forecasters.</li><li>Encourage more group forecasting, with hybrid groups of generalist forecasters and domain experts.</li><li>To support our assumptions on the value of domain knowledge unbiased research is needed to compare generalist and domain expert forecasters after adjusting for time spent forecasting.

Both authors qualify as \u201cexperts\u201d in epidemiology and might benefit from more resources being attributed to domain experts who engage in forecasting.&nbsp;</p><h2>About the Authors</h2><p>Nikos Bosse is currently pursuing a PhD in Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, focusing on evaluating infectious disease forecasts. He also works as a research coordinator for the prediction platform Metaculus and is training to be a medical doctor. His past work includes developing an application to elicit forecasts of COVID-19 case and death numbers, which was used to <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.01.21266598v1.full\">compare human and model-based predictions of COVID-19 in Poland and Germany</a>. He also developed an <a href=\"https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils\">R package</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07090\">scoringutils</a>, that facilitates the evaluation and comparison of forecasts from different models. In his capacity as research coordinator for Metaculus as well as PhD student he has worked on forecasting in epidemiological settings and believes that forecasting by experts as well as generalists can be very valuable. To help foster the forecasting community by providing information for forecasters and forecasting researchers he founded the <a href=\"https://forecasting.wiki\">Forecasting Wiki</a>. He has been involved in the EA community for several years and is trying to help make forecasting a more useful tool for decision-making. He has done a fair share of forecasting himself but is not a power user of any of the large forecasting platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sam Abbott is a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine with a background in mathematical modelling. Since early 2020 he has worked as part of the academic response to the COVID-19 pandemic focussing on real-time analyses, nowcasting, and short-term forecasting. He provided short-term forecasts and estimates of the effective reproduction number to government advisory bodies which were then aggregated along with those from other research groups and used to help inform government policy-makers. He has co-authored multiple other studies used to inform national and international decision-making throughout the pandemic. Methods he has developed are used within public health agencies as part of their decision-making processes as well as by other researchers. For more on his research see <a href=\"https://samabbott.co.uk/posts/2022-04-11-a-very-biased-view-of-my-recent-research/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://epiforecasts.io/posts/2022-03-25-rt-reflections/index.html\">here</a>. His interest in human forecasts is mainly driven by an interest in synthesising expert opinion, and the importance of evaluating forecasts from decision makers. He is sceptical of the value of aggregated forecasts from generalists but open to the idea that some people are better able to rapidly synthesise evidence than others and that this is a useful skill to encourage. He does not identify as an effective altruist. He is a sporadic user of Metaculus, mainly forecasting on questions linked to his domain expertise.</p>", "user": {"username": "Sam Abbott"}}, {"_id": "7LGg2u8v2ebQe9nxn", "title": "[Cause Exploration Prizes] Reducing global childhood sexual abuse", "postedAt": "2022-08-24T10:55:29.181Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This essay was submitted to Open Philanthropy's&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-exploration-prizes/\"><i>Cause Exploration Prizes</i></a><i>&nbsp;contest.</i></p><p><i>If you're seeing this in summer 2022, we'll be posting many submissions in a short period.

What is the problem?</h2><p>Childhood sexual abuse is a common, preventable global problem associated with long-term negative outcomes for the victim and society. Current preventative strategies are uncoordinated and underfunded. A global effort to reduce childhood sexual abuse as a public health issue is needed.</p><h2>1.2. What are possible interventions?</h2><p>Open philanthropy may consider funding: (i) research into the prevention of childhood sexual abuse by targeting men who are sexually attracted to children; (ii) lobbying for more coordinated law enforcement response to childhood sexual abuse; (iii) lobbying to make child marriage illegal; (iv) lobbying for online childhood sexual abuse imagery to be tackled by tech companies; (v) building an academic field dedicated to the prevention of child sexual abuse.</p><h2>1.3. Who else is working on this?</h2><p>The main grant-maker funding this area is the Oak Foundation who awarded $61 million in grants in 2021, focussing on interventions that are effective and scalable. Open Philanthropy would need to ensure it can add unique value over and above these efforts.</p><h1>2. Importance</h1><h2>2.1. Definition and prevalence of childhood sexual abuse</h2><p>Childhood sexual abuse is broadly defined by UNICEF as any sexual activity imposed by an adult on a child (under the age of 18 years) against which the child is entitled to protection by criminal law.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz6yu7hxvfm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz6yu7hxvfm\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It encompasses: (i) coercion to engage in harmful sexual activity; (ii) commercial sexual exploitation; (iii) images of child sexual abuse; (iv) child prostitution, sexual slavery, sexual trafficking, sale of children for sexual purposes and forced marriage. Some studies take a narrower definition of sexual abuse, including only forced intercourse or touching (sometimes called \u2018contact\u2019 abuse) and restricting the definition to children to those under 15 years old.</p><p>The global prevalence of childhood sexual abuse is difficult to measure with significant variation between studies. Two independent meta-analyses of sexual abuse perpetrated against female children calculated a prevalence of roughly 25%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefolf6si0djef\"><sup><a href=\"#fnolf6si0djef\">[2]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdkhpx6rylsd\"><sup><a href=\"#fndkhpx6rylsd\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This proportion is higher than a previous meta-analysis, which calculated a prevalence of 16.4% - 19.7% in girls and of 6.8% - 8.8% in boys.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvmlvb0adyt9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvmlvb0adyt9\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Highest rates were found for girls in Australia and for boys in Africa, with Asia having the lowest rates for both genders.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvmlvb0adyt9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvmlvb0adyt9\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Worldwide, UNICEF estimates that 120 million girls (more than 10%) have experienced forced intercourse or other forced sexual acts.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz6yu7hxvfm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz6yu7hxvfm\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is consistent with a previous meta-analysis estimating that 9% of girls and 3% of boys experienced forced sexual intercourse.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr7v1zegdejm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr7v1zegdejm\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>There are methodological considerations when determining the true prevalence. It has been argued that childhood sexual abuse reported in retrospect when participants are in adulthood is more reliable (due to children being too embarrassed to report). While this may be true, it also introduces a source of recall bias, with potentially a long time lag from the exposure to it being measured.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe a conservative estimate for the prevalence of any sexual abuse in childhood would be 10-20% for girls and 5-8% for boys. My sense is that reported figures are more likely to be an underestimation, with a substantial number of victims not willing to disclose their abuse. My lower bound estimate for the prevalence of \u2018contact\u2019 sexual abuse, would be 5% for girls and 1% for boys.</p><h2>2.2. Child marriage</h2><p>Child marriage is legal in many countries and is common in parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa as shown in Figure 1. There are obvious gradations to this issue; a girl marrying at the age of 17 is quite different from one marrying before the age of 15. In sub-Saharan Africa, between 2015 and 2021, more than 10% of girls were married before their fifteenth birthday.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgy8fq3uzz7r\"><sup><a href=\"#fngy8fq3uzz7r\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_140 140w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_280 280w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_420 420w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_560 560w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_840 840w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_980 980w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_1120 1120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_1260 1260w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/37dbbd8659d893817952f05c6a9737b614b076ad81729f3c.png/w_1380 1380w\"><figcaption>Figure&nbsp;1. Rates of child marriage from Our World in Data</figcaption></figure><p>More than legitimising sexual activity with a child, these marriages are associated with loss of education, increased risk of domestic violence and are gender-based discrimination. In countries where this practice is common, there has been a promising reduction over the last few years, as shown in Figure 2. This may be partly attributable to a campaign by UNICEF. Globally, the overall prevalence has decreased over the past ten years from one in four girls to one in five today.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgy8fq3uzz7r\"><sup><a href=\"#fngy8fq3uzz7r\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_170 170w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_340 340w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_510 510w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_680 680w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_850 850w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_1020 1020w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_1190 1190w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_1360 1360w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_1530 1530w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b6132971f17b2c0e9f031148ec051e7b352eedc36e5dc173.png/w_1618 1618w\"><figcaption>Figure&nbsp;2. Change in child marriage by country, from Our World in Data</figcaption></figure><h2>2.3. Online child sexual abuse imagery</h2><p>Another indication of the scale of this problem is in the rise of online imagery of abuse. These videos and photos are a permanent record of crimes against children and survivors report being revictimized by their distribution.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffoti1vd7lz6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfoti1vd7lz6\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This has risen exponentially due to the widespread availability of broadband internet, smartphone cameras and file sharing sites.</p><p>In 1998, there were approximately 3000 reports of child sexual abuse imagery.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsqpkw2yhxra\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsqpkw2yhxra\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; In 2014, this surpassed 1 million reports. By 2018, 45 million photos and videos were flagged by tech companies as child sex abuse imagery. By 2019, 70 million pieces of content were reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook has been responsible for 90% of reports of child sexual abuse imagery.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsqpkw2yhxra\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsqpkw2yhxra\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The reason behind this is simply that Facebook scans all images that are uploaded through its site, so are detecting it more than other encrypted services. In this way, they are an industry leader in the detection and reporting of this content. By comparison Apple (with encrypts iMessage) sent 43 reports in 2018. There is now widespread concern and campaigns against the encryption of Facebook messenger.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq2i9hl4z09h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq2i9hl4z09h\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;AWS do not try to detect child sexual abuse imagery; Apple does not scan cloud storage.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffoti1vd7lz6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfoti1vd7lz6\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Dropbox, Google and Microsoft only scan for illegal images when these are shared but not when images are uploaded. Snapchat and Yahoo scan for photos but not videos.&nbsp;</p><p>The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children operates a Cybertipline which has received over 82 million reports.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1go5095xva4j\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1go5095xva4j\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;They have reviewed over 322 million images and videos to locate victims, with over 19,100 children identified. Over time, there is a trend towards more egregious sexual content. Actively traded cases were associated with more extreme content and prepubescent victims. Girls are most often the victims, though boys are more likely to be subjected to extreme abuse.</p><p>An Interpol analysis of the International Child Sexual Exploitation Database, which contains over one million media files, was released in 2018.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefagalw7fdspe\"><sup><a href=\"#fnagalw7fdspe\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Of these, 466,000 depicted identified children while 615,150 were of unidentified children. In this dataset, the most common age of victims was prepubescent (56%), followed by pubescent (25.4%), and infants/toddlers (4.3%). &nbsp;</p><p>To aid identification of victims, Interpol strongly recommends increasing resources to law enforcement.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefagalw7fdspe\"><sup><a href=\"#fnagalw7fdspe\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The lack of resources reduces the potential for victim identification worldwide. Interpol also recommends harmonisation approaches across countries and jurisdictions, and interconnection of law enforcement databases worldwide. Convicted offenders are thought to constitute the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019, with many more unidentified victims that never come to the attention of law enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>There is clearly a balance between online privacy and detection of child sexual abuse images. One proposed compromise would be to \u2018finger-print\u2019 images before messages are encrypted and match this to databases of known childhood sexual abuse imagery. However, these types of technological solutions do not seem to be a priority of tech companies and would require external pressure.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.4. The long-term impact on the victim</h2><p>An umbrella review (a systematic review of meta-analyses) found associations between childhood sexual abuse and a host of negative health and social outcomes in adulthood.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpzpgsxoq0w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpzpgsxoq0w\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Of the 28 outcomes examined, a significant association was shown in 26, see Figure 3 for the strength of associations.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_490 490w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_980 980w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_1470 1470w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_1960 1960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_2450 2450w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_2940 2940w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_3430 3430w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_3920 3920w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_4410 4410w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac99f07cd07b41b1e339789c7d5eda2c90931b2978a9b7bf.png/w_4888 4888w\"></figure><p>Figure&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Risk estimates of long-term outcomes following childhood sexual abuse, from Hailes et al.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpzpgsxoq0w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpzpgsxoq0w\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;licensed under CC-BY</p><p>The authors also estimated the Population Attributable Fraction; the cases of a particular disease or condition that is attributable to the risk factor.

Cost to the economy</h2><p>&nbsp;The lifetime economic costs of non-fatal substantiated child abuse (not limited to sexual abuse), in the USA was estimated at $122 billion in 2010 (roughly $166 billion today), based on 579,000 victims and $210,012 total economic costs per victim.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref30lgsokswr6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn30lgsokswr6\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These costs comprised of productivity loss, healthcare, child welfare and criminal justice costs, with the biggest contributor being productivity costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Assuming a 10% prevalence of childhood sexual abuse in the current USA population of 329.5 million, we would expect 329,500 victims of childhood sexual abuse. Therefore, I estimate the total lifetime economic cost of childhood sexual abuse in the USA may be around $69 billion based on 2010 values ($93 billion today).&nbsp;</p><p>In another study, Fang et al.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn2vo9xjnbsr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn2vo9xjnbsr\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;estimated the economic cost of child abuse in East Asia and the Pacific to exceed $160 billion (in 2004 dollars) based on economic losses due to death, disease, and health risk behaviours attributable to child abuse, this is equivalent to $251 billion today.</p><p>A 2019 economic analysis of the cost of childhood sexual abuse to the US, calculated this as $9.3 billion.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi4gxzd8eqpl\"><sup><a href=\"#fni4gxzd8eqpl\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, this is based on 40,387 new substantiated cases of non-fatal childhood sexual abuse and 20 substantiated cases of fatal childhood sexual abuse. Substantiated cases of sexual abuse are likely to be a gross underestimation of the true prevalence. Substantiated cases of sexual abuse have a prevalence of 1%, approximately a factor of ten less than my conservative estimate of sexual abuse prevalence.</p><p>In rough equivalence to my estimation, the economic cost of contact child sexual abuse in England and Wales (population 60 million) was estimated at \u00a310.1 billion in 2019 ($12.25 billion US dollars).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkwle8cmplie\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkwle8cmplie\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;By including only contact child sexual abuse (exclude victims of purely online exploitation) they estimated a yearly prevalence of 2.3%.</p><h2>2.6. Disability Associated Life Years</h2><p>The number of DALYS lost to childhood sexual abuse was estimated by a study funded by the Gates Foundation,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5nnc8qhiw1h\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5nnc8qhiw1h\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which examined global risk factors for disease. The authors do not give a clear number of DALYS for childhood sexual abuse in the article or supplementary material. However, the combination of childhood sexual abuse and bullying accounted for &lt;0.5% of the global attributable DALYS for males and females. I believe this is an under-estimation, as DALYS were only calculated based on childhood sexual abuse being a risk factor for depression and alcohol use disorder, whereas (as described above) it is likely to be a risk factor for a wide range of negative outcomes.</p><p>A separate Lancet study by Bellis et al.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx3891xkbthr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx3891xkbthr\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;examined the health consequences of all adverse childhood experiences (including but not exclusive to sexual abuse) in Europe and North America. They estimated that these adverse experiences in total resulted in 37.5 million DALYS per annum. Reducing the number of children exposed to adverse events by 10%, was estimated to result in annual savings of 3 million DALYS.</p><p>I believe that reducing the number of children exposed to adverse events by 10%, through reducing sexual abuse is a realistic target. To meet Open Philanthropy\u2019s current bar which values one DALY at $100,000 and expects 1000x return per dollar spent, I estimate that the cost of this would have to be less than $300 million per annum. One problem with this estimation, is that measuring the global impact of changes is likely to take many years and, as stated, the primary outcome of childhood sexual abuse is subject to wide variability in its measurement.</p><h2>2.7. Definition and prevalence of paedophilia</h2><p>It is an uncomfortable fact that a proportion of men are sexually attracted to children (the proportion of women is small to negligible). Diagnostic classification through DSM V, defines men attracted to pre-pubescent children as paedophiles and those attracted to pubescent children as hebephiles.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefadnqy8a2gv8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnadnqy8a2gv8\">[19]</a></sup></span></p><p>The consensus is that this attraction is immutable and inherent within the individual; that is to say, as with other sexual orientations, it cannot be altered.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2nvwqf2nv9b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2nvwqf2nv9b\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Such a sexual preference manifests in puberty/early adulthood and remains stable throughout life.&nbsp;</p><p>Treatment does exist to reduce sexual drive and to increase empathy with victims, which will be discussed in more detail below. While not all sexual abusers of children would be classified as paedophiles or hebephiles, these conditions are inherently linked.</p><p>While any sexual contact with a child or viewing of child sexual imagery is a crime, being sexually attracted to children is not a choice. It is also true that sexual attraction does not necessarily result in criminal acts. Indeed, there are online communities of men attracted to children dedicated to them avoiding acting on these impulses.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd2kbggw5g8o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd2kbggw5g8o\">[21]</a></sup></span></p><p>The true prevalence of paedophilia is even more difficult to measure than child sexual abuse. One systematic review put the prevalence of sexual interest in children between 2% and 24%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqkcv605i9bp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqkcv605i9bp\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Another expert puts the upper limit for the prevalence of paedophilia at 5%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2nvwqf2nv9b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2nvwqf2nv9b\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><p>A potential mechanism for reducing child sexual abuse is targeting men who are attracted to children, the vast majority of whom will be undetected by the criminal justice system.</p><h2>2.8. Unmeasured costs</h2><p>The above estimations on the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse and its costs have a wide range of uncertainty. However, I believe the above data can only ever capture part of the impact of childhood sexual abuse. The emotional pain of a child going through this abuse is difficult to quantify but cannot be dismissed. Furthermore, the revictimisation of abuse survivors through the online trading and consumption of abuse imagery is not a cost I have measured but is also a nontrivial consequence of the status quo.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe there is an ethical obligation of a society to acknowledge this abuse exists and take steps to tackle it. I believe society would be better for having online spaces with substantially reduced availability and trading of child sex abuse imagery.</p><h1>3. Tractability</h1><p>There are number of potential interventions that could reduce the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse. Most of these have preliminary evidence at best. They are likely to be most effective as part of a coordinated, global strategy. Before this can reasonably be undertaken, the effectiveness and scalability of the interventions need further evaluation.</p><h2>3.1. Pharmacological</h2><p>A summary of pharmacological interventions is given in Table 2, mainly taken from a recent systematic review for paedophilic disorder and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefol64vvlpu5m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnol64vvlpu5m\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In total, 12 randomised controlled trials were identified.

This is widely tolerated as a treatment for prostate cancer, however further research is needed before it can be widely used as a strategy.</li></ol><p>Overall, pharmacological management of paedophilia could be highly effective through reducing individuals\u2019 sexual drive. It may work best as one part of a holistic treatment plan involving psychological support and reduced access to online sexual abuse material. It could be utilised in both primary prevention (men who have not been convicted of crimes) and secondary prevention (as part of sentencing for men who have been convicted of crimes against children). Whether this can be scaled up across Europe and North America in a cost-effective manner is unknown.</p><h2>3.2. Psychological treatment</h2><p>There is a lack of evidence for psychological treatment to reduce offending.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcjejafavy1r\"><sup><a href=\"#fncjejafavy1r\">[38]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;One meta-analysis concluded that available evidence cannot establish effect of any psychological treatment on sexual offences against children.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxgjleqgk97o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxgjleqgk97o\">[39]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Despite many studies being conducted, only a small number met minimum standards and fewer provided useable data.</p><p>Development and evaluation of psychological treatments would benefit from further research. In other conditions, psychological therapy can be delivered online without a reduction in efficacy \u2013 this could be particularly helpful for online sexual offenders.</p><h2>3.3. Pilot projects</h2><p>The Dunkelfeld Prevention Project<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff9qe1vv7zrp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf9qe1vv7zrp\">[37]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;was launched in Germany in 2005 and now has ten centres. These provide support for men who are sexually attracted to children but are not in contact with law enforcement. It was initially funded by the Volkswagen Foundation and latterly by the German government. It utilises pharmacological and psychological approaches to reduce offending.&nbsp;</p><p>In its first ten years, it had over 2000 enquiries, with 935 men completing a baseline assessment. This pilot suggests that men are willing to undergo treatment, outside the criminal justice system. Of some concern, 90% of participants continued to access child sexual abuse imagery and 20% reported further child sexual abuse offences. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the project managed to reduce risk factors associated with offending.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh7evcc63ki\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh7evcc63ki\">[40]</a></sup></span></p><p>Prevent It is a Swedish based pilot intervention of anonymous online therapy for men who wish to stop using online child sexual abuse material. It has completed an initial study, with results awaited.</p><h2>3.4. Law enforcement</h2><p>There is already international collaboration of law enforcement against child sex offenders, such as Interpol, an international police organisation with 192 member countries. It has a Crimes Against Children Unity which primarily focusses on sexual abuse and exploitation. It administers the International Child Sexual Exploitation police database which is used for victim identification. Interpol strongly recommended improved cooperation between countries. At present, enforcement against this online activity is overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material. Lack of resources has led to an ability to identify child victims recorded in online abuse material.</p><h2>3.5. Lobbying against child marriage</h2><p>Campaigning for a global age marriage of 18 could significantly reduce the risk of childhood sexual abuse for girls, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp; It may also result in a wider cultural shift away from child marriage. This could be a potentially low cost, high gain intervention to reduce the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse. A reduction in the number of girls undergoing child marriage is one indication that campaigns by organisations such as UNICEF are succeeding with this strategy.</p><h2>3.6. Reducing online distribution of child abuse imagery</h2><p>Hash values which act as \u2018digital fingerprints\u2019 have traditionally been used to identify child sexual abuse imagery online, matching new images with a database of known illegal material. However, hash values can be easily altered by making small changes to the image. An emerging tool is PhotoDNA developed by Microsoft which matches images to known databases of illegal material, even if the original image has been altered.</p><p>The rise in videos and streaming of child abuse represents further challenges for online detection by law enforcement. This requires ongoing technological solutions in response, which requires an increased emphasis from tech companies.</p><p>Open Philanthropy is well placed to start a dialogue on the limits of online privacy and the balance that must be struck to reduce the production and distribution of sexual abuse imagery.</p><h2>3.7. Building an academic field</h2><p>There are few academics or clinicians dedicated to the prevention childhood sexual abuse. If novel interventions are to be delivered, credibility and prestige needs to be given to those willing to dedicate their career to this problem.</p><p>Open Philanthropy may consider funding each part of this pipeline: funding early career researchers to investigate interventions to reduce childhood sexual abuse, funding conferences for networking and sharing information, funding professorships for more established academics.</p><h1>4. Neglectedness</h1><p>Preventing child sexual abuse has historically been neglected, mainly relying on small charities and governmental initiatives. World Childhood Foundation, a Swedish based charity has contributed $60 million to 600 projects since its inception in 1999.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmpugz2rq4ko\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmpugz2rq4ko\">[41]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;50% of projects contribute to child supportive environment and relationships, 20% contribute to child online safety, 30% contribute to child focussed response to abuse.</p><p>International organisations such as the WHO and UNICEF have campaigns to reduce global violence against women and girls. UNICEF has a campaign against child marriage, which appears to be making progress.</p><p>The Oak Foundation has recently developed a programme to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefheyotf3vtmj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnheyotf3vtmj\">[42]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is the most equivalent funder (in terms of philosophy and scale) to Open Philanthropy in this space. They have programme of grants focussed on lobbying tech companies, building a global consensus to reduce child abuse, and evaluating preventative interventions.&nbsp;</p><p>They have been building this programme since 2018 and last year awarded $51.9 million to projects (average of $600,000) to prevent child abuse. They aim to rigorously evaluate programmes at are most effective at preventing the perpetration of child sexual abuse and ensuring these programmes can be scaled up effectively. Their grants are similar to the tractability suggestions I have outlined above.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqvsfr1ebz4a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqvsfr1ebz4a\">[43]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1>5. Potential risks and downsides</h1><p>Childhood sexual abuse is a controversial topic which poses some degree of reputational risk to Open Philanthropy. There are good reasons for paedophilia to be so socially stigmatised; by bringing the topic to wider attention there is a risk of legitimising it as a sexual preference. Any move to normalise sexual attraction to children could reduce its taboo. While treating these men with compassion will face opposition from some quarters. Any move to support paedophiles through groups or online communities\u2019 risks being compromised for nefarious purposes. Improving online detection of abuse imagery (for example by lobbying Facebook to avoid encryption of its Messenger system) may result in a backlash from online privacy advocates.</p><h1>6. Major sources of uncertainty</h1><p>The biggest source of uncertainty in this submission is whether interventions can reduce the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse enough to meet Open Philanthropy\u2019s high funding bar. I believe this could be resolved by those with more expertise in health economics, but it may also require further effectiveness research into the interventions.&nbsp;</p><p>Although there is only a small number of trials to pharmacologically reduce the risk of childhood sexual abuse, I believe the mode of action in reducing testosterone is a robust way to suppress sex drive. I am most uncertain about how many men who are sexually attracted to children would be willing to engage with this treatment and whether this could reduce the overall prevalence of childhood sexual abuse at a population or worldwide level.</p><p>While not backed by an evidence base, there is face value in coordinating a world response to childhood sexual abuse through increased funding of law enforcement, tackling the online consumption of child abuse imagery and campaigning against child marriage.</p><p>My own expertise is as a psychiatrist; I am aware of the psychological impact of abuse in childhood and how this can have longstanding consequence in how a person relates to the world. I have no expertise in health economics, so may have largely taken the costs of childhood sexual abuse from the literature. I have little understanding of the online mechanisms to detect child sex imagery or the online subcultures relating to this material. I have largely taken this information from the investigative reporting of Gabriel Dance at the New York Times, who spoke with various experts in tech, law enforcement and survivors. His main investigation took place in 2019-2020, so the information contained in my submission could well be out of date.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, I have no experience in lobbying, campaigning pr philanthropy. I suspect consulting with experts in each of these areas could strengthen this submission. To illustrate this further, I only became aware of Oak Foundation\u2019s drive to prevent childhood sexual abuse at the later stages of developing this submission.</p><h1>7. Questions that have not been addressed in this submission</h1><ul><li>Can youths (under the age of 18) attracted to younger children be targeted with preventative measures to avoid child abuse?</li><li>Are there novel technological solutions to scan and detect abuse imagery? Are there solutions to online streaming of abuse?</li><li>Does engaging men who are sexually attracted to children in treatment result in reduced consumption of child sexual abuse imagery and reduced contact childhood abuse?</li><li>Does reducing the distribution and consumption of online abuse imagery reduce offline contact abuse?</li></ul><p>Some experts in this area that may provide further information on the practicalities in engaging men in preventative interventions:</p><ul><li>Dr Christoffer Rahm, Psychiatrist at the Karolinska, leader of the Prevent It pilot</li><li>Dr Michael Seto, Psychiatrist at the University of Ottowa, leading authority on paedophilia</li><li>Dr Elizabeth Letourneau, Clinical Psychological and Director of the Moore Centre for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse at Johns Hopkins</li></ul><h1>8. Conclusion</h1><p>Based on Open Philanthropy\u2019s high bar for cost effectiveness, I am not convinced that reducing the global prevalence of childhood sexual abuse should immediately be a focus area. But it is an issue that negatively impacts a proportion of children worldwide, with long-term negative consequences. It is to the detriment of all society that we largely ignore the abuse many children go through and let this go undetected in the privacy of the online ecosystem.</p><p>I believe this problem is tractable and have offered potential interventions, which are likely to work best as part of a global, coordinated effort. I have uncertainty around which of these solutions are likely to be most cost effective and implementable.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, this problem has historically been neglected by major funders, academia, and clinicians. Change may now be afoot, with a major grant programme being launched by the Oak Foundation. Open Philanthropy would have to ensure it can add unique value before committing to this cause area.</p><h1>9.

While we don't like putting labels but in the interest of upfront disclosure, our politics can be thought of as somewhere in the anarcho-communist/syndicalist corner, with sympathies for Bookchin, but materialist/realist (until we find out working, efficient and *scalable* systems of organizing under anarchist principles, social democratic states are perfectly acceptable structures) and not revolutionary (extremely pessimistic on the feasibility or actual good outcome).</li><li>Authors background: ML/game theory PhD students who've been thinking about politics, economics and ways to achieve some scalable, feasible approximation to anarchocommunism for about 8 years now. Experience in organizing (mainly through associations), small scale political actions (think tank and input into parliamentary calls) as well as founding startups and financial markets (trading).</li><li>Authors are also German with Polish ancestry and so might be emotionally biased to take authoritarian lock-in as a higher threat than others due to history</li></ol><h1>TL;DR on top</h1><p>Democracy is a social structure which, if it can be implemented efficiently, achieves multiple desirable outcomes:</p><p>1. It solves a coordination problem, unlocking value which would be lost to the \u201cPrice of Anarchy\u201d [11] if participants were forced to rely on the Nash equilibrium outcome;</p><p>2. To degrees varying between simple majority rule to consensus democracies, it lends a degree of moral legitimacy to these decisions;</p><p>3. Pragmatically, it allows for dynamic stability by ensuring regime change and adaptability can happen at low systemic cost;</p><p>4. The deliberative process allows information transmission and aggregation which can make the whole system perform better.</p><p>For sources on these claims, we refer to [7], <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dTconqCtsmHQsNwo9/democracy-promotion-as-an-ea-cause-area-1\">Democracy Promotion as an EA cause area</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f8Cc4XikFGMdrZJAa/towards-a-longtermist-framework-for-evaluating-democracy-1\">Towards a longtermist framework for evaluating democracy-related interventions</a>.</p><p>Despite these apparent advantages, global democracy as measured by [2] has been in decline for 16 years. While Freedomhouse, the authors of [2] are not without criticism, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TMCWXTayji7gvRK9p/is-democracy-a-fad\">Is Democracy a Fad?</a>&nbsp; and [19] give potential arguments for why this might be the case.</p><p>Because of the potential value unlocked by well functioning democratic systems and the suffering and stagnation that can come with authoritarian regimes, we argue that OPF should start funding the following:</p><p>1. Initiatives and policy work to measure, fortify and expand trust in democratic practices in the developed nations, as well as to shift power towards democratic political entities in particular (e.g. cooperatives, public-but-not-state entities like the German <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28684025/\">statutory health insurance</a> [20]) . Particular focus can be paid towards these with a longtermist perspective.</p><p>2. Stabilizing and supporting democratic movements and institutions and self-governance in developing and emerging nations.</p><p>3. Developing a theory and practice of pro-democratic regime change, i.e. working towards a <i>playbook</i> for different actors (individuals, entrepreneurs, NGOs, parties, institutional actors) that helps them take effective pro-democratic action in different regimes (strengthening existing democracy, moving towards full democracy in partial democracies, choosing your effectiveness-risk trade-off in illiberal democracies and autocracies).</p><p>We start by arguing for importance, then discuss neglectedness and conclude by sketching some concrete exemplary directions for this cause area which illustrate tractability.</p><h1>Importance</h1><h1>The role and state of democracy</h1><p>Avoiding authoritarian lock-in has been already identified as a longtermist cause area in the Precipice [1] but given comparatively little attention in terms of page count and discussion (5.5 pages out of 280 main body). In the meantime, according to Freedomhouse, the world has experienced 16 years of democratic backsliding as of 2021 [2]. Writing this proposal in August 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has provided cutting evidence that this is not simply the world splitting into an affluent, democratic, safe \u201cwestern\u201d and an economically rising or poor, but in any case authoritarian \u201cnon-western\u201d block which do not interact. Instead, predictions of a shift in terms of the <i>power balance</i> between democratic and non-democratic nations as those raised in 2019 by [3] might have been more prescient and urgent than expected.</p><p>Similarly, the Uighur genocide [4] has made clear that economic liberalization does not always cause political liberalization, decades after this has been pointed out by scholars [5], partially because of the Chinese state deliberately adopting a liberalizing <i>posture</i> to aid the growth of both it\u2019s economical and political might [6]. This gels with research by [7] which have presented evidence that:</p><p>1. It might be democratic institutions and political liberalization which drive economic growth and liberalization and not vice versa.</p><p>2. Increasing a country\u2019s economical liberalization and wealth does not lead to political liberalization, or necessarily an increase in the standard of living of the broad population.</p><p>Chinas Uyghurs constitute 12.8 million people, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine affects over 42 million people and, if one only counts the population of China, North Korea, and Russia, it already amounts to over 1.5 <strong>billion</strong> people directly living under authoritarian regimes.&nbsp; As a very crude, back of the envelope estimation of what this might translate, the analysis done in <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/democracy-health\">https://ourworldindata.org/democracy-health</a>&nbsp; indicates that moving from 0.5 to 0.7 on the liberal democracy index moved the 2019 life expectancy from no more than 60 to at least 70, i.e. 10 years/0.2. <strong>Extremely</strong> simplifying, if we assume at least 1 year per 0.2 points increases would hold across all levels below 0.7, moving China and India alone (1.402 and 1.38 billion with 2020 numbers=2.782 billion people) by 0.1 points could bring 1.3 billion years of additional life. Of course, China already has an extremely high life expectancy despite it\u2019s low score, while Indian obstacles to higher life expectancy might not be due to public goods alone, but since we are also neglecting other benefits of more efficient and equitable political systems it still seems to be a number worth keeping in mind.</p><p>The potential \u201cmarket\u201d or these comparatively low-democracy index nations is large. Using Freedomhouse\u2019s Free, Partially Free and Not Free categories<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyy0bef6rts\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyy0bef6rts\">[1]</a></sup></span>, only about 80 countries are Free, about 60 qualify as Partially Free and the remainder is Not Free. But even this underestimates the true impact, since the free countries include countries like Tunisia, which is still struggling with the genesis of its democracy during the Arabic Spring; Malta, in which the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizias mars the nations liberal credentials [8];<i>&nbsp;</i>and the world\u2019s still-hegemon itself, the US, which experienced an attack on its nation\u2019s capital in the process of peaceful transition of power in 2021 [9] and continues suffer intense political polarization and tension similar to large chunks of the western world.</p><p>While we might want to be careful with ascribing a <i>crisis</i> of democracy[21], one should not forget that democratic institutions as westerners think of them \u2013 full franchise of all ethnic groups, of women and of people of all social classes \u2013 are between 100 and 200 years old. Generously discounting the full emancipation of gay, trans and racialised people in countries like the US, Germany and others, we arrive at at most 50 or 70 years of true democracy. We should similarly remind ourselves that the rise of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, etc. happened less than a century ago, fascist regimes persisted in Western Europe till the 70s (Spain), and there are still stable ultra-authoritarian regimes such as North Korea, Saudi Arabia and the various warlords of central and southern Africa extant, all of which (together with states like Russia and China) have a vested interest in undermining democratic processes and culture. One could go on discussing India (struggling with its Hindu-nationalist party firmly locked in power) or Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro, who at time of writing follows the anti-democratic playbook of casting doubt on election systems in the face of unpopularity [10], but all of this is to say that, depending on how strictly one counts, the affected population of democratic backsliding, illiberal democracies and lack of political participation is between hundreds of millions at minimum and <i>every single human on this planet.</i></p><h1>Neglectedness</h1><p>One might argue that democracy cannot possibly be neglected with multiple large and powerful nation states having a democratic identity, including the still-hegemon of the USA. On top of this, countless NGOs like Freedomhouse and foundations like the Open Society Foundation are already working on this.</p><p>Our counterarguments to these are centered around two key concepts: necessary partisanship and the stability trap.</p><h3><strong>Inherent and necessary partisanship</strong></h3><p>By necessity, working towards or researching democratic realities is a political endeavor, which inherently means that everyone involved (including the authors) are partisans. This is, in fact, <i>the point</i> of the democratic framework: that, by involving all stakeholders in a process which they can trust to give them a certain minimum of power and ideally find a all-sides-win solution, we can solve the coordination problem and avoid paying the <i>price of anarchy&nbsp;</i>[11].</p><p>But this also means that, without a dedicated longtermist player at the table that advocates for democracy in the sense of avoiding democratic lock in, there will be no voice, no representation of the perspective that no matter what you think is \u201cthe good politics\u201d, you might want to make sure that any viewpoint compatible with democracy should still remain powerful enough to influence things, i.e. avoiding a lock-in of any specific ideology that risks becoming authoritarian.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an extremely hard needle to thread when there are also literal neonazis and anti-democratic populists in the political system trying to exploit the openness of the system, which maybe <i>should</i> be excluded and deplatformed. However, this risks giving up that exact openness that one swore to protect.</p><p>Walking this balance and making judicious decisions, heck, properly researching this is difficult even <i>if</i> the available funding and/or political power base is exclusively interested in increasing political participation and democratic franchise. When, on top of that, the funding comes from political sources, corporations which might or might not be attempting regulatory capture, or \u201cgood billionaires\u201d trying to put their stamp (and thus their personal politics) on the landscape, we argue that it becomes nigh impossible. The democratic institutions themselves are likewise constituted of flawed human beings and might suffer from the Iron Law of Bureaucracy, i.e. be more interested in their own persistence and political entrenchment than actually preserving a dynamic, changing democracy which might do away with them.</p><p>Therefore, because of the inherent and even <i>necessary</i> partisanship, we argue that there is as of right now few to no actors which can be categorized as longtermist-democratic, with the specific goal of avoiding authoritarian lock-in.</p><h3><strong>The stability trap</strong></h3><p>The second reason for neglectedness is a special case of the above, which we term the stability trap. It is, in short, the fact that humans and other stable systems naturally favor stability, which can lead a democratic system \u2013 whose whole purpose is to facilitate appropriate adaptation to the needs of even the smallest minority, peaceful transfer of power and safe change\u2013 to become non-adaptive, crustified and locked in <i>by choice</i>, as well as those who are striving to protect democracy to focus on stability instead of embracing necessary \u2013potentially radical, but safe if done prudently\u2013 changes.</p><p>This trap is instantiated in examples like the aforementioned Iron Law of Bureaucracy, the lack of a timely response to the climate crisis due to multiple factors, the slow creep of unchecked police and executive power in the name of security [12], increases in regulatory burden to the point of decentralized regulatory capture, and many other examples where the need for immediate safety and stability slows down radical changes or prohibits risk taking that would lead to dynamic adaptation towards a real solution. This is, in a sense, also the need that the aforementioned populists exploit by promising <i>radical change to go back to past greatness\u2013 </i>stated differently, break down democratic cruft to take the radical actions to ensure that\u2026 nothing changes.</p><p>Strengthening democracy, in the longtermist sense, to avoid authoritarian lock-in will mean to strengthen democratic <i>dynamism</i> instead, to promote productive <i>instability</i> and to push for actions which undermine the power structure of institutions like themselves. Instantiations might be pushing for devolution into confederacies while maintaining top level cohesion for top-level concerns, mandates to reduce and simplify regulations periodically\u2013 adopting a term from programming, <i>refactoring</i> laws to keep them nimble and maybe even exploring different instantiations of democracy like the privatized regulation explored in [13].</p><p>Taken together, we argue that while there might be broad support of the general <i>vibe</i> of democracy across institutions, the specific goal of democracy to avoid authoritarian lock-in is severely neglected in relationship to its importance, in the same vein<strong> that</strong> two existing OPF focus areas, i.e., <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/macroeconomic-stabilization-policy/\">macro-economic stabilization</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/scientific-research/\">scientific research</a>. We also note that the secondary effects of democratic governance are immense and touch not only on these two but basically <i>all</i> OPF cause areas.</p><h1>Tractability</h1><h1>How to strengthen dynamic democracy</h1><p>Tractability in this area has a sharp divide between the observation and study of dynamic democracy and strengthening democracy in self-proclaimed democratic states <i>\u2013</i>both of which are highly tractable and in fact might be funded by OPF&nbsp; (e.g. as part of the macroeconomic stabilization package)<i>\u2013</i> and in taking steps towards increasing the dynamism of democracy outside of the societally standard norm, e.g. advocating for more dynamic voting systems in first-past-the-post nations, any democratic activism in authoritarian countries, or establishing strong democratic institutions in unstable or poor countries.</p><p>In the former, a relatively small amount of funding and operative support can go a long way, since these are generally non-monetizeable efforts. A possible funding opportunity would be historic and economic research in past and present highly democratic systems and institutions, e.g. aggregating and critically evaluating the various histories of <a href=\"https://www.anarchistlibraries.net/libraries\">anarchist libraries</a> and trying to detangle the \u201cusable\u201d democratic dynamics from historical and ideological cruft. Another avenue in this road would be collecting a \u201cdemocratic meme seed bank\u201d from these sources to study ideas and systems which did not win the historic-evolutionary competition, but might still hold important concepts and inspiration for future instantiations of democracy, as well as simply the voices and perspectives of marginalized peoples, which can serve as a warning and reality check to the \u201cwinners of history\u201d -&nbsp; the present peoples.</p><p>By studying alternative systems of organization like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation\">Mondragon Corporation</a> (scalable cooperative), the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois\">Haudenosaunee</a> (ancient tribal democratic system) and getting a fact-based view of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria\">AANES</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation\">Zapatista</a> social experiments, one might be able to distill general practices into sections of a \u201cplaybook\u201d for moving towards effective democracies. But there are also other candidates not centered on citizenship engagement and coming from one might call a \u201cleftist\u201d worldview. The ideas of moving towards a more privatized and liberalized law-as-technology view from [13] and the liberal-capitalist ideas of [14] would also qualify as entries into the \u201cdemocratic meme seed bank\u201d, since they have at their core the goal of political liberalization and making more efficient (and hence increasing the survival chances) of a democratic state.</p><p>Less conceptual and exotic and more immediately applicable funding opportunities might be expanding the OurWorldInData, FreedomHouse and other NGOs attempts in quantifying democracy to more fine-grained, dynamically updated data that can be used to enable coordination and activation, as well as providing (digital) infrastructure for pro-democratic movements aligned with the longtermist notion of dynamic democracy. Candidates might be platforms like transparency platforms <a href=\"https://www.nosdeputes.fr/\">https://www.nosdeputes.fr/</a> and <a href=\"https://fragdenstaat.de/\">https://fragdenstaat.de/</a>, where marketing, international coordination, and support in lobbying for strong transparency laws can have long-lasting dividends, funding work on and pushing for the adoption and federation of tools like <a href=\"https://docs.decidim.org/\">https://decidim.org/</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy</a> as well as the studies tracking the efficiency and real dynamics surrounding them.</p><p>Another branch, after collecting the \u201cdemocratic meme seed bank\u201d, would be research into formalizing game theoretic definitions of democracy extending the groundwork of [7] into algorithmic game theoretic notions. In particular, using analyses like [14], there is fruitful ground analyzing dynamic systems and in formalizing and developing notions of \u201cgood dynamics\u201d. These are possible formal exit paths from the stability trap, allowing for instability that still attains a high degree of welfare for all participants of the system.</p><p>From this one foundational \u201csure wins\u201d one could then branch into more difficult, ambitious and less assured goals like developing an applicable theory and practice of pro-democratic regime change. Here we must admit that we have no clear idea that is not rooted in our own political biases; however, we think the compilation of a \u201cplaybook\u201d of strategies and tactics as is common amongst political radicals [16], [17] ought to also be compiled, publicized and importantly kept up to date and refined by those wanting to caution against authoritarian lock-in. This might include political, economic, technological, but also military/insurgent knowledge as argued for by e.g. [18], and would have to take into account difficult trade-offs like maintaining an \u201carsenal of democracy\u201d and a capable industry while avoiding regulatory capture by a military-industrial complex.</p><h1>Final words and a personal note</h1><p>The work is cut out for anyone attempting to tackle the area of dynamics democracy. However, we believe the tractability and impact profile of this field to be multimodel, with modes similar to that of the aforementioned macro-economic stabilization focus area, the \u201cland reform\u201d focus area, and the \u201cfuture risk of AI\u201d focus area and, frankly, dwarfing and subsuming all of these in importance and urgency. Because if we don\u2019t manage to build robust systems against lock-in, there is no reason to expect that the fragile flower of democracy will vanish again into a stagnant stability of suffering for everyone but the elite, as had been the historical norm for millennia [19].</p><h1>References</h1><p>[1]&nbsp; T.
