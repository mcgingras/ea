The reason why we talk with people 1 to 1 about whether they should do a PhD is because there is so much nuance and variation depending on personal fit, career goals, industry circumstances, impact goals, etc. This summary does a bad job at conveying these nuances.</p><p>For example, point 2 mentions that doing a PhD limits finances, which is a short-sighted way of putting it, especially considering that over a lifetime, PhDs make back the earnings that they lose over the time that they are doing a PhD, and jobs requiring a PhD are often much more highly paid.</p><p>Point 3 feels pretty blanket-statement-y about scaring away employers when really there is only a minority of employers who are scared away (they probably won't be if you're willing to take the pay that they're offering).</p><p>Point 6 also feels too strongly worded \u2013 I don't think you can ever know if there are no better impact opportunities. Also, not everyone wants to go into entrepreneurship so this last consideration wouldn't apply.<br><br>I know this summary is AI-generated but I think a more nuanced and less strongly worded summary could be created.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ryHaA8qzfWvpEvgFR", "user": {"username": "Jessica Wen"}}]
