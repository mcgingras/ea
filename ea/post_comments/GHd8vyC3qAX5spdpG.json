Left brain implements models, right brain tunes and \"reloads\" them when they become too bloated, too contradictory and need new axioms. Those spiritual vibes (can be seen instantiated in music styles, for example) can be seen as different \"cultures\" of axiom-building. That's why people who recover from trauma (like me) talk about spirituality and vibes - old axioms went into contradictions and couldn't explain or predict or give actions to adapt to the environment.
