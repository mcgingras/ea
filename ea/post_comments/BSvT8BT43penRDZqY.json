They use the terms \"<i>avoidance motivation</i>\" and \"<i>approach motivation</i>\" but my sense is that they match the terminology of fear and excitement very well. It appears that (excessive) avoidance motivation leads to reduced well-being and performance, at least in the long-term (e.g., Roskes et al. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721414524224?journalCode=cdpa\">2014</a>).<br><br>ETA: The above reference is not good.
