It changed my mind about conservationists - I had no idea they were so into the value of evolution in and by itself and at the expense of welfare of both animals and humans. Your post really opened up my mind to a new perspective on this. And I really like how you social science style talked to all these different people to really push them on their beliefs and motivations. And it feels EA related and shows the complexities involved in wild animal suffering. Great job and thanks!&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ulrik Horn"}}, {"_id": "q2reBkSGBhkbtL9bp", "postedAt": "2024-03-19T10:48:12.097Z", "postId": "7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS", "htmlBody": "<p>Wonderful post ! I think this is a good exemplar of how predation related RWAS thought should be presented, and I'm incredibly glad you delved into the conservationists' worldview.</p>\n<p>There is still a pending question in my mind, however, that has to do with the \"One Health\" perspective that healthy ecosystems have a positive benefit on human health. I guess there are some interventions that actually maximize health benefit while minimizing animal suffering (we know those in animal farming, namely not doing it), and if anything, this could favor specific rewilding projects while discarding the ones that are only motivated by a conservationist aesthetic.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Camille"}}]
