One comment on the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remind yourself of what you really care about (e.g. \u201cWith every $1 I save, I can donate to a cost-effective charity like SCI and cure a child of parasitic worms\u201d)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm a big fan of the idea of having set altruistic and personal budgets, so that every spending decision doesn't become a great moral question, which is psychologically unhealthy. Even on this approach you can try to be frugal and aim to underspend on your personal budget. After doing so you could decide that you can live a satisfying life on a slightly smaller personal budget next year. But taking this approach cuts the direct connection between every $1 spending decision and a child dewormed, which is helpful psychologically.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Tom_Ash"}}, {"_id": "fezX6vx4Shi6Z88YW", "postedAt": "2014-12-13T18:45:52.118Z", "postId": "WzYPT6XcscRha28Jd", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Shopping around for a cell phone plan that saves you $5/month means $120 over 2 years (3 hours spent finding such a plan means you earned $40/hour) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This prompted me to spend a few minutes researching new plans. Turned out my mobile phone company had released a new plan since I joined them which strictly dominated my old plan; switching saved me around $9 a month.
