But just before asking for feedback, I made a change in the slides and added this meaning to the ratings of the events:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;3 - \u00a3100, 5 - \u00a31,000, 8 - \u00a310,000, 10 - \u00a3100,000 (e. g. career change)&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I explained it to people as well. This was... not smart. Because of this, some respondents gave low scores to all the events. E.g. someone said that the weekend was &quot;Far more valuable (10-30x the counterfactual)&quot; but did not gave any event a rating that is higher than 4. Others ignored the point and gave high ratings for all events.</p>\n<p>That's why I weighted and normalised the ratings. If someone said that the weekend was &quot;Vastly more valuable (&gt;30x counterfactual)&quot;, I multiplied all their ratings by a constant so that their highest rating would be 10. If they rated the weekend as &quot;Far more valuable (10-30x the counterfactual)&quot;, I multiplied all their ratings so that the highest rating would be 9. 8 for &quot;Much more valuable&quot;, 7 for &quot;Somewhat more valuable&quot;, and 6 for &quot;About as valuable&quot;.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "h2tha6DXHgP8wy3NP", "user": {"username": "saulius"}}, {"_id": "GAWtGttBiay5eRrMF", "postedAt": "2018-06-12T14:44:42.253Z", "postId": "9ozoJpPoNBL6Z5BX5", "htmlBody": "<p>2) I will ask the person who ran Hamming circles to explain it, I only participated in half of the event myself.

We tried to pair up people who don't know each other well and have something in common (e.g. both are excited about the same cause area). We considered letting people pair themselves up but had reservations because some people might get upset if no one wants to talk with them. However, at the end of the first day we told people that if there is someone they'd like to be paired up with on the second day, they can write it on a piece of paper and put it in the box (so that only we could see their preference).
