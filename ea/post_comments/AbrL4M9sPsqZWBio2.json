When we wrote this I think we were referring to the fact that there don't seem to be any clubs or programs at the high school level that have the same goals as SHIC, and that we're feeling like we're in uncharted territory as we've been reaching out to these institutions, teachers and students, mainly because building a curriculum into the network seems like a new approach.</p>\n<p>In any case, that's not well explained in the document, and I don't think that sentence gives off the message we want it to, so I'll strongly consider editing.
