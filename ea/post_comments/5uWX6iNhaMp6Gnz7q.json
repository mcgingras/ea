It just feels so relieving to know there are people who care. Hearing you say you've contacted some organisations gives me so much hope. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need more details or footage over the crisis. I'm so eager to start a brainstorming session here, because I'm at a loss for ideas on how to act as productively as possible. We're emailing international news outlets but I'm unsure over how effective it proves to be. Violence is continuing here and there does not seem to be any signs of it subsiding. I'm dreading that Dhaka may be becoming a war zone. As far as solutions go, I can't think much further than international intervention.  I hope more people see this post so that there is more to discuss.

You may wish to contact the Centre for Social Activism, a Bangladeshi human rights organization who supports activists in Bangladesh for advice before proceeding with contacting external organizations (including the ones I recommend) as they will have much more information on the current political, civil landscape than I do).

I don't know very much history myself, but perhaps a good analogy would be the recent Arab Spring protests.  My vague understanding is that a lot of the Arab Spring countries ended up worse off than they were to start with, despite the good intentions of the people protesting.  &quot;Color revolutions&quot; in the former Soviet Union could be another analogy--<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/18/why-the-color-revolutions-failed/\">here</a> is an article I found on Google.  Perhaps you could gather examples of countries which did/did not succeed in peacefully reforming their government, and try to understand which separates the successful countries from the unsuccessful ones.  (Or see if some academic has already attempted this.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs\">This</a> is a really fascinating video which attempts to show that the bad behavior of autocratic governments is simply a matter of all the individuals involved following their incentives.
