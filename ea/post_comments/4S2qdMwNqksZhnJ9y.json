Why not just have professionals do the work they're good at and explicitly donate the fees generated? This model is an example of what I call Guided Consumption. I know you commented on one of my more recent posts laying out Guided Consumption from the perspective of various agents, and thanks for helping me clarify a point in my formulas. I like this earlier one a bit better as an introduction if you hadn't had a chance to read it yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMiGwDoqEyswaE6hN/making-trillions-for-effective-charities-through-the\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMiGwDoqEyswaE6hN/making-trillions-for-effective-charities-through-the</a></p>\n<p>As I can see you're someone interested in using your economic insights toward altruistic ends, I'd really appreciate the opportunity to discuss the broader project of my nonprofit with you sometime.
