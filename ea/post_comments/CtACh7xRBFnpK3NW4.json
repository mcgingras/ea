I'd like to make a suggestion, which I'm not sure is applicable to your organizations. But some areas can pose risks for certain types of attendees due to local laws. For example, laws that criminalize trans people using their preferred bathrooms, or laws that increase deportation risks for undocumented people. So, that's something to be aware of maybe. Having event planners, if they're deciding where to host an event, look into local laws.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Masha Winchell"}}, {"_id": "xCGuD8mGr2Sa2nv5M", "postedAt": "2023-07-29T01:13:45.527Z", "postId": "CtACh7xRBFnpK3NW4", "htmlBody": "<p>Also, OFTW's harassment policy seemed to focus on harassment related to protected characteristics, like gender, race, etc. But what about harassment for other reasons?

One idea for addressing these barriers would be to provide a basic script that organisers could say, or rewrite in their own words.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "AlexanderSaeri"}}, {"_id": "sE6kZoBYwpgW8wJ2X", "postedAt": "2023-07-31T13:45:55.899Z", "postId": "CtACh7xRBFnpK3NW4", "htmlBody": "<p>I actually do have this in a template for slides for events organisers are doing!
