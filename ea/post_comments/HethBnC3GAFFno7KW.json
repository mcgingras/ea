Imagine that you are a scientist taking an inventory of all the various qualities present in conscious human experience. You\u2019ve written down the qualities of experiencing various colors, sounds, and smells. But there are two distinct experiential qualities that you can\u2019t quite figure out how to describe. In the end, you realize that the only way to describe the one is to say that it\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d, and that you can only describe the other by saying it\u2019s \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d. That is, you have to mention the normativity of the experiences in order to describe them accurately. The qualities of these experiences are simultaneously normative and descriptive.\"</p>\n<p>I can't imagine being satisfied with such a theory of consciousness. It seems like there will always be another question about how to explain \"good\" and \"bad\" or the appearance of them. Stopping here and invoking normative properties that aren't further explained physically is giving up, a lot like invoking the supernatural or gods to explain natural phenomena.</p>\n<p>Intrinsic good and intrinsic bad as properties necessary to describe pleasure and suffering also seem incompatible with functionalism and illusionism, which both seem basically true to me.
