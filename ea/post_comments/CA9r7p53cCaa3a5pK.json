These comments are pretty light on a serious topic, but I want to flag them to donors considering joining this funding circle.

I think 1.25 charity out of 6 being good is still a quite solid success rate. But, most of these charities seemed like bad ideas to many other people in the space prior to launching, CE was given that feedback, and seemed to fail to act on it. This is also the case with their most recent batch of charities that haven't yet launched. CE is typically much more confident in their own research than external feedback, which seems bad given concern 1.</p><p><br>3.

We are not looking for people to donate to us or our charities, and as far as I understand, OpenPhil and AWF do not have a participatory way to get involved other than just donating to their joint pot directly. This request is more aimed at people who want to put in significant personal time to making decisions independent from existing funding actors.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>More connected response:</p><p>Thanks for the thoughts, and the support you have given our past charities. I can give a few quick comments on this. Our research team might also respond a bit more deeply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) Research quality: I think in general, our research is pretty unusual in that we are quite willing to publish research that has a fairly limited number of hours put into it. Partly, this is due to our research not being aimed at external actors (e.g., convincing funders, the broader animal movement, other orgs) as much as aimed at people already fairly convinced on founding a charity and aimed at a quite specific question of what would be the best org to found. We do take an approach that is more accepting of errors, particularly ones that do not affect endline decisions connected directly to founding a charity. E.g., For starting a charity on fish in a given country, we are not really concerned about the number of fish farmed unless that number is significant determining factor in terms of founding a charity in that space. We have gone back and forth as to how much transparency to have on research and how much time to spend per report and have not come to a fixed answer. We are more likely to get criticism/pushback on higher transparency + lower hours per report but typically think it will still lead to more charities that are promising in the end.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>2) CE\u2019s animal charity quality: I think both our ordering and assessment of charity quality would be different from what is described here. I also think animal welfare funds and Open Phil's (both of who have funded the majority of these projects) assessments would also not match your description. However, in some ways, these are small differences as our general estimate is that 2/5 charities in a given area are highly promising. It is quite a hits-based game, and that is the number we would expect (and would rank internally) about how many charities are performing really well.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>2.5) Feedback on animal charities: I did a quick review of charities that got the most positive vs negative feedback at the time of idea recommendation from the broader animal community relative to your rank order and relative to our internal one and did not find a correlation. Generally, I think the space is pretty uncertain and thus the charity that got the most positive expectations were typically the charities that deviated the smallest amount from other actions already taken in the space. I think that putting more time into the research reports (including getting more feedback) is one way to improve charity quality (at the cost of quantity) but I'm pretty skeptical it's the best way. So far, the biggest predictive factor has not been idea strength but the founder team, so when thinking about where to spend marginal resources to improve charities, I would still lean that way (although it's far from clear if that will always be the case).<br>&nbsp;</p><p>3) I would be interested in doing a survey on this to get better data. I get the impression that we are seen as pretty disconnected from the animal space (and I think that is fairly true). I think we are far more involved in e.g., the EA space both when it comes to more formal research and when it comes to softer social engagement. I think our charities tend to go deeper into whatever area they are focusing on than our team does, and I am pretty comfortable with that. I would not be surprised if we both were invited less and attended less coordination events and meetings connected to the animal space; we like to stay focused quite directly on the problems we are working on.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks again for writing this up. I put some chance that these are issues that are correct and important enough to prioritize, and it's valuable to get pushback and flags even if we end up disagreeing about the actions to take.</p>", "parentCommentId": "6rGxLDYxiAamb5kz9", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "ayuEmec7GDKMeFwRj", "postedAt": "2024-03-27T19:45:56.845Z", "postId": "CA9r7p53cCaa3a5pK", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

CE had an ongoing relationship with an animal advocacy policy organisation occasionally providing research to support their policy work. We received a request for some input and over the next 24 hours we helped that policy organisation draft a note on the topic at hand. In doing so a CE staff member copy and pasted text from a private document shared by another animal advocacy research organisation. This was plagiarism and should not have happened. I would like to note: firstly that this did not happen in the course of our business as usual research process but in a rushed piece of work that bypassed our normal review process, and secondly that this report was not directly published by us and it was not made clear to the CE staff member involved that the content was going to be made into a public report (most other work for that policy organisation was just used privately) although we should of course have considered this possibility. These facts of course do not excuse our mistake here but are relevant for assessing the risk that this was any more than a one-off mistake.<br><br>I was involved in responding when this issue came to light. On the day the mistake was realised we: acknowledged the mistake, apologised to the injured party, pulled all publicity for the report, drafted an email to the policy org asking to have the person who's text was copied added as a co-author (the email was not sent until the following day after as we waited for approval from the injured party). The published report was updated. Over the next three weeks we carried out a thorough internal risk assessment including reviewing all past reports by the same author. The other animal rights research organisation acknowledged they were satisfied with the steps taken. We found no cases of plagiarism in any other reports (the other research org agreed with this assessment), although one other tweak was made to a report to make acknowledgment more clear.&nbsp;</p><p>FWIW I find mildlyanonymous' description of this event to be somewhat misleading referring to multiple \"reports\" and claiming \"CE failed to address this\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>CE's reports on animal welfare consistently contain serious factual errors ... noticing immediately that it had multiple major errors, sharing that feedback, and having it ignored due to their internal time capping practices.</p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t know what this is about.

We are aware of the limitations of desktop research (however in-depth), and we encourage organizations to quickly update based on country visits, interactions with stakeholders, and pilot programs they run. There are just some informations that a researcher wouldn't be able to get, and they need input from someone working on the ground. For example, when Rethink Priorities was writing their report on shrimp welfare, they consulted SWP extensively to gain that perspective. Because CE charities operate in extremely neglected cause areas, there is often no other \"implementer\" our research team can rely on. Therefore, organizations are usually expected to change the idea as they learn in their first months of operations. I see this as a success in ingraining the values of changing one's mind in the face of new evidence, seeking this evidence, and making good decisions on the side of co-founders with the support of their CE mentors, and we are happy when we see it happen.&nbsp;<br>There is a complex trade-off to be made when balancing the learning value from more in-depth desktop research vs. more time spent on learning as one implements, and I don't think CE always gets it right, but the latter perspective is often misunderstood and underappreciated in the EA space.&nbsp;<br><br>Regarding charities specifically, in general, we expect about a 2/5 \"hit rate\" (rarely because of the broad idea being bad, more often because the implementation is challenging for one reason or another), and many people, including external charity evaluators and funders, have a different assessment of some of the charities you list.

Partly, this is due to our research not being aimed at external actors (e.g., convincing funders, the broader animal movement, other orgs) as much as aimed at people already fairly convinced on founding a charity and aimed at a quite specific question of what would be the best org to found. We do take an approach that is more accepting of errors, particularly ones that do not affect endline decisions connected directly to founding a charity.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Do you think there are additional steps you could/should take to make this philosophy / these limitations clearer to would-be to those who come across your reports?</p><p>I strongly support more transparency and more release of materials (including less polished work product), but I think it is essential that the would-be secondary user is well aware of the limitations. This could include (e.g.) noting the amount of time spent on the report, the intended audience and use case for the report, the amount of reliance upon which you intend that audience to place on the report, any additional research you expect that intended audience to take before relying on the report, and the presence of any significant issues / weaknesses that may be of particular concern to either the intended audience or anticipated secondary users. If you specifically do not intend to correct any errors discovered after a certain time (e.g., after the idea was used or removed from recommended options), it would probably be good to state that as well.</p>", "parentCommentId": "XxrnhxzQ4sWT4jA5s", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "D73duioq32kMbt6LD", "postedAt": "2024-03-29T01:12:52.093Z", "postId": "CA9r7p53cCaa3a5pK", "htmlBody": "<p>Most of these are just \"people in space knew this wouldn't work\".

I wanted to quickly respond to this point.</p><p>\u2013 \u2013&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Quality of our reports</strong></p><p>I would like to push back a bit on Joey's response here. I agree that our research is quicker scrappier and goes into less depth than other orgs, but <strong>I am not convinced that our reports have more errors or worse reasoning that reports of other organisations </strong>(thinking of non-peer reviewed global health and animal welfare organisations like GiveWell, OpenPhil, Animal Charity Evaluators, Rethink Priorities, Founders Pledge).</p><p>I don\u2019t have strong evidence for thinking this. Mostly I am going of the amount of errors that incubates find in the reports. In each cohort we have ~10 potential founders digging into ~4-5 reports for a few weeks. I estimate there is on average roughly 0.8 non-trivial non-major errors (i.e. something that would change a CEA by ~20%) and 0 major errors highlighted by the potential founders. This <strong>seems in the same order of magnitude to the number of errors GiveWell get on scrutiny </strong>(e.g. <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/a-dozen-doubts/\">here</a>).</p><p>And <strong>ultimately all our reports are tested in the real world </strong>by people putting the ideas in practice. If our reports do not line up to reality in any major way we expect to find out when founders do their own research or a charity pivots or shuts down, as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/maternal-health-initiative-is-shutting-down\">MHI has done recently</a>.</p><p>One caveat to this is that I am more confident about the reports on the ideas we do recommend than the other reports on non-recommended ideas which receive less oversight internally as they are less decision relevant for founders, and receive less scrutiny from incubates and being put into action.&nbsp;</p><p>I note also that in this entire critique and having skimmed over the threads here no-one appears to have pointed out any actual errors in any CE report. So I find it hard to update on anything written here. (The possible exception is me, in this post, pointing to the MHI case which does seem unfortunately to have shut down in part due to an error in the initial research.)</p><p>So I think our quality of research is comparable to other orgs, but my evidence for this is weak and I have not done a thorough benchmarking. I would be interested in ways to test this. It could be a good idea for CE to run a change our mind context like GiveWell in order to test the robustness of our research. Something for me to consider. It could also be useful (although I doubt worth the error) to have some external research evaluator review our work and benchmark us against other organisations.</p><p>\u2013 \u2013&nbsp;</p><p>That said I do agree that we should make it very very clear in all our reports the context of who the report is written for and why and what the reader should take from the report. We do this in the introduction section to all our reports and I will review the introduction for future reports to make sure this is absolutely clear.</p>", "parentCommentId": "bx4FexELoxYZwhSfo", "user": {"username": "weeatquince"}}]
