By \u201creactions\u201d I meant what Facebook calls \u201creactions\u201d.

The post text/link titles will be a bit messy past the first 50. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>EDIT: Ugh. I made a sorting error at some point while making that spreadsheet and some of the links are mismatched. I've unshared it for now and will add to the post once fixed. Stand by :)</p>\n<p>EDIT 2: Updated the link above with the corrected sheet and also added to the body of the post.
