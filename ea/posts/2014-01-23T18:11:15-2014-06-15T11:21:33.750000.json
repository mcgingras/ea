The additional income to the poorest required to bring them above extreme poverty lines is in the hundreds of billions of dollars per annum, while doubling world product would approach a hundred trillion dollars of additional annual output. Legal barriers to migration, and blocked desire to migrate, are most extreme for the poorest countries, suggesting extra migrants from those sources. While migrants may receive more income gains than are needed to escape absolute poverty remittances to family, trade, and investment may help to distribute the gains more widely. Overall, the case that migration liberalization for less skilled workers could eliminate most absolute poverty is significantly more robust than the most extreme estimates of global output gains.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p>In a previous <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/upward-and-downward-biases-in-double.html\">post</a>, I noted that some estimates of the economic gains of open borders depended on the migration of billions of people, including most of the working-age population of the developing world, and far more than suggested by surveys of desire to migrate. This makes the case for a medium term <a href=\"http://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/\">doubling of gross world product</a> from open borders less plausible, although other gains of migration not included in those estimates (such as the spread of institutions and technology by migrants causing home country development) might lead to a doubling.<br><br>However, it is well worth noting that the number of migrants required to slash global rates of extreme poverty is much smaller than required to double world product.</p><h3><strong>Cutting poverty in half requires gains to the poor of much less than 100% of world GDP</strong></h3><p>Current gross world product is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)\">close to $90 trillion</a>. World Bank data up to 2008 shows the declining number of people making less than the old absolute poverty line of $1 per day(in 2005 $USD, PPP), and the new poverty line of $1.25 per day. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995094/mirroredImages/GqDtomtfzekwwc6YF/rcyjoj5kctbmaijbp6ep.png\"></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/\">Inflation</a> since 2005 has been modest, and poverty has fallen further since 2008, so the \"income gap\" between the current incomes of those in extreme poverty and their incomes if boosted to $1 or $1.25 would amount to a few hundred billion dollars per year. If cheap successful cash transfers targeted directly to the poorest were under consideration less than 0.5% of gross world product would be needed.<br><br>Of course the gains of migration liberalization would not be perfectly targeted, but this does provide a clear plausibility to liberalization cutting absolute poverty rates in half again (as happened in the last few decades) even if total economic gains fall well short of doubling world product.</p><h3><strong>Migration from the poorest countries is currently disproportionately restricted</strong></h3><p>Michael Clemens recently <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/does-development-reduce-migration_final_0.pdf\">reviewed</a>&nbsp;research on migration rates under existing immigration laws, which finds a U-shaped curve when emigration rates and per capita income are plotted, below. This might suggest that the poorest will lack the financial resources to invest in migration, or otherwise fail to take advantage of new opportunities.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xNydKi0Tj-E/U4K0ax6TZ2I/AAAAAAAAATc/T46yYne-Vew/s1600/MigrationUCurve.PNG\"></figure><p>However, this pattern occurs in the context of migration systems in most developed countries that are overwhelmingly <a href=\"http://perso.uclouvain.be/frederic.docquier/filePDF/DM_ozdenschiff.pdf\">skewed</a> towards skilled and educated workers:<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kqzX-j2JKsg/U4K1fGlx7KI/AAAAAAAAATo/-ilF3U8W_ms/s1600/MigrationSkillSkew.PNG\"></figure><p><br>Since the lowest income countries have the lowest skill levels, they face greater legal barriers to migration, which would be relaxed under liberalization.<br><br>Sometimes there are openly discriminatory barriers, as in <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/05/migration-levies-and-unskilled-labor.html\">the case of Singapore</a>, where low-skill guest workers must normally come from a list of approved countries, with the list varying by sector. For some categories there are no truly poor countries, and while others such as construction permit the admission of migrants from poor countries in South Asia, most of the world is excluded, e.g. all of Sub-Saharan Africa.<br><br>A 2011 <a href=\"http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/the-worlds-potential-migrants\">survey</a> of desire to migrate found that 36% of Africans expressed desire to migrate, disproportionately of working age, accounting for 166 million out of approximately 700 million worldwide, while desire to migrate was much less common in Asia. Since China is largely succeeding in eliminating poverty, and East and South Asia are following it, at varying rates, projections suggest that most absolute (at the $1 or $1.25 levels, <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/content/poverty-projections-28aug12/1496954.html\">not $2</a>) poverty may be concentrated in Africa within the next several decades. I.e. the trends are for desire to migrate and poverty to coincide.</p><h3><strong>Migrants gain disproportionately, but remittances, trade, and investment spread gains</strong></h3><p>If one is focused on the poorest because of their <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/turning-log-consumption-into-measure-of.html\">higher marginal utility of income</a>, one issue is that when only some of the poor migrate, those who do may gain so much as to significantly reduce their marginal gains from income. For example Clemens estimates the <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/16352_file_CMP_place_premium_148.pdf\">place premium for mid-skilled workers</a> migrating from Haiti to the United States as multiplying mean income by some 10 times. This is obviously a tremendous gain to the migrant, but it might not generate as much human welfare as doubling the incomes of 10 different workers, although more than doubling the incomes of 2 workers.</p><p>However, a single migrant worker may send <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance#Overview\">remittances</a> to a number of other family members back home. For 2009, the World Bank <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTFINANCIALSECTOR/EXTPAYMENTREMMITTANCE/0,,contentMDK:22121552~menuPK:5978015~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:1943138,00.html\">told us</a>:</p><blockquote><p>the World Bank estimates that remittances totalled USD 440 billion in 2010, of which USD 325 billion went to developing countries, involving some 192 million migrants or 3.0% of world population. For some individual recipient countries, remittances can be as high as a third of GDP. Remittances also now account for about a third of total global external finance; moreover, the flow of remittances seems to be significantly more stable than other forms of external finance.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;World Bank <a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/0,,contentMDK:22759429~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:476883,00.html#Remittances\">data</a> for 2013 show remittances up to $542 billion, including $70 billion to India (3.7% of GDP), $60 billion to China (0.7% of GDP), $21 billion to Nigeria (7.9% of GDP), $15 billion to Pakistan (6.1% of GDP), and $14 billion to Bangladesh (12.2% of GDP).<br><br>While the scale of remittances is already larger than absolute poverty, the current migration flows towards skilled workers and middle-income countries, and migrant incomes even more so. However, remittances for skilled workers are suppressed because they are more likely to be able to bring their families to a new country, while less skilled workers undertake temporary migration for employment. 2005 <a href=\"https://www.microfinancegateway.org/sites/default/files/mfg-en-paper-workers-remittance-flows-in-southeast-asia-2006_0.pdf\">data</a> on migrant remittances in East and Southeast Asia show substantial remittances even for low-paid and less skilled workers:<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gc98OUUpdLY/U4TnCegN8FI/AAAAAAAAAUc/d3RROailRy4/s1600/RemittanceTable.PNG\"></figure><p>Remittances may also increase home-town wages, although the net effect on inequality will <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/38840502.pdf\">vary</a> depending on the distribution of migration. If migration rates approached expressed willingness in surveys, including for unskilled workers, enough of Africa could migrate for almost everyone to have a migrant in their close family.<br><br>Correlational and observational studies suggest a connection between migration and trade and investment flows (as migrants buy things from home, invest there, or help enable other foreign investment), although causation is in question, and causal effects may substitute for other possible trade and investment partners. <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/clemens%20case%20against%20taxes%20web.pdf\">Clemens</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Beyond cash, skilled workers abroad interact in many ways with their home countries that have the potential for large positive effects. The more highly skilled emigrants from one country live in another, the more trade occurs between those countries (Rauch 1999; Felbermayr and Toubal 2012). The share of foreign direct investment that countries receive from the United States is positively correlated with the number of college graduates from that country present in the United States (Kugler and Rapoport 2007; Docquier and Lodigiani 2010; Javorcik et al. 2011). Scienti\ufb01c innovations arrive in many developing countries through interaction with skilled emigrants (Kerr 2008). Indian, Chinese, and Israeli immigrants to the United States, for example, have been crucial to the formation of manufacturing and information technology hubs in those countries (Saxenian 2006; Devane 2006; Wei and Balasubramanyam 2006). There is evidence that norms of democracy (Spilimbergo 2009) and fertility (Beine et al. 2013) are conveyed to developing countries through skilled emigrants.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;The direct impact of financial flows from trade, after accounting for various uncertainties, seems substantially less important than remittances, especially for large unskilled migrant flows. Investment and development impacts could be enormously important, e.g. the Chinese diaspora seems to have played a helpful role in China's development and foreign direct investment. However, skilled and high-income workers may contribute more to such idea diffusion per capita, and scaling is uncertain.<br><br>Haiti has a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Haiti\">population</a> of close to 10 million, and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_diaspora\">diaspora</a> in the vicinity of 2 million, with 1.4 million in the high income jurisdictions of the United States, Canada, France and the Bahamas. Another 500,000-800,000 live in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic\">Dominican Republic</a>, with a GDP per capita (PPP) of $9,646 versus Haiti's $1,242. Remittances to Haiti make up $1.7 billion or 20.6% of GDP in the World Bank data, about $1,000 per Haitian diaspora member, and more per migrant (since much of the Haitian diaspora is in later generations which have less motive to send remittances). Distributed to the poor on the basis of need, that amount would suffice to eliminate absolute poverty there.<br><br>Nonetheless, a 2008 World Bank report found 49% of Haitian households living below the $1 per day poverty line. Education and human capital are unequally distributed. The educated are able to migrate through skilled migration systems (80% leave Haiti), and can earn higher wages abroad than those few unskilled workers who are able to leave:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BAXtk0ssKz0/U4-kviMN1HI/AAAAAAAAAU0/H59BfnFkfww/s1600/CaribbeantoOECDMigration.PNG\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Their remittances help bring their families well above the absolute poverty line, while others are left without any migrants in their close families. Opening up unskilled migration would allow rural and less educated families to partake in migration-related revenues, although they would earn less per migrant.<br><br>Combining the various income-boosting channels, and taking into account the unequal distribution of migration even under a more liberalized regime, I'd guess that if developed countries took in hundreds of millions of unskilled workers from the poorest countries, on the order of 10-30% of the low-skill workforce in the latter (consistent with survey evidence, especially for Africa) that would suffice to eliminate most absolute poverty at the $1 per day (or $1.25) line.</p><h3><strong>Even substantially diminishing returns to unskilled labor would leave wages above absolute poverty levels</strong></h3><p>Wages for low-skill construction workers in <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/05/migration-levies-and-unskilled-labor.html\">Singapore</a> and the <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/05/what-does-migration-to-united-arab.html\">United Arab Emirates</a> are much lower (nearer $2 vs $10) than those of migrant construction workers in the United States or Japan. This may reflect lack of productivity-bolstering institutions or market conditions, and may partly reflect diminishing marginal product of low-skill labor. But even there wages for identical workers are several times as great as in India, and access to the UAE construction labor market <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/seize-spotlight-labor-migration.pdf\">dramatically improves</a> household income and wealth.<br><br>The low incomes needed to alleviate poverty provide a large 'safety margin' for diminishing returns, externalities, and other problems: so long as any problems of migration are not catastrophic, migrants will be able to alleviate absolute poverty for their (extended) families.</p><h3><strong>Migration taxes could fund foreign aid</strong></h3><p>Economist Jagdish <a href=\"http://economia.uniparthenope.it/ise/sito/conferenze/miurVinci/Papers_Accepted/Scalera_bdtax.pdf\">Bhagwati has long proposed migration taxes</a> to capture some of the benefits of migration and direct it to development or other aid for those left at home. If developed countries adopted <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/05/migration-levies-and-unskilled-labor.html\">Singapore-like</a> guest worker and migration tax policies revenues would dwarf current foreign aid budgets, and could fund a major global expansion of aid.<br><br>From some analytical perspectives, these things have little to do with each other: if rich countries don't provide more aid out of current revenue, why would they allocate a larger portion of migration taxes? One reason is that increased interaction with a place tends to increase moral attention and foreign aid directed at it (consider Iraq and Afghanistan's enormous foreign aid receipts). Improving health and education in migrant sending countries would <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-immigration-could-make-amf-more.html\">increase the returns to foreign aid</a>. Such a proviso might also make a political coalition for migration liberalization more stable by placating those concerned with exploitation of people from poor countries.&nbsp;And lastly, drawing public attention to the global poor through the migration system may simply make it easier to talk about other interactions with the poor at the same time.<br><br>Since Singapore is able to extract revenue of several billion dollars from less than a million low skill workers subject to foreign worker levies (and taxes could be higher for more skilled workers) a Bhagwati tax on one hundred million guest workers, spent on cash transfers, could suffice to slash absolute poverty (at least at the old lower lines).</p>", "user": {"username": "tessa"}}, {"_id": "vGjJBuBtsdDBvPxo7", "title": "Carl Shulman \u2013 What portion of a boost to global GDP goes to the poor?", "postedAt": "2014-01-24T01:15:56.276Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Summary</strong><i>: How should individuals compare the impact of donations made to the world's poorest with changes in overall economic activity which are not specifically targeted at the poor, but proportionally increase incomes worldwide?

Some industries are more evenly distributed across the world than others: an economic change that delivered equal absolute dollars gain to people around the world might only need to be a few times greater.

At this point the distribution of resources becomes static, and may be preserved for a long time (perhaps until some participants cease to be patient).</p><p>On this model, a windfall of 1% of the world\u2019s resources&nbsp;<i>today</i>&nbsp;may lead to owning 1% of the world\u2019s resources for a very long time. But in such a model, we also never expect to encounter such a windfall, except as the product of investment.</p><h2>Why is this model so wrong?</h2><p>We don\u2019t seem to see long-term interests dominating the global economy, with savings rates approaching 1 and a risk profile tuned to maximize investors\u2019 share of the global economy. So what\u2019s up?</p><p>In fact there are many gaps between the simple model above and reality. To me, most of them seem to flow from a key observation:&nbsp;the most important resources in the world are people, and no matter how much of the world you control at time <i>t</i> you can\u2019t really control the people at time <i>t</i>+1. For example:</p><ol><li>If 1% of the people in the current generation share my values, this does not mean that 1% of the people in the next generation will necessarily share my values.&nbsp;Each generation has an influence over the values of their successors, but a highly imperfect and unpredictable influence; human values&nbsp;are also profoundly influenced by human nature and unpredictable consequences of individual lives. (Actually, the situation is much more severe, since the values of individual humans likewise shift unpredictably over their lives.) Over time, society seems to approach an equilibrium nearly independent of any single generation\u2019s decisions.</li><li>If I hold 1% of the capital at time <i>t</i>, I only get to capture 0.3% of the gross world product as rents\u2014most of the world product is paid as wages instead. So unless I can somehow capture a similar share of all wages, my influence on the world will decay.</li><li>Even setting aside 2, if I were to be making 1% of gross world product in rents, they would probably be aggressively taxed or otherwise confiscated and redistributed more equitably. So owning 1% of the stuff at time <i>t</i> does not entitle me to hold 1% of the stuff at time <i>t</i>+1.</li><li>Even setting aside 2 and 3, if I&nbsp;hold 1% of the resources at time&nbsp;<i>t</i>, I have some probability of dying before time&nbsp;<i>t</i>+1. In light of this risk, I need to identify managers who can make decisions to further my values. It\u2019s hard to find managers who precisely share my values, and so with each generation those resources will be controlled by slightly different values.</li></ol><p>The fact that each generation wields so little control over its successors seems to be a quirk of our biological situation: human biology is one of the most powerful technologies on Earth, but it is a relic passed down to us by evolution about which we have only the faintest understanding (and over which we have only the faintest influence). I doubt this will remain the case for long; eventually, the most useful technologies around will be technologies that we developed for ourselves. In most cases, &nbsp;I expect we will have a much deeper understanding, and a much greater ability to control, technologies we develop for ourselves.</p><h2>Machine intelligence</h2><p>I believe that the development of machine intelligence may move the world much closer to this na\u00efve&nbsp;model.</p><p>Consider a world where the availability of cheap machine intelligence has driven human wages below subsistence, an outcome which seems not only inevitable but desirable if properly managed.&nbsp;In this world, humans rapidly cease to be a meaningful resource; they are relevant only as actors who make decisions, not as workers who supply their labor (not even as managers who supply economically useful decisions).</p><p>In such a world, value is concentrated in non-labor resources: machines, land, natural resources, ideas, and so on. Unlike people, these resources are likely to have the characteristic that they can be owned and controlled by the person who produced them. &nbsp;Returning to the list of deviations from the&nbsp;na\u00efve&nbsp;model given above, we see that the situation has reversed:</p><ol><li>The values of machine intelligences can (probably, eventually) be directly determined by their owners or predecessors. If at time&nbsp;<i>t</i>&nbsp;1% of the world\u2019s machine intelligences share my values and own 1% of the world\u2019s resources, then 1% of all new machine intelligences will also share my values and at time <i>t</i>+1 it\u2019s likely to also be the case that 1% of the world\u2019s machine intelligences share my values and own 1% of the world\u2019s resources.</li><li>A&nbsp;capital holder with 1% of the world\u2019s resources owns about 1% of the world\u2019s machine intelligences, and so also captures 1% of the world\u2019s labor income.</li><li>In a world where most \u201cindividuals\u201d are machine intelligences, who can argue as persuasively as humans and appear as sympathetic as humans, there is a good chance that (at least in some states) machine intelligences will be able to secure significant political representation. Indeed, in this scenario the complete oppression of machine intelligences would be something of a surprisingly oppressive regime. If machine intelligences secure equal representation, and if 1% of machine intelligences share my values, then there is no particular reason to expect redistribution or other political maneuvering to reduce the prevalence of my values.</li><li>In a world where machine intelligences are able to perfectly replace a human as a manager, the challenge of finding a successor with similar values may be much reduced: it may simply be possible to design a machine intelligence who exactly shares their predecessor\u2019s values and who can serve as a manager. Once technology is sufficiently stable, the same manager (or copies thereof) may persist indefinitely without significant disadvantage.</li></ol><p>So at least on a very simple analysis, I think there is a good chance that a world with human-level machine intelligence would be described by the&nbsp;na\u00efve&nbsp;model.</p><p>Another possible objection is that a capital owner who produces some resources exerts imperfect control over the outputs\u2013apart from the complications introduced by humans, there are also random and hard-to-control events that prevent us from capturing all of the value we create. But on closer inspection this does not seem to be such a problem:</p><ul><li>If these \u201crandom losses\u201d are real losses, which are controlled by no one, then this can simply be factored into the growth rate. If every year the world grows 2% but 1% of all stuff is randomly destroyed, then the real growth rate is 1%. This doesn\u2019t really change the conclusions.</li><li>If these \u201crandom losses\u201d are lost to me but recouped by someone else, then the question is \u201cwho is recouping them?\u201d Presumably we have in mind something like \u201ca random person is benefiting.\u201d But that just means that the returns to being a random person, on the lookout for serendipitous windfalls at the expense of other capital owners, have been elevated. And in this world, a \u201crandom person\u201d is just another kind of capital you can own. &nbsp;A savvy capital owner with&nbsp;<i>x</i>% of the world\u2019s resources will also own&nbsp;<i>x</i>% of the world\u2019s random people. The result is the same as the last case: someone who starts with&nbsp;<i>x</i>% of the resources can maintain&nbsp;<i>x</i>% of the resources as the world grows.</li></ul><h2>Implications</h2><p>If we believe this argument, then it suggests that the arrival of machine intelligence may lead to a substantial crystallization of influence.&nbsp;By its nature, this would be an event with long-lasting consequences. Incidentally, it would also provide the kind of opportunity for influence I was discussing in my <a href=\"https://rationalaltruist.com/2014/05/04/we-can-probably-influence-the-far-future/\">last post</a>.</p><p>I find this plausible though very far from certain, and I think it is an issue that deserves more attention. Perhaps most troubling is the possibility that in addition to prompting such crystallization, the transition to machine intelligences may also be an opportunity for influence to shift considerably\u2014perhaps in large part to machines with alien values.&nbsp;In Nick Bostrom\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html\">taxonomy</a>, this suggests that we might be concerned about the world ending in a \u201cwhimper\u201d rather than a \u201cbang\u201d: even without a particular catastrophic or disruptive event, we may nevertheless irreversibly and severely limit the potential of our future.&nbsp;</p><p>It is tempting to be cosmopolitan about the prospect of machine intelligences owning a significant share of the future, asserting their fundamental liberty to autonomy and self-determination.&nbsp;But our cosmopolitan attitude is itself an artifact of our preferences, and I think it is unwise to expect that it (or anything else we value) will be automatically shared by machine intelligences any more than it is automatically shared by bacteria, self-driving cars, or corporations.</p>", "user": {"username": "tessa"}}, {"_id": "tAwBydf6B7BkL9jut", "title": "The Importance of Committing to Causes", "postedAt": "2014-05-14T12:41:38.693Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Note: Before the launch of the Open Philanthropy Project Blog, this post appeared on the </i><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/\"><i>GiveWell Blog</i></a><i>.

We believe that there\u2019s a limited amount we can learn about a cause when presenting ourselves as \u201cpotentially interested in providing moderate amounts of funding\u201d rather than \u201cstrongly interested in providing major funding.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve come to believe in the importance of committing to causes in order to investigate them, and in the importance of \u201cgiving to learn\u201d for the <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>, via the following process:</p><ul><li>We initially envisioned a process that <i>first</i> gathers information on giving opportunities and <i>then</i> identifies which grants should be made.</li><li>However, from observing the behavior of potential grantees and other funders, we came to believe that a funder must be highly prepared (and likely) to make grants in an area <i>in order to</i> find giving opportunities in that area. Many people will only make the relevant referrals, propose relevant ideas, etc. once they are convinced of a philanthropist\u2019s serious interest in providing funding.</li><li>As such, we have in many cases tried offering funding in an area - or at least expressed strong interest in the area - before knowing what giving opportunities would turn out to be available. This approach has led to multiple cases in which much of the learning value of a grant (from our perspective) comes from the process leading up to the grant.</li><li>\u201cGiving to learn\u201d can mean multiple things. It can mean (a) funding research in order to gain specific knowledge; it can also mean (b) funding a project in order to learn from following the project\u2019s progress. The dynamic laid out in the above bullet points represents perhaps the most counterintuitive meaning: \u201cgiving to learn\u201d can mean (c) offering funding in order to learn from the <i>process of finding grantees.</i></li></ul><p>This post lays out:</p><ul><li>An overview of the paths we\u2019ve taken in the last few years to find giving opportunities for the Open Philanthropy Project. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/importance-committing-causes#Sec1\">More</a></li><li>Examples of where showing strong interest in a cause, and particularly in making grants within it, led to information that we couldn\u2019t have gathered in any other way. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/importance-committing-causes#Sec2\">More</a></li><li>The implications of this dynamic - including why we do not believe (contrary to what some have suggested) that funding research is necessarily the best way to gather more information relevant to our work (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/importance-committing-causes#Sec3\">more</a>) and why we think it is important to commit to specific causes fairly soon (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/importance-committing-causes#Sec4\">more</a>).</li></ul><h1>Approaches we\u2019ve taken to finding giving opportunities for the Open Philanthropy Project</h1><p>Early on in our work on the <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>, we spoke to a broad array of people and organizations - including academics, funders and nonprofits - and asked them for their opinions on the best giving opportunities, broadly speaking. (We also asked for referrals to other people who might be able to help us with this question.) As noted in a <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/challenges-passive-funding\">previous post</a>, this approach generally didn\u2019t yield much in the way of actionable ideas (and was often met with responses like \u201cThat question is too broad\u201d or \u201cFirst I need to know what causes you\u2019re passionate about\u201d).</p><p>We gravitated toward <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/refining-goals-givewell-labs\">assessing \u201ccauses\u201d</a>, which helped us to ask more focused questions (rather than \u201cWhat is the best giving opportunity you know about?\u201d we could instead ask something like \u201cWhat would you do if you were a funder seeking to make progress in solving problem X?\u201d) But as we conducted <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports\">shallow (and even medium) investigations</a>, we still encountered relatively few \u201cshovel-ready\u201d giving opportunities. We encountered organizations seeking more funding generally, but we didn\u2019t see many cases where we had a clear sense that more funding would play a crucial role in allowing particular promising work to go forward.</p><p>At the same time, we were speaking with major foundations and trying to understand how they go about finding giving opportunities. We explored the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewell-labs-update-0\">co-funding projects</a> with them, and we encountered ideas \u2013 such as a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/PSI-Myanmar-Artemisinin-Resistance-Containment\">project combating malaria drug resistance in Myanmar (with the Gates Foundation)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/service-delivery-indicators\">Service Delivery Indicators (with the Hewlett Foundation)</a> \u2013 that seemed like interesting and relatively tangible (in the sense of understanding what activities were made possible by the funders\u2019 support) giving opportunities.</p><p>In addition to these co-funding conversations, we devoted substantial time to exploring the cause of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/meta-research-update\">meta-research</a> and observing how funders in that space were finding giving opportunities. We noticed that:</p><ul><li>The \u201cmeta-research\u201d ideas we saw, such as a <a href=\"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/\">registry</a> for randomized controlled trials, were brought straight to the funders who already were known for supporting relevant research, and it seemed to us that the projects might get sufficient support this way without needing a broader search for funds. These funders seemed to us to be well-connected to the people best positioned to come up with ideas for working toward \u201cmeta-research\u201d related goals.</li><li>A similar dynamic seemed like it might apply more broadly. We knew that as a grantee ourselves, we had been connected to the <a href=\"http://www.hewlett.org/\">Hewlett Foundation</a> by someone who knew of their interest in <a href=\"http://www.hewlett.org/programs/effective-philanthropy-group\">improving philanthropy</a>; if not for that connection, it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to us to approach them. Generally, it seemed to us (both from our reading of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/philanthropys-success-stories\">philanthropic success stories</a> and from our conversations regarding \u201cco-funding\u201d) that funders encounter many opportunities via being approached, such that their reputation for being interested in one cause or another directly affects what opportunities they come across.</li><li>While investigating meta-research broadly, we sourced the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/meta-research-innovation-center-stanford-metrics-0\">proposal for a meta-research-oriented center at Stanford</a> that we wrote about previously. This was a clear-cut case in which actively expressing an interest in funding certain kinds of projects led to discovery of a giving opportunity we couldn\u2019t have encountered otherwise.</li></ul><p>We started to feel that we might need to \u201cinvert\u201d our investigative process: rather than (a) first \u201cexploring\u201d a cause, finding potential giving opportunities, and then deciding whether we were interested in providing funding, we should perhaps (b) pick a few causes and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewell-labs-update\">definitively express an interest in providing funding</a>, before knowing of any particular giving opportunities. Our initial thinking that led to this idea was outlined in a 2013 post, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/challenges-passive-funding\">Challenges of Passive Funding</a>.</p><p>This shift led to a noticeable improvement in our ability to source tangible giving opportunities.</p><h1>Examples of the \u201cgiving to learn\u201d dynamic</h1><p>The first cause we chose for a relatively deep investigation - including <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/deep-investigations-new-causes\">some grants</a> - was <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-writeup-criminal-justice-reform\">criminal justice reform</a>. Of the causes we were interested in, it seemed to offer the best odds of quickly finding \u201cshovel-ready\u201d giving opportunities, based on the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Teles%206-12-13%20(public).pdf\">comments of Steven Teles</a>. We told Prof. Teles that we were interested in making some initial grants in this cause, and he quickly connected us to Mark Kleiman and Angela Hawken, each of whom sought funding. We also informed the relevant team at Pew Charitable Trusts that we were actively looking for giving opportunities, and discovered that this team was seeking funding (something that hadn\u2019t come up in the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Adam%20Gelb%208-23-13%20(public).pdf\">first conversation we conducted</a> with this team). We have since begun a thorough investigation of this organization\u2019s track record in this space, with their help - something that wouldn\u2019t have been as feasible if we hadn\u2019t seriously been considering providing the requested funding.</p><p>Over time, we\u2019ve seen more giving opportunities come up. We\u2019ve been approached by multiple groups with confidential proposals to work toward reducing incarceration. In addition, Prof. Hawken contacted us when her organization, BetaGov, came across a seemingly unique and temporary opportunity to study the impact of changing marijuana policy in the state of Washington (more details forthcoming). These are giving opportunities we\u2019re convinced we couldn\u2019t have come across without expressing strong, credible interest in funding work on criminal justice reform (and in some cases, particularly Prof. Hawken\u2019s, actually providing such funding).</p><p>In the meantime, Prof. Teles has continued to think actively about the topic of criminal justice reform, and has come up with multiple new ideas for things a funder might do. We are currently seeking to pause our work in this space, as we try to investigate other causes to a similar level of resolution; however, we\u2019ve now gotten multiple people and organizations to see us as a potential source of funding and to start thinking about more work that would align with the aspects of the space we\u2019re interested in.</p><p>Similar dynamics have applied to the other causes we\u2019ve explored:</p><ul><li><strong>Malaria control and elimination.</strong> We <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/finding-giving-opportunities-malaria-controlelimination\">commissioned Dr. Steve Phillips to explore this space for us and identify giving opportunities</a>. We had substantial discussion with Dr. Phillips around setting expectations appropriately - in particular, what to say about the likelihood of funding - which he found important in order to have conversations about possible projects. In this particular case, we did not commit any funds to malaria control and elimination projects, but we wouldn\u2019t have been able to conduct this project if we hadn\u2019t seen a legitimate possibility of doing so, and we\u2019d be hesitant to dig further on these proposals (or to do a similar project in another area of global health) without having a relatively strong expectation of following up with funding.</li><li><strong>Labor mobility.</strong> We did a <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/policy/labor-mobility\">shallow investigation</a> of the cause of labor mobility that included a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Michael%20Clemens%20Notes%2002-20-13%20public.pdf\">conversation with Michael Clemens</a>, a researcher on the global economics of migration who has been a leading voice on the humanitarian benefits of labor mobility.. However, it wasn\u2019t until we communicated an intent to <i>fund</i> labor-mobility-related work that Dr. Clemens approached us with giving opportunities, including <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/CGD-labor-mobility-grant\">support of his own work</a> as well as another project that we will be writing about in the future. We find the project both promising and unlikely to get funded without our involvement, and believe that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to find out about it without specifically communicating an intent to provide funding. In addition, Dr. Clemens offered to introduce us to a person who might consider leaving their current post in order to pursue work in this area, but wouldn\u2019t want this information widely disseminated.</li><li><strong>New top charities.</strong> We have also been interested in <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/02/26/2014-plan-for-givewells-traditional-top-charities-work/\">making grants to increase the supply of evidence-backed charities serving the global poor</a>. Here too, we have started conversations with research organizations that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to have without a strong interest in (and high likelihood of) providing funding.</li></ul><h1>Why expressing stronger interest can lead to better giving opportunities</h1><p>Without pretending to know exactly how the dynamics work, it seems to us that:</p><ul><li>People are often hesitant to ask for funding, or even mention that they\u2019re seeking it, until and unless they perceive a strong specific interest on the part of the person they\u2019re talking to. (Just knowing that the person they\u2019re talking to is a funder and \u201copen to many possibilities\u201d is often not enough.) Part of this may be a fear of being perceived as \u201cunsuccessful\u201d if they are public about having an idea that they can\u2019t find funding for.</li><li>People are often hesitant to put time into fleshing out an idea until they see a potential path to getting it funded. This seems rational, especially since different funders will often have different preferences in terms of what information they find most important, what sorts of proposals they want to see, and what aspects of the work are most important to prioritize from their perspective.</li><li>Many people seem to seek funding primarily by going through their networks, and seeking out people who are clearly interested in what they\u2019re doing (rather than by publicly disseminating their ideas).</li></ul><p>In theory, it seems possible to have a world in which funding ideas are written up and posted publicly for anyone to browse. In reality, funding ideas are often not even <i>internally fleshed out</i> (much less written up) until specific interest is perceived. Because of this, asking someone for giving opportunities often means asking for substantial amounts of their time and energy, and it can be inappropriate to do so except when one has a high probability of following through with funding.</p><h1>The approach we\u2019re taking</h1><p>Our basic heuristics for deciding what and how much to fund has been:</p><ul><li>Be very thoughtful and careful about how we spend our time, and realize that making grants will almost always have implications for how we spend our time (by signaling our interests, by causing more people doing similar work to approach us, by forming relationships with grantees, etc.)</li><li>When we\u2019re interested in an area, be willing to express strong interest in providing funding and to follow through with high probability.</li><li>Fund projects we come across that seem reasonable, that we\u2019re willing to spend some time following up on, and that fit within our interests in terms of what areas we want to learn more about and see more proposals from.</li></ul><p>Our priority at the moment is <i>asking what sorts of giving opportunities might exist in different causes</i> (and, along with this, learning about meta-issues such as the \u201cgiving to learn\u201d dynamic described in this post). We think of this as an learning/information-gathering agenda, supported by \u201cgiving to learn\u201d grants whose informational value comes from (a) following through on initial expressions of interest; (b) signaling our further interests; and (c) giving us opportunities to follow up over time and learn about the relevant people and organizations and their progress.</p><p>We\u2019ve seen a few comments that we don\u2019t seem to place much value on \u201cvalue of information,\u201d since we\u2019re primarily funding direct work of various kinds rather than research projects aiming to identify the best causes. I disagree with comments along these lines. Our work <i>is</i> a research project aiming to identify the best causes, and funding projects in causes of interest is an important tool for carrying this project out. This sort of \u201cgiving to learn\u201d provides certain kinds of information (e.g., \u201cwhat are the giving opportunities in cause X like?\u201d) relatively quickly and efficiently; more broadly, it is a form of \u201clearning by doing\u201d that has already yielded insights about grantmaking (such as how the \u201cgiving to learn\u201d dynamic works) that would have been difficult to pick up in any other way. By contrast, funding studies would introduce the management challenge (costly in terms of person-hours, our scarcest resource) of trying to align researchers\u2019 work with our own interests, and could take years to produce actionable information.</p><h1>The importance of committing to causes</h1><p>To date, we\u2019ve quite deliberately limited our involvement in - and commitments to - any given cause. We believe that this has placed limits on how well we\u2019re able to get to know the fields in question. If we were to make a substantial \u201ccommitment\u201d to a cause - intending to allocate a substantial number of person-hours to it for the next several years, accompanied by a substantial potential budget - we would be able to:</p><ul><li>Network more extensively, get to know the relevant people and organizations, and communicate the nature of our interests.</li><li>Encourage people to come to us with ideas, without having to caveat that our interest is preliminary and we may not be able to provide stable/renewable funding over time.</li><li>Generally do more investigation and learning about the cause, leading to refinements in the specific types of projects we\u2019re looking to fund - which in turn would affect the types of projects that would come to our attention.</li></ul><p>We believe these activities would lead to deeper understanding of the few causes we investigate, which would likely inform how we approach our lower-depth investigations of all causes. Accordingly, we see a great deal of value in making such commitments relatively soon, rather than trying to be comprehensive in doing lower-depth investigations of every possible cause of interest.</p>", "user": {"username": "HoldenKarnofsky"}}, {"_id": "n4m6nsj3Sm4RwtwnJ", "title": "The First Case Study from Our History of Philanthropy Project", "postedAt": "2014-03-24T10:26:24.509Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Note: Before the launch of the Open Philanthropy Project Blog, this post appeared on the </i><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/\"><i>GiveWell Blog</i></a><i>.

Dr. Soskis had previously compiled a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/HCHP%20Report.docx\">literature review for this program</a> (.docx).</p><p>In brief, the HCH program consisted of the following:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIn December 1983, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), in partnership with Pew Memorial Trusts, spurred by a recognition of how little was being done to address the health care needs of the homeless, issued a call for proposals to \u2026 develop means of incorporating the homeless into local outpatient health care systems\u2026. Ultimately, the foundations funded 19 coalitions over the course of four years, spending a total of $25 million\u2026. In June 1987, Congress passed the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the first major piece of federal legislation to address homelessness in more than half a century\u2026. That the RWJF-Pew program should be granted a significant degree of causal impact in the incorporation of the program into the McKinney Act is undeniable.\u201d (Case Study, Pg 1)</i></p></blockquote><p>The full case study is available <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/HofP/HCHDeepDivepublicfinal.docx\">here</a> (.docx). The full list of sources is available <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/HofP/HCHSourceListfinal.docx\">here</a> (.docx).</p><p>Dr. Soskis\u2019s case study provides an example of how philanthropy can influence policy change. He writes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIncorporation of the HCH program within the McKinney Act was the result of a convergence of a well-designed demonstration project with a policy window opened by a campaign by homeless advocates begun earlier in the decade. The advocates pushed for the federal government to address the mounting crisis of homelessness and when that campaign came to fruition, the HCH program was available as a policy model. The RWJF-Pew HCH program, therefore, does not merely represent a model of a successful demonstration project, but of a particularly powerful convergence between philanthropic initiative and broader political currents.\u201d (Case Study, Pg 3)</i></p></blockquote><p>The picture that emerges from the case study seems importantly different from the picture we got from a shorter piece in <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/philanthropys-success-stories\">a list of 100 philanthropic success stories</a>. The shorter case made the project\u2019s impact seem relatively more significant, and our interest in this case was partly due to the fact that we\u2019ve been pointed to it repeatedly as one of philanthropy\u2019s most clear-cut success stories. Dr. Soskis\u2019s study does attribute significant impact to philanthropy, but also paints a more complex picture.</p><p>This is the first case study Dr. Soskis has completed. He is currently working on a similar study focused on the role played by philanthropy on the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act. We hope to share that (and other case studies) in the future.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/HofP/HCHDeepDivepublicfinal.docx\">Read the case study of the Health Care for the Homeless program</a> (.docx)</p>", "user": {"username": "ElieHassenfeld"}}, {"_id": "ndvcrHfvay7sKjJGn", "title": "Human and animal interventions: the long-term view", "postedAt": "2014-06-02T00:10:15.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>Crossposted from the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/global-priorities-project/\">Global Priorities Project</a></em></p><p>This post discusses the question of how we should seek to compare human- and animal-welfare interventions. It argues: first, that indirect long-term effects mean that we cannot simply compare the short term welfare effects; second, that if any animal-welfare charities are comparably cost-effective with the best human-welfare charities, it must be because of their effect on humans, changing the behaviour of humans long into the future.</p><p>In the search for the most cost-effective interventions, one major area of debate is whether the evidence favours focussing on human or animal welfare.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/\">Some have argued for estimates</a>&#xA0;showing animal welfare interventions to be much more cost-effective per unit of suffering averted, with an implication that animal welfare should perhaps therefore be prioritised. However this reasoning ignores a critical difference between the two types of intervention: the long-term impact. There are good arguments that&#xA0;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE\">the long-term future has a large importance</a>, and that&#xA0;<a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2014/05/04/we-can-probably-influence-the-far-future/\">we can expect to be able to influence it</a>.</p><p>The intention here is not to attack the cost-effectiveness estimates, which may well be entirely correct as far as they go. However, like most such assessments they only consider the immediate, direct impact of interventions and compare these against each other. For example, disease relief schemes would be compared by looking at the immediate welfare benefits to the humans or animals cured of disease.</p><p>What this process misses out is that interventions to improve human welfare have ongoing positive effects throughout society. It has been argued that healthy humans with access to education, food and clean water are far more likely to be productive, and contribute to the economic development of their society, with&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">knock-on improvements for everyone who comes after them</a>. Also, not having to worry about their basic needs may free them up to spend more time considering and improving the circumstances of others around them.</p><p>The upshot of this is that it is likely interventions in human welfare, as well as being immediately effective to relieve suffering and improve lives, also tend to have a significant long-term impact. This is often more difficult to measure, but the short-term impact can generally be used as a reasonable proxy.</p><p>By contrast, no analogous mechanism ensures that an improvement in the welfare of one animal results in the improvements in the welfare of other animals. This is primarily because animals lack societies, or at least the sort of societies capable of learning and economic development. Even though many animals are able to learn new skills, they are extremely limited in their ability to share this knowledge or even pass it on to their offspring.</p><p>The result is that short-term welfare benefits to animals cannot be used as even a rough proxy for long-term improvements in the same way as they can for humans. So even if the short-term estimates suggest that animal welfare interventions are more cost-effective, it is certainly questionable whether this aspect dominates when considering the overall benefits.</p><p>This does not, of course, rule out the possibility that the most effective interventions could have an animal welfare element. For example, a shift in society towards vegetarianism would reduce the number of animals kept in poor conditions today, as well as improving human welfare in numerous ways (such as using fertile land more efficiently to grow crops rather than cattle). Moreover, if it could achieve a lasting improvement in societal values, it might have a large benefit in improved animal welfare over the long-term.</p><p>A push towards vegetarianism is one sort of value-shifting intervention. It is possible that this or another such intervention could be more effective than direct improvements to human welfare, but in order to assess this we need to &#xA0;to model how changing societal values today will influence the behaviour of future generations. This should be a target for further research.</p><p>Humans are uniquely placed to pass on the benefits of interventions to the rest of society and to future generations, and if we ignore these future-compounding effects we may achieve less good than we could have. For many types of human welfare intervention, we can use the short-term benefits to humans as a proxy for ongoing improvements in a way that is not possible - and may be misleading - when it comes to improvements to animal welfare. Although it is difficult to quantify, this hidden benefit may be enough to make the best human-focussed interventions more cost-effective than the best animal-focussed ones, even if the reverse seems true looking at the short run.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "qvofaSbPPGX9XTPr9", "title": "Apples and oranges? Some initial thoughts on comparing diverse benefits", "postedAt": "2014-05-29T15:51:55.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>An important part of effective altruism is comparing the value of different altruistic endeavors. Many altruistic endeavors bring about different kinds of good things, for instance protection of children from incapacitating diseases, and extra years of quality education. To find the best causes, we need some way of evaluating these next to one another. How much extra education in the developing world is worth the same as an extra year of healthy life?</p><p>Answering such questions is notoriously tricky, and GWWC faces an even harder problem of answering them in such a way that other people are happy to use our judgements, and thus our recommendations. One can&apos;t just opt out of answering them, for the same reason one <a href=\"&#x201D;http://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have&#x201D;\">shouldn&apos;t</a> choose one&#x2019;s partner by their social security number just because it&apos;s hard to weigh up a good sense of humor against kind eyes.</p><p>So how can we make such evaluations? GWWC research has been looking into it a bit, and this blog post will tell you some of what we think. We&#x2019;ll look at various methods from economics and the social sciences, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches.</p><p>Any attempt to compare the value of two things has two basic parts. The first step is often to parcel out all of the main ways each item might have benefits. For instance, if a person in Malawi doesn&#x2019;t contract malaria next year, this will translate to various good things: less suffering and more joy for that person, less stress for their family, less congestion at the local hospital, a few thousand dollars of productive work, slightly different expectations among people nearby about how well their lives are likely to go.</p><p>This can go on for more steps - a few thousand dollars of productive work might be factored out in terms of increased prosperity for the family, and more prosperity spread among the wider world. Prosperity for the family might in turn be factored out as better nutrition for them, more education for their children, some investments that will bring them further prosperity, etc.</p><p>Another thing that often happens at this stage is that items are made more abstract. For instance one particular girl&#x2019;s recovery from schistosomiasis might be equated to some number of &#x2018;quality adjusted life years&#x2019; or &#x2018;QALYs&#x2019;. This makes evaluation more tractable. Now we can evaluate many similar things at once, a little bit inaccurately, instead of doing thousands of different evaluations. For instance if we convert many different health interventions into QALYs saved, then we can compare a QALY to a year of school, and we automatically have a comparison of lots of different health interventions.</p><p>The second step is to actually compare the value of the items you end up with. This might involve for instance seeing how money much a person is willing to pay to avoid some suffering. You could do this by observing how much money and effort they invest in avoiding the flu, in flu season. Or you might ask them directly, &#x2018;if you could pay $1000 to avoid this surgery, would you take that offer?&#x2019;. Or instead of looking at money they will sacrifice, you might just ask about how they feel. For instance you might ask a blind person repeatedly over a period how satisfied they are with their life, and do the same with a person who is not blind.</p><p>Comparing value can be done immediately without the previous step of converting things, or after so many iterations of the previous step as to turn health and education into unrecognizable buckets of value. Many ways of comparing the value of A against B have been developed, especially in the social sciences. I have collected some of them into a <a href=\"&#x201D;https://workflowy.com/shared/e666a215-f187-1af9-90dd-c81a3ab99789/&#x201D;\">menu</a>, which describes their upsides and downsides, and suggests when we might expect them to be most appropriate.</p><p>Note that the methods in the menu are generally comparing benefits to identifiable groups of people. We may care about people for whom it&#x2019;s hard to make these measurements, such as future generations, but we&#x2019;ll need different or further methodology to know how to compare these effects to the direct benefits we can measure. Nonetheless it&#x2019;s valuable to understand how we should compare diverse benefits today, and this may be a key component in a more general analysis.</p><p>Also, we won&apos;t usually be able to choose freely from the list of methods. GWWC will probably not have the resources to go and find out how much an additional parent improves the life outcomes for a person in rural China. The hope is rather that this list might help guide choices of comparison when a few different methods happen to be available. I&#x2019;ll give you a few examples of evaluation methods on the list, then in the rest of this post I&apos;ll describe some of key choices it offers and mention some of the factors that might suggest one choice over another.\n</p><h3>Appetizers</h3>\nTo give you a concrete idea of what we are talking about, here are some examples of how we might use different methods from the list to figure out how good something is for a person:<p></p><p><b>Willingness to pay:</b> if a person is willing to pay $100 for a textbook, you can infer that they prefer having the textbook to having $100, and therefore to other things they could buy for $100.</p><p><b>Instantaneous reports of subjective wellbeing:</b> a person&#x2019;s phone pings them throughout the day and and asks something like, &#x2018;zero to ten, how good do you feel right now?&#x2019; Using this method, we can build a hedonic profile for different individuals and (hopefully) discover the correlates and causes of happiness, as well as their relative importance.</p><p><b>The standard gamble:</b> A person is asked what probability of dying they would be willing to accept for an intervention that would improve their health in some way.</p><p><b>Averting behavior method:</b> Use the total costs people pay to avoid extra sunburn as a lower bound for how much a healthy ozone layer is worth to them.\n</p><h3>What to elicit: preferences, happiness, or another proxy of good?</h3>\nWhether you ultimately care to optimize for good feelings, people getting what they want, or something else is a controversial moral question. I won&apos;t address this question here except to note that different answers can lead us to prefer different measurement techniques. For instance, it is relatively easy to observe a person&apos;s preference by looking at which things they choose. Their happiness in different situations is harder to observe, so you might do better just asking them directly if that&apos;s what you care about. On the other hand, there are many reasons to suspect people&apos;s answers to &apos;how happy are you&apos; across time and between people don&apos;t exactly correspond to the true landscape of happiness, so even if you cared about happiness you might take a person&apos;s preferences seriously, if you thought they liked to be happy.<p></p><p>When the situation you want to evaluate will have ramifications for other people than the one(s) directly affected, the preferences and feelings of the people involved will be a poor proxy for the overall good or bad done. For instance, suppose you are considering educating a young woman in a developing country. This should help her, but it is thought to also have large effects on her children and others in her community. If you are hoping to eventually lift her region out of poverty through this type of action, you are relying mostly on good from such indirect effects. In this case, discovering how much the woman would like to be educated is not very useful. Even if she wouldn&apos;t like to be educated at all it may be a good intervention. Similarly, if a person does not understand or care very much about their own future, their views on the value of improving it are not very useful. Asking a child how much they would like to be dewormed is not very useful.</p><p>One might deal with this in the earlier step, by equating &apos;one child dewormed&apos; into a small amount of health, education, and physical development. A child might know better how much they dislike being sick, or adults may be able to shed light on the long term costs of malnourishment. Or you might just abstract a child&apos;s illness to be generic illness, and ask how much better informed people wish to avoid such illness.\n</p><h3>How to elicit: ask or observe?</h3>\nIn many situations what people think or say they value differs from what they choose given the opportunity. There are many possible reasons for this, from hypocrisy to difficulty envisaging the situation of interest accurately and without a biased focus. To the extent one believes a person&apos;s behavior better indicates their &apos;real&apos; preferences, observing choices will be more accurate than asking. However a person&apos;s speech may better reflect their preferences on reflection than their behavior, which usually comprises a combination of considered preferences and unendorsed urges. If you wish to respect only the former, this is some reason to ask instead of observing.<p></p><p>Asking also has the benefit of making it relatively easy to isolate the issue of interest; natural situations rarely allow one to pin a preference to a specific factor, as so many factors change. For instance, if you see that parents choose to send their children to school at substantial cost, you might like to infer that they expect the education to benefit their children substantially. But it could also be that they expect their children to look poor if they don&apos;t go to school, and be treated worse. Then if the school didn&apos;t exist their children would not be worse off - they are just worse off if the school does exist, and they don&apos;t go to it.\n</p><h3>Who to elicit it from?</h3>\nThe best people to evaluate A and B would seem to be people who have experienced both, and are currently either experiencing both or neither. This way they will hopefully be familiar with both items, and not too biased by the details of one being more salient at the moment.<p></p><p>Often it will be hard to find people in exactly that situation though. You will often have a trade off between people who are familiar with one item and not the other (so know more but might be biased) and people who are not familiar with either (so know little, but probably less biased).</p><p>This is all only an issue if you are interested in evaluating A and B for the person directly involved. If you want to know about the overall social benefits of fewer people being blind for instance, compared to fewer people being crippled, you may be better off asking someone who is neither blind nor crippled.\n</p><h3>Comparison or separate evaluation?</h3>\nSuppose you want to know whether it is better to get a five year old to go to school for an extra year, or to avoid them getting malaria for one year, and you intend to figure it out by asking their parents. One way you could do it is to ask each parent &apos;do you think your child will be better off if she goes to school this year and gets malaria, or if she doesn&apos;t go to school or get malaria this year?&apos;. Another is to ask some parents how valuable they think going to school is, and other parents how valuable they think avoiding malaria is, then comparing those values.<p></p><p>If you ask a person to compare two things at once, you will often get different answers to if you get them to just compare one or the other. One reason is that when they can see things side by side, they compare on the characteristics that seem salient. When they can only see one thing, they tend to ignore characteristics if they don&apos;t feel like they can get any grasp on how good the actual number for the characteristic is, even if it seems important. In our earlier example, suppose that for both the school and the health interventions, the parents are told how much extra income their child is likely to have in the future as a result of the project, and zero-to-ten how much their child will like it at the time. Suppose education will bring about much more future income than the health intervention on offer, but makes the child 2/10 happy instead of 8/10 happy. Then when the parents look at both interventions together, they might weigh up the present costs and future gains and choose the education intervention. When they look at the projects separately though, they might have fairly similar mental images of two different largish gains in future income, whereas happiness looks quite different on the given scale. So implicitly they focus more on the difference in happiness, and so the comparison could come out the other way.</p><p>***</p><p>These have been several of the considerations which make some evaluation methods more appropriate than others, at different times. The social science literature has a lot more to say. Hopefully our menu nonetheless summarizes enough important points to strengthen our research comparing interventions, and can be built upon in the future as we carry out such comparisons.</p><p><em>Crossposted from the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2014-05-22/apples-and-oranges-some-initial-thoughts-comparing-diverse-benefits\">Giving What We Can blog</a></em></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Katja_Grace"}}, {"_id": "viAPyZNSzHTADeC6b", "title": "How much do Y Combinator founders earn?", "postedAt": "2014-05-28T12:59:47.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p></p><h2>Introduction and summary</h2>\nWe&#x2019;re interested in estimating how much tech entrepreneurs earn, since it&#x2019;s one of our top recommended <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/314-in-which-career-can-you-make-the-most-difference\">careers</a>, partly because of its earnings. Big earners can create a lot of economic value and can sometimes become <a href=\"/earning-to-give\">big donors</a>. We wanted to find out: <em>if you get into Y Combinator, how much will you earn?</em> We&#x2019;re interested in Y Combinator because it&#x2019;s the best known seed accelerator, and the data is available. Here&#x2019;s what we found:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The total value of Y Combinator companies is $26 billion, of which the founders own $8 billion.</li>\n\t<li>Most of the returns have gone to a tiny minority of super-successes.

Two years ago, Forbes estimated the total value of Y Combinator companies at <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/04/30/top-tech-incubators-as-ranked-by-forbes-y-combinator-tops-with-7-billion-in-value/\">US$7.8 billion</a><sup><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>, but this year, their value has skyrocketed due to its largest companies receiving big valuations in their latest funding rounds:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Dropbox was valued <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303465004579327001976757542\">US$10 billion</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Stripe was valued at <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304632204579337043662898228\">US$1.75 billion</a>.</li>\n\t<li>AirBnB was valued at <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304626304579509800267341652\">US$10 billion</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.seed-db.com/accelerators/view?acceleratorid=1011\">Seed-DB</a> estimate that the total of all companies that have exited is US$1.3 billion<sup><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>. The rest of operating companies are probably worth another few billion<sup><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup>. So of the total of US$26 billion, the overwhelming majority comes from the three top companies.<p></p><p>Paul Graham has previously <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/swan.html\">noted</a> how unintuitively fat-tailed startup investing can be:\n</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Effectively all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners. The total value of the companies we&#x2019;ve funded is around US$10 billion, give or take a few. But just two companies, Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.&#x201D;</blockquote>\nInvesting in startups is risky. However, founding them is even riskier, because founders can&#x2019;t diversify their equity across multiple firms. Of founders backed by venture capital, the top <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w13056\">2%</a> get half of the equity. Of Y Combinator founders, the top 0.5% have 78% of the total equity<sup><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup>. Essentially, Drew Houston from Dropbox has put all his eggs in one basket and it has paid off.<p></p><p>Whether this bet will appeal to you depends on what you plan to do with the money. As Bill Gates points out, if you spend millions of dollars on yourself, they soon reach diminishing returns:\n</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I can understand wanting to have millions of dollars, there&#x2019;s a certain freedom, meaningful freedom, that comes with that. But once you get much beyond that, I have to tell you, <em>it&#x2019;s the same hamburger</em>. Dick&#x2019;s [the Seattle fast food chain] has not raised their prices enough.&#x201D;</blockquote>\nIn contrast, giving can scale. As our researcher Carl Shulman <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers\">put it</a>: <em>What would I do with a tenth Ferrari? Not much. But with my tenth vaccine&#x2026; I can vaccinate another kid.</em> So if you can think of good things to do with a billion dollars, or if earning that billion dollars indicates you created a lot of economic value, entering Y Combinator becomes more desirable.\n<h2>How much do Y Combinator founders earn?</h2>\nThe total earnings of all Y Combinator founders is around US$9 billion and so the average founding team is worth US$14 million. Together, the founding teams of AirBnB and Dropbox are worth about US$6 billion. Stripe&#x2019;s founding team are probably worth about another billion dollars<sup><a href=\"#fn:5\">5</a></sup>. On my previous estimate, the remainder of Y Combinator companies are worth US$4.25 billion. Of this, the founders probably only own $2 billion.<sup><a href=\"#fn:6\">6</a></sup> This gives a grand total of $9 billion of founder-equity, representing 35% of the total value of Y Combinator companies.<p></p><p>The problem with averaging across all Y Combinator companies is that some of them are too young to have achieved much growth.</p><p>To get a less conservative estimate, we can focus on the older companies. The total net worth of founders from the first 5 years of Y Combinator&#x2019;s operations (2005-09) is about $7 billion<sup><a href=\"#fn:7\">7</a></sup> or $48 million per founding team<sup><a href=\"#fn:8\">8</a></sup>. This estimate depends a little on which exact year you cut it off. From 05-08, the total net worth is US$3 billion, or US$30 million per founding team. Let&#x2019;s split the difference and say that the average founding team from Y Combinator&#x2019;s heyday has earned US$39 million. Assuming typically-sized teams, this is $18 million per founder. As 5-9 years have passed since the graduation of these companies, they have earned about US$2.5 million per founder per year over this time<sup><a href=\"#fn:9\">9</a></sup></p><p>To get a more conservative estimate, we can see what Y Combinator pays to invest in companies. Y Combinator recently increased their standard investment to US$120,000, valuing each company at US$1.7 million, of which each founding team owns $1.6 million<sup><a href=\"#fn:10\">10</a></sup>. At this valuation, each founder stands to earn US$100,000 per year (in cash or equity).<sup><a href=\"#fn:11\">11</a></sup> However, this estimate will be low because Y Combinator&#x2019;s business model depends on investing at a discount rate in exchange for training and access to further investment.\n</p><h3>What about founders that didn&#x2019;t win big?</h3>\nFor the overwhelming majority of founders, their basket of eggs does not turn to gold. This leaves a range of possibilities. Looking again at graduates from the first five years of Y Combinator, 55 (38%) of these companies are now dead, 38 (26%) have been sold and 52 (36%) continue to operate. <a href=\"http://mattermark.com/number-of-y-combinator-companies-sold-for-over-40m-by-year-funded/\">Paul Graham</a> recently said that 18 (12%) of the startups from this period have been sold or valued at US$40 million<sup><a href=\"#fn:12\">12</a></sup>. I count 6 companies that have sold for that much,<sup><a href=\"#fn:13\">13</a></sup> leaving 12 in operation. I count a further 15 companies that have sold for between US$5 and $40 million<sup><a href=\"#fn:14\">14</a></sup>. So here is how it all breaks down:<p></p><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0eGj9qB.png\" alt=\"Y Combinator results from 05-09\"></p><p>So most of these companies have died or are struggling on with low valuations. A few still stand a chance at making it big, and a substantial minority have made small exits. These small (US$0-40m) exits are smaller than they may seem because a) the founding team only owns a portion of the equity, b) this must be divided between the founders, c) it will be taxed and d) it is achieved by years of hard work with minimal salary.\n</p><h3>What about the companies that died?</h3>\nThe founders whose companies die usually only earn small salaries. Before being admitted to Y Combinator, founders usually live off savings or taking <a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20reports%20and%20covers/2008/11/capital_structure_decisions_new_firms.pdf\">loans</a>. During the Y Combinator program, they use only a one-off seed investment from Y Combinator of <a href=\"http://blog.ycombinator.com/the-new-deal\">US$120,000</a> to pay living and business expenses<sup><a href=\"#fn:15\">15</a></sup>. If they go on to receive angel investment can pay themselves about <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/How-much-money-should-company-founders-get-as-salary\">$50,000</a> per year. With venture capital funding, this tends to increase to about <a href=\"http://www.sethlevine.com/wp/2012/08/how-much-should-a-start-up-ceo-make\">US$100,000</a> per year<sup><a href=\"#fn:16\">16</a></sup>.\n<h2>How much could you expect to earn going forward?</h2>\n<h3>Will Y Combinator&#x2019;s results project into the future?</h3>\nSo should we expect founders earnings to continue at their historical average? There are some reasons to suspect that they will not. First, the valuation environment for technology companies <a href=\"http://avc.com/2014/03/the-bubble-question/\">may</a> worsen. Second, competing seed accelerators have arisen and so some of Y Combinator&#x2019;s founders and venture capitalists may leave. Third, there is a selection effect at play. There is a lot of unpredictable variation in the performance of incubators. We have studied Y Combinator because of its fame and success, but some of the early teams may have been lucky, upwardly distorting our estimates<sup><a href=\"#fn:17\">17</a></sup>. Over time, we should expect performance to regress to the mean. All things considered, these factors make US$2.5 million per founder per year an optimistic forward estimate.\n<h3>What are my chances of being accepted by Y Combinator?</h3>\nThe next part of the equation is your chance of being accepted. Y Combinator inform me that they have accepted 2.5% of their latest batch of applicants, with a few late applications still pending<sup><a href=\"#fn:18\">18</a></sup>.<p></p><p>It is hard to estimate the chance of being accepted to Y Combinator for a particular individual. The competition is exceptionally technically able, intelligent and determined. Your chance of getting accepted will depend on <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/founders.html\">personality traits</a>, the <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/start.html\">strength of your</a> cofounders, and the <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/howtoapply.html\">quality of your product</a>. Mostly, Y Combinator invest in internet technology startups but they are also starting to fund <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=27&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CLICEKkCMBo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fstart-up-investor-bets-on-biotech-1.15096&amp;ei=y11YU4eEBq2w7AadpYHYBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSS4DATf75GRP48VvPjRFVJyIXLw&amp;sig2=6aJRje4MfWEVYH69cdPV0w\">biotechnology</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=25&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CJ8CEBYwGA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techmeme.com%2F130906%2Fp20&amp;ei=y11YU4eEBq2w7AadpYHYBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUOt4b7Fa0uaxe7wr9JLQ5Qeu7XQ&amp;sig2=up4dEFfLxtSJoUHzs7T-gQ\">nonprofits</a>.\n</p><h3>What are my expected earnings once I get into Y Combinator?</h3>\nAlmost all of the expected earnings of Y Combinator founders are concentrated in the tail - in the AirBnBs and Dropboxes. So your expected earnings in Y Combinator depend on the extent to which your company resembles these big successes. For a lot of people, whether to enter Y Combinator, and entrepreneurship in general, hinges on the answer to this hard question.<p></p><p>So what predicts big success? Well, venture capitalists think they know something about this - some companies find it relatively easy to get their funding and others struggle. We&#x2019;ve only reviewed a little of the relevant literature, but it appears that <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/23-entrepreneurship-a-game-of-poker-not-roulette%20\">intelligence</a> is at least somewhat predictive of success. Typically, the most successful founders are more ambitious than average, have technical expertise, have a strong team, and have entered a top university (though have not necessarily finished). For marginal founders who would not find it easy to get funding and do not resemble the super-successes, it may not be good to enter Y Combinator. On the other hand, individuals who possess more of the traits of successful entrepreneurs can plausibly claim that if they pass the application, they will earn - on expectations - millions of dollars per year. There is plenty of opportunity for more research here.</p><p>The bottom line is that we expect future Y Combinator founders to make an average of US$700,000-18 million, or US$100,000-2.5 million per year, and the chance of being accepted is 2.5%. What you personally can expect to earn by applying to Y Combinator depends on:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>How likely you are to get accepted into Y Combinator, and</li>\n\t<li>How likely you are to go on to create the next AirBnB or Dropbox (2 companies among hundreds).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n\t<li>In June 2011, Paul Graham said the top 21 companies were worth <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/nums.html\">US$4.7 billion</a>. <a href=\"#fnref:1\">&#x21A9;</a></li>\n\t<li>Seed DB has estimates for &gt;80% of exited companies.

The companies from the first 5 years (2005-09) of Y Combinator are worth US$24 billion, or US$170 million each, on average. If you move the cut-off forward by a year (05-10), the average market capitalisation is US$120m. If you push it back by a year, the average is US$130m.

IQ also has the benefit of being easily quantifiable, which would make it simpler to compare interventions.\n<h2>Cost-effectiveness metrics</h2>\nAn important metric for comparing causes is cost-effectiveness (number of &#x201C;things&#x201D; accomplished per dollar). Which things should we count? Some cost-effectiveness measures are very specific, such as the number of malaria cases prevented per dollar. But when comparing between causes (such as between preventing malaria and improving education), it&#x2019;s best to have a broad metric. There are two major types of metrics: health-related (e.g., <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year\">quality-adjusted life years</a>) and economic (e.g., increases in GDP).\nWhile health-related and economic metrics are appropriate in some cases, they aren&#x2019;t ideal. Health-related metrics may be relatively unimportant if you care about far-future causes, such as <a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\">existential risk</a>. Economic outcomes can be hard to measure. Even GDP, one of the most common metrics of economic output, is not universally accepted as a valid measure of economic productivity.<p></p><p>Instead, I propose that effective altruists take a closer look at interventions to raise IQ. Cognitive improvements would have a wide range of benefits, described below, and would be easy to quantify. As Nick Beckstead <a href=\"/ea/3u/a_proposed_adjustment_to_the_astronomical_waste/\">argues</a>, effective altruists who want to improve the far future should consider taking actions that have broad, generalized benefits.\n</p><h3>Is the low end or the high end important?</h3>\nThe most obvious way to measure cost-effectiveness of IQ interventions would be to measure the cost of increasing the average IQ in a population of a certain size by one point. However, the average hides a lot of information.\nAssume a population has an IQ distribution like this:<p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-initial.png\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-initial.png\" alt=\"IQ initial\"></a></p><p>One intervention results in this:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-final-1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-final-1.png\" alt=\"IQ final 1\"></a></p><p>Another results in this:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-final-2.png\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-final-2.png\" alt=\"IQ final 2\"></a></p><p>Same increase in the average, very different impacts.</p><p>It&#x2019;s an open question whether it&#x2019;s more important to improve IQ at the low end or the high end. (The two often aren&#x2019;t mutually exclusive.) My intuitions:\n</p><ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>To reduce violence, it would be most important to improve IQ at the low end.</li>\n\t<li>Better decision-making would occur more dramatically at the low end, but people at the high end are more likely to be making important decisions.</li>\n\t<li>Improving the low end would be important for increasing economic productivity, but most long-term growth would come from the high end (due to increased technological progress).</li>\n\t<li>Most of the benefits from innovation would come from the high end.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Benefits of increasing IQ</h2>\n<h3>Decreased violence</h3>\nThe strong correlation between low IQ and violent or criminal behavior is clear from extensive research. <a href=\"#ftn1\">[1] </a><a href=\"#ftn2\">[2] </a><a href=\"#ftn3\">[3]</a> The fact that the correlation is observed even among children raised by the same parents suggest that IQ causes violent behavior, rather than some environmental factor causing both low IQ and violence. <a href=\"#ftn4\">[4]</a><p></p><p>Steven Pinker argues that the Flynn effect (the consistent increase in IQ that has been observed over generations for about a century) is responsible for the remarkable decrease in violence that has occurred from prehistoric times to the present day. According to him, reason and rationality are some of the &#x201C;better angels of our nature&#x201D; that can curb violence.<a href=\"#ftn5\">[5]</a> It is plausible that increased IQ will lead to better reasoning, though uncertain. (See below.)</p><p>There is good evidence that the sharp drop in crime during the latter half of the twentieth century was due to decreased exposure to lead. (See <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline\">here</a>.) One of the most notable effects of lead exposure is decreased IQ, but it&#x2019;s unclear whether the increase in crime associated with lead exposure is due to its cognitive effects.\n</p><h3>Increased economic productivity</h3>\nA 1-point increase in IQ corresponds to approximately a 1% increase in wages for an individual.<a href=\"#ftn6\">[6] </a> There is also a strong correlation (0.82) between IQ and per capita GDP, though it seems plausible that causality runs in both directions, with extreme poverty causing low IQ. <a href=\"#ftn7\">[7] </a>\n<h3>Improved decision-making</h3>\nA study of college students showed that students with higher IQ did not do significantly better on some tests of rationality, though they did do better on other tests and were better able to evaluate the quality of an argument.<a href=\"#ftn8\">[8]</a> People with high IQ are also more likely to underestimate their own biases that hinder their rationality.<a href=\"#ftn9\">[9]</a><p></p><p>However, the average college student probably has an IQ far above the global average, so the low end was not represented in this study. It also did not capture the high end, since it only included students from an average college. Additionally, it only measured abstract tests of irrationality (such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy\">base rate fallacy</a>). There are plenty of more prosaic examples of rationality in everyday life. (Since rationality has connotations of abstract reasoning, I prefer to call this &#x201C;decision-making&#x201D;.) It&#x2019;s unclear that the formal study of fallacies and biases significantly affects decision-making. (See <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/9p/extreme_rationality_its_not_that_great/\">here </a> and <a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/optimalbias\">here</a>.) On more mundane matters, someone with a low IQ would be expected to make worse decisions than someone with an average IQ. People with low IQs are more likely to experience a range of poor outcomes, such as teen pregnancy, controlling for childhood socioeconomic status.<a href=\"#ftn10\">[10]</a></p><p>I did not find any research on whether IQ affects rationality at the high end, but it seems like a promising topic, since high-IQ people are more likely to be making important decisions in society.</p><p>In a survey that controlled for factors such as education and income, IQ was correlated with opposition to economic protectionism. Economists almost universally agree that protectionism is bad policy.<a href=\"#ftn11\">[11]</a> Even Paul Krugman, who generally favors greater government intervention in the economy, opposes protectionism. (He once said that if there were an Economist&#x2019;s Creed, it would include the statement &#x201C;I advocate free trade.&#x201D;) Free trade is a particularly worthy cause for effective altruists, who care about the interests of people in the developing world. It is estimated that the removal of all subsidies and trade barriers would have a net economic benefit of $44 trillion, much of which would benefit the poor. Since there&#x2019;s currently widespread public support for protectionism, it seems plausible that increased opposition could lead to the removal of trade barriers.<a href=\"#ftn12\">[12]</a>\n</p><h3>Innovation</h3>\nIncreasing IQ could have large benefits in scientific and technological progress. People with extremely high intelligence are far more likely than average people to receive tenure at a research university and be successful in business. Even within scientific research, the most influential research tends to be produced by people who have higher intelligence than the average scientist.<a href=\"#ftn13\">[13]</a>\n<h2>Interventions to increase IQ</h2>\nSocial interventions targeting young children may be able to increase intelligence. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) is an inventory that measures the quality of a child&#x2019;s home environment, with items such as &#x201C;child has three or more puzzles&#x201D; and &#x201C;parent holds child close for 10-15 minutes per day&#x201D;. Controlling for maternal IQ, the HOME score was positively correlated with IQ for two-year-olds.<a href=\"#ftn14\">[14]</a> However, interventions to change behavior are often <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/66-social-interventions-gone-wrong\">difficult to implement</a>, though there are some that have been successful.<p></p><p>Nutrient supplements (particularly iodine, but also protein and iron) are a cost-effective way to increase IQ. Studies generally only report changes in the median or the mean IQ, but presumably supplements would mainly help the low end of the spectrum.</p><p>Another option is to use <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf\">in vitro fertilization to increase IQ</a>, but this could be politically controversial.\n</p><h2>Implications for effective altruists</h2>\nEffective altruists may give more consideration to causes such as iodine supplementation because of their large flow-through effects compared to other public health programs, such as deworming. While this would be a step in the right direction, I generally think it&#x2019;s relatively ineffective to fund proven, non-controversial public health interventions, because the market for funding these causes is <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">fairly saturated</a>.\nInstead, I propose that effective altruists support efforts to do research into IQ. This could mean doing the research directly or doing funding or advocacy. In general, effective altruists should support research if they have reason to believe it&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/103-how-to-do-important-research\">systematically underfunded</a>.\n<h3>Which types of research are underfunded?</h3>\n&#xA0;\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Social interventions?\nWhile psychologists are aware of some social factors that influence cognitive abilities, it seems that the main bottleneck is the difficulty in changing behavior through social interventions. Given the large number of people working on social interventions of all types, I don&#x2019;t believe this would be systematically underfunded. (On the other hand, my impression is that social psychology and public policy are seen as lower-status than, say, theoretical physics, so they may attract fewer talented people. This would imply that there are opportunities for a bright person to have an impact.)</li>\n\t<li>Biomedical interventions?\nThere is a lot of research into interventions such as iodine supplementation that raise IQ. However, I believe that these may be underfunded because they are viewed as public health interventions and the long-term benefits are not appreciated. I think working to identify new biomedical influences on IQ would be very cost-effective.</li>\n\t<li>Genetic interventions?\nThis type of research is probably the most underfunded, due to social stigma. However, the main bottleneck may be changing public attitudes regarding these efforts, which brings us back to the realm of social psychology and advocacy.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Potential objections</h2>\n&#xA0;\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Childhood IQ tests are inaccurate, so it can take decades to evaluate a new intervention.</em>\nResponse: Though childhood IQ tests are less accurate than adult tests, they correlate fairly well with adult scores.<a href=\"#ftn15\">[15]</a> The question is not whether IQ is easy to measure, but whether it&#x2019;s easier than other metrics of success, such as &#x201C;spreading positive values&#x201D;. Additionally, this implies that it may be worth investing in better tests of IQ.</li>\n\t<li><em>Other interventions, such as deworming, have similar flow-through effects.</em>\nResponse: There is some evidence (summarized <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Developmentalimpacts\">here</a>) that deworming increases school attendance, wages, and labor productivity (though not through increasing IQ). However, the evidence is mixed and there&#x2019;s a much narrower range of benefits than raising IQ could have. Additionally, school attendance seems like a bad metric of success, given the extremely poor quality of schools in the developing world.</li>\n\t<li><em>We might create evil geniuses.</em>\nResponse: This seems worth exploring further. However, the preliminary evidence suggests that raising IQ will reduce violence.\nI don&#x2019;t currently advocate the creation of superhuman intelligence, simply increasing intelligence within the &#x201C;normal&#x201D; range. If one thinks that increasing the number of people in the (normal) high-IQ range would be net negative, would it be good to reduce the number of people in this range?

I&#x2019;m trying to sit down with some of these people and learn more about their thoughts and motivations.</p><p>Today, I sit down with Boris Yakubchik. He&#x2019;s the co-President of Giving What We Can: Rutgers and has been involved in the effective altruist movement for a long time, regularly giving away 50% of his income to the Against Malaria Foundation.</p><p></p><center><img title=\"Boris Yakubchik\" src=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/images/posts/interview-with-boris-yakubchik/boris.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Yakubchik\"></center><p></p><p><strong>Peter Hurford:&#xA0;</strong><em>One of the most notable things about you is that you regularly give 50% of your salary to <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com\">the Against Malaria Foundation</a>&#xA0;without missing a beat. How did you get to that point in your life? And do you plan on going any further?</em></p><p><strong>Boris Yakubchik:</strong> I was lucky to have learned about effective altruism before I started my full-time job. I joined <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> previously and was already giving 10% from my part-time self-employed tutoring income. And by January 2012 I started my full-time job as a high-school math teacher and my income more-than-doubled.</p><p>Before taxes I started earning close-to $50,000 and my expenses were less than $20,000. I figured I didn&#x2019;t need a more-lavish lifestyle and I thought I would be able to sustain giving 50% to cost-effective charities.</p><p>Unfortunately in 2013 I was not working full time and wanted to quickly pay down the college debt of my fianc&#xE9;e, so I temporarily decreased my giving to 10%.</p><p>I&#x2019;m at the moment trying out a work-from-home business in which my parents have been successful; it has the potential for a significantly higher income than a teacher.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Why did you pick Against Malaria Foundation as a place to give? Why not give somewhere else, or to a bunch of different charities?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> At the time that I started giving, AMF was <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>&#x2019;s top-rated charity. I feel that is the best reason.</p><p>Also, I had several &#x201C;Birthday for Charity&#x201D; events and was able to <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/Fundraiser.aspx?FundraiserID=6941\">raise money for AMF directly through their website</a>. There is certainly a psychological tie to giving to AMF because I&#x2019;ve publicly endorsed AMF for several years now.</p><p>I&#x2019;m open to giving to other charities, and through the years have done that. Specifically I gave to <a href=\"http://veganoutreach.org/\">Vegan Outreach</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehumaneleague.com/\">the Humane League</a> based on the evaluations from <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>.</p><p>There are some strong arguments that conclude that once you find the best charity, you ought to give there. I give the bulk of my money to whichever charity I think does the most towards eliminating extreme poverty, but will continue to give nontrivial amounts to organizations that effectively decrease animal suffering.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>You say your expenses are less than $20K. That&#x2019;s quite frugal! How do you make that work?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I don&#x2019;t want lavish things, my car is for purposes of getting from point A to point B. I try to minimize large expenses (like apartment rent). I rarely eat out (my fiancee cooks amazing food). Most of the entertainment is virtually free: spending time with friends, reading book and internet, watching films at home.</p><p>I wrote up some of the best advice about frugal liging that I&#x2019;ve come across on my website: <a href=\"http://www.yboris.com/frugal.php\">http://www.yboris.com/frugal.php</a></p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Let&#x2019;s change topics a little bit. Another thing I&#x2019;ve seen you talk a lot about is the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GivingWhatWeCanRutgers\">Giving What We Can chapter at Rutgers</a>. What does it do? And how did you get involved with it?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I was lucky to watch the Rutgers chapter get started (primarily by Nick Beckstead, Mark Lee, and Tim Campbell) and attend the meetings from day one. At our second meeting I gave a short talk about positive psychology and how giving affects happiness (primarily relying on Andreas Mogensen&#x2019;s wonderful <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/giving-without-sacrifice.pdf\">&#x201C;Giving Without Sacrifice&#x201D;</a>).</p><p>By the second academic year I volunteered (and was elected) as the president. The main task has been to organize events, and get others involved. The primary function of the chapter is to draw an audience of undergraduate and graduate students, educate them about the problems of extreme world poverty, and demonstrate to them that they can individually make a big positive difference in the world.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve done that through a variety of events like lectures (e.g. Poverty: Lessons Learned from Photography), workshops (e.g. THINK&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/modules/charity-assessment\">Evaluating Social Interventions</a>), and fundraising (Booksale for Charity).</p><p>Last academic year we had another President running Giving What We Can: Rutgers, Micha&#xE9;l MF.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Wow. I always forget that there are a lot of cool people involved in the Rutgers chapter! Have your events been able to engage people well? What lessons have you learned from running them?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I wish I tracked our success more quantitatively, but I&#x2019;m confident that over the years we&#x2019;ve been able to encourage many to start giving more effectively. At the very least, several of my friends have joined Giving What We Can (started giving at least 10%).</p><p>Some of the events we had, for example <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsl9cyaIn-g\">Thomas Pogge came to give a talk</a>, drew an audience of students who have never heard of Giving What We Can, several stayed around after the talk to learn more. Some events were attended poorly, in part because of poor advertizing on my part, but we have video recordings for others to see, for example <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvUcbcUMtXw\">Zell Kravinsky talked about how he gave away over $40 million</a>.</p><p>While it&#x2019;s certainly important to have an interesting and educational event, it&#x2019;s very important to advertise widely. Doing things by yourself isn&#x2019;t the best strategy, I really recommend giving specific tasks to those who are interested in helping (e.g. contact the student paper to send a correspondent, or print 3 flyers and post them in these buildings).</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Do you have any tips on how to advertise an event so that people get interested and come?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I&#x2019;m not sure how important it is to have a well-designed flyers, but posting flyers has been successful for us. There have been times when we post flyers on the day of the event with &#x201C;TODAY&#x201D; written on it. I think that can encourage more people to look at the flyer, thus increasing the chances of more people attending.</p><p>Personal invitations have worked well, one acquaintance I had I urged to come to our meeting, she came just because of the request and was interested enough to come to many events for several semesters.</p><p>I had better success getting people to come when I was a student at Rutgers. I don&#x2019;t know, but it seemed that when we had weekly meetings (same day, same time, same location), we had better attendance than when we had them bi-weekly. Perhaps building a habit is good.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>I saw that as a part of GWWC: Rutgers you even were able to give a TEDx talk on cost-effectiveness in philanthropy. That&#x2019;s so cool! How did you arrange for that to happen? What came out of it?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> TEDxRutgers happened for several years at Rutgers and in early 2013, Micha&#xE9;l MF told me that he knew some of the people organizing the event. Because I&#x2019;ve given talks related to Effective Altruism (some modeled on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcZkXq2C40I\">Toby Ord&#x2019;s presentation</a>), Micha&#xE9;l put me in touch with the organizers. I was lucky that they still had some space in their line-up and I was accepted with a 12-minute limit.</p><p>I had significant help from friends and the EA community while drafting and revising my talk (at the very least I&#x2019;d like to thank Roxanne Heston). I wish I had an extra day to practice, because during the final talk I stumbled several times.</p><p>Unfortunately, it took a long time for the video to be edited. But,finally, a year later, we were able to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPe9-OM7vgU\">post it online on the Giving What We Can YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>In addition to raising awareness via Giving What We Can: Rutgers, I&#x2019;ve also seen you raise awareness on different issues via prolific posting on Facebook. And I remember we once talked about how you were handing out leaflets from Vegan Outreach that encourage people to eat less meat. A lot of people, like me, care a lot about these causes, but are too shy to become activists. How did you cross that bridge?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I was rather shy even in my first year in college, but by third year I became a lot more social (with the help of a friend who kept encouraging me to go to parties with him). I didn&#x2019;t like the parties, but at some point I somehow knew hundreds of people and felt a lot more confident talking to strangers.</p><p>At some point, I went silly in the head on Facebook and started befriending people who I just met once, or who had some large number of friends in common; so I managed to have a &#x2018;network&#x2019; of about a thousand people.</p><p>At first I was a cheerleader for science, posting news of fantastic discoveries and potential technologies, but with time, especially once I learned of extreme world poverty and moral arguments like Peter Singer&#x2019;s, I decided to use my platform to share pro-social ideas.</p><p>I think incremental steps can help one become less uneasy about approaching others (when handing out VO booklets), and it&#x2019;s easy to talk about what you&#x2019;re passionate about.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Do you have any recommendations to people that also want to get involved in influencing, whether through Facebook, pamphlets, or official organizations?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> Facebook provides a rather safe environment for starting a conversation. It&#x2019;s hard to know how much influence posts and discussions can have, but I think over the years, at least a dozen people have messaged me privately saying things akin to &#x201C;I really appreciate your posts&#x201D; and even &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve influenced my thinking&#x201D;.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve occasionally posted images that were provoking (especially ones urging people to take steps to decrease animal suffering). Sometimes the discussions are hijacked by people that sound like they are from another planet, but at other times it feels productive.</p><p>Getting involved with official organizations is great because they legitimize what you are doing. It&#x2019;s much easier to talk about a topic when others are there for that purpose.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Has anyone reacted negatively or hostile to your activism? If so, how do you deal with that?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I&#x2019;ve had in the past some discussions with friends (in person) where the topic of morality came up and I argued too forcefully. I think one needs to be very careful when discussing issues like that because even well-worded comments can be misunderstood, and even the purpose of the discussion could be misinterpreted. With practice you can get better at these conversations. I absolutely love Giving What We Can&#x2019;s approach: you just share your excitement about how awesome it is that you can, thanks to research and awesome organizations, help people significantly with little cost to you!</p><p>It&#x2019;s possible that some people won&#x2019;t be moved by arguments or other appeals. Something that&#x2019;s helpful is to keep in mind that people come from different backgrounds with different assumptions. Motivating a change that is too drastic can backfire. Reading books written by psychologist can help (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X\">Influence</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Charisma-Myth-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591845947\">The Charisma Myth</a>, etc)</p><p>One of the most helpful books I&#x2019;ve read was <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Animal-Activists-Handbook-Maximizing/dp/1590561201\">&#x201C;The Animal Activist&#x2019;s Handbook&#x201D;</a> which shares excellent (psychology-informed) advice about working towards change.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Speaking of vegan activism, I&#x2019;ve heard you describe yourself personally as &#x201C;near vegan&#x201D;. What do you mean by that? And how did you make that lifestyle change?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> The first time I heard of vegetarianism was with a PETA leaflet that compared factory farms with concentration camps. This was too-drastic for me to accept at the time and I promptly threw it away with a laugh and a thought &#x201C;crazy people&#x201D;.</p><p>I was lucky that I met many vegetarians through my college careers, many were happy to say why they chose it for themselves, many were not pushy. I think because I liked the people, I was eager to learn more.</p><p>Through extended conversations, and especially because I made a close friend (Graduate Philosophy student) who was vegetarian, I warmed up to the arguments. I was lucky that my diet was primarily vegetables based (mom cooked soups, fried potatoes, etc) so it wasn&#x2019;t hard to decrease my meat consumption.</p><p>For the longest time, and still, I think of vegetarianism as a continuum. This type of thinking makes it psychologically easier for people to eat less meat: they can feel like they are already doing something by eating less.</p><p>I know it&#x2019;s possible to be entirely vegan; one year that I was living alone I just refrained from buying animal products. But I think it&#x2019;s better to be flexible (and not freak out over some butter in your restaurant dish) - this creates a more inviting picture for others to join.</p><p>It&#x2019;s important not to forget about the social component: you are able to do more by encouraging and inspiring others to change too.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>When not trying to save the world, what do you do in your free time?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I really enjoy reading and have read some amazing books in the past (I recommend some here: <a href=\"http://www.yboris.com/reading.php\">http://www.yboris.com/reading.php</a>). I like electronic music and listen often through the day (have been listening to trance/progressive house on <a href=\"http://www.di.fm/\">di.fm</a> for over a decade). I enjoy spending time with friends, learning about and joking about trivial things. During the summer, hiking is one of my favorite activities.</p><p>Now I&#x2019;m lucky to have met a partner for life, Yetzenia, now my fiancee. We live together and thus spend most of the time in each other&#x2019;s company. I recently bought a used projector and with the help of a large white wall Yetzenia and I watch movies.</p><p>I look forward to the release-version of Oculus Rift.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Last time we talked, you were involved in a massive cross-continental US road trip with your fiancee. What&#x2019;s that like? What&#x2019;s your favorite moment?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> It&#x2019;s hard to pick one. The 10,000-mile trip was wonderful and we both learned a lot about what we like and what we don&#x2019;t. There were numerous beautiful moments, I&#x2019;ll share one.</p><p>One of the most exhilarating moments for me was when I found a probably-five-story-high mountain of sand along the East Coast Highway in California (some miles north of LA); I walked up it for a long time, and then ran down. Yetzenia described that I looked like a gazelle. By the time I reached the bottom I was breathless, laughing, with tears running down my eyes from the wind.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Wow, that sounds really fun! Well, thanks for taking the time to let me get to know you! This was awesome!</em></p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/interview-with-boris-yakubchik/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></em></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "6ANGzPD8bE3Md4fwd", "title": "Effective altruism outreach plans", "postedAt": "2014-05-02T23:30:37.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p></p><h2>Overview</h2>\nOver the coming couple of years, the primary project that <a href=\"http://www.williammacaskill.com/\">William MacAskill</a> and I, <a href=\"http://www.nielbowerman.com/\">Niel Bowerman</a>, will be working is effective altruism outreach. We&#x2019;re now referring to this as a distinct project within the Centre for Effective Altruism, called, fittingly, &#x201C;EA Outreach&#x201D;. Our aim is to grow and strengthen the effective altruism (EA) movement. &#xA0;In this post I lay out some of my current thoughts on what this might involve. &#xA0;This is only my current best guess, and is likely to change as the project evolves.\n<h2>Movement-building strategy</h2>\nMuch of the work we will be doing can be conceptualised in a four-stage movement-building strategy. &#xA0;This framework builds on the model we used while I was volunteering for President Obama on his Energy and Environment Policy Team during his first presidential campaign. &#xA0;It has also developed out of thinking I did with people like <a href=\"http://www.caspertk.co.uk/\">Casper Ter Kuile</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielvockins\">Dan Vockins</a> and <a href=\"http://party.coop/person/ben-west/\">Ben West</a> while building the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Youth_Climate_Coalition\">UK Youth Climate Coalition</a>.<p></p><p>This framework can be thought of as the four stages that we would like people to move through while involved in the EA community. &#xA0;Briefly, the four stages are:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li><b>Initial contact</b>, in which people first hear about EA, and are exposed to its ideas enough to want to find out more.</li>\n\t<li><b>Getting involved</b>, where people are actively learning about the principles behind EA, getting involved in the community, and taking actions to increase their social impact.</li>\n\t<li><b>Training up</b>,<b> </b>which is about giving people the access to information, mentoring, networks and resources that they need to scale up their impact.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sustainability</strong>, which is about making the movement sustainable by preventing burning-out and ensuring the long-term survival of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\nI will now discuss our activities in each stage in more detail. &#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/four-box-design-v2.1-cropped.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/four-box-design-v2.1-cropped.jpg\" alt=\"four-box design v2.1 cropped\"></a>\n<h2>Initial contact</h2>\nThe first stage in a person&#x2019;s involvement in a movement is finding out about it. &#xA0;We have a unique and unusually good opportunity in William MacAskill&#x2019;s upcoming book titled &#x201C;Effective Altruism&#x201D;, which we hope to use to introduce more people to the movement.\n<h3>William MacAskill&#x2019;s book</h3>\n<a title=\"Announcing a forthcoming book on effective altruism\" href=\"/ea/60/announcing_a_forthcoming_book_on_effective/\">William MacAskill&#x2019;s book</a> will be released in the summer of 2015, and we hope to use the time between now and then in order to build a media and marketing campaign around it, and in particular around EA.<p></p><p>In the US, the book will be published by <a href=\"http://www.penguin.com/meet/publishers/gotham/\">Gotham</a>, an imprint of Penguin Books USA. &#xA0;In the UK we have a deal with <a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/about/press/guardian-faber/\">Guardian Faber</a>, a collaboration between publisher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faber_and_Faber\">Faber and Faber</a> and national newspaper <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">The Guardian</a>. &#xA0;We will be collaborating closely with The Guardian for our UK marketing and media campaign.</p><p>Our marketing campaign around the book has three main components: maximising sales in the first week, maximising sales after the opening week, and maximising the flow-through benefits for the EA movement. &#xA0;I won&#x2019;t go into the strategy on each of these components here to prevent this post from getting too long.</p><p>Will has pledged his profits from book sales will either be reinvested in marketing or be donated to effective charities. &#xA0;Peter Singer is also currently working on a more academic book about EA, and he and William are coordinating campaigns so as to increase the impact of these publications.\n</p><h3>Media campaign</h3>\nWe will begin the media run-up to the book launch by introducing the ideas behind EA to the media in the latter half of 2014. &#xA0;The current strategy is to create a debate around the principles behind EA as applied to contemporary news topics.<p></p><p>We are contractually obliged to undertake a &#x2018;media silence&#x2019; in the US in first half of 2015. &#xA0;This is so that we can increase our chances of appearing in the major US media outlets in launch week in summer 2015 as we would not have been in them for the past six months.</p><p>In the UK, because of our partnership with the Guardian, we will probably do some media outreach in the first half of 2015, however this is still under negotiation.\n</p><h3>Speaking tour</h3>\nAccording to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Author-Bestselling-Book-Publicity-Book/dp/1593375247\">Robyn Spizman and Rick Frishman</a>, on average one in four audience members buy a copy of the book on speaking tours. &#xA0;In the summer and autumn/fall of 2015 William MacAskill will be going on a speaking tour of EA chapters. &#xA0;We hope that William&#x2019;s book will offer audience members a direct next step to take after the talk in order to learn more about EA.\n<h2>Getting involved</h2>\nWilliam MacAskill&#x2019;s book, as well as much of the media interest, will direct people online to learn more about EA, and to get involved. &#xA0;Over the coming year, we are hoping to build an easy-to-use entry point that people can come to in order to learn more about EA and to get involved.\n<h3>EffectiveAltruism.org</h3>\nWe have purchased EffectiveAltruism.com and EffectiveAltruism.org. The current Effective-Altruism.com site will probably move to EffectiveAltruism.org/blog. We will develop this site considerably from where it is now. We hope that EffectiveAltruism.org will become the landing page for people interested in learning more about EA for the first time. &#xA0;We will have content there to help people learn about the core concepts behind EA, as well as lots of links to other organisations and other EA projects that people can get involved in. We aim for it to be a hub or entry point for anyone who hears about effective altruism (such as through the book or publicity) to find out about the many EA organisations.<p></p><p>EffectiveAltruism.org will not itself be providing large numbers of volunteering opportunities for people to get involved in, nor will it be coordinating chapters or meet ups. &#xA0;It will simply be publicising these opportunities. &#xA0;We hope that groups such as <a href=\"http://dotimpact.im/\">.impact</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveWell\">growing</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">number</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.greatestgoodfoundation.com/\">of</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups\">different</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">effective</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">altruist</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">organisations</a> will help provide these volunteering and meet-up opportunities.\n</p><h3>EffectiveAltruism.com</h3>\nEffectiveAltruism.com will be a landing page for the Effective Altruism book, and an alternative route into the content on EffectiveAltruism.org. &#xA0;We hope that these sites will be able to use a unified back-end.\n<h2>Training up</h2>\nOnce people are involved in the EA movement, we want to be able to give them opportunities to train up by gaining skills, growing their networks, increasing access to resources and providing mentoring and guidance. &#xA0;Groups like <a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">CFAR</a> and <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> are already doing great work in this area, and so we will spend relatively less time in this area compared to the activities outlined above.<p></p><p>There are a few initiatives that we would like to take on if others in the EA community do not take them on first. &#xA0;These include setting up a mentoring scheme within the community, and undertaking an initiative to make it easier for EA donors to fund new EA projects.\n</p><h3>Effective Altruism Research</h3>\nIn order to allow people to learn about the more in-depth side of effective altruism (for example the details of giving now vs later, or the haste consideration) we plan to set up a well-categorised and easily searchable curated collection of posts on more advanced EA topics. &#xA0;As the community grows, we think it will be useful to centralise and categorise this work so that people can learn about advanced EA topics more easily. &#xA0;We are currently looking for a volunteer curator for this project, so if you are interested please contact me at first.last@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\n<h2>Movement sustainability</h2>\nOnce a movement has attracted people, and they have trained up and are having significant social impact, the challenge is to keep people involved in the movement if that is where they can be having the most impact. &#xA0;This means preventing burn-out on an individual level, but also ensuring that the movement as a whole does not collapse. &#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.leverageresearch.org/\">Leverage Research</a> have been doing some work in this area, but there is much more that can be done, and so this is the final area in which we will focus our efforts.<p></p><p>For example, the specific concept and message of EA is likely to be determined early on. But currently no-one is doing brand management for this. There is a risk that the concept becomes too weird (e.g. sole focus on existential risks from artificial intelligence), too mainstream (giving 1% to Oxfam is &#x2018;effective altruism&#x2019;), becomes too dominated by one specific cause-area, or otherwise starts to develop the wrong attributes (too aggressive, not welcoming, not having high enough epistemic standards). &#xA0;We will be carefully monitoring each of these risks throughout our media campaign and defending against them.\n</p><h2>Target audience</h2>\nWe will be developing our marketing strategy in more detail as the project develops, however at this stage it is clear that we will have at least two distinct target markets. &#xA0;The first is people quite similar to those who have already been drawn to effective altruism. &#xA0;This is a broad audience and is likely to be further segmented.<p></p><p>The second audience we hope to reach out to is certain types of VIPs. &#xA0;We have noticed that our successes to date across most areas, whether in moving money to effective charities, fundraising, raising the profile of effective altruism, or our policy advocacy, have usually been reliant on a surprisingly small number of particularly influential people that we have reached out to. &#xA0;We would like to focus more of our efforts on these VIPs in order to increase the overall impact of our work.\n</p><h2>Going forward</h2>\nWilliam MacAskill will complete the first draft of the US version of &#x201C;Effective Altruism&#x201D; in summer 2014. &#xA0;This will then go out to a number of review panels and editors to refine it and polish it further. &#xA0;Simultaneously William will be working on the UK version of &#x201C;Effective Altruism&#x201D; (he will be using some different examples, different phraseology, probably a slightly different tone, and of course different spelling). &#xA0;Once the writing stage is complete we plan to move onto the first stage of the media campaign. &#xA0;Alongside this William will be starting as a Junior Research Fellow at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_College,_Cambridge\">Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a> from October 2014.<p></p><p>In my role as Director of Special Projects at the <a href=\"http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> I split my time between this project and the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/global-priorities-project/\">Global Priorities Project</a>. &#xA0;Part of my time over the coming weeks will be spent coordinating the media launch of the Global Priorities Projects report on Unprecedented Technological Risk with the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/\">Oxford Martin School</a>. &#xA0;However in the future I aim to spend approximately 80% of my time on the EA Outreach project. &#xA0;I am currently developing a more in-depth strategy for the project, which we will then take to The Guardian to get buy-in before moving going ahead with it.</p><p>If funding allows we would like to hire someone with PR and marketing experience to do the day-to-day coordination of the marketing and media campaigns for this project. &#xA0;We have identified a couple of candidates for this role in our recent recruitment round. &#xA0;We have also identified web developers who have offered to develop the sites discussed above for significantly reduced rates. &#xA0;We will start on these projects once the overall strategy is finalised.</p><p>I am always keen to hear people&#x2019;s feedback and suggestions, so please do comment below if you have thoughts about the strategy outlined above.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "Mn4fDHSdRWsDDJkqc", "title": "2014 survey of effective altruists", "postedAt": "2014-05-02T04:39:13.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p></p><div><p></p><p>I&apos;m pleased to announce the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1jjBWT9\">first annual survey of effective altruists</a>.

How might that decision go if you want to incorporate principles of effective altruism in the big decisions of your life? In considering the costs and attractions of parenthood, I will make the case that having children can indeed be consistent with those principles. I&#x2019;ll also explain why I think the EA movement should be open to the idea of parenthood as part of an EA life.\n<h2>How does parenthood fit into a life based on effective altruism?</h2>\nI am not a parent myself: I have to make my estimation of the costs and some of the benefits from the data I can gather, including experiences and opinions of parents. However this decision can only be made from such a point of inexperience. Indeed, one of the reasons this is a difficult decision is that there are few realistic options for changing one&#x2019;s mind after one has had a child, and for women the option is only open for a limited (but unknown) timeframe.\n<h3>What are we asking?</h3>\nIt can be useful to consider big decisions abstractly, to determine the ideal sequence of actions to take in our life without consideration for our individual psychologies. This can make us aware of the decision space, and encourage us to cultivate helpful desires. However, when we make decisions we must consider who we are. Within the effective altruist movement we seek to ask how we as individuals can achieve the most good possible. If a proposed action would render a particular person miserable, it&#x2019;s highly unlikely they will be able to stick to it. Moreover, the question of potential parenthood is usually being asked by two people whose relationship offers them mutual support. The well-being and psychological needs of both those people must factor in the analysis.\n<h3>What are the costs of a child?</h3>\nEstimates of the financial costs of child-raising range from the considerable to the enormous, but the figures available are not robust or free from bias. A UK insurance group has estimated &#xA3;220,000 to raise a child from birth to 21<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>, with childcare (&#xA3;60k) and education (&#xA3;70k) forming the bulk of this. The number has been criticised on a number of grounds<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> by economist Tim Harford,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a> who also a pointed out the obvious benefit to a company which sells life insurance of inflating the accepted cost of parenthood. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Child Poverty Action Group made a more conservative estimate of &#xA3;148,000 for a couple raising one child to the age of 18.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a>&#xA0;This figure is derived from their minimum income standard (or MIS<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a>), which is their calculation of the minimum support needed for two adults and one child. Currently set at &#xA3;468 per week, the MIS outstrips the minimum wage two people would earn in the UK, suggesting that two adults earning minimum wage would be unable to support any children. The fact that many do suggests the MIS is not actually a minimum.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]</a><p></p><p>While meeting the needs of your child will cost a significant amount &#x2013; especially paid childcare in the early years &#x2013; the manner in which you do it has some flexibility. As adults, as part of an EA life, we have chosen to limit our consumption and live more simply. These simpler lives may certainly exceed a &#x2018;minimum standard&#x2019; &#x2013; they can be downright lovely. Some of the reasons for this include cultivating tastes for less expensive pleasures and recreations, as well as leveraging non-financial resources such as education, or proximity to friends and family. The same principles, I believe, can be extended to our children without deprivation.</p><p>Bryan Caplan&#x2019;s excellent book <em>Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</em><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]</a> reviews the evidence from 40 years of adoption and twin studies with a frankly liberating result: barring actual deprivation or trauma, children are largely who they are going to be as a result of their genetic makeup. In long-term measures of well-being, education and employment, parental influence exerts a temporary effect which disappears when we are no longer living with our parents. So costly added extras (music lessons, coaching and tutoring, private school fees) are probably not going to change your child&#x2019;s life in the long term. &#xA0;(However, data on the antenatal environment suggests benefit to taking iodine, but avoiding ice-storms and licorice during pregnancy.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]</a>) Sharing time together and finding common interests can build a good relationship and help a child develop without major costs.</p><p>Taking this information into account, I estimate that for two parents living in the UK, the cost of raising a child to independence while providing what&#x2019;s needed for their health, education and wellbeing will be between &#xA3;150-&#xA3;200,000. If we estimate 18-21 years for them to reach such independence, this gives an approximate range of &#xA3;3500-&#xA3;4800 per parent per year. But we don&#x2019;t &#x2018;lose&#x2019; our children when they are no longer dependent upon us: it might be better to consider the cost as a lifetime cost, so that if you become a parent at 30 and expect to live till you are 80, the cost is more like &#xA3;2000 per parent per year over one&apos;s remaining years of life.</p><p>This considerable cost can be put into perspective with other spending decisions. The annualised lifetime cost of parenthood is less than many spend annually on a car and petrol. It is less than the cost differences at stake in deciding which city to live in, or whether to live rurally. It&#x2019;s much less than the difference in wages between two potential careers. For this reason I think it is a real mistake to consider the financial costs of parenthood as being categorically different to many of the other lifestyle choices we make. It would seem irrational to choose a profession that would have significant adverse effect on your well-being for the sake of a &#xA3;2000 p.a. increase in wages.</p><p>In addition to straightforward financial outlay, parenthood comes with costs of time and opportunity. Loss of flexibility and leisure mean you won&#x2019;t be able to take all opportunities (like taking on extra work to make more money or advance your career). Late notice travel is unlikely to be possible. You will probably be sleep deprived for a large part of the first year or more of your child&#x2019;s life, and this may impact on your work performance. The work of parenting will take time, though some of it may be outsourced at the cost of increased financial outlay.</p><p>So, this baby is going to cost you about &#xA3;2000 a year and take a variable but large amount of your time, which will equate in the end to another chunk of money. For parents taking parental leave or working less than full time to provide childcare, there may be delay to career progression as well as income. &#xA0;Does this represent an unacceptably large sum of money and time to be compatible with the goal of maximising our impacts for the good?</p><p>I would argue it&#x2019;s possible to integrate this cost into one&#x2019;s personal rather than charitable budgets. When deciding if we would try to start a family, my partner Toby and I planned a &#x2018;baby budget&#x2019;: we would each contribute a portion of our income to the fund for our child&#x2019;s needs. By doing this we can still meet our giving pledges, but adjust other spending patterns. In effect, we would channel money from ourselves to this other person, without reducing our commitments to give. If the costs turn out to be higher than we can absorb this way, I may reduce my giving, but am confident of still being able to give over &#xA3;1,000,000 in the course of my career.</p><p>Likewise, we would plan to continue to work in our careers full time (after a period of parental leave). We envisage that our personal time budgets would change pretty dramatically.&#xA0; I don&#x2019;t work all the hours in a day (even if it sometimes feels like it!) and neither does my partner.&#xA0; We spend time talking over coffee, we listen to music, we read, we walk, we hang out with friends, I knit and sometimes I watch a lot of crappy television. How might that time budget change? There would be fewer sleep-ins, and more wakeful nights. I would probably exchange bad TV for audiobooks while breastfeeding. Our walks would be shorter and slower, and will be more likely to end in a playground than a pub.</p><p>Some of this &#x2013; the sleeplessness, bits of pregnancy and the process of childbirth &#x2013; would not be fun. Again, I don&#x2019;t think this represents a categorical difference from the sacrifices we elect to make in pursing other long term goals. In my case, I&#x2019;ve worked 84 hours of night shifts in a week, a feat which requires several days to recover physically and mentally, because it was integral to training in my career. I&#x2019;ve studied for hours at either end of a full time working day because I want to progress in my specialty.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]</a> If the payoff is worth it, I am prepared to do this too.\n</p><h3>So what&#x2019;s the gain?</h3>\nFirst, there can be personal benefits. While parenting is work, it&#x2019;s also a challenge and a discovery. To observe and take part in the growth of a human from a ball of cells to someone who can talk, think, reason and love sounds to me like a most amazing journey. I expect that parenthood will challenge me to the end of my character. I expect to learn and change and grow.<p></p><p>I don&#x2019;t think you have to become a parent to learn these lessons, but nor do I think I&#x2019;ll learn them just by working at my paid job. I might learn them from traveling widely, from climbing mountains, from learning another language, by arguing with strangers in a bar at 3am, by reading all of Derek Parfit&#x2019;s works, by singing songs with friends in the backyard on a sunny afternoon. For most of us, living a life means doing a lot of things that don&#x2019;t necessarily earn money or prestige. Some people might be able to work 80 hours a week, to just work and sleep and thrive on that. My observation is that even among highly motivated and talented coworkers, such people are the exception rather than the rule. If I did that I am reasonably sure I&#x2019;d be burned out and unhappy within 5 years, making such a plan not merely demanding but directly self-defeating.</p><p>The desire to be a parent &#x2013; to have children, either biologically or by other means &#x2013; does not always arise as a clear-eyed appraisal of the potential benefits. The (faintly derisive) term &#x2018;baby fever&#x2019; was coined to denote the intense desire for children that many people experience without being able to fully explain, and possibly in the face of their own analysis of the arguments for and against having a child.&#xA0; Some preliminary psychological research suggests the phenomenon has complex origins and is observable in both men and women.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]</a></p><p>It is clear that the longing for children that some people experience can not be overcome by clearly viewing the obstacles to and pitfalls of parenthood. The nature of this desire can be so strong, that even when achieving parenthood seems impossible, people&#x2019;s wish to become parents will drive them to extraordinary efforts. Fertility clinics treat patients prepared to endure years of waiting<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]</a>, followed by uncomfortable and invasive testing, difficult procedures and at least a 65% chance of failure<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn12\">[12]</a> in an effort to become parents. If they were able to rationalise themselves out of wanting children, they would stop before exhausting every possible resource &#x2013; medical, emotional and financial &#x2013; in efforts to start a family that might span a decade.&#xA0; In the light of this reality, the rationalist suggestion I have encountered &#x2013; that one guard against a desire to become a parent by pre-emptively being sterilised before the desire has arisen &#x2013; seems a recipe for psychological disaster.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t have the answer to the origin of the longing for children that many experience. It&#x2019;s almost certainly due to a complex mixture of biological and social factors. It might even be an evolutionary trick. However, the fact remains that this desire is real and difficult to manage if unfulfilled.&#xA0; It can&#x2019;t be simply discounted or argued away as irrational. It needs to form part of our considerations in whether or not we choose to (attempt to) become parents, because we must consider how tenable it is to sacrifice our chance to fulfil these desires</p><p>Finally we may ask whether parenthood &#x2013; and the resulting person created &#x2013; will benefit the wider world? This is a harder good to calculate or rely upon. The inheritance of specific character traits is difficult to predict. It&#x2019;s certainly not guaranteed that your offspring will embrace all of your values throughout their lifetime. The burden of onerous parental expectations are extensively documented, and it would appear foolish to have children on the expectation they will be altruistic in the same way you are. However, your child is likely to resemble you in many important respects. By adulthood, the heritability of IQ is between 0.7 and 0.8,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn13\">[13]</a>&#xA0;and there is evidence from twin studies of significant heritability of complex traits like empathy.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn14\">[14]</a>&#xA0;This would give them a high probability of adding significant net good to the world.</p><p>For EA&#x2019;s making this decision, there is a further benefit in changing how the world sees the EA life. A core message of <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> is that many people can do a significant amount of good. We are so comparatively wealthy that without significant sacrifice, we can help thousands of people. If the way we live implies that to make this difference you must sacrifice parenthood, this will drastically narrow the range of people who can consider doing the same.\n</p><h3>How do we weigh these up?</h3>\nIt&#x2019;s a complicated ledger.<p></p><p>On the one hand: the vast bulk of your leisure time for perhaps five years and a significant portion for the next 13, a less flexible work and home life, the emotional cost of knowing your heart may never be your own again, and finally your share of the financial cost of &#xA3;150,000-&#xA3;200,000. Two parents might be able to save 70 lives by donating this money to Against Malaria Foundation</p><p>On the other hand: we demonstrate the level of sacrifice required to make the world significantly better does not require a dramatic deviation from what most people consider &#x2018;a normal life&#x2019;; we gain all the good that might be contained in one life; two parents grow and develop and enjoy a lifetime with their child, and, for some, there is the fulfilment of a deep desire.</p><p>The nature of an individual will almost certainly play a determining role. For myself, I could theoretically cut my personal spending anyway, work more and be able to give more money, to save more lives. I could live just to work, earning to give. But I know such a life plan would be self-defeating and would not last. I&#x2019;m happy donating 50% of my income over my life, but if I also chose not have a child simply to raise that amount to 55%, then that final 5% would cost me more than all the rest, to the extent I don&#x2019;t believe I could continue to do so. Julia Wise writes beautifully about how it changed her outlook on life to allow herself the possibility of children,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn15\">[15]</a>&#xA0;and it&#x2019;s a feeling that I totally understand because I&#x2019;ve felt the same. I believe that by making this decision to spend my personal money and time budgets in this way, I&#x2019;m deciding to meet a major psychological need and to plan a life I can continue to live in the long term. I think this decision will also benefit my future child, and I think there is a significant chance it will benefit the wider world.\n</p><h3>Is EA &#x201C;family friendly&#x201D;? Why does it matter?</h3>\nWithin the EA movement I&#x2019;ve sometimes encountered a fairly dismissive attitude to parenthood in the abstract. Sometimes the best on offer is a sort of resigned tolerance, with EA&#x2019;s advocating we not &#x201C;shun&#x201D; people just for having children.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn16\">[16]</a>&#xA0; At other times I&#x2019;ve seen parenthood characterised as foolish, selfish or both, to be discouraged with great zeal. I genuinely wonder where this hostility comes from. Is it simply that the hostile attitudes I&#x2019;ve encountered have been expressed by people quite early in their lives? The onset of a desire to have a family may post-date one&#x2019;s third decade (creating difficulties for the half of our species with a limited reproductive lifespan). Possibly it&#x2019;s so prevalent because in our society women are more likely to express a desire for children than men are, and men dominate some internet EA conversations.<p></p><p>I hope these attitudes aren&#x2019;t representative. Providing some counter evidence is that since announcing that we are expecting a baby, my husband Toby and I have both experienced a universally warm and excited response from friends and colleagues in the EA community. I&#x2019;m reasonably sure &#x2013; and I certainly hope &#x2013; they aren&#x2019;t just deciding not to shun us.</p><p>I think it&#x2019;s vital that as a movement, EA enthusiastically embraces parents and potential parents. In order to spread EA values, and to build a robust movement, these values must be tenable as part of a whole life. We are not machines who can spend every waking moment working or earning money to give.

But this uncertainty can also arise out of fundamental normative uncertainty: out of not knowing, for example, what moral weight the wellbeing of distant strangers has compared to the wellbeing of our family; or whether non-human animals are worthy of moral concern even given knowledge of all the facts about their biology and psychology.<p></p><p>&#x2026;one might have expected philosophers to have devoted considerable research time to the question of how one ought to take one&#x2019;s normative uncertainty into account in one&#x2019;s decisions. But the issue has been largely neglected. This thesis attempts to begin to fill this gap.</p></blockquote>\nIn the first part of your thesis you argue that when the moral theories to which an agent assigns some credence are cardinally measurable (as opposed to ordinal-scale) <i>and</i> they are intertheoretically comparable, the agent should choose an action which &#x201C;maximizes expected choice-worthiness&#x201D; (MEC), which is akin to maximizing expected value across multiple uncertain theories of what is desirable.<p></p><p>I suspect that result will be intuitive to many, so let&#x2019;s jump forward to where things get more interesting. You write:\n</p><blockquote>Sometimes, [value] theories are merely ordinal, and, sometimes, even when theories are cardinal, choice-worthiness is not comparable between them. In either of these situations, MEC cannot be applied. In light of this problem, I propose that the correct metanormative theory is sensitive to the different sorts of information that different theories provide. In chapter 2, I consider how to take normative uncertainty into account in conditions where all theories provide merely ordinal choice-worthiness, and where choice-worthiness is noncomparable between theories, arguing in favour of the <i>Borda Rule</i>.</blockquote>\nWhat is the Borda Rule, and why do you think it&#x2019;s the best action rule under these conditions?<p></p><p></p><p><strong>Will MacAskill</strong>: Re: &#x201C;I suspect that result will be intuitive to many.&#x201D; Maybe in your circles that&#x2019;s true! Many, or even most, philosophers get off the boat way before this point. They say that there&#x2019;s no sense of &#x2018;ought&#x2019; according to which what one ought to do takes normative uncertainty into account. I&#x2019;m glad that I don&#x2019;t have to defend that for you, though, as I think it&#x2019;s perfectly obvious that the &#x2018;no ought&#x2019; position is silly.</p><p>As for the Borda Rule: the Borda Rule is a type of voting system, which works as follows. For each theory, an option&#x2019;s <i>Borda Score</i> is equal to the number of options that rank lower in the theory&#x2019;s choice-worthiness ordering than that option. An option&#x2019;s <i>Credence-Weighted Borda Score</i> is equal to the sum, across all theories, of the decision-maker&#x2019;s credence in the theory multiplied by the Borda Score of the option, on that theory.</p><p>So, for example, suppose I have 80% credence in Kantianism and 20% credence in Contractualism. (Suppose I&#x2019;ve had some very misleading evidence&#x2026;.) Kantianism says that option A is the best option, then option B, then option C. Contractualism says that option C is the best option, then option B, then option A.</p><p>The Borda scores, on Kantianism, are:</p><p>A = 2</p><p>B = 1</p><p>C = 0</p><p>The Borda scores, on Contractualism, are:</p><p>A = 0</p><p>B = 1</p><p>C = 2</p><p>Each option&#x2019;s Credence-Weighted Borda Score is:</p><p>A = 0.8*2 + 0.2*0 = 1.6</p><p>B = 0.8*1 + 0.2*1 = 1</p><p>C = 0.8*0 + 0.2*2 = 0.4</p><p>So, in this case, the Borda Rule would say that A is the most appropriate option, followed by B, and then C.</p><p>The reason we need to use some sort of voting system is because I&#x2019;m considering, at this point, only <i>ordinal</i> theories: theories that tell you that it&#x2019;s better to choose A over B (alt: that &#x201C;A is more choice-worthy than B&#x201D;), but won&#x2019;t tell you <i>how much</i> more choice-worthy A is than B. So, in these conditions, we have to have a theory of how to take normative uncertainty into account that&#x2019;s sensitive <i>only</i> to each theory&#x2019;s choice-worthiness ordering (as well as the degree of credence in each theory), because the theories I&#x2019;m considering don&#x2019;t give you anything more than an ordering.</p><p>The key reason why I think the Borda Rule is better than any other voting system is that it satisfies a condition I call Updating Consistency. The idea is that increasing your credence in some particular theory T1 shouldn&#x2019;t make the appropriateness ordering (that is, the ordering of options in terms of what-you-ought-to-do-under-<wbr>normative-uncertainty) <i>worse</i> by the lights of T1.</p><p>This condition seems to me to be <i>very plausible indeed</i>. But, surprisingly, very few voting systems satisfy that property, and those others that do have other problems.</p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Luke</strong>: One problem for the Borda Rule is that it is, as you say, &#x201C;extremely sensitive to how one individuates options&#x201D; &#x2014; a problem analogous to the problem of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_clones_criterion\">clone-dependence</a> in voting theory. You tackle this problem by modifying the Borda Rule to include a measure over the set of all possible options. Could you explain how that works? Also, is this modification to the Borda Rule novel to your thesis?</p><p></p><p><strong>Will</strong>: A measure is a way of giving sense to the size of a space. It allows us to say that some options represent a larger part of possibility space than others. This is an intuitive idea: &#x2018;drinking tea tomorrow&#x2019; represents a larger portion of possibility space than &#x2018;drinking tea with my left hand tomorrow at 3pm&#x2019;. With the idea of a measure on board, we can rewrite our definition of the Borda Rule, as follows (I&#x2019;ll ignore the possibility of equally choice-worthy options, as that makes the definition a little more complicated):</p><p>For each theory, an option&#x2019;s <i>Borda Score</i> is equal to the sum total of the measure of the options that rank lower in the theory&#x2019;s choice-worthiness ordering than that option. An option&#x2019;s <i>Credence-Weighted Borda Score</i> is equal to the sum, across all theories, of the decision-maker&#x2019;s credence in the theory multiplied by the Borda Score of the option, on that theory.</p><p>So, suppose that, according to some theory Ti, A&gt;B. On the old definition of the Borda Rule, A gets a Borda Score of 1. But if option B is split into options B&#x2019; and B&#x201D;, such that A&gt;B&#x2019;=B&#x201D;, then A gets a Borda score of 2. The fact that A&#x2019;s score has changed just because of how you&#x2019;ve individuated options is problematic.</p><p>But let&#x2019;s use the new definition, which incorporates a measure, and suppose that the measure of A is 0.5 and the measure of B is 0.5. If so, then, when the decision-maker faces options A and B, then A gets a Borda Score of 0.5, on Ti. But when option B is split into options B&#x2019; and B&#x201D;, then the measure is split, too. Suppose that B&#x2019; and B&#x201D; are equally large. If so, then B&#x2019; would have a measure of 0.25 and B&#x201D; would have a measure of 0.25. So A&#x2019;s Borda score, on Ti, would be 0.5, just as before.</p><p>This modification to the Borda Rule is novel, though the idea was given to me by Owen Cotton-Barratt, so I can&#x2019;t take credit! I guess the reason it hasn&#x2019;t been suggested in the voting theory literature is because it might seem obvious that every candidate gets the same measure. But perhaps you could think of the &#x2018;space&#x2019; of possible political positions (which would be easy if it were really a left-right spectrum), and assign candidates a measure based on how much of this space they take up. That could possibly allow for the Borda Rule to avoid problems to do with clone-dependence. But I think that for actual voting systems, the Schulze method is better than the Borda Rule. It&#x2019;s clone-independent even without a measure, and is much less vulnerable to strategic voting than the Borda Rule is.</p><p></p><p><strong>Luke</strong>: What is the relevance of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem\">Arrow&#x2019;s impossibility theorem</a> to your suggested use of a modified Borda Rule for handling normative uncertainty?</p><p></p><p><strong>Will</strong>: I suggest that, in conditions of ordinal theories, we should exploit the analogy with voting. But that analogy with voting means that we&#x2019;ll run into a analogue of Arrow&#x2019;s Impossibility Theorem: the result that no voting system can satisfy all of a number of highly desirable properties.</p><p>There are a few ways to formulate the impossibility result. The strongest, in my view, is to say that any voting system that satisfies other more essential properties must violate Contraction Consistency, where Contraction Consistency is defined as follows:</p><p>Let A be the option set, and M be the set of maximally appropriate options within A. Let S be a subset of A that contains all members of M. The condition is: <i>A</i> is a maximally appropriate option, given option set S, iff it is a member of M.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a condition that you&#x2019;ve got to be careful how to formulate. I don&#x2019;t go into that in my thesis. But some violations of it are intuitively clearly irrational. E.g. imagine you&#x2019;ve got the options of blueberry ice cream or strawberry ice cream. You currently prefer blueberry. But then you discover that the restaurant also serves chocolate ice cream, and so you switch your preference from blueberry to strawberry, even though your assessment of the relative values of blueberry and strawberry hasn&#x2019;t changed. That seems irrational &#x2013; e.g. it would suggest that you should spend resources trying to find out if you have available to you an option that you know you won&#x2019;t take.</p><p>I think that contraction consistency is a problem for the Borda Rule. But it&#x2019;s a problem that affects all voting system analogues. So it&#x2019;s something that we&#x2019;ve got to live with &#x2013; it&#x2019;s just unfortunate that we have (or ought to have) credence in merely ordinal theories.</p><p>There is a second response as well. Which is to distinguish the Narrow and Broad versions of the Borda Rule. The Narrow version assigns Borda Scores within an option-set. The Broad version assigns Borda Scores across all possible options. It&#x2019;s only the Narrow version that violates Contraction Consistency. But the Broad version has its own weirdnesses. Suppose that you&#x2019;ve got a situation:</p><p>99%: T1: A&gt;B</p><p>1%: T2: B&gt;A</p><p>Where T1 and T2 are merely ordinal theories. It might seem obvious that you should pick A in that situation. But you can&#x2019;t infer that from that case, according to the Broad Borda Rule. Instead, you&#x2019;ve got to look at how A and B rank in T1 and T2&#x2032;s ordering of all possible options. If A and B are very close on T1 but very far apart, on T2, then B might be the most appropriate option. So the Broad Borda is very difficult to use. And it gives results that seem wrong to me &#x2013; as if you&#x2019;re &#x2018;faking&#x2019; cardinality where there is none.</p><p>So my general view on this is that any account you have will have deep problems. Endorsing a particular view involves carefully weighing up different strengths and weaknesses; there&#x2019;s no obviously correct position. (This becomes a theme when you start working on normative uncertainty. To an extent, this should be expected: we&#x2019;re dealing with messy nonideal agents, who don&#x2019;t have perfect access to their own values or to the normative truth).</p><p></p><p><strong>Luke</strong>: Your thesis covers many other interesting topics; we won&#x2019;t try to cover them all here. How would you summarize the other major &#x201C;takeaways&#x201D; you&#x2019;d most want people to know about from your thesis?</p><p></p><p><strong>Will</strong>: The &#x201C;Maximise Expected Choice-Worthiness&#x201D; approach to moral uncertainty is the best approach. It is able to respond to a number of objections that have been levelled against it.</p><p>If you think that you can&#x2019;t compare choice-worthiness across theories, then you should normalise different theories at their variance. But I think that the arguments for intertheoretic incomparability don&#x2019;t work. Instead, you should feel comfortable about using your intuitions about how different theories compare.</p><p>We can make sense of the idea of two theories T1 and T2 having exactly the value-ordering over options, but T1 thinking that everything is twice as important as T2 does. So &#x2018;utilitarianism&#x2019; really refers to a class of theories, each of different levels of amplification.</p><p>Most of our intuitions about different Newcomb and related problems can be captured by maximising expected choice-worthiness over uncertainty about whether evidential or causal decision theory is true (with much higher credence in causal decision-theory than evidential decision theory). Taking decision-theoretic uncertainty into account puts causal decision theory on pretty strong grounds &#x2014; you can respond to the intuitive and &#x201C;Why Ain&#x2019;cha Rich?&#x201D; arguments in favour of evidential decision theory.</p><p>Moral philosophy provides a bargain in terms of gaining new information: doing just a bit of philosophical study or research can radically alter the value of one&#x2019;s options. So individuals, philanthropists, and governments should all spend a lot more resources on researching and studying ethics than they currently do.</p><p>Even if you think that continued human survival is net bad, you should still work to prevent near-term human extinction, in case the human race gets evidence to the contrary over the next few centuries. (Well, this is true given a few fairly controversial premises.</p><p></p><p><strong>Luke</strong>: Thanks, Will!</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "lukeprog"}}, {"_id": "kNJNziSDZbeWE4nXs", "title": "Good Done Right: a conference on effective altruism", "postedAt": "2014-04-07T15:00:10.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Registration for <a href=\"http://www.gooddoneright.com/\">Good Done Right</a>, a conference on effective altruism, is now open.</p><p>The conference will take place from the&#xA0;7th to the 9th of July at All Souls College, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford.

Of course a huge amount of research bears on this question, but I&apos;m most interested in research that addresses its distinctive characteristics. In particular, I&apos;m most interested in:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>Research that draws on what is known about different areas in order to actually make these comparisons. I think <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/givewell-labs\">GiveWell Labs</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/\">Copenhagen Consensus Center</a> are the two most salient examples of this work, though they have quite different approaches. I understand that the <a href=\"http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>&#xA0;(CEA) is beginning to invest in this area as well. I think this is an area where people will be able to get a lot of traction (and have already done pretty well for the amount of investment I&apos;m aware of) and I think it will probably go a very long way towards facilitating issue-agnostic giving.</li>\n\t<li>Research that aims to understand and compare the long-term impacts of the short-term changes which our investments can directly bring about. For example, research that clarifies and compares the long-term impact of poverty alleviation, technological progress, or environmental preservation, and how important that long-term impact is. This is an area where answers are much harder to come by, but even slight improvements in our understanding would have significant importance for a very broad range of decisions. It appears that high-quality work in this area is pretty rare, though it&apos;s a bit hard to tell if this is due to very little investment or if this is merely evidence that making progress on these problems is too difficult. I tend to lean towards the former, because (a) we see very little public discussion of process and failed attempts for high-quality research on these issues, which you should expect to see even if they are quite challenging, and (b) this is not an area that I expect to receive a lot of investment except by cause-agnostic altruists who are looking quite far ahead. I think the most convincing example to date is Nick Bostrom&apos;s <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/AstronomicalWaste.pdf\">astronomical waste argument</a> and Nick Beckstead&apos;s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE\">more extensive discussion of the importance of the far future</a>, which seem to take a small but reasonably robust step towards improving our understanding of what to do.</li>\n</ol>\nThere are certainly other relevant research areas, but they tend to be less interesting as cause prioritization per se. For example, there is a lot of work that tries to better understand the impact of particular interventions. I think this is comparably important to (1) or (2), but that it currently receives quite a lot more attention at the moment and it&apos;s not clear that a cause-agnostic philanthropist would want to change how this is being done. More tangentially, efforts to improve forecasts more broadly have significant relevance for philanthropic investment, though they are even more important in other domains so prima facie it would be a bit surprising if these efforts ought to be a priority by virtue of their impact on improving philanthropic decision-making.<p></p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: In public talks and private conversation, you have argued that instead of supporting any of the object-level interventions that look most promising on the evidence currently available, we should on the current margin invest in research on understanding which of those opportunities are most effective. &#xA0;Could you give us an outline of this argument?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: It seems very likely to me that more research will lead to a much clearer picture of the relative merits of different opportunities, so I suspect in the future we will be much better equipped to pick winners. I would not be at all surprised if supporting my best guess charity ten years from now was several times more impactful than supporting my best guess charity now.</p><p>If you are this optimistic about learning more, then it is generally better to donate to your best guess charity in a decade, rather than donating to your current best guess. But if you think there is room for more funding to help accelerate that learning process, then that might be an even better idea. I think this is the case at the moment: the learning process is mostly driven by people doing prioritization research and exploratory philanthropy, and total investment in that area is not very large.</p><p>Of course, giving to object level interventions may be an important part of learning more, and so I would be hesitant to say that we should avoid investment in object-level problems. However, I think that investment should really be focused on learning and exploring (in a way that can help other people make these decisions as well, not just the individual donor) rather than for a direct positive impact. &#xA0;So for example I&#x2019;m not very interested in scaling up successful global health interventions.</p><p>The most salient motivation to do good now, rather than learning or waiting, is a discount rate that is much steeper than market rates of return.</p><p>For example, you might give now if you thought your philanthropic investments would earn very high effective rates of return. I think this is unlikely for the kinds of object-level investments most philanthropists consider--I think most of these investments compound roughly in line with the global growth rate (which is smaller than market rates of return).</p><p>You might also have a high discount rate if you thought that the future was likely to have much worse philanthropic opportunities; but as far as I can tell a philanthropist today has just as many problems to solve as a philanthropist 20 years ago, and frankly I can see a lot of possible problems on the horizon for a philanthropist to invest in, so I find this compelling.</p><p>Sometimes &#x201C;movement-building&#x201D; is offered as an example of an activity with very high rates of returns. At the moment I am somewhat skeptical of these claims, and my suspicion is that it is more important for the &#x201C;effective altruism&#x201D; movement to have a fundamentally good product and to generally have our act together than for it to grow more rapidly, and I think one could also give a strong justification for prioritization research even if you were primarily interested in movement-building. But that is a much longer discussion.</p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: I think it would be interesting to examine more closely the object-level causes supported by EAs or proto-EAs in the past (over, say, the last decade), and use that examination to inform our estimates about the degree to which the value of future EA-supported causes will exceed that of causes that EAs support today. &#xA0;Off the top of my head, the EAs I can think of who have donation records long enough to draw meaningful conclusions all have in the past supported causes that they would now regard as being significantly worse than those they currently favour. &#xA0;So this would provide further evidence for one of the premises in your argument: that cause prioritization research can uncover interventions of high impact relative to our current best guesses.</p><p>The other premise in your argument, as I understand it, is that the value of the interventions we should expect cause prioritization research to uncover is high relative to the opportunity cost of current spending. Can you elaborate on the considerations that are, in your opinion, relevant for assessing this premise?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long and technical response. I see three compelling reasons to prefer giving today to giving in the future. But altogether they don&#x2019;t seem to be a big deal compared to how much more we would expect to know in the future. Again, I think that using giving as an opportunity to learn stands out as an exception here--because in that case we can say with much more confidence that we will need to learn more at some point, and so the investment today is not much of a lost cause.\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>The actual good you do in the world compounds over time, so it is better to do good sooner than later.</li>\n\t<li>There are problems today that won&#x2019;t exist in the future, so money in the future may be substantially less valuable than money today.</li>\n\t<li>In the future there will be a larger pool of &#x201C;smart money&#x201D; that finds the best charitable opportunities, so there will be fewer opportunities to do good.</li>\n</ol>\nRegarding (1), I think that the vast majority of charitable activities people engage in simply do not compound that quickly. To illustrate, you might consider the case of a cash transfer to a poor family. Initially such a cash transfer earns a very high rate of return, but over time the positive impact diffuses over a broader and broader group of people. As it diffuses to a broader group, the returns approach the general rate of growth in the world, which is substantially smaller than the interest rate. Most other forms of good experience a very similar pattern. So if this were the only reason to give sooner, then I think that you would actually be better served by saving and earning prevailing interest rates for an extra year, and then donating a year later--even if you didn&#x2019;t expect to learn anything new.<p></p><p>A mistake I sometimes see people make is using the initial rates of return on an investment to judge its urgency. But those returns last for a brief period before spreading out into the broader world, so you should really think of the investment as giving you a fixed multiplier on your dollar before spreading out and having a long-term returns that go like growth rates. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether that multiplier accrues instantaneously or over a period of a few years during which you enjoy excess returns. In either case the magnitude of the multiplier is not relevant to the urgency of giving, just whether the multiplier is going up or down.</p><p>A category of good which is plausibly exceptional here is creating additional resources that will flexibly pursue good opportunities in the future. I&#x2019;m aware that some folks around CEA assign very high rates of return, in excess of 30% / year, to investment in movement-building and outreach. I think this is an epistemic error, but that would probably be a longer discussion so it might be easier to restrict attention to object-level interventions vs. focusing on learning.</p><p>Regarding (2), I don&#x2019;t really see the evidence for this position. From my perspective the problems the world faces today seem more important--in particular, they have more significant long-term consequences--than the problems the world faced 200 years ago. It looks to me like this trend is likely to continue, and there is a good chance that further technological development will continue to introduce problems with an unprecedented potential impact on the future. So with respect to object-level work I&#x2019;d prefer to address the problems of today than the problems of 200 years ago, and I think I&#x2019;d probably be even happier addressing the problems we face 50 years.</p><p>Regarding (3), I do see this as a fairly compelling reason to move sooner rather than later. I think the question is one of magnitudes: how long do you expect it will take before the pool of &#x201C;smart money&#x201D; is twice as large? 10 times larger? I think it&#x2019;s very easy to overestimate the extent to which this group is growing. It is only at extremely exceptional points in history that this pool can grow 20% faster than economic growth. For example, if you are starting from a baseline of 0.1% of total philanthropic spending, that can only go up 20% per year for 40 years or so before you get to 100% of spending. On the flip side, I think it is pretty easy to look around at what is going on locally and mistakenly conclude that the world must be changing pretty rapidly.</p><p>I think most of what we are seeing isn&#x2019;t a changing balance between smart money and ordinary folk, it&#x2019;s continuously increasing sophistication on the part donors collectively--this is a process that can go on for a very long time. In this case, it&#x2019;s not so clear why you would want to give earlier when you are one of many unsophisticated donors rather than giving later when you are one of many sophisticated donors, even if you were only learning as fast as everyone else in the world. The thing that drives the discount rate earlier was the belief that other donors were getting sophisticated faster than we are, so that our relative importance was shrinking. And that no longer seems to apply when you look at it as a community increasing in sophistication.</p><p>So overall, I see the reasons for urgency in giving to be relatively weak, and I think the question of whether to give or save would be ambiguous (setting aside psychological motivations, the desire to learn more, and social effects of giving now) even if we weren&#x2019;t learning more.</p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: Recently, a few EAs have questioned that charities vary in cost-effectiveness to the degree that is usually claimed within the EA community. &#xA0;Brian Tomasik, for instance, argues that <a href=\"http://utilitarian-essays.com/why-charities-do-not-differ-astronomically.html\">charities differ by at most 10 to 100 times</a> (and much less so within a given field). Do you think that arguments of this sort could weaken the case for supporting research into cause prioritization, or change the type of cause prioritization research that EAs should support?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: I think there are two conceptually distinct issues here which should be discussed separately, at least in this context.</p><p>One is the observation that a small group looking for good buys may not have as large an influence as it seems, if they will just end up slightly crowding out a much larger pool of thoughtful money. The bar for &#x201C;thoughtful&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t that high, it just needs to be sensitive to diminishing returns in the area that is funded. There are two big reasons why this is not so troubling:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Money that is smart enough to be sensitive to diminishing marginal returns--and moreover which is sufficiently cause-agnostic to move between different fields on the basis of efficiency considerations--is also likely to be smart enough to respond to significant changes in the evidence and arguments for a particular intervention. So I think doing research publicly and contributing to a stock of public knowledge about different causes is not subject to such severe problems.</li>\n\t<li>The number of possible giving opportunities is really quite large compared to the number of charitable organizations. If you are looking for the best opportunities, in the long-term you are probably going to be contributing to the existence of new organizations working in areas which would not otherwise exist. This is especially true if we expect to use early investigations to help direct our focus in later investigations. This is very closely related to the last point.</li>\n</ul>\nThis issue is most severe when we consider trying to pursue idiosyncratic interests, like an unusually large degree of concern for the far future. So this consideration does make me a bit less enthusiastic about that, which is something I&#x2019;ve written about before. Nevertheless, I think in that space there are many possible opportunities which are simply not going to get any support from people who aren&#x2019;t thinking about the far future, so there still seems to be a lot of good to do by improving our understanding.<p></p><p>A second issue is that broad social improvements will tend to have a positive effect on society&#x2019;s ability to resolve many different problems. So if there is any exceptionally impactful thing for society to do, then that will also multiply the impact of many different interventions. I don&#x2019;t think this consideration says too much about the desirability of prioritization: quite large differences are very consistent with this observation, these differences can be substantially compounded by uncertainty about whether the indirect effects of an intervention are good and bad, and there is substantial variation even in very broad measures of the impact of different interventions. This consideration does suggest that you should pay more attention to very high-impact interventions even if the long-term significance of that impact is at first ambiguous.</p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: Finally, what do you think is the most effective way to promote cause prioritization research? &#xA0;If an effective altruist reading this interview is persuaded by your arguments, what should this person do?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: One conclusion is that it would be premature to settle on an area that currently looks particularly attractive and simply scale up the best-looking program in that area. For example, I would be hesitant to support an intervention in global health (or indeed in most areas) unless I thought that supporting that intervention was a cost-effective way to improve our understanding of global health more broadly. That could be because executing the intervention would provide useful information and understanding that could be publicly shared, or because supporting it would help strengthen the involvement of EA&#x2019;s in the space and so help EA&#x2019;s in particular improve their understanding. One could say the same thing about more speculative causes: investments that don&#x2019;t provide much feedback or help us understand the space better are probably not at the top of my priority list.</p><p>Relatedly, I think that global health receives a lot of attention because it is a particularly straightforward area to do good in; I think that&#x2019;s quite important if you want your dollar to do as much good directly as possible, but that it is much less important (and important in a different way) if you are paying appropriate attention to the value of learning and information.</p><p>Another takeaway is that it may be worth actively supporting this research, either by supporting organizations that do it or by giving on the basis of early research. I think Good Ventures and GiveWell Labs are currently the most credible effort in this space (largely by virtue of having done much more research in this space than any other comparably EA-aligned organization), and so providing support for them to scale up that research is probably the most straightforward way to directly support cause prioritization. There are some concerns about GiveWell Labs capturing only half of marginal funding, or about substituting with Good Ventures&#x2019; funding; that would again be a longer and much more complicated discussion. My view would be that those issues are worth thinking about but probably not deal-breakers.</p><p>I hear that CEA may be looking to invest more in this area going forward, and so supporting CEA is also a possible approach. To date they have not spent much time in this area and so it is difficult to predict what the output will look like. To the extent that this kind of chicken-and-egg problem is a substantial impediment to trying new things faster and you have confidence in CEA as an organization, providing funding to help plausible-looking experiments get going might be quite cost-effective.</p><p>A final takeaway is that the balance between money and human capital looks quite different for philanthropic research than for many object-level interventions. If an EA is interested in scaling up proven interventions, it&#x2019;s very likely that their comparative advantage is elsewhere and they are better served by <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/category/earning-to-give/\">earning money and distributing it to charities doing the work they are most excited about</a>. But if you think that increasing philanthropic capacity is very important, it becomes more plausible that the best use of time for a motivated EA is to work directly on related problems. That might mean working for an &#x201C;EA&#x201D; organization, working within the philanthropy sector more broadly, or pursuing a career somewhere else entirely. Once we are talking about applying human capital rather than money, ability and enthusiasm for a particular project becomes a very large consideration (though the kinds of considerations we&#x2019;ve discussed in this interview can be another important input).</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "admin3"}}, {"_id": "oJ4bsxgxvynMq7FMr", "title": "Announcing a forthcoming book on effective altruism", "postedAt": "2014-03-16T13:00:35.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>I&apos;m delighted to officially announce my forthcoming book on effective altruism.

It&apos;ll be in two parts. The first part explains the key principles behind effective altruism, illustrating them with reference to a wide variety of issues &#x2014; charity and career choice, which are heavily discussed by EAs, but also issues that are often discussed in mainstream media like Fair Trade, socially responsible investing, and sweatshop labour. The second part takes those principles and applies them to the questions of how to spend your money, how to spend your time, what are the most important causes, and what is the highest-value activity to be doing right now.</p><p>I&apos;d really like this to be the go-to resource for people interested in, but still new to, effective altruism.

I realized that not that many people know where the term &apos;effective altruism&apos; came from, nor that there was a painfully long amount of time spent deciding on it. And it was fun digging through the old emails. So here&apos;s an overview of what happened!</p><p>The need to decide upon a name came from two sources:</p><p>First, the <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> (GWWC) community was growing. <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> (80k) had soft-launched in February 2011, moving the focus in Oxford away from just charity and onto ethical life-optimisation more generally. There was also a growing realization among the GWWC and 80k Directors that the best thing for us each to be doing was to encourage more people to use their life to do good as effectively as possible (which is now usually called &apos;movement-building&apos;).</p><p>Second, GWWC and 80k were planning to incorporate as a charity under an &apos;umbrella&apos; name, so that we could take paid staff (decided approx. Aug 2011; I was Managing Director of GWWC at the time and was pushing for this, with Michelle Hutchinson and Holly Morgan as the first planned staff members). So we needed a name for that umbrella organization (the working title was &apos;High Impact Alliance&apos;). We were also just starting to realize the importance of good marketing, and therefore willing to put more time into things like choice of name.</p><p>At the time, there were a host of related terms: on 12 March 2012 Jeff Kaufman <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/a-name-for-a-movement\">posted</a> on this, listing &apos;smart giving&apos;, &apos;efficient charity&apos;, &apos;optimal philanthropy&apos;, among others. Most of the terms these referred to charity specifically. The one term that was commonly used to refer to people who were trying to use their lives to do good effectively was the tongue-in-cheek &apos;super-hardcore do-gooder&apos;. It was pretty clear we needed a new name! I summarized this in an email to the 80k team (then the &apos;High Impact Careers&apos; team) on 13 October 2011:\n</p><blockquote>We need a name for &quot;someone who pursues a high impact lifestyle&quot;. &#xA0;This has been such an obstacle in the utilitarianesque community - &apos;do-gooder&apos; is the current term, and it sucks.&quot;</blockquote>\nWhat happened, then, is that there was a period of brainstorming - combining different terms like &apos;effective&apos;, &apos;efficient&apos;, &apos;rational&apos; with &apos;altruism&apos;, &apos;benevolence&apos;, &apos;charity&apos;. Then the Directors of GWWC and 80k decided, in November 2011, to aggregate everyone&apos;s views and make a final decision by vote. This vote would decide both the name of the type of person we wanted to refer to, and for the name of the organization we were setting up.<p></p><p>Those who voted were as follows (I think, but am not certain, that this is complete):\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Will MacAskill (then &apos;Crouch&apos;)</li>\n\t<li>Toby Ord</li>\n\t<li>Nick Beckstead</li>\n\t<li>Michelle Hutchinson</li>\n\t<li>Holly Morgan</li>\n\t<li>Mark Lee</li>\n\t<li>Tom Ash</li>\n\t<li>Matt Wage</li>\n\t<li>Ben Todd</li>\n\t<li>Tom Rowlands</li>\n\t<li>Niel Bowerman</li>\n\t<li>Robbie Shade</li>\n\t<li>Matt Gibb</li>\n\t<li>Richard Batty</li>\n\t<li>Sally Murray</li>\n\t<li>Rob Gledhill</li>\n\t<li>Andreas Mogensen</li>\n</ul>\nTom Rowlands, who was then Director of Communications for both GWWC and 80k, sent round the following email on 3 December 2011:\n<blockquote>I&apos;ve been through all the suggestions on the umbrella name - thanks.The names that have arisen mostly reflect two components: an ethical position i.e. &apos;good&apos; and optimizing this i.e. &apos;maximisation&apos;We might also want a name for &apos;group&apos;.[I&apos;ve deliberately used the above words as they didn&apos;t arise in the suggestions, to avoid bias.]For these reasons, I&apos;ve split the voting into three parts, based on these categories - to do otherwise would make it almost incoherent. The downside is this doesn&apos;t really account for acronyms and combinations (you might like three of the terms in isolation, but don&apos;t like them as a group).So, please consider the options in the three categories, before coming up with up to three names you like together:e.g. Good Maximisation Group<p></p><p>1:</p><p>a) altruist\nb) do-gooder\nc) utilitarian\nd) humanist\ne) empathetic\nf) philanthropist\ng) consequentialist\nh) positive\ni) benetarian</p><p>2:</p><p>a) hardcore\nb) dedicated\nc) rational\nd) professional\ne) optimal\nf) high impact\ng) evidence-based\nh) effective\ni) biggest</p><p>3:</p><p>a) alliance\nb) group\nc) centre\nd) community\ne) institute\nf) network\ng) association</p><p>You might not think all three components are necessary, in which case just use the ones you think are e.g. Good Maximisers.</p><p>If you completely disagree with the methodology, please say so and I&apos;ll come up with another. I did spend some time considering this!</p><p>Sorry we haven&apos;t got to the voting yet, but it seemed like this is a necessary step on the way there.</p><p>Please send me your ideas by 2100 Sunday. I&apos;ll then send another email with a shortlist to vote on. [Michelle - I hope this meets the deadline; sorry if not)</p><p>From non-snowy Val Thorens,</p><p>Tom</p></blockquote>\nAnd on 5 December 2011 there was a vote, for what the name of the new umbrella organization should be. The shortlist was:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Rational Altruist Community RAC</li>\n\t<li>Effective Utilitarian Community EUC</li>\n\t<li>Evidence-based Charity Association ECA</li>\n\t<li>Alliance for Rational Compassion ARC</li>\n\t<li>Evidence-based Philanthropy Association EPA</li>\n\t<li>High Impact Alliance HIA</li>\n\t<li>Association for Evidence-Based Altruism AEA</li>\n\t<li>Optimal Altruism Network OAN</li>\n\t<li>High Impact Altruist Network HIAN</li>\n\t<li>Rational Altruist Network RAN</li>\n\t<li>Association of Optimal Altruists AON</li>\n\t<li>Centre for Effective Altruism CEA</li>\n\t<li>Centre for Rational Altruism CRA</li>\n\t<li>Big Visions Network BVN</li>\n\t<li>Optimal Altruists Forum OAF</li>\n</ul>\n(There was actually two other votes, too: one on whether to use &apos;Effective&apos; rather than &apos;rational&apos; or &apos;strategic&apos;; and one on whether to use &apos;Centre&apos; rather than anything else. Tom expressed how arduous the name-decision process had been - after this list he said &quot;Again, apologies for the way this process has gone. I&apos;ll try to keep the last couple of days relatively pain-free.&quot;&#xA0;&#xA0;I remember Matt Wage commenting that he thought that this whole process was a really ineffective use of time. But it seems to have been worth it in retrospect!)<p></p><p>In the vote, CEA won, by quite a clear margin. Different people had been pushing for different names. I remember that Michelle preferred &quot;Rational Altruism&quot;, the Leverage folks preferred &quot;Strategic Altruism,&quot; and I was pushing for &apos;&quot;Effective Altruism&quot;. But no-one had terribly strong views, so everyone was happy to go with the name we voted on. GiveWell was using &quot;rational altruism&quot; for a while after that point (e.g. <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/01/16/in-memory-of-aaron-swartz/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/02/15/self-evaluation-givewell-as-a-project-4/\">here</a>), before switching to &quot;effective altruism&quot;.</p><p>We hadn&apos;t planned &apos;effective altruism&apos; to take off in the way that it did. &apos;Centre for Effective Altruism&apos; was intended not to have a public presence at all, and just be a legal entity. I had thought that effective altruism was too abstract an idea for it to really catch on, and had a disagreement with Mark Lee and Geoff Anders about this. Time proved them correct on that point!</p><p>After that, the term was used progressively more, as 80,000 Hours started using it (e.g. <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/31-what-is-an-effective-altruist\">this</a> was the go-to page on effective altruism for quite a while, published 5th March 2012) and <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">THINK</a> was set up to promote effective altruism specifically. Ruair&#xED; Donnelly set up the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Effective Altruists Facebook group</a> in November 2012. Then I think what really solidified the term was Peter Singer&apos;s TED talk, which was filmed in March 2013, and posted on-line in May 2013.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "William_MacAskill"}}, {"_id": "rmLS3Q4B5aewENHu7", "title": "An argument for more effectual giving", "postedAt": "2014-03-08T21:25:26.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>We say we give to charity to make the world and its inhabitants better off. Unfortunately, our actual giving habits rarely reflect much concern at all for how much good we do. If we were really giving selflessly, we&#x2019;d care a lot more about effectiveness than our habits indicate.</p><p>The Make-A-Wish Foundation&#x2014;a well-known and very well-financed charity&#x2014;provides once-in-a-lifetime experiences to people 17 and under living with serious illnesses. By its own account, it costs around <a href=\"http://wish.org/content/faq#How-much-does-granting-a-wish-cost\">$7,200</a> to fulfill the average request. In contrast, the Against Malaria Foundation&#x2014;a cause most have never heard of&#x2014;funds and distributes long lasting insecticidal nets in poor countries with a high prevalence of malaria. According to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">independent sources</a>, it can save a life for a little under $2,400 on average, a price that likely beats that of any other organization.</p><p>Both are doing morally good work, and it&#x2019;s certainly better to give to either than spend money on a new Rolex. Still, it&#x2019;s a tragic waste to give to the former instead of the latter. To see why, think about how you&#x2019;d allocate your money when spending on people you care about. Imagine you have 4 children: Make-A-Wish raised over $180 million in contributions in 2012, while the Against Malaria Foundation received under $3 million that same year.Adam, Bob, Charles, and Dave. Adam has a terminal illness. He will surely die no matter what you do, so you hope to fulfill his lifelong dream of going to Disney World before he passes away. Bob, Charles, and Dave are also deathly ill. Unlike Adam, their diseases are curable, but treatment is expensive, and your funds are limited. You simply don&#x2019;t have enough money to save Bob, Charles, and Dave while providing for Adam&#x2019;s trip. Here are your options given your cruel financial realities: Deny Adam his wish and save your three remaining children, or send Adam to Disney World and let all four kids die. While the impulse to make Adam&#x2019;s final days more enjoyable is noble, it is&#x2014;in comparison to your other children&#x2019;s lives&#x2014;a frivolous luxury.</p><p>Similar reasoning should apply when it comes to strangers. I&#x2019;m not claiming that you ought to give as much to charity as you spend on caring for those close to you, but rather you should try to get the most out of your money in both cases. In the above example, terrible (and I hope hypothetical) as it may be, caring about your family&#x2019;s well being demands judicious allocation of funds. Likewise, if you really care about strangers and their children, even if to a much lesser extent, you&#x2019;ll try to maximize the good you do with each dollar you give. And until kids that would otherwise die for want of funding, you oughtn&#x2019;t waste money on providing luxuries to others, rather you should make every attempt to ensure your philanthropy is directed toward the very best causes.</p><p>Of course, it&#x2019;s not always easy to tell how or what maximizes the good or even what the good is. We should all agree, however, that saving actual lives is far better than making somebody happy for a few days. Nevertheless, Make-A-Wish raised over <a href=\"http://fy12annualreport.wish.org/our-finances/\">$180 million</a> in contributions in 2012, while the Against Malaria Foundation received under <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/FinancialInformation.aspx\">$3 million</a> that same year.</p><p>Compassion demands we start using our heads to guide our hearts when giving. Instead of looking to causes that capture the public&apos;s attention such as Make-A-Wish, or basing philanthropic decisions on extraneous factors like CEO pay and overhead cost, we should be worrying about the bottom line: what charities give you the most moral bang for your buck? And what metrics are best in determining efficacy? If the task of researching charitable organizations sounds daunting, those in the &apos;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\">Effective Altruist</a>&apos; <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/smartgiving\">movement</a>, have already done most of the legwork for you. Websites such as <a href=\"http://thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, and the especially in-depth and rigorous <a href=\"http://givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, consolidate information about the reputation and impact of charitable organizations, report on the transparency of their finances, and rank causes on their overall effectiveness. So despite our wish to entertain the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uu2zpn82WI\">imagination</a> of young children going through hardship, when it comes to charity, it&#x2019;s the <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/users/katherinarosqueta\">consequences</a> that matter.</p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://vvvnt.com/media/effective-giving\">VVVNT</a></em></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Ben_Levinstein"}}, {"_id": "QYFij3GkS7saBMzhb", "title": "Effective altruism is not a competition", "postedAt": "2014-03-03T20:10:33.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>In the past, some people have suggested that we &#x201C;gamify&#x201D; effective altruism some more, and create points for doing altruistic-y things, like donating our money or volunteering our time.  I think this could be a good idea, but rather than seeing individual scores, I&#x2019;d much rather see a collective team score for EA.  We&#x2019;d compete as a group to beat our past group selves (make March better than February, for example) rather than compete amongst ourselves as individuals.</p>\n<p>There are several problems with the individual competition model, but the biggest problem is the most fundamental &#x2014; <b>effective altruism is not</b> (and shouldn&#x2019;t be) <b>a competition.</b>  Rather, we are a team.  A community.  We all have one common goal.</p>\n<p>I know some effective altruists who see EAs like Holden Karnofsky or what not do incredible things, and feel a little bit of resentment at themselves and others; feeling inadequate that they can&#x2019;t make such a large difference.  This is an important feeling for generating a desire to improve, and keeping a <a href=\"http://michaelgr.com/2007/04/15/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset-which-one-are-you/\">growth mindset</a> in the face of this could lead to great things for you.  However, it&#x2019;s even more important not to let this get you into depression, <b>simply because Holden&#x2019;s success is also your success.</b></p>\n<p>All effective altruists care about is making sure that the world is a better place.  It doesn&#x2019;t matter who is doing the better-ing.  If Holden, Bill Gates, and Dustin Moskovitz each have 1 billion EA points and you only have five, you should be celebrating the fact that the EA community is collectively at 3 billion and five EA points and that you&#x2019;re helping.  You shouldn&#x2019;t feel bad that you&#x2019;re not doing as well.</p>\n<p>We all have different skills and abilities.  Growth mindset does say that we each have an ability to be incredibly effective and altruistic, but we still all start with different places.  It&#x2019;s simply not the case that all of us, right this year, could be making seven figure donations to GiveWell or be putting in 80 hours a week at a top non-profit.  But we all can do our best and try a little harder.</p>\n<p>Let&#x2019;s start seeing ourselves more as a community where everyone has something to offer and celebrate our collective success, not despair over who is or is not the most effective.  Effective altruism shouldn&#x2019;t be a competition (at least, among individuals).</p>\n<em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/effective-altruism-is-not-a-competition/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></em></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "dZbb63ufnkMCR4WGK", "title": "Ten ways to meet effective altruists", "postedAt": "2014-02-24T22:01:20.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Meeting EAs is the most reliable way we know to gain information and motivation to do good. It&apos;s also enjoyable and fulfilling to connect with others whose brains work similarly to your own. The most valuable thing you can do right now is to send a few emails to some well-connected EAs. A small initial step can be the start of a network that delivers you friends and collaborators over a timescale of years.</p>\n<p>This month, Austin Parish asked on Facebook where he could find EA projects:</p>\n<blockquote>Hi all! I am a medical student with a quantitative/research background, and I deeply interested in effective altruism and rationalism. During the upcoming summer, I will be living in the D.C. area and I am looking for something to do (work, volunteering, research, interning) that will let me work to support either an effective altruism cause, or the movement of effective altruism itself.</blockquote>\n<p>In my experience, the surest path to sensible EA projects is linking in with other EAs. First, it will spawn a dialogue about the best projects. Second, it will facilitate movement-building. Third, it eases coordination.</p>\n<p>Most people focus on building a general-purpose network of EAs before zeroing in on a particular area of interest, and this is okay. Those who have a very specific project in mind can be better served by directing their attention and networking efforts in a more specific fashion that is not explored in this post.</p>\n<p>Even if you do not make any effort, EAs will occasionally email you out of the blue, and old friends will occasionally contact you about some interesting talk or EA blog post that they have seen. However, if these are the only EAs you know, then you are missing almost all of your opportunities. With these simple steps, you will not (necessarily) instantly discover a hidden EA community, but more effective altruists should gradually come to appear.</p>\n<p>Here is what Austin and you can do to meet EAs.</p>\n<h2>1. Email Giving What We Can</h2>\n<p>Email the Director of Community for Giving What We Can and ask them whether they knows any effective altruists near you. It&apos;s the job of the Director of Community for Giving What We Can to support local chapters to bring EAs together, and if they knows somebody, it is easy for them to send you an introductory email. In my experience, when I e-introduce EAs, it makes my day! It&apos;s usually the most impactful thing I do that week, so don&apos;t feel shy when you&apos;re really doing the EA community a favour.</p>\n<h2>2. Email 80,000 Hours</h2>\n<p>There are presently only a few <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/meet_the_team\">full-timers</a> at 80,000 Hours. Fortunately, they all know a lot of EAs and are happy to give an introduction.</p>\n<h2>3. Email The Life You Can Save</h2>\n<p>Contact <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/aboutus/contactus.aspx\">The Life You Can Save</a>&#xA0;to meet any The Life You Can Save members in your area. As with all the other groups, they have to want to meet you too, but it&apos;s always good to ask!</p>\n<h2>4. Email Mark Lee</h2>\n<p>Mark Lee, who coordinates <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">The High Impact Network</a> and collaborates with <a href=\"/www.leverageresearch.com\">Leverage Research</a> and has many contacts who are interested in self-improvement and ambitious world-improving projects. <a href=\"http://mce_host/&lt;a href=&apos;mailto:info@thehighimpactnetwork.org&apos;&gt;info@thehighimpactnetwork.org&lt;/a&gt;\">Contact Mark</a>.</p>\n<h2>5. Check for LessWrong meetups in your area</h2>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/meetups/\">LessWrong</a> to check for upcoming meetups in your area. Just because your location doesn&apos;t have a lesswrong event coming up in the next few weeks, doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t one. There might still be a mailing list or a community that you can find on the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/meetups/wi\">LessWrong meetup wiki page</a>. Ask Lesswrong members if they have other altruistic friends who would come to a Lesswrong meetup. Altruistic Lesswrong attendees are EAs until proven otherwise.</p>\n<h2>6. Check the 80,000 Hours members list:</h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130821030947/http://80000hours.org/members/all\">over 1000</a> 80,000 Hours members. To find members near you, press Ctrl-F to search your locality. 80,000 members are pretty awesome so just introduce yourself to anyone who lives near you, and to anyone who shares your interests.</p>\n<h2>7. Use Facebook</h2>\n<p>Join the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Effective Altruism Facebook group</a>. When you see anybody write something interesting, introduce yourself and send them a friend request. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ryancarey1\">Add me</a>! Let me know what causes and projects you&apos;re interested in, and I will suggest you more friends. Add them! Look at their friends. Add everyone whose name you recognise, whether from an old blog post, a comment thread, a Youtube video or whatever, just add them! Add the mutual friends of all of these effective altruists until you get to a hundred. Your Facebook feed will feed your brain many more interesting ideas after you do this.</p>\n<h2>8. Socialise with effective altruists</h2>\n<p>When you meet nearby EAs, get them to introduce you their friends, and to other EAs. Meet them all. Listen to them; really listen. Ask them what can be done to improve the world. Introduce them to others with similar or complementary ideas. Ask for others to introduce you. Be yourself. Be likeable. Socialise. Enjoy yourself. Being around EAs is easy because EAs are awesome!</p>\n<h2>9. Find groups that interest you</h2>\n<p>Do you want to earn to give with a career in finance? Join the local university&apos;s finance club. To be a philosopher? Visit the philosophy club. Are you interested in AI? contact <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/team/\">MIRI</a>. Psychological improvement? Contact <a href=\"/www.leverageresearch.com\">Leverage</a>. Animal welfare? contact <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/about/meet-our-team/\">ACE</a>. Poverty and global health? Contact <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/contact\">Givewell</a>. In other areas, <a href=\"/www.facebook.com/ryancarey1\">I&apos;m happy to help</a> you find research topics and collaborators.</p>\n<h2>10. Create an EA meetup</h2>\n<p>The best magnet that you can create to attract EAs is a meetup. Remember that you will meet the most new awesome people (maybe 20% of them) at the first meetup that you do. The next meetup will have maybe 10%, the first speaker event will provide another 10%. Over the lifetime of your meetup group (months to years), you&apos;ll meet another 1-2% of the awesome people at each regular event. So for now, just focus on the first event. Not even the first public event - just the first time you get a few motivated effective altruists who didn&apos;t already know each other in a room together.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Don&apos;t agonise over which branch of EA to represent, or promote the event, or design activities, or print business cards. Just pick a place - like a cafe, pick a time, gather a few friends and do it. Don&apos;t let anyone draw you into a conversation about making commitments to particular EA organisations, or creating an ongoing event. Just get people together to talk about what to do in the world, and that&apos;s your founding EA meetup.</p>\n<h2>Now make the most of it!</h2>\n<p>Next came EA Melbourne! Giving What We Can provided one of our cofounders, and two other organizers came from LessWrong, where we had also met each other. The rest of these steps gave us more than half of the rest of our attendees and contributors.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary, but this algorithm seems to be the best available. Hopefully Austin will make some new contacts in DC too, and you are already on your way to doing so elsewhere. So enjoy your new EA acquaintance! For anyone who tries out this algorithm, <a href=\"http://www.emailfuture.com/\">remind yourself</a> to contact me in a month to tell me how it has gone!</p>\n<p><em>Crossposted from Ryan Carey&apos;s <a href=\"http://careyryan.com/ten-simple-tricks-to-meet-effective-altruists-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next/\">blog</a></em></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "fHjeEanG7PyWMFFQR", "title": "End of year review of Effective Altruism Melbourne", "postedAt": "2014-02-24T17:28:55.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em><strong>Co-written by Brayden Mclean and Ryan Carey</strong></em>\n</p><h2>Summary</h2>\nFrom July to December 2013, Brayden McLean and Ryan Carey (the authors) built a new effective altruist community. We entered this process with only scraps of spare time in-between our full-time jobs, and the support of a few keen volunteers. We promoted this group using meetup.com, leafleting at talks by Peter Singer, and networking. Within a few months our Effective Altruist community was hosting multiple meetups per month, regularly attracting 20 or more attendees. At the same time as the founding of EA Melbourne, we escalated outreach efforts for the local LessWrong chapter, achieving similar successes in community building that we will refrain from elaborating on here. Management of EA Melbourne has been handed over to Helen Toner and Ruben Bloom as of January 2014.\n<h2>Inception</h2>\nIn June 2013, Ryan received an email from Giving What We Can management. It said that central management had just received an email from Rangi de Silva, another Melbourne-based doctor interested in generating a <em>Giving What We Can</em> presence in Melbourne. <img title=\"The intial founding meeting\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/1/e/600_266141502.jpeg\">Ryan and Brayden gathered together a founding team with Stephanie McQualter from the <em>Monash Philosophy Society</em>, Frazer Kirkman, a mindfulness and wellbeing teacher, and Kathy, a developer and previous collaborator with <em>Leverage Research</em>. We met in a city caf&#xE9; on 30 June to plan what kind of chapter we might create. We stated overlapping sets of goals which centred on the following:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enlarging Melbourne&apos;s rational altruistic social community</li>\n\t<li>Spreading the idea of effective altruism in Melbourne</li>\n\t<li>Improving the quality of discussion about effective interventions</li>\n\t<li>Gathering Melbournians who can collaborate on effective projects; and</li>\n\t<li>Encouraging people to travel to hubs of effective altruism in San Francisco and Oxford to get more involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>July</h2>\nOn Friday 12th July, we held our first event, a <em>meet and greet</em> at the socially conscious bar <em>Shebeen</em>. There were 15-20 attendees, mostly aged in their twenties. About half were known from Lesswrong or from the founders meeting, while the rest were new. The event went well, and there was lots of discussion of further potential projects. As a result, we were very busy in the month of August, implementing the following projects:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Presenting at the <em>Global Ideas Forum</em> (Will MacAskill presenting by Skype, and Ryan presenting in person)<img title=\"Ryan presenting at the Global Ideas Forum\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t31/q71/s720x720/1147690_10151816106191578_1518352134_o.jpg\">\nHosting a stall at the Giving Games, with posters sponsored by Matt Fallshaw&#x2019;s Trike Apps, and with a <em>Giving Games</em> for all delegates of the <em>Global Ideas Forum</em>.</li>\n\t<li>Presenting on Effective Altruism to a class of 30 at <em>Powershift</em>, a youth climate activist summit</li>\n\t<li>Leafleting two of Peter Singer&apos;s talks collaboratively with <em>The Life You Can Save</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>August to October</h2>\n<em>The Life You Can Save Melbourne</em> had arranged for Peter Singer to give a talk to 500 people at the Melbourne Writers Festival. Prior to this event, <em>The Life You Can Save</em> Melbourne and <em>Giving What We Can</em> Melbourne decided to collaborate under the <em>EA Melbourne</em> banner to distribute leaflets together.\nWe continued to experiment with different event formats, advertising a discussion dinner before Peter Singer&#x2019;s Melbourne Writers festival talk during our initial leafleting. <img title=\"warming up for a lecture at the Edge lecture theatre\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/f/a/600_274707642.jpeg\">Peter himself made an appearance at the dinner, meeting with our core group of attendees.<p></p><p>In parallel with our outreach efforts, we started looking into other projects that we had some comparative advantage while being located in Melbourne:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Ben Toner began to investigate the why the Against Malaria Foundation had so far failed twice in its applications for Australian tax deductibility status and how this might be achieved later, with limited success.</li>\n\t<li>A small group experimented with the mind-mapping software utilised by Leverage Research, with no great effect.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/6/6/8/600_274710312.jpeg\"></li>\n\t<li>Helen Toner was interviewed on community radio and answered listener&#x2019;s questions on the topic of effective altruism.</li>\n\t<li>We attended a talk by Julian Savulescu and met for dinner afterwards.</li>\n\t<li>We hosted our first interstate guest, Brenton Mayer, a <em>Giving What We Can</em> member, and who had participated in the <em>Run for Better Days</em>, who spoke to the community at a dinner and discussion night.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The branding pivot</h2>\nAround this time, Brayden, Helen and Ryan, who were now managing the group met to discuss ongoing strategy. It was suggested that the <em>Giving What We Can</em> brand that we had previously been emphasising did not necessarily best represent the group and its activities. There was a mixed degree of interest in poverty alleviation, some notion that the group was more interested in career choice and research than in monetary donation, only a couple of participants had pledged ten per cent and no one had newly signed the GWWC pledge as a result of our activities <em>Giving What We Can Melbourne</em>. <img alt=\"Brenton presenting to EA Melbourne\" src=\"https://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/6/600_290643462.jpeg\"> Moreover, the group identified more strongly with the broader Effective Altruist label than with <em>Giving What We Can</em> in particular. Based on this assessment, a provisional decision was made to continue our efforts under the name <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em>. Subsequently, we have not run any further events under the <em>Giving What We Can Melbourne</em> brand.\n<h2>Maintenance - November to January</h2>\nWe continued to run events after this, and quickly found a popular and repeatable combination of event formats that required less overheads. These continued at a decreased frequency of two per month. During this period we held an all day brunch fundraiser and social mixer event at Brayden&#x2019;s rationalist sharehouse, and two telepresentations, one by Geoff Anders from Leverage Research, and another by Jess Whittlestone from 80,000 hours.\n<h2>Succession</h2>\nAt January 2013, it was noted that Ryan would be travelling overseas for the duration of 2014 and that Brayden would be travelling to the Bay Area for three months. <img title=\"Paul and Katja visiting EA Melbourne\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/6/b/2/600_331214002.jpeg\">Thus if <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em> would continue into 2014, someone new would have to take responsibility for maintaining its ongoing operations. We met with Helen Toner and Ruben Bloom to assist them in setting their goals and mission that they will bring to the community. This new team is off to a great start by starting a regular monthly lunch meetup that is displayed along with other events on an online calendar. Since the inaugural lunch discussion group, they have hosted effective altruist researchers Katja Grace and Paul Christiano, and have since filed a lecture hall at a presentation by Julia and Anna from CFAR.\n<h2>Impact</h2>\nI will now discuss to what extent <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em> achieved each of its goals using examples of events that seemed to succeed and events that didn&#x2019;t.<p></p><p>Enlarging Melbourne&apos;s rational altruistic social community\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>we gathered a regular group of attendees of effective altruists from our friends, family, acquaintances, networking at relevant conferences, LessWrong, the universities&#x2019; philosophy societies, the universities&#x2019; secular societies, and online meetup groups.</li>\n\t<li>there seemed to be a very positive effect from the growth of the LessWrong community (from 20 to 50 individuals) on <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em> and vice versa. There is a &gt;50% overlap of attendees between these two communities, so it becomes difficult to split up</li>\n</ul>\nSpreading the idea of effective altruism in Melbourne.\n<ul>\n\t<li>We didn&#x2019;t get any new pledges for <em>Giving What We Can</em>, although a few new individuals pledged to 80,000 Hours due to the existence of effective altruism in Melbourne</li>\n\t<li>Talks by Will Crouch, Geoff Anders and Jess Whittlestone were delivered via teleconference, and Ryan presented in person. These talks seemed well understood, and were discussed in more detail e.g. each Geoff and Jess, who had question time, responded to half an hour&#x2019;s worth of intelligent questions from new and old members alike, and then the topics of their talk dominated conversation for half an hour afterward.</li>\n\t<li>In her interview on community radio, Helen explained effective altruism clearly and with a good manner. As is unfortunately the risk with broad outreach events, we don&#x2019;t have clear evidence that the show did good &#x2013; none of our new members indicated hearing about the group on the meetup.com sign up question.</li>\n\t<li>Presenting at Powershift conference &#x2013; attendees politely listened through Brayden and Ryans 15 minute presentation on effective altruism, but had a much lower degree of interest in our discussion and understanding of it than the global health crowd at Global Ideas Forum. <img title=\"Brayden and Rangi at the Giving Games stall at the Global Ideas Forum\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://scontent-b-pao.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1/21423_10151816091366578_1015413555_n.jpg\"></li>\n\t<li>The <em>Giving Games</em> was useful as a quick and memorable way of transferring ideas. Participants seemed to understand that comparing charities is difficult, and that it depends upon the degree of need of recipients, the good done by a charity relative to the size of its budget, and other factors.</li>\n</ul>\nImproving the quality of discussion about effective interventions\n<ul>\n\t<li>It&#x2019;s not clear that the existence of <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em> has contributed greatly to this goal. Ryan and Helen are having ongoing discussions about the most up-to-date research from each of the EA organisations, but much of the rest of the community, including some of the core members, are heavily engaged in business activities, and so they prefer to focus on their job &#x2013; their comparative advantage &#x2013; while leaving the charity evaluation to others. The broader community, including many new members, are starting to read more articles and post occasional comments in the EA facebook group. Helen aims to build up deeper understanding of EA ideas by collating important blog pieces and papers monthly for discussion at the regular lunch event. This is the first activity to directly target this goal.</li>\n\t<li>The core members think they have better altruistic career plans than previously, although this is hard to prove.</li>\n</ul>\nGathering Melbournians who can collaborate on effective projects\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ben is reaching the end of his investigation of the feasibility of achieving tax deductibility status for the Against Malaria Foundation.</li>\n\t<li>Ben, Brayden and Ryan did ~ 10 hour each of goal factoring sessions, as a spin-off of Leverage Research&#x2019;s Connection Theory, but did not identify any insights into improving the process.</li>\n\t<li>Ryan and Brayden escalated their involvement with the creation of an effective altruist book, an effective altruist community blog, and some dot impact projects during this period. International collaboration picked up on these projects at the start of 2014.</li>\n</ul>\nEncouraging people to travel to hubs of effective altruism in San Francisco and Oxford to get more involved.\n<ul>\n\t<li>One Lesswrong community member travelled to San Francisco and came back intending to give 10 per cent of his income to charity. It&#x2019;s possible, but not probable that he would give ten per cent of his income without Effective Altruism Melbourne.</li>\n\t<li>Brenton Mayer visited Giving What We Can Oxford, something that he would not have done if not for Effective Altruism Melbourne.</li>\n\t<li>Brayden remained confident in the decision to move to the Bay Area for 3 months.</li>\n\t<li>Helen made a trip to the Bay Area</li>\n\t<li>Ryan visited the Bay Area</li>\n\t<li>Eleven members of either Less Wrong Melbourne or Effective Altruism Melbourne signed up to attend one of the four day CFAR workshops in February 2014, which encouraged additional discussion of high impact ideas and getting involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\nThree things that worked well:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Being <em>known</em> to central EA organisations. It&apos;s not essential to be a part of any particular body, but it&apos;s essential that when another resident of your city contacts Ben Clifford or Mark Lee to express their interest, then these central figures know to forward their email on to you. In a city of about 4 million residents like Melbourne, expect central EA organisations to collectively discover a new member who is interested in starting something around twice a year. Members found in this way are often very passionate and competent.</li>\n\t<li>Word of mouth: most of our most effective members were friends, acquaintances and family.</li>\n\t<li>Subscribing to meetup.com: this was the only effective public outreach strategy. At each event, we had around 5 attendees who discovered the meetup through meetup.com, about half of whom were new on each occasion. These people often were interested in ideas related to effective altruism, including animal welfare, global poverty reduction, social entrepreneurship, and so on. Members who discovered the group through meetup.com were about ~ 5 times less likely to attend events than members who were introduced through friends, however 2 of the 11 attendees from the community at the CFAR workshop originally discovered the community through meetup, so the ability to find highly committed members through this medium should not be underrated (especially in cities where there is a dearth of events for rational or intelletual altruistic individuals)</li>\n</ul>\nThree things that worked badly:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Mailing list: we maintained a mailing list of about a hundred emails of people who we met in passing, and who signed up to our sheet at conferences and during leafleting. This had a clickthrough rate of less than ten per cent and apparently yielded no new attendees.</li>\n\t<li>Leafleting Peter Singer&apos;s lectures: we got many emails written down on our notebooks at Peter Singer lectures, but these were not helpful, as previously described. Furthermore, we handed out hundreds of leaflets indicating the next effective altruist events. There were as many as four different leafleters, who had a mix of gender, age, and marketing ability. Despite this, even when the leaflets promoted a dinner on the very same day, we only got a few new attendees. We didn&#x2019;t do any further leafleting after this. <img title=\"Leafleting Peter Singer&apos;s Edge talk\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://scontent-b-pao.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/t31/q74/s720x720/1273249_10151816091501578_878522005_o.jpg\"></li>\n\t<li>Conference networking &#x2013; although the Global Ideas Forum and Powershift (climate-change) conferences, were enjoyable, and appeared to offer opportunities for follow-up meetings or presentations, we regret that we did not follow-up on these, other than to invite atendees to our meetups.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A final note on <em>Actually Doing Things</em></h2>\nOrganising your first effective altruist event should take no more than two hours of organisation. It just takes a few people to sit down and <em>do it</em>. We are proud that we avoided analysis paralysis by implementing a simple plan. In doing so, we gathered information that should be useful for the rest of the effective altruism movement. We are excited to see <em>Effective Fundraising</em> and <em>Dot Impact</em> similarly measuring their activities.<p></p><p>Any questions about how to emulate the good bits of our project and avoid the rest may be directed to Ryan at <a href=\"mailto:ry.duff@gmail.com\">ry.duff@gmail.com</a></p><p><em>Crossposted from Ryan Carey&apos;s <a href=\"http://careyryan.com/end-of-year-review-of-effective-altruism-melbourne/\">blog</a></em></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "ttodwEu2ynbHSaXky", "title": "Career opportunities in effective altruism outreach", "postedAt": "2014-02-21T00:25:40.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/405665_545823162122588_1261293881_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/405665_545823162122588_1261293881_n.jpg\" alt=\"405665_545823162122588_1261293881_n\"></a></p><p>We are forming a new project within the Special Projects team at the Centre for Effective Altruism. &#xA0;It will consist of a small but high-quality team that is dedicated to promoting effective altruism.

Conceivably, people with access to disaster shelters or other refuges may be more likely to survive and help civilization recover. However, existing disaster shelters (sometimes built to ensure continuity of government operations and sometimes built to protect individuals), people working on submarines, largely uncontacted peoples, and people living in very remote locations may serve this function to some extent.<p></p><p><b>What are the possible interventions?</b> Other interventions may also increase the chances that humanity would recover from a global catastrophe, but this review focuses on disaster shelters. Proposed methods of improving disaster shelter networks include stocking shelters with appropriately trained people and resources that would enable them to rebuild civilization in case of a near-extinction event, keeping some shelters constantly full of people, increasing food reserves, and building more shelters. A philanthropist could pay to improve existing shelter networks in the above ways, or they could advocate for private shelter builders or governments to make some of the improvements listed above.</p><p><b>Who else is working on it? </b>Some governments maintain bunkers in order to maintain continuity of government and/or to protect their citizens. Some individuals purchase and maintain private disaster shelters<b>.</b></p><p><b>Questions for further investigation: </b>With the possible exception of pandemic specifically engineered to kill all humans, I am aware of no scenario in which improved disaster shelters would plausibly enable a small group of people to survive a sudden near-extinction event. In the case of other catastrophes where a much larger number of people would survive, I would guess that improved refuges would play a relatively small role in helping humanity to recover because they would represent a small share of relevant people and resources. Many challenging questions about improving refuges remain, but I would prioritize investigating other issues at this point because refuges seem likely to be of limited value and alternative strategies (such as improving biosecurity and increasing the resilience of industrial and agricultural systems) seem more likely to effectively reduce the global catastrophic risks that improving refuges might plausibly address.\n</p><h2>Why did I look into this area?</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A number of different global catastrophes could conceivably result in the collapse of civilization.</li>\n\t<li>Although refuges would only prevent a tiny portion of the deaths that could follow a global catastrophe, they could conceivably help humanity to survive and recover in the long run.</li>\n\t<li>From some philosophical perspectives that highly value future generations,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> increased likelihood of eventual recovery from global catastrophes is extremely important.</li>\n\t<li>Robin Hanson<a href=\"#_edn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and Jason Matheny<a href=\"#_edn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> have suggested that investing in refuges may increase the chances that humanity would recover from a global catastrophe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Terminology</h2>\n&#x201C;Bunker&#x201D; and &#x201C;shelter&#x201D; seem to be used largely interchangeably, but &#x201C;bunker&#x201D; is more often used to describe large shelters built by the government. Government buildings, including bunkers, designed to withstand severe stress are sometimes called &#x201C;hardened facilities.&#x201D; Private shelter providers tend to use &#x201C;shelter&#x201D; to describe their products, and this document follows that usage when describing their products. In this document, &#x201C;refuge&#x201D; is used broadly to mean &#x201C;place where people might be especially likely to survive a global catastrophe.&#x201D;\n<h2>What is the problem?</h2>\n<h3>How could refuges help civilization recover from a global catastrophe?</h3>\nAbstractly speaking, a global catastrophe could leave the remaining population just below some threshold&#x2014;in terms of numbers, supplies, or capabilities&#x2014;necessary for humanity to eventually recover. In such a case, had there been an appropriate network of disaster shelters or other refuges, humanity might have recovered. For example:\n<ol>\n\t<li><b>Disaster shelters could help a small population to survive some initial catastrophe.</b> A nuclear war would be unlikely to kill everyone outright,<a href=\"#_edn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> but perhaps some other catastrophe&#x2014;such as an engineered pandemic of the future&#x2014;could.&#xA0; Conceivably, an adequate disaster shelter might help a small population to survive and eventually rebuild civilization. The shelter would have to be stocked with enough supplies to wait out the catastrophe (e.g. to wait for radiation to clear).</li>\n\t<li><b>Perhaps a sufficiently large catastrophe would dramatically change the mixes of capital and labor that are useful, and disaster shelters or other refuges stocked with resources and people with appropriate skills would aid in recovery.</b><a href=\"#_edn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a></li>\n</ol>\nDisaster shelters would not help given some conceivable catastrophe scenarios, such as unfriendly AI<a href=\"#_edn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> or global ecophagy from nanotechnology.<a href=\"#_edn7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>\n<h3>What kind of disaster shelters and other refuges do we have now?</h3>\n<h4>Government bunkers for private citizens</h4>\nAs of 1986, the reference Nuclear War Survival Skills judged that, &#x201C;Switzerland has the best civil defense system, one that already includes blast shelters for over 85 percent of all its citizens.&#x201D; They have 300,000 communal bunkers, which another source claims is enough for the entire Swiss population of 7.6 million, with a million spaces to spare.<a href=\"#_edn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> These bunkers are stocked with 4.5 months of food and basic fuel.<a href=\"#_edn9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In addition, a 1978 law requires all residential buildings to have a fallout shelter capable of withstanding a 12-megaton explosion at a distance of 700 meters or pay a fee. However, people building single-family homes typically pay the fee instead of building the shelters.<a href=\"#_edn10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a>\n<h4>Continuity of government bunkers</h4>\nA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government\">Wikipedia page</a> describes continuity of government bunkers in Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United Sates, but without references.<a href=\"#_edn11\"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Some brief details on the capabilities of continuity of government bunkers are provided below (with references) for the US, the UK, and Russia.\n<h5>United States</h5>\nDuring the Cold War, the US government spent billions of dollars to build a network of bunkers designed to preserve continuity of government in the event of a nuclear strike against the US, the full extent of which is still unknown.<a href=\"#_edn12\"><sup>[12]</sup></a><p></p><p>Much information about continuity of government bunkers is classified&#x2014;one report suggests that even members of Congress can&#x2019;t get the full details of the plan<a href=\"#_edn13\"><sup>[13]</sup></a>&#x2014;and this makes it difficult to know much about their current capabilities.</p><p>Some known continuity of government bunkers include Cheyenne Mountain, Mount Weather,<a href=\"#_edn14\"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Raven Rock (also known as &#x201C;Site R&#x201D;),<a href=\"#_edn15\"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and U.S. Strategic Command. Additional bunkers are rumored to exist underneath the White House and at the Camp David Presidential retreat in Maryland.<a href=\"#_edn16\"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p><p>Project Greek Island was a top secret bunker, built underneath the Greenbrier resort in Western Virginia, that would be used to house members of Congress in the event of a nuclear strike. It was exposed by a journalist in 1993 and is no longer in operation.<a href=\"#_edn17\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> This suggests the possibility of other bunkers that might be off of the public record.</p><p>One concern about the effectiveness of these bunkers is that if people were notified that nuclear missiles were en route to the US, there may not be enough time for people to get inside of the bunkers.<a href=\"#_edn18\"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Another possible concern is that they would not have an appropriate gender mix to repopulate civilization. Mount Weather was initially built as an all-male facility.<a href=\"#_edn19\"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p><p>Historically, continuity of government bunkers were built primarily with nuclear war in mind, but people managing these bunkers have begun to consider threats like pandemic influenza.<a href=\"#_edn20\"><sup>[20]</sup></a>\n</p><h5>United Kingdom</h5>\nThe following is an excerpt from notes from a conversation with Nick McCamley, author of <i>Cold War Secret Nuclear Bunkers</i>:<p></p><p>&#x201C;The UK created many bunkers during and before the Cold War, but they were decommissioned and sold off from 1998 to 2004. The bunkers kept three months of food at their peak. The UK government believed that in the event of a nuclear war, most of the population would perish, but a substantial portion would survive. McCamley believes the UK now uses many dispersed, mobile communication centers instead of bunkers. McCamley believes the UK would be very underprepared if there were a nuclear war today, and is much less prepared than Switzerland, which has fallout shelters for the entire population.&#x201D;<a href=\"#_edn21\"><sup>[21]</sup></a>\n</p><h5>Russia</h5>\nIn the late 1970s, Russia began working on a massive underground shelter at Yamantau Mountain.<a href=\"#_edn22\"><sup>[22]</sup></a>\n<h4>Shelters purchased by private citizens</h4>\nAs of 2010, Radius Engineering&#x2014;a private shelter provider&#x2014;had built 1100 shelters, about a third of which were in the Washington D.C.

These societies may be relatively safe from diseases which are easier to transfer in a highly interconnected world, and they know how to survive without reliance on modern technology and infrastructure. I would guess that it would be very challenging for a global catastrophe&#x2014;at least the kind which could be mitigated by constructing refuges&#x2014;to kill all of these people at once.\n</p><h2>What are the possible interventions?</h2>\nOne proposed way of improving shelters is to stock them with appropriately trained people and resources that would enable them to rebuild civilization in case of a near-extinction event.<a href=\"#_edn38\"><sup>[38]</sup></a> For example, someone could ensure that some people trained in agriculture had ready access to large stockpiles of agricultural equipment that would be functional without a large industrial infrastructure, and that these people had access to good refuges. Alternatively, people might explicitly be trained to rebuild civilization following a catastrophe. Subsistence farmers and hunter-gatherers in largely uncontacted societies, survivalists, and &#x201C;people interested in &#x201C;living off the grid&#x201D;<a href=\"#_edn39\"><sup>[39]</sup></a> may serve these functions to some extent already.<p></p><p>Another proposed way of improving shelters is to keep some of them constantly full of people.<a href=\"#_edn40\"><sup>[40]</sup></a> More generally, decreasing the amount of time it takes for people to get into their refuges might decrease the number of people affected by an initial catastrophe. The initial effects of a nuclear war would not kill everyone (as mentioned above), but it&#x2019;s conceivable that people in a refuge would avoid being infected by an extremely deadly pathogen that affected the rest of the world. However, sailors in submarines and people living in remote locations&#x2014;especially largely uncontacted peoples&#x2014;serve this purpose to some extent already.</p><p>However, with the possible exception of pandemic specifically engineered to kill all humans, I am aware of no scenario in which a refuge would plausibly enable a small group of people to survive a rapid near-extinction event. I have seen the following plausible-enough-to-discuss swift extinction scenarios discussed in print: alien invasion, AI, asteroids and comets, cosmic rays, gamma-ray bursts, global ecophagy from nanotechnology, nuclear war, pandemics (natural and manmade), physics disasters, simulation shutdown, supernovae, and supervolcanoes.<a href=\"#_edn41\"><sup>[41]</sup></a>&#xA0;Refuges would clearly be of limited value in cases of alien invasion, AI, global ecophagy from nanotechnology, physics disasters, and simulation shutdowns. Asteroids and comets, nuclear wars, and supervoIcanoes are not &#x201C;swift&#x201D; extinction scenarios in my sense, and operate primarily by disrupting the global food supply. These scenarios are discussed in the next paragraph. I know very little about cosmic rays, gamma-ray bursts, and supernovae, but I doubt that both (a) they could kill everyone relatively quickly and (b) bunkers could help a small group survive in those cases.&#xA0;That leaves pandemics. Natural pandemics seem extremely unlikely to kill all humans. Conceivably, a pathogen specifically engineered to kill all humans could do so. It therefore seems to me that the most plausible scenario in which a refuge prevents a swift human extinction is one in which only people in constantly-staffed refuges survive a pandemic purposely engineered (with futuristic technology) to cause human extinction.</p><p>It might be suggested that stocking refuges with a very large food supply&#x2014;over and above what is necessary to survive the initial catastrophe&#x2014;might help a small group to survive and recover if a global catastrophe disrupts global food production. A global catastrophe could disrupt global food production for two reasons. First, some global catastrophes&#x2014;such as supervolcanic eruptions, nuclear wars, and asteroid collisions&#x2014;might put enough dust in the atmosphere to interfere with photosynthesis and disrupt global food production. Second, the initial catastrophe could kill enough people and do enough damage to infrastructure to shut down global food production. However, I would guess that such additional food stockpiles in refuges would do little to increase chances of eventual recovery. In either case, there would be a substantial amount of remaining food reserves in the form of grain stockpiles, livestock, fisheries, foods stored at retailers and private homes, and wild land animals that could be hunted.<a href=\"#_edn42\"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Because of this, I would guess that any food stored in a refuge would be a relatively small part of the available food supply. If there were very few survivors, there would probably be a large amount of long-lasting food concentrated in small areas, e.g. in grain silos. If there were many survivors, it might be suggested that a refuge could, in some scenarios, help induce a less equal distribution of food, allowing at least a small group of people to survive. However, other places, e.g. grain silos, would hold more food than refuges, and many pressures for or against an egalitarian distribution would apply roughly equally to people holding food in refuges and people holding food in other existing stockpiles. I therefore see limited advantages in having refuges store food in excess of what would be required to survive an initial catastrophe. A counterpoint is that if a refuge is sufficiently isolated and/or secret, it would be easier to ensure that everyone in the refuge had an adequate food supply, even if that meant an inegalitarian food distribution.</p><p>Finally, we could build more shelters. Vivos&#x2019; shelters cost between $6 million and $20 million each, and (as mentioned above) will hold 1000 people each.<a href=\"#_edn43\"><sup>[43]</sup></a> They sell spaces in their shelters for $50,000 each. Radius Engineering shelters cost from $17,000 to $80,000 per person protected.<a href=\"#_edn44\"><sup>[44]</sup></a> However, thousands of people have access to these shelters already.</p><p>A philanthropist could pay to improve existing shelter networks in the above ways, or they could advocate for private refuge builders or governments to make some of the improvements listed above.\n</p><h2>Who else is working on this?</h2>\nIn the US, <a href=\"http://undergroundshelters.com/\">Radius Engineering</a>, <a href=\"http://www.terravivos.com/\">Vivos</a>, <a href=\"http://utahsheltersystems.com\">Utah Shelter Systems</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.northwestsheltersystems.com/\">Northwest Shelters Systems</a>) make disaster shelters. In Switzerland, Lunor G Kull AG and Andair AG make disaster shelters.<a href=\"#_edn45\"><sup>[45]</sup></a>\n<h2>Questions for further investigation</h2>\nTo summarize and wrap up, I would guess that the most likely ways in which improved refuges could help humanity recover from a global catastrophe are scenarios in which well-stocked refuges with appropriately trained people help civilization to recover after a catastrophe that leaves a substantial portion of humanity alive but disrupts industrial and agricultural infrastructure, and scenarios in which only people in constantly-staffed refuges survive a pandemic purposely engineered to cause human extinction. I would guess that, in the former case, resources and people stocked in refuges would play a relatively small role in helping humanity to recover because they would represent a small share of relevant people and resources. The latter case strikes me as relatively far-fetched and I would guess it would be very challenging to do much better than the largely uncontacted peoples in terms of ensuring the survival of the species. I would also guess that more targeted biosecurity efforts would more effectively reduce the risk of extinction from an engineered pandemic, and would have more substantial benefits in helping to prevent less extreme (and much less unlikely) pandemics.&#xA0; I would also guess that other measures aimed at increasing the resilience of industrial and agricultural systems to global catastrophes would be more effective than training a small number of people to rebuild civilization. I would therefore prioritize investigating other areas over further research into disaster shelters and other refuges.<p></p><p>If someone did look into disaster shelters and other refuges further, some questions to focus on would include:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>Is it possible for a pathogen to literally kill everyone (except for the people in a refuge)? How could this happen?</li>\n\t<li>In what scenarios, if any, would it be useful for refuges to carry food supplies longer than one year? How likely are these scenarios?</li>\n\t<li>What other kinds of resources would it be valuable for refuges to stockpile in order to aid survivors in rebuilding civilization in the event of a global catastrophe? To what extent do they stock these resources now? To what extent are these resources unintentionally stockpiled in e.g. Wal-Mart distribution centers or warehouses?</li>\n\t<li>Apart from people working on submarines and living in remote locations, what other unintentional refuges are there?</li>\n\t<li>What are the capabilities of government shelters still in use in countries other than the US, the UK, and Switzerland?</li>\n\t<li>Would additional training help survivors to rebuild civilization? To what extent do survivalists and people trying to live &#x201C;off the grid&#x201D; already achieve these gains?</li>\n\t<li>How many survivors are necessary to rebuild civilization?</li>\n\t<li>How much would it cost to give a minimum viable population access to a refuge that was substantially better than all existing refuges?</li>\n\t<li>How beneficial would it be to increase the number of people with access to the best kind of refuges currently available?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>My process</h2>\nI decided to do this research in consultation with GiveWell staff, and GiveWell paid me for my time on this project.

From a long-run perspective, there is an enormous difference between a collapse of civilization followed by eventual recovery, versus a permanent collapse of civilization.&#x201D; Beckstead and Shulman 2013.</p><p>&#x201C;I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now could, this outcome would be much worse than most people think.

I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater.<p></p><p>. . . The Earth will remain inhabitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction of the whole of civilized human history.

If so, there might be a substantial chance of finding a post-disaster population that is just above, or just below, a threshold for preserving humanity. In this case it is reasonable to wonder what we might do now to change the odds. The most obvious possibility would be to create refuges with sufficient resources to help preserve a small group of people through a very large disruption, the resulting social collapse, and a transition period to a post-disaster society.&#x201D; Hanson, Robin 2008, Pg 373.</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[3]</span> &#x201C;Perhaps more cost effective than building refuges in space would be building them on Earth. Elaborate bunkers exist for government leaders to occupy during a nuclear war (McCamley, 2007). And remote facilities are planned to protect crop seeds from &#x201C;nuclear war, asteroid strikes, and climate change&#x201D; (Hopkin, 2007). But I know of no self-sufficient, remote, permanently occupied refuge meant to protect humanity from a range of possible extinction events. Hanson (2007) argues that a refuge permanently housing as few as 100 people would significantly improve the chances of human survival during a range of global catastrophes.

Fearing a decapitating strike, the Soviets sent tens of thousands of workers to these remote sites, where U.S. spy satellites spotted them still toiling away in the late 1990s. Yamantau is expected to be operating soon. According to diagrams and notes given to me in the late 1990s by SAC senior officers, the Yamantau command center is inside a rock quartz mountain, about 3,000 feet straight down from the summit. It is a wartime relocation facility for the top Russian political leadership. It is more a shelter than a command post, because the facility&apos;s communications links are relatively fragile. As it turned out, the quartz interferes with radio signals broadcast from inside the mountain. Therefore the main communications links are either cable or radio transmitters that broadcast from outside the center.&quot; GlobalSecurity.org, &#x201C;Yamantau.&#x201D;</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[23]</span> &#x201C;On the other hand, more-established Radius Engineering has been building underground shelters for the last 30 years, with a total of 1,100 built so far, a third of which are in the Washington, D.C. area.

To those who are, it can seem like an obvious, logical course of action. After all, it only relies on a desire to help people and to get more value for your money. There are a lot of potential supporters of effective altruism out there! Still, relatively few of them are actual supporters. I want to talk about why this gap exists and what we can do about it.</p>\n<p>First, is the gap a bad thing? I think it is, even if we only focus on the perspective of the potential effective altruist. If you want to do something, knowing how to do it is valuable to you. So for people who really want to help others, informing them is a useful service. Not knowing, and even not knowing that there&apos;s something to know, is a problem for them. And the more people who support these ideas, the more they will collectively be able to achieve.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>To spread the movement, it must be appealing</h2>\n<p>Why isn&apos;t everyone who really cares, and is willing to act on reasonable arguments, already an effective altruist? It can seem a pretty obvious idea: to maximise what you can achieve you should measure and evaluate the options and act accordingly. Even ten years ago there were far fewer people acting efficiently on these beliefs, but the numbers have been growing quickly. To get to this stage it isn&#x2019;t enough to have a desire to help and common sense. The answer must be that it is one of those ideas which seems obvious only in retrospect. You also need to be exposed to the concepts, and to approach them with an open mind.</p>\n<p>So if we want these ideas to spread, we need to make them widely available and accessible. By accessible I mean that they should be easy-to-understand, appealing, and non-confrontational. Confrontation frequently closes people&apos;s minds against new ideas. Similarly, if the ideas initially appear odd or distasteful it can stop people ever taking them seriously.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Don&#x2019;t make arguments that sound too weird</h2>\n<p>For people who have internalised the central concepts of effective altruism, there is often a tension here. It turns out that these first, in-retrospect-obvious, ideas are just a small part of larger and more general theories which are being developed. The new ideas are often important and intellectually exciting, and it is natural to want to share them widely.</p>\n<p>This can often be a mistake. Even very natural ideas are often built on the paradigm of effective altruism. Without the context of this paradigm they may seem strange or ill-founded. This can be a disservice to the ideas, to effective altruism, and to the people hearing them. These people might very reasonably dismiss the ideas, and attach negative connotations to them. In turn this could stop them from ever seriously considering the central ideas of effective altruism, even if with proper consideration they would have loved these ideas.</p>\n<p>For example, after internalising the idea that we should be seeking to help people as much as we can, people often notice we may have opportunities now to help people in the future. If the future has a decent chance of being long and prosperous, perhaps most people are yet to come. And if we have opportunities to increase that chance of being long and prosperous -- for example by reducing the risk of human extinction -- it&#x2019;s plausible these opportunities are the best use of our resources. As presented here this argument runs a little fast, passing over key questions such as how we could ever expect to be able to reduce this, and it is unclear that it would convince anyone who hadn&#x2019;t already thought about charity as an activity that could be optimised.</p>\n<p>Far worse is to present the conclusion without the argument. You might say something like &#x201C;The most important thing we can do is to stop humanity going extinct,&#x201D; (when most people have never seriously thought about scenarios where this happens), or &#x201C;Compared to the far future, people alive today hardly matter.&#x201D; The danger here is not just of seeming wrong, but of seeming like a crackpot, even to a smart and well-informed audience. With enough time they might try to understand why you&#x2019;d believe this obviously wrong thing, and perhaps realise you could be right. But with a limited amount of attention they&#x2019;re likely instead to use the good rule of thumb of not paying attention to crazy ideas. Even questions, like &#x201C;How can we best reduce the chance of extinction?&#x201D;, can sound similarly weird because of their implicit assumptions.</p>\n<p>Of course, important ideas should not be dropped or forgotten. On the contrary, they should be discussed and developed. But we should take care to keep open the dialogue between people who have spent a long time thinking about effective altruism, and those who are just encountering it for the first time. The ideas are natural, and have a broad appeal, and it would be a great shame if they never realised that broad appeal because the groups developing them became too specialised, too quickly.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Be nice to people</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of other traps to avoid. Firstly, using the terminology of a group in order to affiliate with that group. Sometimes it&apos;s useful to have specialist terms, but usually you don&apos;t need them. Using them makes the group look more insular to outsiders (which the effective altruist movement really isn&apos;t), and can also lead people reading arguments to take away the wrong message. Avoiding unnecessary terminology is part of not being too &apos;clannish&apos; about effective altruism. It isn&apos;t &quot;us against the world&quot;, since most people are really on our side.</p>\n<p>A particularly unhelpful line of thought runs as follows. Effective altruists are typically likely to do much more to help the world than other people. So given a choice between prioritising the resources (time or money, say) of effective altruists and others, it&apos;s good to favour the effective altruists. They are in practice &#x2018;more important&#x2019; than regular people, even if you think all people&#x2019;s welfare matters equally.</p>\n<p>This last distinction is subtle and liable to be drowned out by the general distastefulness of the idea that people in a particular group matter more than others. It looks particularly bad if the reasoning is applied to oneself, as it is likely to be. Note that the argument doesn&apos;t need to be given explicitly to be harmful. If someone internalises the idea that they matter more than other people, elements of this are likely to show in conversation. Moreover, it can manifest itself in antisocial behaviour. Even if this is intended in the service of greater social good, there is a serious risk that the behaviour could become associated with effective altruism and taint the idea. If one of the most important things we can do is to help more people to become effective altruists (and right now, I think it is), it&apos;s important that we not just do good, but are seen to do good by society&apos;s standards. This mindset has a worrying potential to undo that. Be nice to people.</p><p></p><p><em>Acknowledgements: I&#x2019;d like to thank Nick Beckstead, Rebecca Cotton-Barratt, Toby Ord, Pablo Stafforini, Robert Wiblin, and Julia Wise for comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this post.</em></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "pLgi8orS52tRB7u5K", "title": "Where I'm giving and why: Tom Ash", "postedAt": "2014-01-28T15:37:53.000Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>Tom Ash was invited to write this post in the &apos;Where I&apos;m giving and why&apos; series as the Centre for Effective Altruism&apos;s Director of Operations; he&apos;s since moved to <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/\">Charity Science</a>, and runs the <a href=\"/effectivealtruismhub.com\">Effective Altruism Hub</a>.</em></p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s difficult to pick between the top charities recommended by <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities\">Giving What We Can</a>, because neither group currently ranks their recommendations, and I certainly know less about the choice than their researchers do. However, it seems likely that one charity is (in expectation) better than the rest, and that the extra good done by my donating to it rather than the alternatives will be truly important - an extra life saved, or a huge difference to the recipients&#x2019; welfare. Just as the enormity of the good I could do moved me to pledge to donate 10% of my income, so it calls for putting real effort into picking the best charity - something I haven&#x2019;t done enough in previous years.</p>\n<p>This makes it a shame that GiveWell don&#x2019;t pick out the charity that they think does most good, radically uncertain though this choice would be. However, it&#x2019;s a choice that&#x2019;s forced on their staff when they make their individual donations, and fortunately GiveWell have published where these go. A clear majority donate to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">GiveDirectly</a>, and this carries great weight, as I trust GiveWell researchers&#x2019; ability to pick charities far more than I do my own. So GiveDirectly is a strong candidate. It has many qualities I value highly: straightforward counterfactual impact; an RCT demonstrating significant improvements in the lives of its beneficiaries; and a simple and clear model for doing good, without too many speculative or poorly-evidenced steps.</p>\n<p>However, it has these qualities at the cost of doing slightly less good than some other candidates for my donations, at least on certain expected value calculations. I&#x2019;m conscious of the weaknesses of these calculations, but in the case of the <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities/amf-further-information\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> in particular they provide a persuasive case in favour of its doing more good than GiveDirectly. If they&#x2019;re even roughly correct, I&#x2019;d save several lives if I donated &#xA3;5,000 to AMF this year. That&#x2019;s an awe-inspiring ability to have, and seems better than sending that money to the poor households to which GiveDirectly would grant it, despite the enormous difference I know that would make.</p>\n<p>So my current top choice would be AMF. As many readers will know, GiveWell recently <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">ceased recommending it</a> on the grounds that it currently lacks room for more funding, not having arranged enough bednet distributions to use up its substantial reserves. But this concern may be addressed within three or perhaps six months, as large distributions are currently being negotiated; Giving What We Can continues to recommend AMF for this very reason. Given this, I plan to give to AMF if it gains clear room for more funding over the next six months, and otherwise seriously consider donating to GiveDirectly.</p>\n<p>This is a provisional choice, as I&#x2019;m constantly learning and thinking about where my donations can do the most good. (For example, I&#x2019;m open to the argument that I could help people more through indirect means; I&#x2019;m currently talking to GiveWell about the possibility of donating to them, as this might ultimately cause larger donations to first-order charities than my own.) &#xA0;I&#x2019;d love to hear readers&#x2019; comments on my reasoning, as if there&#x2019;s a better giving opportunity I&#x2019;d very much want to know about it!</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Tom_Ash"}}]
