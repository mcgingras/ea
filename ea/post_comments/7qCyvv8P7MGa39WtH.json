One of the things I find useful when tabling / fresher's fairs is thinking about how much, if I were a fresher, I would want to be told about Giving What We Can. It makes me feel much less like I'm bothering people, and more like I'm actually helping them by getting their attention. \nThe Oxford fresher's fair has had a lot of luck with the question 'Would you like to save hundreds of lives?'. It gets people's attention, it's hard to say no to, and it leads naturally to the explanation of both effectiveness and donating significant amounts. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "K4pm5cZdGn4ixEoQs", "postedAt": "2014-09-21T22:43:35.124Z", "postId": "7qCyvv8P7MGa39WtH", "htmlBody": "<p>Agree.
