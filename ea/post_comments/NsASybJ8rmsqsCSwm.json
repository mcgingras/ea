Konstantin Pilz wrote a report on data centers which points out some geographical and economical constraints on where it makes sense to build them at scale. For instance, outside the US, maybe Canada or Mexico would be good options (but other countries as well). (I'm not sure if it's necessary for much of lab infrastructure to be right next to a mega-sized data center, or if data can be handled remotely, but even if you're moving your lab to some other location, you need to figure out the compute availability <i>somewhere</i>.)<br><br>I'd imagine it to be somewhat likely for Canada to follow US legislation if it seems reasonably motivated and if the US puts in an effort to make it happen; I'm more uncertain about US influence on other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}]
