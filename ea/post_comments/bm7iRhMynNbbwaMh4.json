In fact, it seems arguing from a <i>specific</i> alternative grounding would make Timmerman's argument weaker. As he notes (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>I have purposefully not made a suggestion as to how many (if any) children Lisa is obligated to rescue. I did so to make my argument as neutral as possible, as <strong>I want it to be consistent with any normative ethical view</strong> ranging from moral libertarianism to a view that only permits Lisa to indulge in a comparably insignificant good a single time.</p></blockquote><p>As an analogy, if you make a general claim such as: \"All marbles are blue,\" it's enough to point to a single counterexample to show that that claim is false. I don't <i>also </i>have to have my own view about what colors marbles come in.<br><br>Also, as a matter of interpreting <i>Famine, Affluence, and Morality</i>, Singer <i>doesn't</i> justify his principles based on any inferences from the drowning child thought experiment. Instead, he only uses that thought experiment as an <i>application</i> of his principles, which he takes to simply be common-sense. And although Singer is himself a utilitarian, he <i>doesn't </i>make any argument for utilitarianism in that paper, largely for the same reason as Timmerman! He wants diverse people to agree with him <i>regardless of their grounding</i> for the principles he discusses.</p>", "parentCommentId": "NRrDzFc7RMHdFs5j6", "user": {"username": "nathan98000"}}]
