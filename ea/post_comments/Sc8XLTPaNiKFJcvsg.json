I don't think there are any examples? In which case, some people might read it, get to the end and think \"well that was a waste of 22 minutes and hardly seems relevant to EA, so I'll downvote it to deter others from spending time reading it\".</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Matt_Sharp"}}, {"_id": "27LRsmWbjoWkWtyLd", "postedAt": "2022-12-01T00:29:00.008Z", "postId": "Sc8XLTPaNiKFJcvsg", "htmlBody": "<p>What sort of examples do you want?

What's the problem? Maybe you missed that part when skimming? It's in the introduction immediately before the article summary. The rest of the article does not attempt to argue this point; it's talking about something else which builds on this premise.</p>\n<p>Why is this even controversial? If I tell you a misquote or poor cite in the sequences or some other literature you like, you aren't going to care much or start taking actions regarding the problem (such as checking whether the same author made more errors of a similar nature), right? You don't believe that misquoting is like deadnaming someone and should have a similar norm against it because it's hurtful to the victim in addition to being poor scholarship, do you? Don't you disagree with me and know that you disagree with me? The norm I'm advocating is not normal nor popular with any large group. So, fine, disagree with me \u2013 but I find it a really bizarre reaction for people who disagree with me to dismiss my arguments on the basis that I'm obviously right and this is a waste of time due to being uncontroversial common knowledge. Most people think stuff like \"People are sloppy sometimes, which isn't a big deal.\" instead of thinking, \"Being sloppy with quotes in particular isn't acceptable. Use copy/paste. If you must type something in, triple check it. There's no real excuse for quotes to be inaccurate in tiny ways; that's really bad even if the wording changes do not substantively change the meaning.\"</p>\n<p>I'd like to first establish that this issue matters, and only second, potentially point out some specific examples. As long as I don't think anyone considers misquoting to actually be very bad, I don't think it's a good idea to bring up examples of people doing it. Also I don't think the problem is a few individuals behaving badly; it's a widespread problem of community attitudes and norms. The community simply doesn't value this kind of accuracy and is OK with misquotes; in that context, it's unfair to be very hard on individuals who get caught misquoting, so that's another reason not to name and shame anyone. If i give examples people will just tell me that the misquote didn't change the conclusion in that case and therefore doesn't really matter (rather than agreeing with me), which <em>is not the point</em>. Misquotes mistreat the person quoted like deadnaming, and also like other inaccuracies they're bad for truth seeking whether or not they change the conclusion. These are not popular claims, but I think they're important, so I tried to argue and explain them, and neither of these claims would be served well by examples because they're both about concepts not concretes. And if people don't like conceptual articles, or struggle to understand them, or don't like long articles ... fine whatever, but saying that people <em>agree</em> with me, when they don't, is really weird.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "oeuqMbTCpeHApmfKv", "user": {"username": "Elliot Temple"}}, {"_id": "MnkfzTYFiBjqKScec", "postedAt": "2022-12-01T12:22:59.233Z", "postId": "Sc8XLTPaNiKFJcvsg", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>What sort of examples do you want?
