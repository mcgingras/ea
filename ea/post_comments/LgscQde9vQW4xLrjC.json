It raises a lot of issues I've been wondering about myself, though in the context of other charities and I think your intuitions are right.</p><p>On the other hand, as far as UNICEF itsefl is concerned, it's not just a charity, it's primarily a UN agency and shares its overall goals. So in addition to its child-focused mandate, it works on UN agenda, incl. political stability and peacebuilding more broadly. These are activities whose cost-effectiveness is difficult to assess.</p><p>But indeed, UNICEF itself for too many of its programmes (especially the most complex ones) does not have much data on effectiveness and sometimes even on the costs themselves. I can see several reasons for that:<br><br>1. UNICEF more often than other organisations supports national governments and channels its funds into specific ministries. This has the advantage of stabilising those governments and strengthening existing institutions rather than creating parallel systems. The downside is the loss of some (and often almost all) control over how the money is spent. Another consequence is the reluctance to share with the public information about the funds that go to non-democratic regimes etc. All this is not conducive to financial transparency.&nbsp;<br><br>2) UNICEF works largely in the area of humanitarian aid (and not development aid), unlike most of GiveWell's charities. This has two basic consequences:&nbsp;<br>- the areas in which it operates are unstable, making it difficult to conduct counterfactual cost-effectiveness analyses. If I invest in capacity-building in a government, and then there is a coup d'\u00e9tat there, and then there is a currency devaluation and public officials leave, it is difficult to see benefits of my actions. If I prepare an educational programme in refugee camps, but then its inhabitants are further displaced, then a fire breaks out destroying the infrastructure, and then all the aid staff is forced to leave the country, the cost-effectiveness of my endeavours is necessarily limited.<br>- initiatives that are geared towards ad hoc and makeshift solutions are necessarily less cost-effective than investing in sustainable infrastructure and long-term reforms.&nbsp;<br><br>3. In line with the principle of inertia in an overgrown bureaucracy, all the novelties are adopted with a time lag, and these include, in many regional offices, the monitoring and economic analysis of operations. Indeed, the lack of attachment to numbers is downright shocking in some places. Which is to some extent a consequence of the approach of the donors themselves.</p><p>Does this mean that it is not worth directing funds (or rather investing aid) to volatile areas? As a rule, financial markets avoid such regions. Should aid do the same? These are questions to which there is no single answer. Nevertheless, it would be wonderful to see UNICEF one day on the path of full financial transparency and clear communication regarding (sometimes necessary) tradeoffs of their key decisions.&nbsp;And it would be great to have more discussion around the humanitarian sector in EA, in comparison to development (but I'm quite newvto the movement and maybe that discussion has already taken place).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "mcnificat"}}, {"_id": "BBHawby8GW8hrybv8", "postedAt": "2023-05-07T21:09:23.981Z", "postId": "LgscQde9vQW4xLrjC", "htmlBody": "<p>If people care maybe I can look I to this more seriously and write up something longer, but I find it quite unlikely that their claim is correct.

We're now more open to investigating opportunities within \"mega-charities\" than we were previously.</p><p>One factor that we consider whenever we make a grant is funging, or the possibility that a grant from GiveWell will cause other actors to allocate their funding differently. If a program gets money from GiveWell, another funder that would have supported that program might then decide to fund a different program that's less cost-effective, reducing the impact of our funding. Or, the organization that runs the program could decide to move some of its unrestricted funding to another of its programs that's less impactful.

In particular, we don't have a clear sense from studies of how many deaths they prevent, due to ethical considerations limiting the research that can be done\u2014it's (justifiably) unethical to withhold malnutrition treatment, so it's not possible to conduct a true randomized controlled trial of treatment vs. no treatment.</p><p>After conducting extensive internal research, plus hiring a couple of external experts to do their own analysis, we believe some malnutrition treatment programs are in the range of cost-effectiveness of programs we would consider directing funding to\u2014i.e., similar to that of our top charities, which we estimate can save a life for roughly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/impact-estimates#Impact_metrics_for_grants_to_GiveWells_top_charities_in_2021\"><u>$3,500-$5,500</u></a>.

But we think we may be able to reduce our uncertainty in other areas, and we're moving forward with work on those aspects of our model. Simultaneously, we're still investigating specific charities' programs (in specific locations) as potential giving opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>All that said, like you, we would be very surprised if the true cost to save a life (for any program, not just malnutrition treatment) were on the order of $210. Our cost per life saved estimates include all costs of running the program, including non-philanthropic costs (such as those covered by the government), and attempt to account for the other factors you mention, such as the fact that not all treated children would otherwise die from malnutrition and the likelihood that another funder would support this program if we didn't.</p><p>If you're curious to learn more, you can read a page about one of the grants we made to ALIMA&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/ALIMA-malnutrition-Niger-June-2021\"><u>here</u></a>, and our most recent malnutrition treatment intervention report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/combined-protocol-community-management-acute-malnutrition\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>I hope that's helpful!</p><p>Best,</p><p>Miranda Kaplan</p><p>GiveWell Communications Associate</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "GiveWell"}}, {"_id": "NAWpwLDgjkKWDvCHa", "postedAt": "2023-11-14T09:48:01.776Z", "postId": "LgscQde9vQW4xLrjC", "htmlBody": "<p>I want to raise another argument against donating to mega-charities, in favour of those who we are confident are highly cost-effective. Mega-charities, by their nature, run many programs, in many locations. In effect, they draw multiple times from the distribution of interventions by effectiveness. By the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\">Central Limit Theorem</a>, the average of any such samples, if not heavily conditioned on high cost-effectiveness, will be closer to the average of the underlaying distribution. The larger the sample, the closer to the average we can expect. For an individual donor who cannot reasonably choose to support only a single intervention at a mega-charity, we should expect that a donation contributes towards their average cost-effectiveness. The same goes for directed donations, which suffer from high fungibility, as GiveWell mention in <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\">this comment</a>. In other words, it's difficult to be one of the very best on average if you are doing lots of different stuff. Even if some of the interventions you do are really effective, your average effectiveness will be dragged down by the other interventions.</p><p>Thus, from a donor perspective, mega-charities are similar to index funds, you aren't likely to go very wrong by supporting them, and the average ROI is close to the average of all relevant interventions. However, you cannot expect to get the highest ROI by supporting mega-charities. For that, you need an organisation that specialises on one, or a few interventions that comes from the very top of the distribution.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jorgen_Ljones"}}, {"_id": "of5PX3obxoD3AADL6", "postedAt": "2023-11-14T12:23:37.640Z", "postId": "LgscQde9vQW4xLrjC", "htmlBody": "<p>I think it's a good sentiment, but I strongly disagree with one aspect of this.</p>\n<p>I think you can go very wrong by supporting mega charities.</p>\n<p>Mega charities often do lots of things really badly, so aren't really like index funds. In the charity field I don't see why diversification would mean you would close in on the average.
