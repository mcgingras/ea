It sounds somewhat similar to some economics experiments involving charity that I have seen, but of course with a different goal in mind.

Separately, we\u2019re also working with a number of academic researchers on experimental collaborations.  Some of these involve studying the efficacy of the GG model, while others use the GG format as an experimental design to study other topics.

A big component that may be being overlooked here is how participants vote on the charities. That plays a role in how the winner is determined as well as how the results are reflected. The voting method can also play a role in how participants assess candidate charities. To expand on the role of the voting method in giving games, I've put together an article. I hope this information brings even more success to giving games: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@aaronhamlin/let-the-giving-games-begin-d19a5ad91570\">https://medium.com/@aaronhamlin/let-the-giving-games-begin-d19a5ad91570</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "aaronhamlin"}}, {"_id": "4RDuf4oDL2asqNJFF", "postedAt": "2018-09-08T19:56:46.376Z", "postId": "8AABHubnwpoqZXABh", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm about to put on a Giving Game for passerbyers in the middle of a student center building.

They are mainly going downstairs to eat.)</p>\n<p>From what I've read about Giving Games, the majority of people choose the effective charities. Although, I was told at my one and only EA meetup, that I could do <strong>two or three effective charities--just having them be different cause areas.</strong> This is what I plan to do. Do you see advantages of putting, say, the Make-A-Wish Foundation in there as a choice? To me it's just common sense to choose the stringently evaluated charities over non-transparent, little traction, etc--type charities. </p>\n<p>And so I don't want to insult other people's intelligence. The results of Giving Games with an &quot;ineffective&quot; charity, that I've read, show that the majority of people pick the more effective charities. It seems the &quot;bad&quot; charity is there as a <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=token\">token</a>. It appears the <strong>cause-area style of Giving Game</strong> is better (than winner-takes-all, tiered or proportional games for university students).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "adamaero"}}]
