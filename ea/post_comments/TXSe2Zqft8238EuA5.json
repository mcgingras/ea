But they might have done even better with more involvement from you! Perhaps it's predictable that when posting to an EA forum you'd get advice to focus more on EA projects (inevitably at the expense of others). Hacker News would doubtless tell you to drop anything EA in favour of laser-like focus on your top secret startup. (Very tantalising! Can you give any hints?)</p>\n<p>AFAICT the Charity Science fundraising experiments have a few full-time people working on them, so maybe there's little you could add as a part-timer, but I don't know how many people would do your .impact work if you didn't? It's great that you've managed volunteers coding some fixes and features for this very forum, but you can only get so much out of volunteers in general.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Nekoinentr"}}]
