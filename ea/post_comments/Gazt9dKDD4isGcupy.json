However, I think the paper <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2208661120\">Income and emotional well-being: A conflict resolved</a> is one of the best resources on this question. Here is the abstract:</p><blockquote><p>Do larger incomes make people happier? Two authors of the present paper have published contradictory answers. Using dichotomous questions about the preceding day, [Kahneman and Deaton,&nbsp;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.&nbsp;<strong>107</strong>, 16489\u201316493 (2010)] reported a flattening pattern: happiness increased steadily with log(income) up to a threshold and then plateaued. Using experience sampling with a continuous scale, [Killingsworth, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.&nbsp;<strong>118</strong>, e2016976118 (2021)] reported a linear-log pattern in which average happiness rose consistently with log(income). We engaged in an adversarial collaboration to search for a coherent interpretation of both studies. A reanalysis of Killingsworth\u2019s experienced sampling data confirmed the flattening pattern only for the least happy people. Happiness increases steadily with log(income) among happier people, and even accelerates in the happiest group. Complementary nonlinearities contribute to the overall linear-log relationship. We then explain why Kahneman and Deaton overstated the flattening pattern and why Killingsworth failed to find it. We suggest that Kahneman&nbsp;and Deaton might have reached the correct conclusion if they had described their results in terms of unhappiness rather than happiness; their measures could not discriminate among degrees of happiness because of a ceiling effect. The authors of both studies failed to anticipate that increased income is associated with systematic changes in the shape of the happiness distribution. The mislabeling of the dependent variable and the incorrect assumption of homogeneity were consequences of practices that are standard in social science but should be questioned more often. We flag the benefits of adversarial collaboration.</p></blockquote><p>Across countries, self-reported life satisfaction <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-vs-happiness\">is</a> correlated with real GDP per capita even for high income countries, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_high-income_economy\">have</a> a gross national income per capita of at least 13.8 k 2022-$:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/iw0irjksbkf9k3bt1x98\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/snlkwlcns3m2mos4kf9n 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/j9u9hy50veietdgfv4fu 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/k09ctvmhcte5fjx0ru5c 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/qesrk96xgylxxe4jd2ak 1320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/x69fmccw2mw6vmbpzl8w 1650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/uv6jcgqdzzitvzbsbfpz 1980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/p1aye273klmj9njo11kk 2310w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/itwc4o35fnx1hkkovusx 2640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/iuzf7pmuc6nvetuqzhms 2970w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mezo6KiZkcDnCjmgt/dsijernowpwg8pweuar9 3240w\"></figure><p>Zooming out, you may want to have a look at some of the links here:</p><blockquote><p>The above does not capture all the benefits of saving human lives due to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/indirect-long-term-effects\">indirect longterm effects</a>.

In addition, people who have higher self-esteem due to being more responsible are more likely to practice responsibility in terms of human and animal suffering (as by donating to causes and/or going vegetarian/vegan, with people from high income countries having more potential impact here). Of course, raising self-esteem levels in low income countries could also be quite beneficial - for instance, higher self-esteem people may be more of a driving force for raising health standards in their countries.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Sean Sweeney"}}, {"_id": "eQ3nazkKrpRjcTXnN", "postedAt": "2024-03-21T13:25:18.897Z", "postId": "Gazt9dKDD4isGcupy", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Executive summary:</strong> Saving human lives in high income countries may be better than in low income countries from the perspective of boosting economic growth, while helping animals may be better than saving human lives in low income countries from the perspective of improving near-term welfare.</p><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><ol><li>The author's views on saving human lives have evolved over time, from rational egoism to now considering effects on animals and economic growth.</li><li>The cost-effectiveness of saving human lives depends on the benefits to the person saved (proportional to life satisfaction and life expectancy) and indirect long-term effects on economic growth (uncomfortable conclusion that lives in high income countries may be instrumentally more valuable).</li><li>It's unclear if saving human lives has a positive or negative impact on near-term animal welfare due to the \"meat-eater problem\" and potential effects on wild animals.

If you save a life in a rich country, does that sometimes have the potential to do more good overall because they might, post-intervention be in a better position to help others with donations/volunteering/high tax contribution? And if we only addressed what's espoused to be \"the most cost-effective\" - only the malaria net charities etc. and we ignore dealing with more expensive issues, we could make the issues we neglect exponentially worse and do more harm than good. It's not necessarily the case that the more expensive issues just say constant if we don't fund interventions for them. The world is far more complex than that. Many problems have a tipping point where things get much worse beyond a set point, and if we just say 'no funding for causes not on the effective charities lists' there's a strategic cost/implication to that. For example, child exploitation by criminal gangs - not something you find on the cause prioritisation lists, but if nothing is done to address issues like that, guess what - organised crime thrives without challenge and it becomes a much, much more complex, expensive problem to fix. <i>(There are probably better examples, but I did find this </i><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68615776\"><i>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68615776</i></a><i> from the UK news today really interesting and it seems like an example where there is a problem getting worse and without attention it will become effectively an epidemic. Yet, the general EA wisdom would say funding charities that try to help children escape exploitation by criminal gangs is not cost-effective so don't put it on your list - don't we need a more nuanced view?)&nbsp;</i><br><br>Cause prioritisation is really important, considering effectiveness and cost-effectiveneness is really important, but it feels like the model needs to evolve to something a bit less simplistic than how many lives can you save with \u00a3X. To be clear, I do genuinely think charities like Against Malaria Foundation and GiveDirectly are fantastic and should receive a high level of funding - but not to the exclusion of everything else. If we fund ONLY those causes described by EA community as cost-effective, there are huge repercussions to that. We need to think about addressing root causes of issues, including those that are complex and may be expensive to solve, not just individual lives saved per \u00a3100k<i> (or if we go for lives/\u00a3 then at least factor in WELLBYs as suggested, and make some attempt to consider knock on impacts of funding or not , including the difference between low funding for a cause vs zero funding for a cause).</i><br><br>I'd love to see more posts like this one that ask bold questions challenging existing assumptions - strong upvote!</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RedTeam"}}, {"_id": "ySbpy7wEQHNt2Pj7t", "postedAt": "2024-03-22T10:00:15.398Z", "postId": "Gazt9dKDD4isGcupy", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the support, RedTeam!</p>", "parentCommentId": "tuYR2KiBA6AoNavEH", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}]
