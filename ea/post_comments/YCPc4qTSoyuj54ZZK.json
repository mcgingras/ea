One comparison point for this, for which data is easily abundant, is readerships of websites that are open-to-read (no entry criteria, no member fees). Looking at the distribution of such websites, 70% seems like a relatively low end of skew. For instance, Politico and The Hill, politics news sites, see 70-75% male audiences (<a href=\"https://www.quantcast.com/politico.com#demographicsCard\">https://www.quantcast.com/politico.com#demographicsCard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.quantcast.com/thehill.com#demographicsCard\">https://www.quantcast.com/thehill.com#demographicsCard</a>) whereas nbc.com, a mainstream TV, entertainment, and celebrity site, sees a 70% female audience: <a href=\"https://www.quantcast.com/nbc.com#demographicsCard\">https://www.quantcast.com/nbc.com#demographicsCard</a></p>\n<p>(I'm not trying to pick anything too extreme, I'm picking things pretty close to the middle.

The changes you recommend seem extremely promising and it's very helpful to have all of these recommendations in one place.</p>\n<p>I think that there are some additional reasons that go beyond those stated in this post that increase the value of making the EA a more diverse and inclusive community. First, if the EA movement genuinely aspires to cause-neutrality, then we should care about benefits that accrue to others regardless of who these other people are and independent of what the causal route to these benefits is. As such, we should also care about the benefits that becoming a diverse and inclusive movement would have for women, people of color, and disabled and trans people in and outside of the community. If, as you argue and as is antecedently quite plausible, the EA movement is essentially engaging in the very same discriminatory practices in our movement-building as people tend to engage in everywhere else, then as a result we are artificially boosting the prestige, visibility, and status perception of white, cis, straight, able-bodied men, we are creating a community that is less sensitive to stereotype threat and to micro- and macroaggressions than it otherwise could be, and we are giving legitimacy to stereotypes and to business and nonprofit models which arbitrarily exclude many people. All of this causes harm or a reduction in the status or power of women, people of color, and disabled and trans people and advances their discrimination - which is a real and significant cost to organizing in this way.</p>\n<p>Second, even if one thinks that this effect size will be very small compared to the good that the EA movement is doing (which is less obvious than EAs sometimes assume without argument), 1) these are still pure benefits, which strengthens the case for and the reasons favoring improving the EA community in the respects you argue, and 2) if the EA community fails to become more diverse and inclusive we'll suffer reputation costs in the media, in academia, among progressives, and in the nonprofit world for being a community that is exclusionary. This would come at a significant cost to our potential to build a large and sustainable movement and to create strong, elite networks and ties. And at this point, this worry is very far from a mere hypothetical:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai\">https://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse\">https://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICKxhc5VOr8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33m24s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICKxhc5VOr8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33m24s</a></p>\n<p>I think we have our work cut out for us if we want to build a better reputation with the world outside of our (presently rather small) community, and that the courses of action you recommend will go quite a long way to getting us there.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "tylermjohn"}}, {"_id": "tQ7nEuY29X2nSxJX9", "postedAt": "2017-10-26T15:49:25.001Z", "postId": "YCPc4qTSoyuj54ZZK", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>I prefer to play the long game with my own investments in community building, and would rather for instance invest in someone reasonably sharp who has a track record of altruism and expresses interest in helping others most effectively than in someone even sharper who reasoned their way into EA and consumed all the jargon but has never really given anything up for other people</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe that Toby Ord has talked about how, in the early days of EA, he had thought that it would be really easy to take people who are already altruistic and encourage them to be more concerned about effectiveness, but hard to take effectiveness minded people and convince them to do significant altruistic things.

To me &quot;pure benefits&quot; suggests something costless, or where the costs are so trivial they should be discarded in analysis, and I think that really underestimates the labor that goes into building inclusive communities. Researching and compiling these recommendations took work, and implementing them will take a lot of work. Mentoring people can have wonderful returns, but it requires significant commitments of time, energy, and often other resources. Writing up community standards about conduct tends to be emotionally exhausting work which demands weeks of time and effort from productive and deeply involved community members who are necessarily sidelining other EA projects in order to do it. </p>\n<p>None of this is to say 'it isn't worth it'. I expect that some of these things have great returns to the health, epistemic standards, and resiliency of the community, as well as, like you mentioned, good returns for the reputation of EA (though from my experience in social justice communities, there will be articles criticizing any movement for failures of intersectionality, and the presence of those articles isn't very strong evidence that a movement is doing something unusually wrong). My goal is not to say 'this is too much work' but simply 'this is work' - because if we don't acknowledge that it requires work, then work probably will not get done (or will not be acknowledged and appreciated). </p>\n<p>Once we acknowledge that these are suggestions which require varying amounts of time, energy and access to resources, and that they impose varying degrees of mental load, then we can start figuring out which ones are good priorities for people with limited amounts of all of the above. I've seen a lot of social justice communities suffer because they're unable to do this kind of prioritization and accordingly impose excessively high costs on members and lose good people who have limited resources. </p>\n<p>So I think it's a bad idea to think in terms of 'pure benefit'. Here, like everywhere else, if we want to do the most good we need to keep in mind that not all actions are equally good or equally cheap so we can prioritize the effective and cheap ones.</p>\n<p>I'm also curious why you think the magnitude of the current EA movement's contributions to harmful societal structures in the United States might outweigh the magnitude of the effects EA has on nonhumans and on the poorest humans. To be clear about where I'm coming from, I think the most important thing the EA community can do is be a community that fosters fast progress on the most important things in the world. Obviously, this will include being a community that takes contributions seriously regardless of their origins and elicits contributions from everyone with good ideas, without making any of them feel excluded because of their background. But that makes diversity an instrumental goal, a thing that will make us better at figuring out how to improve the world and acting on the evidence. From your phrasing, I think you might believe that harmful societal structures in the western world are one of the things we can most effectively fix?

One suggestion is that groups exhibit a collective intelligence accounted for by number of women in the group, turn-taking and emotional empathizing, with group-IQ being only weakly-linked to individual IQ (Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, &amp; Malone, 2010). Here we report tests of this model across three studies with 312 people. Contrary to prediction, individual IQ accounted for around 80% of group-IQ differences. Hypotheses that group-IQ increases with number of women in the group and with turn-taking were not supported. Reading the mind in the eyes (RME) performance was associated with individual IQ, and, in one study, with group-IQ factor scores. However, a well-fitting structural model combining data from studies 2 and 3 indicated that RME exerted no influence on the group-IQ latent factor (instead having a modest impact on a single group test).

Implementing such a huge list would mean radically overhauling the EA community. Is that a good idea?</p>\n<p>I think its important to keep in mind that the EA community has been tremendously successful. Givewell and OpenPhil now funnel tremendous amounts of money towards effective global poverty reduction efforts. EA has also made substantial progress at increasing awareness of AI-risk and promoting animal welfare. There are now many student groups in universities around the world. EA has achieved these things in a rather rapid timeframe. </p>\n<p>Its rather rare for a group to have comparable success to the current EA community. Hence I think its very dangerous to overhaul our community and its norms. We are doing very well. We could be doing better, but we are doing well. Making changes to the culture of a high performance organization is likely to reduce performance. Hence I think you should be very careful about which changes you suggest. </p>\n<p>In addition to being long your list of changes has many rather speculative suggestions. Here are some examples: &quot;\n-- You explicitly say we should be more welcoming towards things like &quot;dog rescue&quot;. Does this not risk diluting EA into just another ineffective community. \n-- You say that suing the term &quot;AI&quot; without explanation is too much jargon. Is that really a reasonable standard? AI is not an obscure term. If you want us to avoid the term &quot;AI&quot; your standards of accessibility seem rather extreme. \n-- You claim we should focus on making altruistic people effective instead of effective people altruistic. However Toby Ord claims he initially had the same intuition but his experience is that the later is actually easier. How many of your intuitions are you checking empirically?

Some people think discrimination is the most likely hypothesis.  Other people have other hypotheses.  The people who think discrimination is the most likely hypotheses see the people suggesting other hypotheses and loudly decry those people as discriminatory.  Those people get quieter.  The gender or race-based disparity persists.  The only hypothesis that anyone is allowed to talk about is the discrimination one.  So it's more clear than ever that discrimination is the only possible explanation.  Given this clarity, the people pushing the discrimination hypothesis have the mandate to decry milder and milder instances of discrimination.

What if it's been 10 years?</p>\n<p>Realistically, if there's a disparity, there's probably a combination of several things going on.

I really agree with most of this - I was talking in terms of these benefits as &quot;pure&quot; benefits because I assumed the many costs you rightly point out up front. That is, assuming that we read Kelly's piece and we come away with a sense of the costs and benefits that promoting diversity and inclusion in the Effective Altruism movement will have, these benefits I've pointed out above are &quot;pure&quot; because they come along for free with that labor involved in making the EA community more inclusive, and don't require additional effort. But I understand how that could be misleading, and so I take all of your criticism on board. I also agree that this will involve priority-setting - even if we think that all of these suggestions are important and some people should be doing all of them to some extent (and especially if not), there are some that we ought to spend more time on than others as a community.</p>\n<p>I also agree that the EA community should focus on identifying and working on the very most important things. Although I might disagree slightly with how you've characterized that. I don't think that we should be a community doing work that fosters &quot;fast progress on the most important things,&quot; because I think that we should be doing whatever does the most good in the long run, all-things-considered, and fostering &quot;fast progress&quot; on the most important things does not necessarily correlate with doing the most good in the long run, all-things-considered - unless we define &quot;fosters fast progress&quot; in a way that makes this trivial. But if, for example, we could perform one of two different interventions, one which added an additional +5 well-being to all of the global poor, on average, over twenty years, for one generation, and one which added an additional +5 well-being to all of the global poor, on average, over one hundred years, for all generations, we should choose the latter intervention, even though the former intervention is in a sense fostering faster progress. I make this point not to be pedantic, but because I think some EAs sometimes forget that what we (or many of us) are trying to do is to produce the most benefits and avert the most harm all-things-considered, and not simply make a lot of progress on some very important projects very quickly, and I think that this is quite relevant to this conversation.</p>\n<p>To your question as to why &quot;the magnitude of the current EA movement's contributions to harmful societal structures in the United States might outweigh the magnitude of the effects EA has on nonhumans and on the poorest humans,&quot; I unfortunately haven't written something on this and perhaps I should. But I can say a few things. I should first say that I certainly don't think it's obvious that the EA movement's contributions to such harmful structures clearly will outweigh the magnitude of the effects we have on nonhumans and on the poorest humans. I only claimed that it was non-obvious that the effect size was &quot;very small&quot; compared to the positive effects we have. It's something more EAs should treat as non-negligible more often than they do.</p>\n<p>Still, here are some of the basic reasons why I think that the EA movement's contributions to harmful social structures could well be of sufficient magnitude that we should keep constant accounting of them in our efforts to do good in the world, apart from reputation costs and instrumental epistemic benefits of inclusion and diversity work. First, the fundamental structure of society and its social, legal, and political norms profoundly shape the kinds and quality of life of all beings, as well as profoundly shaping cultural and moral mores, and so ensuring that the fundamental structure of society and these norms are good ones is crucial to ensuring that the long-run future is good, and shaping these structures for the better may make the trajectory of the future far better than the counterfactual where we shape these structures for the worse (for reasons of legal precedent, memetics, psychological and value anchoring, and more). Second, norms against harming others are very sticky - much stickier than norms favoring helping others except in certain particular cases (e.g. within one's own family). They are psychologically sticky, whether for innate biological reasons which fix this, or for entirely cultural reasons. Which of these is true makes a difference to how much staying power this stickiness has. But whichever is true, ensuring that we set good norms in place around not causing harm to others and ensuring that these norms are stringently upheld and not violated so that we internalize them as commonsense norms seems like a good way to shape how the future goes. They are also easier to enforce through sanction, blame, and punishment, whereas norms of aid (especially effective aid) are more difficult to enforce. And our human legal and political history suggests that they are much easier to codify into law. So for all these reasons, ensuring that we have good norms in these areas and not violating them looks like a very important intervention for shaping the social and legal institutions of future societies. Third, there are reasons to think that our moral and political attitudes towards others are psychologically intertwined in complex ways. How we treat and think about some groups, and the norms we have around harming and helping them, seems to have an impact on how we treat and think about other groups. This seems especially important if we are interested in expanding our human moral circle to include nonhuman animals and silicon-based sentient life. If our negative attitudes, norms, laws, and practices around other humans have negative downstream effects on our attitudes, norms, laws, and practices around other animals and other, inorganic sentient beings, then the benefits of prioritizing moral development and averting harmful social structures which favor some sentient beings over others may be very important. If AI value alignment is decided as a result of a political arms race, then it seems that having a broader moral circle may significantly shape the impact of intelligent and superintelligent AI for better or worse. (Here I'm out of my depth, and my impression is that this is a matter of significant disagreement, so I certainly won't come down hard on this.) The main point is that the downstream effects of our norms, attitudes, laws, and practices around humans, and who our society decides is worthy of full moral consideration, may have significant downstream effects in complicated and to some extent unpredictable ways. The more skeptical we are about how much we know about the future, the greater our uncertainty should be about these effects. I think it's reasonable to be concerned that this may be too speculative or too optimistic about the downstream consequences of our norm-shaping on the far future, but we should be careful to remember that there are also skeptical considerations cutting in the opposite direction - measurability bias may lead us to exclude less measurable, long-term effects in favor of more measurable, short-term effects of our actions irrationally.</p>\n<p>I am not arguing that actively averting oppressive social structures and hierarchies of dominance should be a main cause area for EAs (although that could be an upshot of this conversation, too, depending on the probabilities we assign to the hypotheses delineated above), but given the psychological, social, and legal stickiness of norms against harming and the fact that failing to make EA a more diverse and inclusive community will raise the probability of EAs harming marginalized communities and failing to create and uphold norms around not harming them. And the more influential the EA community is as a community, the more this holds true. So it seems to me that there's a plausible case to be made that entrenching strong norms against treating marginalized communities inequitably within the EA community is an effective cause area that we should spend some of our time on, even if we should spend the majority of our time advocating for farmed and wild animals and the global poor.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "KPoDGpyeMbmxgjJeP", "user": {"username": "tylermjohn"}}, {"_id": "L9hStGgeTLCy8p7wP", "postedAt": "2017-10-27T01:38:22.399Z", "postId": "YCPc4qTSoyuj54ZZK", "htmlBody": "<p>EA prizes accuracy?

I also appreciate that you offered to have a discussion on the extent to which this is a problem. I have had negative experiences in the past with people who were opposed to this line of questioning, so I am really glad to see you actually invite this discussion.</p>\n<p>Firstly, in regard to the communities we draw from, I've seen a lot of articles about how problematic the IT industry is, but I am rather skeptical of these claims and hence of the claim that EA is especially problematic. Clearly there are a lot of bad things that have happened in certain places, but people are acting as though it is an established fact industry is worse than other industries without there being any research backing it up. I think we need to be careful about anecdotal evidence because of the <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/16/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers/\">Chinese Robber Fallacy</a> - ie. neglect of base rates. I feel that many people look at the industry with the preconception that it is sexist because it is majority male and it is hardly surprising that they find confirmatory evidence. This isn't to say that the industry might not be disproportionately sexist, my suspicion is that we do not know because no-one has conducted the research.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I would suggest that similarly it is not clear whether the problem in EA is larger than in the rest of society. It might be larger or it might be smaller, but I haven't seen strong evidence either way. I'm not saying that we should therefore not try to be more inclusive, I'm just pushing back a tendency that I've seen to declare a group especially bad without sufficient evidence to justify claiming this as an established fact.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, I would be wary about relying to much evidence about correlations. Does diversity increase the success of companies or due more successful and wealthier companies have an easier time attracting women and minorities? I would not be surprised if it was a mix, although I won't guess at the split.</p>\n<p>Fourth, I wouldn't say that the effects of quotas are clear from the one study (<a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/)\">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/)</a>. As it says, &quot;Competence was measured by comparing the private incomes across people with the same education, occupation, age, and residence in the same geographical region. Those with higher incomes were deemed more competent&quot;. That's an interesting result, but it needs to be combined with other research to be reliable.</p>\n<p>Fifth, &quot;some people in the community have made other thoroughly unreasonable claims to justify the status quo, such as that women would be a distraction in the workplace&quot;. Where were these claims made and how many people made them?</p>\n<p>Sixth, I'm in favour of people being able to anonymously share experiences, but I believe it would be of the utmost importance to ensure that we did not create a site that enabled people to anonymously spread rumours that harmed the reputation of other people and could possibly lead to divisions within the movement. If such a site is made, I would suggest that there be rules against identifying information be shared in the general discussion area. If someone wants the kind of advice that requires them to identify the specific individual, such as if they were intending to lodge a formal complaint with an organisation, then there could be specific persons tasked tasked with advising them. There's a huge debate about anonymous vs. identified complaints that I don't want to get involved in, but anonymous, public, unscreened accusations are a recipe for disaster.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you write, &quot;Unfortunately I suspect some people in the community are content, implicitly or explicitly, to assume that women and people of color are inherently so much worse than white men at thinking about altruism effectively that the constitution of the community is merely an effect of this presumed difference&quot;. I believe there are two main issues with recruiting women: a) Women are less likely to be in the groups we have been successful in recruiting from (ie. maths, philosophy, computer science) b) In our society, women are encouraged to embrace their emotions more and men are encouraged to be objective. Given this socialisation, men are more likely to find EA matches their thought process.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "casebash"}}, {"_id": "xurw9FT7YMrSPou33", "postedAt": "2017-10-27T02:34:30.329Z", "postId": "YCPc4qTSoyuj54ZZK", "htmlBody": "<p>&quot;oh, it turns out affluent white males are just a lot more moral than everyone else and there's nothing to explain here&quot;</p>\n<p>Do you think it is possible that EA could be majority white affluent male because programmers, philosophers, mathematicians, ect. are disproportionately white affluent male and EA has become good at recruiting these specific audiences?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "xbMH5gHLdBc6X3LzH", "user": {"username": "casebash"}}, {"_id": "zu6SSnxTzxGTKWmQS", "postedAt": "2017-10-27T03:04:41.389Z", "postId": "YCPc4qTSoyuj54ZZK", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for this post.  There's a lot I agree with here.

And in the spirit of not considering any arguments above criticism, and disagreement being critical for finding the best answers, I hope you won't mind if I lay my disagreements out.  To save time, I'll focus on the differences between your view and mine.  So if I don't mention a point you made, you can default to assuming I agree with it.</p>\n<p>First, I'm broadly skeptical of the social psychology research you cite.  Whenever I read about a study that claims women are more analytical than men, or women are better leaders than men, I imagine whether I would hear about it if the experiment found the opposite result.</p>\n<p>I recommend <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/01/diversity_of_th.html\">this blog post</a> on the lack of ideological diversity in social psychology.  Social psychologists are overwhelmingly liberal, and many openly admit to discriminating against conservatives in hiring.  <a href=\"http://www.joseduarte.com/blog/i-was-denied-admission-to-a-phd-program-because-of-my-perceived-political-views-reflections-of-a-sellout-how-diversity-would-strengthen-social-science\">Here</a> is a good post by a Mexican social psychologist that discusses how this plays out.  There's also the issue of publication bias at the journal level.  I know someone who served on the selection committee of a (minor &amp; unimportant, so perhaps not representative) psychology journal.  The committee had an explicit philosophy of only publishing papers they liked, and espousing &quot;problematic&quot; views was a strike against a paper.  Anyway, I think to some degree the field functions as a liberal echo chamber on controversial issues.</p>\n<p>There's really an entire can of worms here--social psychology is currently experiencing a major reproducibility crisis--but I don't want to get too deep in to it, because to defend my position fully, I'd want to share evidence for positions that make people uncomfortable.  Suffice to say that there's a third layer of publication bias at the level of your Facebook feed, and I could show you a different set of research-backed thinkpieces that point to different conclusions.  (Suggestion: if you wouldn't want someone on the EA Forum to make arguments for the position not X, maybe avoid making arguments for the position X.  Otherwise you put commenters in an impossible bind.)</p>\n<p>But for me this point is really the elephant in the room:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>some people in broader society now respond to correctable offenses with a mob mentality and too much readiness for ostracization, but just because some people have swung too far past the mark doesn\u2019t mean we should default to a status quo that falls so short of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would like to see a much deeper examination here.  Insofar as I feel resistant to diversity efforts, this feels like most of what I'm trying to resist.  If I was confident that pro-diversity people in EA won't spiral towards this, I'd be much more supportive.  <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/60.html\">Relevant fable</a>.</p>\n<p>All else equal, increased diversity sounds great, but my issue is I see a pattern of other pro-diversity movements sacrificing all other values in the name of trying to increase diversity.  Take a statement like this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of the most talented and resolute people in this community are here because they are deeply emotionally compelled to help others as much as possible, and we\u2019re currently missing out on many such people by being so cold and calculating. There are ways to be warm and calculating! I can think of a few people in the community who manage this well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being warm and calculating sounds great, but what if there's actually a tradeoff here?  Just taking myself as an example, I know that as I've become aware of how much suffering exists in the grand scheme of things, I've begun to worry less about random homeless people I see and stuff like that.  Even if there's some hack I can use to empathize with homeless people while retaining a global perspective, that hack would require effort on my part--effort I could put towards goals that seem more important.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>this particular individual \u2014 who is probably a troll in general \u2014 was banned from the groups where he repeatedly and unrelentingly said such things, though it\u2019s concerning there was any question about whether this was acceptable behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, I think there's a real tradeoff between &quot;free speech&quot; and sensitivity.  I view the moderation of online communities as an unsolved problem.  I think we benefit from navigating moderation tradeoffs thoughtfully rather than reactively.</p>\n<p>Reminding people off the forum to upvote this post, in order to deal with possible hostility, is also a minor red flag from my perspective.  This resembles something Gleb Tsipursky <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/12z/concerns_with_intentional_insights/\">once did</a>.</p>\n<p>None of this seems very bad in the grand scheme of things, especially not compared to what I've seen from other champions of diversity--I just thought it'd be useful to give concrete examples.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here are some ideas of mine, if anyone cares:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Phrase guidelines as neutrally as possible, e.g. &quot;don't be a jerk&quot; instead of &quot;don't be a sexist&quot;.  The nice thing about &quot;don't be a jerk&quot; is it at admits the possibility that someone could violate the guideline by e.g. loudly calling out a minor instance of sexism in a way that generates a lot of drama and does more harm than good.  Rules should exist to serve everyone, and they should be made difficult to weaponize.  If most agree your rules are legitimate, that also makes them easier to enforce.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Team-building activities, icebreakers, group singalongs, synchronous movement, sports/group <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BKuM7GrgYwz/\">exercise</a>, and so on.  The ideal activity is easy for anyone to do and creates a shared EA tribal identity just strong enough to supersede the race/gender/etc. identities we have by default.  Kinda like how students at the same university will all cheer for the same sports team.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Following the example of the animal-focused EAs: Work towards achieving critical mass of underrepresented groups.  Especially if you can saturate particular venues (e.g. a specific EA meetup group).  I know that as a white male, I sometimes get uncomfortable in situations where I am the only white person or the only man in a group, even though I know perfectly well that no one is discriminating against me.  I think it's a natural response to have when you're in the minority, so in a certain sense there's just a chicken-and-egg problem.  Furthermore, injecting high-caliber underrepresented people into EA will help dismantle stereotypes and increase the number of one-on-one conversations people have, which I think are critical for change.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Take a proactive, rather than reactive, approach to helping EA men with women.  Again, I think having more women is playing a big role for animal-focused EAs.  More women means the average man has more female friends, better understands how women think, and empathizes with the situations women encounter more readily.  In this <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2017/10/christine-peterson-computer-security/\">podcast</a>, Christine Peterson discusses the value of finding a life partner for productivity and mental health.

Groups of people cohere because they really do share traits, albeit statistically. So a mind that generalizes about people from their category membership is not ipso facto defective. African Americans today really are more likely to be on welfare than whites, Jews really do have higher average incomes than WASPs, and business students really are more politically conservative than students in the arts \u2014 on average.</p>\n<p>The problem with categorization is that it often goes beyond the statistics. For one thing, when people are pressured, distracted, or in an emotional state, they forget that a category is an approximation and act as if a stereotype applies to every last man, woman, and child. For another, people tend to moralize their categories, assigning praiseworthy traits to their allies and condemnable ones to their enemies. During World War II, for example, Americans thought that Russians had more positive traits than Germans; during the Cold War they thought it was the other way around.\u201d</p>\n<p>EA supporter Peter Thiel's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6cxRYgqfHY\">comments on diversity</a> from twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>Professor Thomas Sowell <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7FrBYi8pKA\">gives his perspective</a> on social justice.

But on the other hand, if someone is ethically motivated to do the right thing, and they find that EA is plausibly in the right lane for this purpose, then you would expect them to be involved in productive activities regardless of whether their personality types are similar or not. That's not any more of a sacrifice than we make in other sorts of things: I recruited for a finance career, despite the fact that the personality types and culture are antithetical to my own, I am in the military, despite the fact that the personality types and culture are antithetical to my own, I donate money, despite the fact that I would have more personal happiness than if I didn't, and so on. </p>\n<p>The kinds of people who <em>would</em> be doing EA things <em>if and only if</em> we were a little bit more appealing are the kinds of people who <em>won't</em> take the ethically optimal career route, because the ethically optimal career route is not likely to be optimally appealing, and that is something that we can't change. If someone can only be brought into the movement by catering, they're not going to suddenly change and automatically act as forcefully and positively as the rest of us; they'll <em>still</em> need to be catered to for additional steps on and on into the future. You can see examples of this with activist groups on college campuses, where administrations make costly room and concessions to activists and yet continually face additional demands and disruption.</p>\n<p>This, of course, is not a statement that all people who are motivated in such a way are like this nor is it a statement that such people would not bring substantial positive value to the movement on balance. And I'm not making any judgements about character, just observing the ethically relevant facets of human behavior. The point is that the positive impact of such expansion is more limited than you would naively think and therefore warrants less resource allocation than expansions which would attract similar numbers of other types of people.</p>\n<p>I'm also skeptical that concessions like this actually do much. If you want an example, look at the early criticisms of EA, where people talked about how we 'neglect systemic change'. Over and over and over again, we explained that you can do systemic change in EA, please come and do systemic change with us, we're compatible, and so on. There were a couple articles saying &quot;Can EA change the world? It already has&quot; and &quot;We love systemic change.&quot; Now there have even been two peer-reviewed published philosophy papers driving this point home, by Joshua Kissel and Brian Berkey. Then 80,000 Hours said &quot;hold up guys, only 15% of people should earn to give, we don't want to be misunderstood.&quot; And on and on and on. This was all a fine response, of course. </p>\n<p>But has it actually changed the behavior of the people who raised those critiques? Have any of the critics recanted and said &quot;okay, I'll join EA now, and develop some EA-based systemic change&quot;? Are EA's ranks swelling with a new crop of excited leftist revolutionaries? No! This kind of movement growth is nowhere to be found! When was the last time you heard ANY Effective Altruist argue that poverty alleviation is neutral or harmful because it reduces the probability that capitalism will be superseded? Never! Yes, there are a few EA leftists whose main priority is to systemically reform capitalism, but not significantly more than there were in the first place, and they are a tiny group in comparison to the liberals, the conservatives, the vegans, the x-risk people, and so on. As far as I can tell, the impact of all these articles and comments in bringing leftists into active participation with EA was totally nonexistent. </p>\n<p>So while there is a difference between the demographics under consideration here and the progressive-leftist political group in this example, don't expect to work any wonders from piling on disclaimers and bureaucracy and openness and other things. You can look outside EA for other examples. The US military does many of the things that you suggest. SHARP/EO representatives, briefings, policies, and on and on and on. But that didn't substantially change our demographics, culture, sexual assault rates, or anything of the sort. It didn't stop PVT Manning from going sufficiently crazy and disassociated with military culture on the basis of gender dysphoria to decide to harm the organization.</p>\n<p>So instead of engaging in the knee-jerk logic of &quot;there's a diversity problem - let's start doing pro-diversity things!&quot; we should be focusing on reason and evidence so that we only spend time and money on solutions where we have a significant expectation of something meaningful being accomplished.</p>\n<p>Of course you are pretty clear in your post that, yes, things should be evidence based, there is weak-but-mounting evidence supporting interventions like this, and so on. But I want to emphasize a higher bar of skepticism than what people are likely to take away from your post, especially since the opportunity cost for EA resources is much higher than it is in other contexts.</p>\n<p>E.g.:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u25cf CEA and EAF could both, or jointly, hire a Diversity &amp; Inclusion Officer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u25cf All organizations should hire communications staff who are versed in inclusionary communications practices. Alternatively, the Diversity &amp; Inclusion Officer could train them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are both moderately costly additions to bureaucracy, and I don't really see what their value is. I'm aware that lots of organizations put emphasis on these types of things, but what are the exact outputs and impacts? </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u25cf Adopt and enforce a clear policy \u2014 as organizations and individuals \u2014 for dealing seriously and fully with illegal actions like sexual harassment and explicit discrimination or discrimination revealed by HR or legal counsel. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I'm not saying this is a bad thing, I don't see what the motivation is. If the problem is gender bias, or ineffective marketing, or narrow appeal, or things of that nature, then they should be dealt with appropriately. What we should not do is lump together every gender-related problem as part of a monolithic reason to implement all gender-related solutions. It's simply less efficient.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For instance, it should be outright unacceptable for someone to say that women do not contribute to society and are leeches if they don\u2019t offer men sex. This actually happened, recently, </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I was the one who, more than anyone else, told that person that they were an idiot who ought to shut up. But it wasn't just because they were sexist. I think one of the underlying problems here is not just sexism but people who just don't care enough about the EA movement itself. I would expect any sexist or racist to at least be decent and intelligent enough to know that there are some pots you don't stir, purely as a practical means of maintaining a productive movement. I see lots of people talk about making EA more appealing or more diverse, which is fine, but one of the underlying causes of <em>all</em> of these issues, both when it comes to sexists picking fights and when it comes to members of marginalized groups refraining from contributing, is that people care more about things like lifestyle, community and tribal affiliation than they do about sitting down to do productive ethical work. And that's a super hard thing to change, but it warrants some attention. We can't just sit around and rely on a shaky combination of atypical saints on one hand and clever marketing on the other.</p>\n<p>Edit: also, I have to add that you are being a little bit uncharitable to the person who said that. They said something bad, but not quite how you describe it. I'm not saying this because I care about them, but just because it's bad if people read this and think &quot;omg, an effective altruist said this! Look how sexist EAs are!&quot; and it gets repeated and spread as a false rumor.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "kbog"}}, {"_id": "i5Partpi9W2aXvoXX", "postedAt": "2017-10-27T08:41:33.868Z", "postId": "YCPc4qTSoyuj54ZZK", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Variant on this idea: I'd encourage a high status person and a low status person, both of whom regularly post on the EA Forum, to trade accounts for a period of time and see how that impacts their likes/dislikes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Problem is that the participants would not be not blinded, so they would post differently.

I'm editing this paragraph to clarify the way in which I'm using a few words. When I talk about whether an argument is actually combative or collaborative, I mean to indicate whether it is more effective at goal-oriented problem-solving or at achieving political ends. By politics, I mean something like &quot;social maneuvers taken to redistribute credit, affirmation, etc. in a way that is expected to yield selfish benefit&quot;. For example, questioning the validity of sources would be combative if the basic points of an argument held regardless of the validity of those sources.</p>\n<p>Claims like \u201cEA would attract many additional high quality people if women were respected\u201d or \u201csocial justice policing would discourage many good people from joining EA\u201d are, while true, basically all combative, and the framing of effectiveness is just helping people self-deceive into thinking they\u2019re motivated by impact or truth. They\u2019re using a collaborative style (the style of caring about impact/truth) to do a combative thing (politics, in the wide definition of that word).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I can spin the observation that these things are combative into a stylistically collaborative but actually combative argument for my own agenda, so everything I\u2019m saying is suspect. To illustrate: the EA phrase \u201cpolitics is the mindkiller\u201d is typically combatively used in this way, and I have the ability to do something similar here. \u201cPolitics is the mindkiller\u201d is the mindkiller, but recognizing this won\u2019t solve the problem, in the same way recognizing politics is the &quot;mindkiller&quot; doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>People can smell this, and they\u2019d be right to distrust your movement\u2019s ability to think clearly about impact, if you\u2019re using claims of impact and clearer thinking to justify your own politics. People who are bright enough to figure this out are typically the ones I'd want to be working with.</p>\n<p>Yeah, you all have a problem with how you treat women and other minority groups. Kelly did a lot of work in order to point out a real phenomenon, and I don\u2019t see anyone taking her very seriously. You let people who want to disparage women get away with doing so by using a collaborative \u201cimpact and truth\u201d discussion style to achieve combative, political aims. That\u2019s just the way the social balance of power lies in EA. People would use \u201cimpact and inclusivity\u201d as a collaborative style to achieve political aims if the balance of power were flipped. Plausibly there\u2019s an intermediate sweet spot where this happens less overall, though shifting the balance of power to such spots is never a complete solution. I suspect a better approach would be to get rid of the politics first; this will make it easier to make progress on inclusivity.</p>\n<p>The norm of letting people stylize politics with talk of impact and truth is deeply ingrained in EA. It\u2019s best to work outside the social edifice of EA, if you want to think clearly about impact and truth. Which feels like a shame, but isn\u2019t too bad if you take the view that good people will eventually be drawn to you if you\u2019re doing excellent work.

You hit the nail on the head many times in this post on the subtle connections between things that I think can be hard to identify: the connection between heart and head, the E and the A, the overuse of jargon, and the hero worship, and so on. I have to say that as a fairly straight-passing gay man with immense amounts of privilege, even I feel many of these pressures and am often put off by the alpha-male machismo you often see in EA spaces.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve witnessed discrimination and harassment, and heard of assault, in EA-ish spaces, and it seems pretty clear that this is contributing to the gender gap. I\u2019ve definitely exhibited some of the combative and argumentative behaviors you mention. When I got into the EA community a few years ago, I began in global poverty and animal advocacy circles, and I found they were much better on these issues than the community is now, sadly. (That\u2019s with both of those areas\u2019 having plenty of problems.)</p>\n<p>I think Kelly moved us toward a type of dialogue on this issue that is lacking in the world, and I hope we can have more of it. Right now, discussions around diversity and inclusion seem polarized between the sort of \u201crationalist\u201d discussion that\u2019s snarky and dismissive on the one hand and an ostracizing mob mentality on the other hand. I don\u2019t want to say EA should chart a middle path, because I think we should lean toward being overly zealous on diversity and inclusion rather than away, but I think EA and its aligned movements (animal advocacy in my mind) would benefit from a conversation that is at the same time inclusive and data-based. I don\u2019t think the world has that type of conversation very often.</p>\n<p>The lack of conversations that are both inclusive and data-based seems to lead to pretty bad results, where diversity and inclusion are may not be promoted in the most effective ways, and people opposed to diversity and inclusion harbor suspicions about the world (e.g. that discrimination does not exist) that continue to fester unaddressed.</p>\n<p>From my exploration of these matters, I\u2019ve come to see that generally, when one reads about data on discrimination, differences between groups, etc. one finds that (a) discrimination exists and can be quite powerful; (b) there are differences between genders, but the differences are subtle and go in varied directions (e.g. men are more combative, and women are more collaborative, as Kelly notes); and (c ) these differences are <em>not</em> the reason for the vast majority of gaps that we see.</p>\n<p>I think that because discussion about differences between genders is often consigned to the more diversity-hostile corners of the internet, though, ideas that would be proven wrong by the data go unchallenged. Again, I think if we were to have the right sort of conversation on these issues, we would find that discrimination is indeed the primary cause of the gender gap in EA, but without that conversation, people will not be convinced. (And if an honest conversation engaged with data and personal experiences came to the conclusion that this was not the case, that would probably be good information to have.)</p>\n<p>For instance, I read the Damore memo, but then saw <a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*H5PrnnEAD7GteRHf.\">this graph</a> which seems to be pretty good evidence that the vast majority of the gap in tech is not from biological differences (and so likely some iteration of discrimination, implicit or explicit). I don\u2019t remember where I came across this graph, but it was very helpful to me. Without looking at the whole picture, though, one can look solely at the individual components of the picture (e.g. Damore\u2019s arguments on specific gender differences) and come to conclusions that would be put in doubt with fuller information.</p>\n<p>As an additional reason why I think EA is a movement that could have the right conversation on this, I think that EAs recognize a moral principle similar to equality of interests, where differences in personal traits do not lead to moral differences. It seems that in many diversity and inclusion conversations, both the right and the left consider personal trait differences to imply moral differences, and I think EAs can challenge and move beyond that assumption\u2013though with care and only after we start improving on our demographics.</p>\n<p>This is a very challenging issue because, as noted in a comment below, racism and sexism have long been motivated by biological essentialism, and it\u2019s extremely disturbing to have people talk about a group you are a part of in this way. (As a Jew, I can say that I feel discomfort with the conversation about Jewish values below, for instance, though I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on its propriety.) I think that the way to deal with this problem is to exercise caution when speaking about these sorts of things, to avoid casual discussion of them, and to have a higher evidence standard for when we talk about these things. I think that our community can learn the appropriate maturity to do that, though.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all this is to say that I hope that as this conversation goes on, we can bring data to bear and recognize the implications of the way we speak for others in this community. Words and ideas do cause harm, and we should be utilitarians about the way we speak. With appropriate caution, though, I think that EAs can have a conversation that gets to the heart of the matter and offers a model for how these conversations can be had.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>For those looking for examples of places where these discussions could be valuable, I have a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Gender and cosmopolitan values\u2013<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010\">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a> cites feminism as one of the reasons for declines in all sorts of violence (war, sexual violence, torture), and I\u2019ve seen enough data to match my intuition that feminism is also very good for animals. I think there are lots of things to explore empirically in this domain (that likely would have implications for the A vs. E debate), but they probably involve engaging with uncomfortable questions about where these gender differences arise.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>On another note, animal advocates will often assert that if we focus on multiple causes, we will solve our diversity and inclusion problem. I think this is a very important claim to test, because focusing on multiple causes may be quite costly.

To preface things I had generally good interactions with people they were nice and we chatted a bit about non-systemic EA interests (which I am also interested in). There was lots of conversation and not too much holding-forth.</p>\n<p>I was mainly trying to find people interested in discussing AI/future things as any systemic change has to take this into consideration and there is lots of uncertainty. I was asked what I was interested in by organisers and asked if anyone knew people primarily interested in AI, and I didn't get any useful responses.  At the time I didn't know enough about EA to ask about systemic change (and wasn't as clear on what I exactly wanted). </p>\n<p>This slightly rambling point is to illustrate that it is hard to connect with people on niche topics (which AI seems to be in London).

More could be done, but more could always be done.</p>\n<p>The second, which I think might be more exclusionary, is EAG. I applied for tickets and to volunteer but I've heard nothing so far. I'm unsure why there is even selection on tickets.</p>\n<p>I suspect I don't look like lots of EAs on an application form: I don't earn to give, but have taken a pay cut to work part time on my project, which I hope will help everyone in the long run. I may not have quite the same chipper enthusiasm. </p>\n<p>I suspect other people interested in systemic change will look similarly different from lots of EAs, and the curation of EAG might be biased against them. If it is, then I probably have not lost out much by not going!</p>\n<p>I mainly wrote this comment to try and give some possible reasons for the lack of a significant group interested in systemic change (despite articles/comments to the contrary). I'm not expecting EA to change, you can't be a group for everyone and you do interesting and good things.

From my own perspective for the people that are interested in current niche EA topics it is important to be able to potentially meet other people  from around the world interested in their topics.

However, I'm not entirely clear what incentive gradient you are referring to.</p>\n<p>But I do see an incentive gradient which goes like this: Most people responding to threads like this do so in their spare time and run on intrinsic motivation.  For whatever reason, on average they find it more intrinsically motivating to look for holes in social psych research if it supports a liberal conclusion.  There's a small population motivated the opposite way, but since people find it less intrinsically motivating to hang out in groups where their viewpoint is a minority, those people gradually drift off.  The end result is a forum where papers that point to liberal conclusions get torn apart, and papers that point the other way get a pass.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, essentially all online discussions of politicized topics fall prey to a failure mode akin to this, so it's very much something to be aware of.</p>\n<p>Full disclosure: I'm not much of a paper scrutinizer.  And the way I've been behaving in this thread is the same way Kelly has been.  For example, I linked to Bryan Caplan's <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/01/diversity_of_th.html\">blog post</a> covering a paper on ideological imbalance in social psychology.  The original paper is <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/images/fileUpload/documents/Duarte-Haidt_BBS-D-14-00108_preprint.pdf\">53 pages long</a>.  Did I read over the entire thing, carefully checking for flaws in the methodology?  No, I didn't.</p>\n<p>I'm not even sure it would be useful for me to do that--the best scrutinizer is someone who feels motivated to disprove a paper's conclusion, and this ideological imbalance paper very much flatters my preconceptions.  But the point is that Kelly got called out and I didn't.</p>\n<p>I don't know what a <em>good</em> solution to this problem looks like.  (Maybe LW 2.0 will find one.)  But an <em>obvious</em> solution is to extend special charity to anyone who's an ideological minority, to try &amp; forestall <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/\">evaporative cooling</a> effects.  [Also could be a good way to fight ingroup biases etc.]</p>\n<p>As a side note, I suspect we should re-allocate resources away from social psychology as a resolution for SJ debates, on the margin.  It provides great opportunities for IQ signaling, but the flip side is the investment necessary to develop a well-justified opinion is high--I don't think social psych will end up solving the problem for the masses.

Suppose one initially takes a set of studies to support P. Others suggest studies X, Y and Z (members of this set) do not support P after all. If one agrees with this, it seems better to clearly report a correction along the lines of &quot;I took these 5 studies to support P, but I now understand 3 of these 5 do not support P&quot;, rather than offering additions to the set of studies that support P. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The former allows us to forecast how persuasive additional studies are (i.e. if all of the studies initially taken to support P do not in fact support P on further investigation, we may expect similar investigation to reveal the same about the new studies offered).

I don\u2019t agree with 100% of your diagnoses or prescriptions (honestly I rolled my eyes at some of them), but absolutely share your concern that a lack of gender and racial diversity is hurting EA.  I\u2019d also add age diversity to the mix, and in my experience (which I doubt is unique) this issue interacts with the gender and racial issues in a problematic way.</p>\n<p>Back in my 20s, I would have brushed off and rationalized away your diversity concerns.  At that time, I was the type of person over-represented in EA: young, male, studied econ at an elite school, working as a hedge fund quant in an explicitly hyper-rational and confrontational work environment, maximum \u201cthinker\u201d assessment on the Myers-Briggs thinker vs. feeler spectrum, etc.  Many (probably \u201cmost\u201d, or even \u201calmost all\u201d) of my friends and co-workers fit the same description.  And I placed a very high value on my opinion, and the opinions of people like me.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m pushing 40, and I\u2019m still a quanty, thinker vs. feeler guy with a blunt communication style.  But I\u2019ve acquired a valuable perspective on just how stupid really smart 20 somethings can be.  When you work at a place that hires lots of people that fit the same profile year after year, certain patterns become obvious.  You see the first year analyst class making the same mistakes each year, and realize they\u2019re the same mistakes you and your cohorts made when you were first year analysts.  You see that some people, with impeccable backgrounds/resumes, simply aren\u2019t very good at their jobs for a variety of reasons.  It turns out that even really really smart people mess up in very systematic ways.  For instance, the type of people overrepresented at EA (myself included) generally aren\u2019t that great at being humble (probably because of all the good grades and accomplishments).  They also undervalue people skills- until I was lucky enough to meet an enormously talented salesperson and watch him build and nurture relationships that were critical to landing many multibillion dollar accounts, I thought the marketers were just people who couldn\u2019t hack the math to do real finance work.  I\u2019m sure I still carry this bias to some degree.</p>\n<p>When I was younger, I would have fallen in the \u201csure EA is homogeneous, but can you prove that\u2019s a problem?\u201d camp.  With another ~15 years of perspective, I think that gets the burden of proof backwards.  We\u2019ve already experienced some of the negatives- remember when an EA journalist went to EA Global and felt a big part of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai\">story</a> was EA naivet\u00e9?  We know the EA community and its leadership disproportionately represent populations who systematically lack humility (the \u201cbest and brightest\u201d), experience (the young), and access to alternative perspectives (the women, people of color, people who remember the 70s, etc. who are mission aligned but think EA is too much work to interact with).  That\u2019s a lot of red flags (and FWIW most of my background is in risk management).  </p>\n<p>So now I\u2019ve come around to the view that the EA community should seek out low cost ways to improve diversity (e.g. limiting jargon), and at least weigh the costs of changes that could significantly improve diversity (e.g. a community diversity officer).  And if people want to argue that the lack of diversity in EA isn\u2019t a problem, I think the burden of proof is clearly on them.  </p>\n<p>I\u2019m amazed and inspired by all the young EAs who want to make the world a better place- I spent my time in college getting drunk at my frat, not reading 80,000 hours.  The last thing I want to is discourage any of them.  And I\u2019m still kind of young and plenty dumb.  So please just consider this a perspective to consider, and an endorsement of the principle of considering different perspectives.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jon_Behar"}}, {"_id": "YZwvnxbtZAevnFP2c", "postedAt": "2017-10-28T14:34:35.649Z", "postId": "YCPc4qTSoyuj54ZZK", "htmlBody": "<p>Another (possibly bad, but want to put it out there) solution is to list names of people who downvoted.

As I said very explicitly in my comment about free speech, the term is often used to justify speech that pushes people out and reduces the diversity of opinions in the community and the freedom that people have to speak. The question is where the line is -- and it's probably a blurry, messy one -- and how we should address transgressions of it to keep our debates as free and productive as possible.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "FHvx2mrgNcrfobLux", "user": {"username": "Kelly_Witwicki"}}, {"_id": "bzBrDeFQTd36d67bs", "postedAt": "2017-10-30T05:12:23.193Z", "postId": "YCPc4qTSoyuj54ZZK", "htmlBody": "<p>Some more thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I mentioned my concern that pro-diversity efforts in EA might &quot;spiral&quot; towards a mob mentality.  I think one way in which this might happen is if the people working towards diversity in EA recruit people from underrepresented groups that they know through other pro-diversity groups, which, as you mention, frequently suffer from a mob mentality.  If the pool of underrepresented people we draw from is not selected this way (e.g. if the majority of black people who are joining EA are against affirmative action, as is true for the majority of the black population in general), then I'm less worried.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I think some of your suggestions are not entirely consistent.  For example, you mention that EA should not &quot;throw around the term \u201cAI\u201d with no qualification or explanation&quot;.  From my perspective, if I was hearing about EA for the first time and someone felt the need to explain what &quot;AI&quot; was an acronym for, I would feel condescended to.  I imagine this effect might be especially acute if I was a member of a minority group (&quot;How dumb do these people think I am?&quot;)  Similarly, you suggest that we cut our use of jargon.  In practice, I think useful jargon is going to continue getting used no matter what.  So the way this suggestion may be interpreted in practice is: <em>Don't use jargon around people who are members of underrepresented groups</em>.  I think people from underrepresented groups will soon figure out they are being condescended to.  I think a better idea is to remember that we were once ignorant about jargon ourselves, and make an effort to explain jargon to newbies.  Hopefully they feel like members of the ingroup after they've mastered the lingo.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Relatedly, there is a question which I think sometimes gets tied up with the diversity question, but perhaps should not get tied up, which is the question of whether EA should aim more to be a committed, elite core vs a broad church.  My impression is lots of people privately favor the committed, elite core approach.  I think we can have both diversity and a committed, elite core: consider institutions such as Harvard which are both elite and diverse.  Furthermore, I think being more public about our elitism might actually help with diversity, because we'd be making our standards clearer and more transparent, and we could rely less heavily on subjective first impressions.  (CC <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1g3/why_how_to_make_progress_on_diversity_inclusion/c83\">Askell</a> on &quot;buzz talk&quot;.)  To put it another way: although &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;inclusion&quot; are often treated as synonyms, it's actually possible to be both &quot;diverse&quot; and &quot;exclusive&quot; (and this seems likely ideal).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A benefit of diversity you didn't mention: Insofar as the EA movement has world peace and global cooperation as part of our goals, it's useful to have people from as many different groups as possible.  This is also useful if we want to be able to speak authoritatively on topics like how AI should be used for the benefit of humanity and whatnot.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Unjustified hunch here, but I think maybe another failure mode that can come up when a movement tries to increase diversity is that people who are underrepresented start to receive more attention.  Even if this attention is positive (e.g. &quot;How can we cater to people like you better?&quot;), I think this can result in an increased level of self-consciousness.  (See my previous point about how people who look different may feel self-conscious by default even if they're not discriminated against.)  Further unjustified conjecture: the sort of black person who supports affirmative action tends to enjoy the power they get from this, whereas the sort of black person who doesn't support affirmative action doesn't like it, thereby enhancing the &quot;spiral&quot; effect.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Another possible failure mode: Diversity advocates see something they don't like (e.g. a person suggesting that women do not contribute to society and are leeches if they don\u2019t offer men sex), and they want to root the problem out.  In order to rally support, they let everyone know about the problem (like you did in this post).  But by letting everyone know about the problem, they've also made it in to a bigger problem: now every woman who reads this post knows that someone, at one point in an EA-related discussion somewhere, made this outrageous claim--which results in those women feeling less welcome and more on edge.  The toxic echo of this person's post continues to reverberate as it is held up as part of a broader trend within EA, even though their post itself was long ago deleted.  (This could contribute to the &quot;spiral&quot; effect I described, if the women who stick around after hearing about posts like these are disproportionately those that enjoy engaging in flame wars with people who make outrageous statements.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I mentioned the EA Survey.  One thing you could do is look at existing EA survey data and try to understand whether our issues with underrepresentation seem to be getting better or worse over the years.  My impression is that gender thing, at least, has gotten much better since EA was founded.  In any case, if things are already on a good path, I'm more skeptical about major diversity initiatives--&quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Incidentally, I realized some of the points I'm making here are redundant with <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/mp/pitfalls_in_diversity_outreach/\">this essay</a> which was already posted.
