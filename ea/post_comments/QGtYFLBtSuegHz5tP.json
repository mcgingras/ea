I'm going through AGISF right now and making a bunch of cards for studying and the thought of publishing them for others came up, but wasn't sure if it was worth the effort (to polish them for public use).</p>\n<p>@Bryce Robertson, any thoughts on this? Were you approached to do this or did you come up with your own reasons as to why you started this project? If this is something that would be valuable for other resources I'd be quite excited to work on this.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "squanchBrigade"}}, {"_id": "obWb2XdksEMLCjzma", "postedAt": "2023-09-30T15:19:14.809Z", "postId": "QGtYFLBtSuegHz5tP", "htmlBody": "<p>The idea came about because I was looking for ways I could use Anki beyond language learning and figured this could be useful, then decided that if it seems useful for me then presumably for others too.</p><p>When I told a few people I was working on this, I generally didn\u2019t get particularly excited feedback. It seemed like this may at least to some degree be because people are sceptical as to the quality of shared decks, which is partly why I put a lot of time into making this one as well-designed as possible.</p><p>That\u2019s also the reason I would personally be keen to try out someone else's deck on core concepts from an AISF course or similar, but with the caveat that if it didn\u2019t meet a pretty high quality standard then I\u2019d likely not use it and make one myself instead.

Not sure if they were already fans of SRS before.

I almost only use cloze deletions and that may not be preferable. I do source all of my links and the source text that I'm roughly basing my card on.
