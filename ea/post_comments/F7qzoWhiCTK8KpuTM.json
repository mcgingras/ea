We remind attendees at the start of most EA NYC events that everyone present has a different starting point and we all have something to learn and something to teach. We began doing this, in large part, to make sure newcomers who don't \"speak EA\" feel welcome. But there might be a benefit to also explicitly noting possible language barriers, given how deeply international and multicultural the community here is.

From my experience of teaching college classes in China, often people there have much higher English fluency in writing and reading than in speaking.</p><p>So, roughly 75% of the potential English speakers in the world have English as their second rather than native language. This is a very large, often untapped market for EA ideas -- people who might be able to read Singer, Bostrom, MacAskill, Ord, etc., and read EA Forum posts, but who might feel quite intimidated attention an EAG meeting in person and trying to talk with people.</p><p>I think one small, practical step we can take is to be aware of this issue when writing posts and comments on EA Forum. We often use Anglo-American colloquialisms, rather obscure academic vocabulary, and rather convoluted grammar, partly as a coolness-indicator, and partly as an intelligence-indicator. When we use EA/Rationalist in-group dialect, I imagine that might be especially confusing to outsiders.</p><p>So, when we're writing stuff on EA Forum, I would suggest that people try to keep in mind a clear mental image of their audience -- and instead of imaging our US/UK in-group friends, we should try to imagine a 22-year from Shenzhen, Mumbai, Beirut, or Prague who's got pretty good English from a few years of school classes, but who's not fully fluent, or familiar with current US/UK pop culture or Rationalist jargon.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "5wZkuprsuMJ8fdpns", "postedAt": "2023-12-22T19:10:14.838Z", "postId": "F7qzoWhiCTK8KpuTM", "htmlBody": "<p>\"...for most professional EA roles, and <i>especially </i>for \"thought leadership\", English-language communication ability is one of the most critical skills for doing the job well\"</p><p>Is it, really?
