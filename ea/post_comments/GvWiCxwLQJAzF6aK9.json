I'm sure experiences vary a lot, so, general disclaimer, this is just my personal data point and not some broad impression of the <i>typical</i> experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the best things that happened as a result of my stay:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;I made at least three close friends I'm still in regular contact with, despite leaving the hotel half a year ago. That is a lot by my standards! I also increased my \"network\" by at least 20 people from all parts of the world and various professional/academic backgrounds that I'd be pretty happy to reach out to.</li><li>I greatly increased my productivity. During my stay, a friend and I came up with an accountability system that increased my productivity on average by &gt;5 focused hours per week over the last year (compared to previous years) and made me generally more healthy (e.g. I would estimate that I now exercise &gt;1h more per week on average).<ol><li>Relatedly, I managed to create four episodes of a German podcast about EA in my first two months there.</li></ol></li><li>Harder to quantify: a lot of inspiration! I came to the hotel after a year of being more or less in covid-isolation and so I went from that to talking hours every day to researchers and creators with loads of new ideas. I hope that spending so much time around people who were smarter and more knowledgeable than I lead to a decent amount of intellectual growth for me. Somewhat relatedly, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the value of my stay came from many small suggestions other people casually made in conversation (e.g. of some concept, some website or some other product).<ol><li>I think this varied a lot over time as the group of people changed and especially as we became a smaller group over the summer it became less of a stimulating environment.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p>Some downsides:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>I'm not a fan of Blackpool. I remember it largely as being grimy and dull, especially in winter. The proximity to the sea and the park are quite nice though&nbsp;</li><li>I think the hotel rooms were also less comfortable and nice than what I'm used to from home. I think this was fine for the most part since I mostly used my room to sleep. &nbsp;</li></ol><p>On balance, I think I benefitted a lot from staying at the hotel and I'm very glad I made the decision to go! Thanks to Greg, Lumi, Denisa, Dave and everyone else who spend time with me while I was there &lt;3<br>Please reach out if you have any questions you'd rater like to ask me in private.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Aaron__Maiwald"}}, {"_id": "CrQDznKaEQYn6Bp3j", "postedAt": "2022-12-14T23:09:10.907Z", "postId": "GvWiCxwLQJAzF6aK9", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Post summary</strong> (feel free to suggest edits!):<br>The Centre for Enabling EA Learning &amp; Research (CEEALAR) is an EA hotel that provides grants in the form of food and accommodation on-site in Blackpool, UK.
