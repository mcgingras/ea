Abolishment is a pipe dream, but arms limitation is far from nothing - it really does make a difference whether each side has 1000 nuclear weapons or 300 or 100, since the soot produced and famine caused scales with weapons used, and it can be the difference between 5.5 billion people dying (current worst case scenarios for NATO-Russia &amp; US-China nuclear exchanges) and like sub 1-2 billion (India-Pakistan).</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Joel Tan"}}]
