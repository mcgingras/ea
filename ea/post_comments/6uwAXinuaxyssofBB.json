I have an objection to your analysis, though as you point out, there's a substantial chance that most economic growth in the future will be driven by artificial intelligence or digital people, so this doesn't end up being overly consequential. But your section on the proportion of economic growth from population increases is, I think, a bit insufficiently optimistic on that factor. Economic growth rates are often theorized to be superexponential in terms of population. Increasing population contributes to growing the economy not only because the additional people directly contribute economic activity, but because marginal people also increase the <i>growth rate</i>. The 8,000,000,001st person isn't just another worker or scientist, they're another person all eight billion previous people can bounce ideas off of. One example is prehistoric Australia, which was settled by trans-oceanic explorers, settled into a stable population level in the tens of thousands for an extremely long time, and had stagnant economic and technological growth over this period. Adding another person there wouldn't increase their growth very much, but in the population regime where the world already has ten billion people, it makes a much bigger difference.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "robirahman"}}, {"_id": "CAvjpEHeehxFsh4mT", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T10:12:38.587Z", "postId": "6uwAXinuaxyssofBB", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Robi, thanks for your response. Are you referring to the endogenous growth models, where additional people have growth effects rather than level effects as in the semi-endogenous growth model (they increase the future growth rate)? or are you referring to historical trends? I am personally not very convinced of both.</p><p>\"they're another person all eight billion previous people can bounce ideas off of\"</p><p>This seems to depend on whether people actually have more connections. Even if they have more connections AND you think that research is driven by bouncing off ideas, you might think that this positive effect is smaller than the negative effect of research duplication when the population becomes bigger. But I agree it is plausible that the relevant parameter in the semi-endogneous growth model, lambda, is greater than 1.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "i4X4FFdeJJ9q9adAZ", "user": null}, {"_id": "PyFfqWjsDEQfF8aSD", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T07:06:45.239Z", "postId": "6uwAXinuaxyssofBB", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm sympathetic to Robi's claim that growth rates may be a superexponential function of population.

For all the discussion that population growth/decline has gotten recently in EA(/-adjacent) circles, as a potential top cause area--to the point of PWI being founded and Elon Musk going on about it--there hasn't been much in-depth assessment of the case for it, and I think this goes a fair way toward filling that gap.</p><p>One comment: you write that \"[f]or a rebound [in population growth] to happen, we would only need a single human group satisfying the following two conditions: long-run above-replacement fertility, and a high enough \u201cretention rate\u201d, that is, a large enough fraction of the descendants of this group continues to belong to the group.\" I think that's a good and underappreciated point, but I also think it's a bit weaker than it sounds at first, since something of a converse also holds. I.e. for permanent population decline to happen, we would only need a single human group satisfying the following two conditions: long-run below-replacement fertility, and a high enough \"attraction rate\", that is, a large enough fraction of people born outside the group continue to join the group. \"Western civilization\" has arguably been such a group for the last few generations, and it's not obvious to me that it (or its \"descendants\") won't continue to be for a very long time.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "trammell"}}, {"_id": "G5bFvs7gfxYKFAPXe", "postedAt": "2023-05-27T08:49:27.650Z", "postId": "6uwAXinuaxyssofBB", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for writing this blogpost!&nbsp;<br><br>I wondered whether you also specifically looked at population <i>decline </i>in developed countries?
