Edited to add an approx min length and that whips are expensive. I didn't state any specific length because the minimum depends on the organisation, but yes, a guideline is good. More than that... there is actually nothing. It is super easy to do and it is common sense that many people who don't have hair because of cancer are really not comfortable with this, and specially for children this makes them stand out and be an easy target for jokes and comments. For those that struggle with money, this is very valuable \u2014at an almost negligible cost for us. Downsides? Having colder ears? ;-) I'm not asking people who don't want to cut their hair to do anything, I'm saying if you want to cut yours, consider donating it.</p>\n<p>Re shortform: I actually first clicked on it but: 1) I wrote the post in the phone, 2) there was no title line, 3) I've never wrote (or read, I think) a shortform 4) I have not written the post for several weeks already. So 2) looked weird and because of 1) and 3) I was not sure that everything was fine, and because of 4) I didn't want to delay more writing the post (which often leads me to not writing any post at all). So I went to the safe option of writing a (short) post (which I don't think is not adequate as I've read quite a few very short posts, also by notable EAs, and nobody complained in the comments or seemed to have downvoted). This also explains the rough writing. I have to note here that I've red several times posts from the forum masters asking people to write rough/short/half-baked posts as it is much preferable than not writing them at all.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "MFRnhDj2ATKpHoBuB", "user": {"username": "mikbp"}}]
