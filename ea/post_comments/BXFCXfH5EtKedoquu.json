Firstly, if one donor stops contributing funds, one or more funders are still around to provide funding. Hopefully, partial interim funding would be sufficient to meet living costs for the donee until full funding is restored. Anyway, secondly, funding coalitions of more members can seem more trustworthy and reliable to potential new donors. A new donor will be more likely to fill an existing funding gap if they can see one or more other donors already trust the donee enough to carry out the desired work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "XAHtCQnaoTFYhqXQi", "postedAt": "2015-07-28T19:41:19.149Z", "postId": "BXFCXfH5EtKedoquu", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>AFAIC donations within a bounded range can be received by non-US citizens in US soil, even in non-favorable Visa conditions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think you mean AFAICT - as far as I can tell.

Reasons I can see:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Individuals are willing to work for less. But this doesn't really speak to the opportunity cost of their time, which (from the perspective of society, or &quot;effective altruism&quot; as a whole) is the main cost.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Tax treatment. Most of the time this is much worse for gifts to individuals (unless you arrange to make a grant to an individual, which is quite difficult for most donors and introduces significant additional reporting overhead). It can be better if (a) donors weren't able to deduct their donations anyway (e.g. because they are in an unfavorable jurisdiction or are donating &gt; 50% of AGI in the US), and (b) people are willing to work for very low wages outside of institutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Fundraising. I don't see why this would be cheaper for individual donors, though I agree that in general we could as a community reduce fundraising costs by improving our collective decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Coordination. Groups spend time coordinating with each other, on training and recruiting, etc., but in general these seem like worthwhile projects that are pursued precisely because they are cost-effective.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Administrative overhead. This seems like the main game. Some of this is useful work that improves efficacy, while some is just overhead involved with hiring people, accounting, maintaining non-profit status. It would be useful to get a more precise estimate for the total &quot;lost&quot; overhead that can be avoided by working independently. I think this is the main thing you could do to make this case more compelling. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's worth pointing out that the number of dollars spent on overhead as a fraction of total dollars isn't a directly relevant metric, given that the opportunity cost of employee time is often significantly higher (so e.g. a 20% financial overhead may be more like a 5-10% overhead if we include all inputs).
