The third study you cite is the one above in a US context, and I don't know how much this evidence transfers to an LMIC context.</p><p>However, you mention a lack of evidence in a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/B7wohgDDdwPoQAatt/new-cause-area-training-health-workers-to-prevent-newborn#comments\">previous post</a> \"New cause area: training health workers to prevent newborn deaths\" you mention that:</p><blockquote><p>I was tempted to title this piece \u201cNew cause area: health workforce development,\u201d but the reality is that there\u2019s much better data to quantify cost-effectiveness on a dollars-per-DALY basis in the niche of neonatal care training.<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/B7wohgDDdwPoQAatt/new-cause-area-training-health-workers-to-prevent-newborn#fnluuyf8byg6\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&nbsp;I believe that this much narrower cause area is just the tip of the iceberg \u2013 it\u2019s easy to see and quantify but also indicative of a much bigger underlying and unaddressed problem. Fortunately, modest investments in neonatal care training might be cost-effective on their own while <i>also</i> generating transferable lessons applicable to the bigger problem.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>2. Based on this post, it's not clear to me how you / your team is prioritizing which countries or regions to operate in, which health problems to work on first, and why. Based on what you wrote in the previous post, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/B7wohgDDdwPoQAatt/new-cause-area-training-health-workers-to-prevent-newborn#Thoughts_on_next_steps\">the next steps</a> you outlined seemed very promising, and plausibly neonatal care could be good, but this is not mentioned in this post.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Becaus the funding amount is quite large ($4 million), it would be good to explain why you think this is the right amount to ask for right now. Based on my knowledge of early-stage global health startup NGOs, I'd expect that you could probably create a strong case for impact (e.g. run an RCT) and create a strong case for impact for somewhere in the range of USD $100,000-$500,000 (very very rough estimate, someone please correct me if this is way off!).&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "vaidehi_agarwalla"}}, {"_id": "vzbmgsvDz5Ab3Me3s", "postedAt": "2022-09-13T22:14:35.005Z", "postId": "4f7tXpp8npR853g9d", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for this feedback! This is exactly why I posted, so before I provide any specific responses to your points, please know that I appreciate all of the questions and suggestions and I'm already thinking of how they could be addressed in a future version of this proposal.</p><p>1. I appreciate your point that the key step in the theory of change is not clear - and I think this is not due to a gap in the data itself but instead due to a gap in my presentation of the evidence. The key supporting evidence is linked out from this statement:</p><blockquote><p>My analysis of existing research studies shows that training HWs to properly care for newborn babies is likely to be&nbsp;<a href=\"/posts/B7wohgDDdwPoQAatt/new-cause-area-training-health-workers-to-prevent-newborn\"><u>highly cost-effective</u></a>, with an average cost of&nbsp;<strong>$59 per DALY</strong> averted ($100 per DALY averted is&nbsp;<a href=\"/posts/HbunzTyFPRwcYihg6/long-lasting-insecticide-treated-nets-usd3-340-per-life\"><u>sometimes cited</u></a> as a benchmark for highly effective interventions)....</p></blockquote><p>The linked post cites six studies that show reductions in mortality due to HW training. &nbsp;While there are remaining reasons for skepticism, I think these six studies support this key step in the theory of change, at least for some types of training. Regarding your sub-points on point (1), I accept the feedback that we can and should provide more detail on the evaluation in a future version of this. The six studies provide pretty clear guidance on the type of data we would collect.</p><p>2. I agree that a roadmap of regions / countries / priority courses would be helpful to include and can add this to a future version. Thanks for the suggestion. We'd want to start with topics that have the strongest existing evidence base (such as neonatal care and management of childhood illness).</p><p>3. The dollar amount may seem high, but this is a technology development project. I think it will be very difficult to build a truly excellent learning platform that is tailored to this target audience without attracting top engineering talent, and that gets expensive. As I mentioned in the post, we've already done substantial piloting &nbsp;on a shoestring and I plan to continue to do that! I'll think further about whether we can present a tiered approach, with additional pilots done with an MVP.</p>", "parentCommentId": "tePNiiWxhFBtQu5Jy", "user": {"username": "mpt7"}}, {"_id": "jcEjX9igEdnBppBfx", "postedAt": "2022-09-13T22:43:26.615Z", "postId": "4f7tXpp8npR853g9d", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for responding!</p><ol><li>I missed that link!

It looks great. A few minor comments and ideas. Wordpress is very flexible but requires lots of plugins to interface with each other for many functions to work. Consider chatting to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliaqeel/\">Aqeel</a> or JJ Hepburn from <a href=\"https://sangro.io/\">Sangro</a>/AI Safety Support who recently used wordpress for a learning management system to see how they found it. Consider also using an existing platform with more pre-built features (e.g., Thinkific) where cross-compatibility might be less painful (see our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eauq.thinkific.com/courses/ea-uq-intro\"><u>uni EA fellowship site</u></a>). At least at the start, these help projects like this get off the ground more easily. Most projects add their bells and whistles later.</p><p>My PhD student is doing a thesis very close to this project. She\u2019s trying to accelerate knowledge translation in developing countries. Our hypothesis, like yours, is that online learning will rapidly and cost-effectively close the research-practice gap.</p><p>The first study in her thesis&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Zfd9PmhABV4xxJRPEPtqO0VkDSpU0Kj3enooL8Kj2o/edit\"><u>is a systematic review of randomised trials</u></a> using online learning in healthcare. We want to know how well online learning teaches professionals, and how well the training helps people translate it into practice. She\u2019s aiming to find what features help the interventions work better. If you\u2019re interested in the review, she\u2019s looking for team members. Being a team member means you learn the results much more quickly and become an author on the paper, which can be good for credibility. If you want to find out more, email me at noetel [at] gmail.com or send me a message on the forum.</p><p>Her second study is a cost-effectiveness analysis of an online nursing intervention. Her third study is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19tyLyUyDgVn3BnTKmJ4Z9KHnR7bfU6OpnPoHrG-MnhI/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>a series of interviews in LMICs to see how professionals from those countries feel about online learning</u></a>. It sounds pretty well aligned with the kind of scoping your team is doing. If you\u2019d be interested in the findings of a study like that, and possibly have some contacts from healthcare in LMICs, then again we\u2019d be interested in collaborating (email me). She could run the interviews but you might find the results valuable.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "mnoetel"}}]
