The <a href=\"https://archive.is/rt2PS\">linked article</a> gives no evidence for this claim. China has something like 10% or less of the chip market share, and the export controls don't affect other countries' abilities to produce chips (though they do prevent some chips from being sold to China). Most fabs right now have utilization rates well below 100%, meaning they produce fewer chips than they could due to weak demand.</li><li>The October 7 controls also have not \"upset markets\" globally, or at least the <a href=\"https://archive.is/ZvuCU\">linked article</a> gives no evidence for this claim. Memory chip-makers like Samsung have seen profits fall, but this seems to be a normal business cycle thing --- semiconductors, and especially memory chips, are a cyclical industry, sensitive to consumer demand, and the current downturn is almost certainly related to the global financial downturn and associated reduction in consumer demand.<ul><li>I think the October 7 controls have affected and will affect markets, but mostly by reducing profits of companies selling chips and equipment to China, and reducing the supply of some chips and equipment within China (their intended purpose). There'll probably be other, indirect effects down the line, but it's hard to say what those will be now.</li></ul></li><li>I also note a tension between those two points -- the first blames the October 7 controls for there being a chip supply shortage, and the second blames the controls for there being a chip oversupply. Neither is true.</li><li>I disagree with the claims that the October 7 controls have \"failed spectacularly at achieving their stated ambitions\" and that despite them \"China\u2019s AI research has managed to continue apace\".<ul><li>I basically disagree with the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-ai-industry-barely-slowed-by-us-chip-export-rules-2023-05-03/\">linked article</a>.<ul><li>It states that Nvidia is releasing export-control-adapted versions of its chips with lower memory interconnect (to be below the export control thresholds) for the Chinese market. This is true, but the gap between the state of the art and what can be sold to China will grow.</li><li>It seems to suggest that compute will be less important in future.
