I think a substantional amount of intellectual progress was made in the 2000s / early 2010s from a constellation of different places (e.g. early FHI, the rationality community, Randomistas, GiveWell, etc) which led to the EA community developing some crucial ideas. Sadly, I think we have seen less of that \"raw idea generation process\" in recent times. I'd be pretty excited if there was a project that was able to revive this spirit, although I think it would be (very) difficult to pull off.</li><li><strong>High quality communications of EA </strong><i><strong>Principles</strong>.</i> Many core EA ideas are hard to communicate, especially in low bandwith formats. In practice I think this means that discourse around EA (e.g. on twitter) is pretty poor (and worsening). Whilst there's been work to remedy this in specific cause areas (like <a href=\"https://aiscc.org/\">AISCC</a>), there don't seem to be many public communications champions of EA as <i>an intellectual project, </i>nor as <i>a community of people earnestly aiming to improve the world</i>. Again, I think this is hard to remedy, and easy to get wrong, but I would be pretty excited for someone to try.<i>&nbsp;</i></li><li><strong>Fundraising. </strong>Promising projects across all cause areas are going unfunded due to funding constraints (EAIF included). I'm additionally worried that there are several fundraising organisations &nbsp;- who's principle goal is \"fund EA/EA-ish projects\" - are distancing themselves from the EA label, leaving projects (especially in the EA community) without a source of funding.</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnlvhj4oaeyjd\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreflvhj4oaeyjd\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Not speaking for EAIF / EA Funds / EV&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": "M4eDapxDoQCjRt3WN", "user": {"username": "22tom"}}, {"_id": "9jaNzagBoM9bhpJ5Z", "postedAt": "2024-01-24T22:35:32.293Z", "postId": "E9AQEKZYtCB84ckXu", "htmlBody": "<p>I think the premise of your question is roughly correct: I do think it's pretty hard to \"help EA notice what it is important to work on\", for a bunch of reasons:</p><ul><li>It could lead to new, unexpected directions which might be counterintuive / controversial.</li><li>it requires the community to have the psychological, financial and intellectual safety to identify / work on causes which may not be promising</li><li>It needs a non-trivial number of people to engage with the result of exploration, and act upon it (including people who can direct substantial resources)</li><li>It has a very long feedback loop, which can be a) demoralising, and b) difficult to predict if it ever has an impact.</li></ul><p>Given those challenges, it's not suprising to me if we struggle to find many projects in this area.

For projects that are clearly great / terrible this is less of an issue, but projects close to the bar do benefit from some (at least basic) info.</li><li><i>Providing too much (irrelevant) information</i> - On the flip side, a large amount of (irrelevant) information can distract from the core case for the project. E.g. if an applicant does not have track record in an area they're looking to move towards, I much prefer that they directly state this rather than include highly irrelevant info to fill the page.</li><li><i>Not providing any references</i> - We often reach out to references, who can give a more detailed opinion on the applicant and/or their project plan. Without any 3rd party to contact, it can be difficult to verify claims made in an application.</li><li><i>Optimising for p(receive grant) rather than Impact</i> - this is a tricky one, since people apply for projects which they believe are highly impactful, and an obvious instrumental goal to that happening is to get funding. But ultimately, it's worth being upfront and honest about weakenesses, since ultimately our common goal is to do the most good, and perusasion / deception undermine that (even if this increases p(receive grant))</li><li><i>Intepreting rejection (or success) too strongly</i><u> </u><i><u>- </u></i>The grant appplication process (like job applications) is extremely noisy, in which a single decision gives limited evidence about an application. Of course, this advise goes both ways - it is not literally 0 evidence, and some projects shouldn't be funded - but I do worry if people over-update on a rejection from EAIF, especially when they are pretty close to the bar</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "cDKgoSDMsmkbmEM8A", "user": {"username": "22tom"}}, {"_id": "9ZBoRJMu48g7TNbu8", "postedAt": "2024-01-26T15:04:05.811Z", "postId": "E9AQEKZYtCB84ckXu", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>located in an existing hub so that program participants have plenty of people outside the program to interact with</p></blockquote><p>I don't understand this consideration.
