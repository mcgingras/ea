This is partly because we wanted to rely on published studies on the association between various conditions (e.g., stress) and productivity loss. Most of the studies we looked at relied on self-reported absenteeism and presenteeism (loss of productivity while at work due to lower performance). This means that these estimates don't include turnover which can indeed cause decreased organizational productivity, emotional challenges, and other costs. Overall, this might mean that this is an underestimate though there are other ways in which the estimates above might be an overestimate. Do you have a sense of how many people this might involve - e.g., is it 0.1% of staff, 1% of staff, or something else?</p>", "parentCommentId": "FsbF4kQ4jcTAxMxxi", "user": {"username": "SebastianSchmidt"}}, {"_id": "v6qyoouE3BrrswkCe", "postedAt": "2023-10-25T21:58:38.327Z", "postId": "Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for putting this together <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/sebastianschmidt?mention=user\">@SebastianSchmidt</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/amine?mention=user\">@Amine</a>. I appreciate you being conservative with your conclusions.

Yes, we found that even the conservative estimate indicates that this can be a worthwhile investment and I feel more robustly good about folks investing in experimenting with high-quality services. That said, some initiatives have significantly higher ROI than 3.7 (our upper bound) so people will have to make individual judgment calls.</p>\n<p>In terms of your considerations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This seems right to me. I also want to stress that I think it's likely that some of the people who could benefit the most from these services aren't currently working at organizations. E.g., individual researchers who don't have anything that resembles management and other beneficial structures typically found within organizations.</li>\n<li>Seems true to me! However, even very senior people may benefit a lot from this. For example, many of the big tech CEOs (e.g., Eric Schmidt, Tim Cook, and Sundar Pichai) were coached by Bill Campbell and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trillion-Dollar-Coach-Leadership-Handbook/dp/1473675960\">attributed significant value to that coaching</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yes, we're happy to support follow-ups!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "v6qyoouE3BrrswkCe", "user": {"username": "SebastianSchmidt"}}]
