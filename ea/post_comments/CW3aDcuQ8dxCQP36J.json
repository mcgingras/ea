It\u2019s great to see someone take such a deep interest, and thank you for the specificity of your suggestions. As it happens, we\u2019re about to put up an impact evaluation. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been a little while since the previous one (done by Nick Beckstead). I was hoping to do it a bit earlier, but was tied up finishing my PhD. It will address various points like what we might expect the value of a new member to be, and how this changes with different discount rates. I\u2019ll take your comments, like about wanting to be able to follow individual cohorts, into consideration. We\u2019ve also recently taken on a Community Director (Alison Woodman) who focuses on members \u2013 both to improve membership retention and to increase our understanding of our membership for impact evaluation purposes. So hopefully in the future our impact evaluations will be more thorough and frequent.</p>\n<p>Jacob\u2019s already addressed the most pressing points. I just had a couple of other considerations: \nAs he said, the main thing in December was the Pledge event, which was amazing. Giving season and new year\u2019s resolutions always cause a bit of a bump in membership too. </p>\n<p>I\u2019m don\u2019t think that we should think of members who joined under the newer pledge as \u2018lower quality\u2019. The new pledge is more general, but it is so in the sense that it is cause neutral. People who plan to donate to animal charities because they think that they can help fellow creatures even more by doing so seem every bit as serious in helping others effectively as those donating to eradicate extreme poverty. We\u2019ve even had a couple of people join because of the change in the pledge who donate to poverty eradication charities, but who thought that we might in future find an even more effective cause than that, and wanted to make sure if they took a lifelong pledge they would definitely be able to keep it. These people seem at least as likely to continue donating as others. </p>\n<p>While I agree that it\u2019s easier to join online than by sending off a letter, I\u2019m less convinced that the new method of joining is going to be one which makes it less likely people feel engaged. We still send people a physical pledge form, to maintain the feeling of solidity. But doing it online means that an email immediately gets sent to the person, and we now make more effort to follow-up with and get to know members (which we have more capacity for because of the reduction in admin moving to the online system). </p>\n<p>By the way, you seem very comfortable with numbers, knowledgable and engaged \u2013 how would you feel about working with our research team?

Presumably we should discount their value by whatever credence we place in animals counting as moral agents. A wide range of new focuses are now acceptable to GWWC members, and regardless of one's specific personal beliefs, it seems likely that some of those members will focus on something you don't personally think is very valuable. For example, it seems plausible that some people might (falsely) think that donating to a political party was the best way of helping people.

There are an additional 7 members or so who joined during that period (bearing in mind the pledge change happened in early December) who also said they intend to give to non-poverty causes. </p>\n<p>So it seems the spike over Dec-Jan is attributable more to the Facebook event than to the broadening of the pledge, although that certainly had a noticeable effect. Having spoken to quite a few of those who joined because of the event, I'd guess that Rob is right that most of these were likely not aware of the pledge change.</p>\n<p>The pledge change and Ravi's work just happened to coincide - we hadn't heard from Ravi beforehand. He and a group of friends came up with the idea of a New Year pledging event and did most of the work themselves, though the GWWC team helped out.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "7khK2s9vEGincDtnz", "user": {"username": "aliwoodman"}}, {"_id": "jL5Z5rqX2sPnDWEpK", "postedAt": "2015-04-20T15:32:21.337Z", "postId": "CW3aDcuQ8dxCQP36J", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks!

Some interesting points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>only 293 of 705 (41.6%) of the people who applied to join GWWC have returned their pledge forms.</li>\n<li>The fraction of people who claimed to be fulfilling the pledge in 2011 (I take it GWWC does not have tax receipts etc.) was basically unvarying by year of pledge: 64% of 2009 pledges, 71% of 2010 pledges and 64% of 2011 pledges. This suggests that the 'more keen people join first' and 'people drop out over time' effects perfectly canceled out. (Though the sample size is small). However 65-70% claimed retention after 0-2 years suggests a relatively short half-life for members.</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": "AAkWQCzwaMzq9q5Z9", "user": {"username": "Dale"}}, {"_id": "jETc96kKbAKDJEJcK", "postedAt": "2015-04-21T05:59:08.442Z", "postId": "CW3aDcuQ8dxCQP36J", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Regardless of one's specific personal beliefs, it seems likely that some of those members will focus on something you don't personally think is very valuable</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The relevance of this isn't clear. Both before and after the change, every particular GWWC donor is giving to a charity that the donor likes but that some people don't consider maximally valuable. The question is whether the change made things worse. On average, I expect it made things better, since I expect cause neutrality to be helpful.</p>\n<p>Perhaps your point is that previously this impact was valuable to one constituency--people who prioritize development--whereas now the value is spread to a wider range of donors with a wider range of values. I can see why this might make fundraising harder, since it's a classic example of a public goods problem, but it doesn't seem to make the project less impactful overall.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but that they'll see a higher dropout rate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I expect that GWWC's dropout rate is increasing over time.
