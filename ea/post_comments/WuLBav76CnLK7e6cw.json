It probably comes with reduced pay but does not require enough savings to carry you through unpaid leave.

I managed to convince my previous boss at the startup about EA too. I then joined another startup to rack up more savings and had another sabbatical where I was more determined to work at a highly impactful job. Seems like every sabbatical I took I get closer to EA ideas and ultimately stumbled upon a good fit at an effective giving org.

In cases where this option is available + financially viable, I think it can be very worth considering.

I was very frustrated back then. Having learnt a lot of interesting ideas about using one\u2019s career for social impact I felt that I do not have sufficient time to explore these ideas to the depth I wanted to. I wanted to head towards a transition but I felt that I got stuck. So earlier this year I told my employer that I\u2019m thinking of quitting because of this (note that I\u2019m in a furtunate position of having experience that is currently in high demand, so I could relatively easily find a job similar to my previous if needed). But they suggested that I could do part-time instead if I wanted to and I accepted their offer.</p>\n<p>It did not just give me time to explore the research around high-impact careers but now also allows me to spend signifficant time on applications, work trials and volunteering projects for testing my fit and upskilling.</p>\n<p>One thing that I\u2019m still thinking about is that I was in a fortunate position of being able to afford this financially. It just does not feel right that I decided to \u201cspend\u201d these resorces (my time/the salary I did not earn) on this \u201cproject\u201d without crosschecking with experts (e.g. grantmakers) that my \u201cproject\u201d meets the bar of being an effective use of these resources.
