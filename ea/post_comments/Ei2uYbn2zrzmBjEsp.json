I appreciate the actionable suggestions &amp; the structure of the post (i.e., summaries at the top and details in the main body). Excited to see the other posts in this series!</p><p>One suggestion: <strong>I think it would be helpful to distinguish between interventions that are helpful for people with poor sleep quality </strong>(e.g., people with insomnia) <strong>and those that are helpful for people with \"average\" sleep quality</strong> (e.g., people who don't have any huge problems with their sleep quality but are trying to optimize their sleep quality).&nbsp;</p><p>In other words: let's assume person A has diagnosable insomnia, and person B has \"average\" sleep quality but is trying to optimize (i.e., by going from 50th percentile sleep quality to 80th percentile). Would you suggest the same intervention for person A and person B?</p><p>My understanding &nbsp;is that many of the top recommendations are typically studied for insomnia, but there is much less research supporting their effectiveness for \"people with ordinary sleep habits who are trying to optimize\" (epistemic status pretty uncertain: I'm not a sleep researcher but have talked with a few about this topic).</p><p>A few questions:</p><ul><li>In general, would you say the evidence for these interventions is strongest for people with insomnia/poor sleep quality?</li><li>Which intervention(s) would you recommend most strongly to someone with insomnia/poor sleep quality?</li><li>Which intervention(s) would you recommend most strongly to someone with average/good sleep quality?</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Akash"}}, {"_id": "NhGA5tudtdDqz8ZPf", "postedAt": "2021-11-15T17:09:59.591Z", "postId": "Ei2uYbn2zrzmBjEsp", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you! I think those are some quite reasonable suggestions/ questions.</p>\n<p>Short response:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think differences in effectiveness based on current sleep quality are likely outweighed by differences in individual behaviours (e.g. how much caffeine/ magnesium you already consume).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Long response:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm reasonably confident that the relative value of each of these interventions is likely to be similar for people regardless of their current quality of sleep, just with reduced effect for those currently with better quality sleep.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I expect that differences in value on that basis (poor quality vs average quality) are likely outweighed by differences in value based on personal circumstances as the individual effectiveness of several of these interventions depends based on people's current behaviours. (e.g. current bright light exposure/ night-time window policy/ previous exposure to mindfulness/ quality of mattress).</p>\n<p>The only exception to this is likely CBT-I given it's specifically geared to insomnia, though I'd expect improved sleep hygiene and sleep restriction to still offer significant benefits to someone with more average sleep quality.</p>\n<p>From the studies that I've looked at, I'd say that the evidence tends to be strongest for the effect of these interventions on insomnia. In general, I found research to be relatively thin for many of these topics which led me to largely combine findings for people with average sleep quality and those suffering with insomnia/ other sleep issues.</p>\n<p>There's definitely a risk of that skewing the results, which perhaps I should've discussed in the text, but it felt like a trade-off between that and either splitting the recommendations, perhaps making the article more taxing to read, or giving recommendations based on very little evidence (by discounting some of the studies used for being the wrong group).</p>\n<p>Given all that, I'd likely stick with the same recommendations regardless of someone's current sleep quality.

It's cool they have done a study on the 'full-room' approach.</p><p>I think full-room approaches are worth people looking into, but it's worth noting that they are usually <i>less</i> bright than using SAD lamps (and this goes for the setup described in the pre-print too). As noted, in the <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.29.21265530v1.full.pdf+html\">pre-print</a>, they put out more light, but because you are usually much further away from the lightbulbs distributed around the room than you would be from a light box on your desk, the mean illuminance at eye level was 1433-1829 lux. By comparison, I have three of the light boxes photographed above on my desk (quite a distance, more than arm's length), and they're each around 5000-7680 lux at eye level. Of course, it's <i>possible</i> to get much larger amounts of light from either approach.</p><p>As the pre-print notes, natural summer sunlight exposure has a few characteristics that might be advantageous over typical light therapy, i) much brighter, ii) covers the whole visual field, iii) exposure for many hours of the day, not just a short period in the morning.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree that (ii) might be important and potentially a significant advantage of the full room approach over light boxes. IME, one significant difficulty with getting a large amount of light from a small/concentrated source (such as a light box) is that it's subjectively very uncomfortable. Daylight, conversely, usually provides much more light but without the uncomfortable glare of having a single, very bright light in front of you. Ironically, when I tried setting up &nbsp;large number of bright lightbulbs around my room previously, they are actually <i>less</i> comfortable than light boxes, because without being fully covered by diffusers (as SAD lamps usually are, but which reduces the brightness a lot), the single points of very bright light coming from the bulbs were more unpleasant than the light boxes. Of course, there are very many different ways you could set these up in a room, including having more bulbs, but all with diffusers, so YMMV.</p><p>The authors are also right that being able to just sit in a bright room and move around freely within in might be a significant advantage (or a practical necessity) for many people. This isn't really a factor for me, and I'd imagine many EAs, since I am at my desk most hours and so can be exposed to my SAD lamps pretty easily.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also uncertain about how less bright light spread roughly evenly across the day compares to the typical very bright dose of light first thing in the morning. It seems possible that the brighter light first thing in the morning is superior for circadian rhythm entrainment (and so improving your sleep), &nbsp;though it is also possible that less bright light throughout more of the day is superior (perhaps mediated by higher volume), or that this is superior for SAD, but not for circadian rhythm per se. I'd be interested if anyone knows any high quality studies that tease this apart. I often wonder, for myself, whether it would be better to have a high light dose only relatively early (and then cut it off) or to maintain a high light dose throughout most of the day.</p>", "parentCommentId": "2ca8kF2rPyBviAkTX", "user": {"username": "David_Moss"}}, {"_id": "FobqmqvNFpkAJhQSs", "postedAt": "2021-11-17T12:56:18.384Z", "postId": "Ei2uYbn2zrzmBjEsp", "htmlBody": "<p>Regarding magnesium, the specific supplement you happened to link to was magnesium oxide.

As a reader, I have no idea how to interpret the rankings or numbers - what does it mean that melatonin gets \"5.95/10\" or that CBT-I gets \"5.78\"? - or how much to update off them. The results are basically uninterpretable.&nbsp;</p><p>I would strongly&nbsp;recommend that the OP heavily revise their methods and the presentation of their research for any further work. The main thing would be to present the results of the interventions in a standardised metric, e.g. total sleep time, or standard deviations of something, so readers can make a comparison themselves, then make comments on cost and, if necessary research quality.

In particular, I can agree that the \"5.95/10\" numbers aren't particularly useful given the lack of any context/ scale.</p><p>To respond quickly to a few specific points:<br>1) This research was overwhelmingly based on the existing literature. I chose not to include a reference list or in-text citations to maximise the readability of the text but perhaps this was an error.<br>2) The interventions' strength of effect, which accounts for about 40% of the score, is an average of improvements in sleep efficiency and total sleep time found in the literature I reviewed. In hindsight, I think it could have been better to highlight these findings on their own in the text and may add them in.<br>3) The focus of this research was to explore interventions that the reader is less likely to have heard of previously. I assumed that ideas like avoiding alcohol and late naps are things that nearly all readers would already know. On that basis, I felt that highlighting them in an article like this is unlikely to produce any change in behaviour, though I can see now the potential usefulness of presenting the size of effect.&nbsp;<br>4) I think an article like this recommending low-cost, personal interventions can reasonably have a different approach and level of rigour to one recommending charitable interventions and/or shifting large sums of money. A weighted factor model may not be the best way to frame this research but I think additional considerations like the potential risks and additional benefits of a recommendation are important and necessary to highlight.&nbsp;<br><br>These points make me realise that a more explicit description of the methods used and the literature reviewed would be valuable for future posts, rather than linking to them in out-of-text docs or leaving them out for a marginal improvement to the conciseness of the text.</p><p>This is the first post intended in a series and I expect to revise and improve the methods involved with each post and certainly the feedback I get on posts helps to direct that process. As a first attempt, some of the process was not as rigorous as it could or perhaps should be.

In most cases, it helps to show the reader you know that literature, to outline what it is, and then go on say what your new contribution is.

A piece of \"what works for X\" should, I say, include the things that work for X, then perhaps go on to flag which of these are likely to be a surprise, rather than assuming on the reader's behalf what they will already know.

All other social animals do the same thing when they\u2019re isolated too. The best theory is that you don\u2019t feel safe going to sleep when you\u2019re lonely, because early humans literally weren\u2019t safe if they were sleeping apart from the tribe. You know nobody\u2019s got your back\u2014so your brain won\u2019t let you go into full sleep mode. Measuring these \u2018micro-awakenings\u2019 is a good way of measuring loneliness\u2026 [A researcher studying the Hutterites in the American Dakotas found] they had barely any. The [Hutterite] community showed the lowest level of loneliness that [the researcher had] seen anywhere in the world. It really stunned [him].</i></p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "DaveC"}}, {"_id": "8NQ8EBhJZJWSxdtgo", "postedAt": "2022-04-27T20:47:26.027Z", "postId": "Ei2uYbn2zrzmBjEsp", "htmlBody": "<p>Relaxing sounds help me to sleep well e.g. rain on window with thunderstorm or just rain-sounds.
