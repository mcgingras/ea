Thanks for writing it out for the community. I think there are few reasons for this change.</p><ol><li>The average EA today is far less \"committed\" to EA than in 2016. By committed, I mean making personal sacrifices for altruism. Here is a website I found for <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/donations#footnote1\">Jeff Kauffman and Julia Wise</a> where you can see them giving 50% of their income since ~2012. If I'm not mistaken, they've had a family for most of that time. This behavior is significantly less common nowadays, particularly as a proportion of people in the movement where I suspect a good fraction of people in the community donate relatively little, let alone 50% of their income.</li><li>Salaries at EA organizations have grown a lot. People used to take massive pay cuts to do EA non-profit work. Hopefully people from the early days can fill in some numbers here but there is a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cfdnJ3sDbCSkShiSZ/ea-and-the-current-funding-situation\">picture</a> here of an office in the basement of an estate agent, salaries being 15k/year pre-tax and lunch being the same every day. In the OP, Abraham talks about a $500 donation allowing him to hire a contractor and being able to hire staff after ~75k of donations. Apart from a select few CE incubated charities, 75k doesn't even cover a single person's salary for a year at most EA orgs. Most salaries I see today for EA positions are 100k+, particularly at longtermist organizations.</li></ol><p>There are a few solutions to this:</p><ol><li>EA gets more frugal. We might not go back to 15k (20k or so with CPI adjustment) but a typical salary could become 50-60k. Catered lunches, generous expense policies, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-roles-on-our-gcr-team/#2-about-working-at-open-philanthropy\">large benefits packages and ample + flexible + paid time off</a> become a pot luck once a week, basic healthcare coverage and 2 weeks of vacation. All of a sudden, running a 10 person organization takes $1M instead of $10M and it becomes much more feasible to get 30 x $10-30k with a couple of 50-100k donations to cover the cost of the organization.</li><li>A general decentralization of the funding landscape. Open Phil (and maybe SFF) get divided into ~5 orgs. A significant amount of regranting gets done on the order of ~100k-1M per regrantor who otherwise do other things.</li></ol><p>I think there are costs to both approaches. There will be a lot less work done by \"less committed\" EAs if sacrifices compared to the private sector become expected. Furthermore, there are many efficiency gains to be had by not having several grantmaking orgs duplicate the same work + a bunch of less skilled and trained regrantors might on average make worse grants.</p><p>Still something to consider.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MarcusAbramovitch"}}, {"_id": "XLgnHmMo8HoLeAyBe", "postedAt": "2023-11-12T11:47:52.658Z", "postId": "AyLF2KQ8AqQuiuDLz", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for writing this up! One problem with this proposal that I didn't see flagged (but may have missed) is that if the ETG donors defer to the megadonors you don't actually get a diversified donor base. I earn enough to be a mid-sized donor, but I would be somewhat hesitant about funding an org that I know OpenPhil has passed up on/decided to stop funding, unless I understood the reasons why and felt comfortable disagreeing with them. This is both because of fear of unilateralist curse/downside risks, and because I broadly expect them to have spent more time than me and thought harder about the problem. I think there's a bunch of ways this is bad reasoning, grantmaker time is scarce and they may pass up on a bunch of good grants due to lack of time/information/noise, but it would definitely give me pause.</p>\n<p>If I were giving specifically within technical AI Safety (my area of expertise), I'd feel this less strongly, but still feel it a bit, and I imagine most mid-sized donors wouldn't have expertise in any EA cause area.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Neel Nanda"}}, {"_id": "3g9yozzw34tuCAfAJ", "postedAt": "2023-11-12T12:13:34.501Z", "postId": "AyLF2KQ8AqQuiuDLz", "htmlBody": "<p>I've found that if a funder or donor asks, (and they are known in the community,) most funders are happy to privately respond about whether they decided against funding someone, and often why, or at least that they think it is not a good idea and they are opposed rather than just not interested.</p>", "parentCommentId": "XLgnHmMo8HoLeAyBe", "user": {"username": "Davidmanheim"}}, {"_id": "YMzYr7a8m7f8YPegk", "postedAt": "2023-11-12T15:58:42.504Z", "postId": "AyLF2KQ8AqQuiuDLz", "htmlBody": "<p>It's definitely true that, holding everything equal, spending less on salaries means it's easier to fundraise, and organizations can get more done for a given amount of money. But of course if you ask someone who could be earning $500k to work for $50k most of them (including me!) will say no, and even people who say yes initially are more likely to burn out and decide this is not what they want to do with their life.</p>\n<p>There are also other costs to pushing hard on frugality: people will start making tradeoffs that don't really make sense given how valuable their time is to the organization. For example, in 2015 when our first child was refusing to eat at daycare it would have been possible for us to hire someone to watch them, but this would have been expensive. Instead, <a href=\"https://thewholesky.wordpress.com/2015/05/28/two-working-parents-no-daycare/\">we chose a combination of working unusual hours and working fewer hours</a> so she wouldn't need to be in daycare. We were both earning to give then, so this was fine, but if we had been doing work that was directly valuable I think it would probably have been a false economy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if sacrifices compared to the private sector become expected</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this general area is quite subtle and confusing, where people have really different impressions depending on their background. From my perspective, as someone making about 1/3 as much in a direct work job as I was making (and expect I could still make) in industry, this is already a relative sacrifice. On the other hand, I also know people at EA orgs who would be making less money outside of EA. I don't at all have a good sense of which of these is more typical? And then the longer someone spends within EA, developing EA-specific career capital and foregoing more conventional career capital, the lower a sacrifice it looks like they are making (relative to the highest comp job they could get right now) but also the higher a sacrifice there actually making (relative to a career in which they had optimized for income).</p>\n<p>(And, as always, when people give us as examples of people making large sacrifices, I have to point out that the absolute amount of money we have kept has been relatively high. I expect most EAs who spent a similar period in direct work were living on less and have much lower savings than we can. And I think this would still be true even if current direct work compensation had been in place since 2012.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "wD8ExiHZJ5dNDfBm3", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "DLsHfiHHnh3HmMJjM", "postedAt": "2023-11-12T16:47:02.937Z", "postId": "AyLF2KQ8AqQuiuDLz", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Neel, I get the issue in general, but I'm a bit confused about what exactly the crux really is here for you?</p>\n<p>I would have thought you would be in one of the best positions of anyone to donate to an AI org - you are fully immersed in the field and I would have thought in a good position to fund things you think are promising in on the margins, perhaps even new and exciting things that AI funds may miss?</p>\n<p>Our of interest why aren't you giving a decent chunk away at the moment?

For other less senior roles there weren't (though I think the opposite generally tends to be more true).<br><br>I do thing one consideration here is we are talking about who looked best during hiring. That's different than who would be a better employee - we're assuming our hiring process does a good job of assessing people's fit / job performance, etc., and we know that the best predictors during hiring are only <a href=\"https://infogram.com/1p9zelp0zeg5pyi72nknnymj2xsd27wzv9\">moderately correlated</a> with later job performance, so it's plausible that often we think there is a big gap between two candidates, but they'd actually perform equally well (or that someone who seems like the best candidate isn't). Hiring is just a highly uncertain business, and predicting long-term job performance from like, 10 hours of sample work and interviews is pretty hard \u2014 I'm somewhat skeptical that looking at hiring data is even the right approach, because you'd also want to control for things like if those employees always meet performance expectations in the future, etc, and you never actually get counterfactual data on how good the person you didn't hire was. I'm certain that many EA organizations have hired someone who appeared to be better than the alternative by a wide margin, and easily cleared a hiring bar, but who later turned out to have major performance issues, even if the organization was doing a really good job evaluating people.</p>", "parentCommentId": "wpxQGv5ZoEoMdjpL9", "user": {"username": "abrahamrowe"}}, {"_id": "X9yEdCAZWXJKL9BgF", "postedAt": "2023-11-18T17:45:33.816Z", "postId": "AyLF2KQ8AqQuiuDLz", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Given how much the community has grown, isn't this just what you'd expect?
