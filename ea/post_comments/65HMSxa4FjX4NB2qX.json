Nick Beckstead puts this well in his dissertation discussion of far future trajectories, or the concept of &quot;existential hope&quot; from Owen Cotton-Barratt &amp; Toby Ord. But in practical terms the bulk of the opportunity appears to be in gcr/xrisk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Niel Bowerman: What is your assessment of the recent report by FHI and the Global Challenges Foundation? <a href=\"http://globalchallenges.org/wp-content/uploads/12-Risks-with-infinite-impact-full-report-1.pdf\">http://globalchallenges.org/wp-content/uploads/12-Risks-with-infinite-impact-full-report-1.pdf</a> How will your integrated assessment differ from this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I contributed a small amount of content to this, along with one other GCRI affiliate, but the bulk of the credit goes to the lead authors Stuart Armstrong and Dennis Pamlin. There are synergies between this and GCRI's integrated assessment. We are in ongoing conversation about that. One core difference is that our integrated assessment focuses a lot more on interventions to reduce the risks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How many man-hours per week are currently going into GCRI. How many paid staff do you have and who are they?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't have data on person-hours. I am the only full-time GCRI staff. We have some people doing paid part-time work, and a lot of 'volunteering', though much of the 'volunteering' comes from people who participate in GCRI as part of their 'day job' - for example faculty members with related research interests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What would you say is the single most impressive achievement that GCRI has achieved to date?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I'm proudest of is the high-level stakeholder engagement we've had, especially on nuclear weapons. This includes speaking at important DC think tanks, the United Nations, and more. Our research is good, but research isn't worth much unless the ideas actually go places.

The ability to work across multiple risks is extremely helpful. Our big missing piece has been on biosecurity risks. However, we have a new affiliate Gary Ackerman who is helping out with that. Also I'm participating in a biosecurity fellowship program that will also help. But we could still use more on biosecurity. That includes natural pandemics, biological weapons, biotech lab accidents, etc.</p>\n<p>The other really important thing is people who can develop risk-reducing interventions that bring significant risk reductions <em>and</em> make sense from the perspective of the people who would take these actions. There's a lot of important social science to be done in understanding the motivations of key actors, whether it is politicians, emerging researchers, or whoever else.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And do you expect the kinds of researchers that come to you are very different from the ones that are needed for catastrophic risk research in general, like at FHI, MIRI, FLI or CSER?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Definitely different from MIRI, as they're currently focused on technical AI research and we do not do that. Relative to us, FHI is more philosophical, but we still talk with them a lot. CSER is just getting started with their post-docs arriving later this year, but I see a lot of parallels between CSER's research approaches and GCRI's. And I'm not quite sure what in-house research FLI is doing, so it's hard for me to comment on that.</p>\n<p>Overall, we tend to attract more social science and policy research, and more quantitative risk analysis, though that may be changing with CSER doing similar work.

FHI is more philosophical than GCRI. The most basic division of labor there is for FHI to develop fundamental theory and GCRI to make the ideas more applied. But this is a bit of a simplication, and the coordination there is informal. With FLI, I can't yet point to any conceptual division of labor, but we're certainly in touch. Actually I was just spending time with Max Tegmark over the weekend in NYC, and we had some nice conversations about that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What would you identify GCRI's main comparative advantage?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GCRI comes from the world of risk analysis. Tony Barrett and I (GCRI's co-founders) met at a Society for Risk Analysis conference. So at the core of GCRI's identity and skill set is rigorous risk analysis and risk management methodology. We're also good at synthesizing insights across disciplines and across risks, as in our integrated assessment, and at developing practical risk reduction interventions. Other people and other groups may also be good at some of this, but these are some of our strengths.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "qYc3P7PeGm9emPW4G", "user": {"username": "SethBaum"}}, {"_id": "qZQnugKD2DzJRGMxn", "postedAt": "2015-03-04T00:49:43.324Z", "postId": "65HMSxa4FjX4NB2qX", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Ryan!

Can they play a role in promoting risk-reducing policies? And more generally, how can researchers get their insights implemented?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a really, really important question. In a sense, it all comes down to this. Otherwise there's not much point in doing risk analysis.</p>\n<p>First, there are risk analysis positions that inform decision making very directly. (I'm speaking here in terms of 'decisions' instead of 'policies' but you can use these words pretty interchangeably.) These exist in both government and the private sector. However, as a general rule the risks in question are not gcrs - they are smaller risks.</p>\n<p>For the gcrs it's trickier because companies can't make money off it. I've had some funny conversations with people in the insurance industry trying to get them to cover gcrs. I'm pretty sure it just can't be done. Governments can be much friendlier for gcr, as they don't need to make it profitable.</p>\n<p>My big advice is to get involved in the decision processes as much as possible. GCRI calls this 'stakeholder engagement'. That is a core part of our integrated assessment, and our work in general. It means getting to know the people involved in the decisions, building relations with them, understanding their motivations and their opportunities for doing things differently, and above all finding ways to build gcr reductions into their decisions in ways that are agreeable to them. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to listen to the decision makers and try to understand things from their perspective.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to reduce AI risk, then get out there and meet some AI researchers and AI funders and anyone else playing a role in AI development. Then talk to them about what they can do to reduce AI risk, and listen to them about what they are or aren't willing or able to do.</p>\n<p>GCRI has so far done the most stakeholder engagement on nuclear weapons. I've been spending time at the United Nations, getting to know the diplomats and activists involved in the issues, and what the issues are from their perspectives. I'm giving talks on nuclear war risk, but much of the best stuff is in private conversations along the way. </p>\n<p>At any rate, some of the best ways to reduce risks aren't what logically follow from the initial risk analysis, but it feeds back into the next analysis. So it's a two-way conversation.

Also, I can't speak for other think tanks. GCRI runs a fairly unique operation. But I can say a bit on what we look for in people we work with.</p>\n<p>Some important things to have for GCRI include: (1) a general understanding of gcr/xrisk issues, for example by reading research from GCRI, FHI, and our colleagues; (2) deep familiarity with specific important gcrs, including research literature, expert communities, and practitioner communities; (3) capability with relevant methodologies in quantitative risk analysis such as risk modeling and expert elicitation; (4) demonstrated ability to publish in academic journals or significant popular media outlets, speak at professional conferences, or otherwise get your ideas heard; (5) ability to work across academic disciplines and professions, and to work with teams of similarly diverse backgrounds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What are your suggestions for someone who's technically inclined and interested in directly working on existential risk issues?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It depends on what you mean by 'technically inclined'.

To me this seems as likely if not more so than AI risk. What are your thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't have confident estimates on relative probabilities, but I agree that totalitarianism is important to have on our radar. It's also a very delicate risk to handle, as it points directly to the highest bastions of power. Interestingly, totalitarianism risk resonates well with certain political conservatives who might otherwise dismiss gcr talk as alarmist. At any rate, I would not discourage you from looking into totalitarianism risk further.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the twentieth century we sort of systematically deconstructed a lot of our grand narratives, like 'progress'.

Do you have any thoughts on narratives as a tool for dealing with x-risks?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First, I commend you for thinking in terms of deconstructed narratives and narratives as tools. I'm curious as to your background. Most people I know who self-identify as 'technically inclined' cannot speak coherently about narrative construction.</p>\n<p>This is something I think about a lot. One narrative I use comes from James Martin's book 'The Meaning of the 21st Century'. The title on its own offers a narrative, essentially the same as in Martin Rees's 'Our Final Century'. Within the book, Martin speaks of this era of human civilization as going through a period of turbulence, like in a river with rapids. I don't have the exact quote here but I think he uses the river metaphor. At any rate, the point is that global civilization is going through a turbulent period. If we can successfully navigate the turbulence, we have a great, beautiful future ahead of us. I've used this in a lot of talks with a lot of different audiences and it seems to resonate pretty well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How can we make our societies generally resilient to threats? Once we have some idea of how to make ourselves more resilient, how can we enact these ideas?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One common proposal is to stockpile food and other resources, or even to build refuges. This could be very helpful. An especially promising idea from Dave Denkenberger of GCRI and Joshua Pearce of Michigan Tech is to grow food from fossil fuels, trees, and other biomass. So even if the sun is blocked (as in e.g. nuclear winter) we can still feed ourselves. See <a href=\"http://www.appropedia.org/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What\">http://www.appropedia.org/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What</a>. These are some technological solutions. It's also important to have social solutions. These are institutions that respond well to major disturbances, psychological practices, and more. We say a bit on this in <a href=\"http://sethbaum.com/ac/2013_AdaptationRecovery.html\">http://sethbaum.com/ac/2013_AdaptationRecovery.html</a> and <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/aftermath\">http://gcrinstitute.org/aftermath</a>, but this is an understudied area of gcr. However, there is a lot of great research on local-scale disaster vulnerability and resilience that can be leveraged for gcr.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think that a really robust space program could be very important for x-risk mitigation. What are your thoughts? Do you see space-policy advocacy as an x-risk related activity?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's certainly relevant. I used to think it was not promising due to the extremely high cost of space programs relative to activities on Earth. However, Jacob Haqq-Misra (<a href=\"http://haqqmisra.net\">http://haqqmisra.net</a>) of GCRI and Blue Marble Space made the great point that space programs may be happening anyway for other reasons, in particular political, scientific, and economic reasons. It may be reasonably cost-effective to 'piggyback' gcr reduction into existing space programs. This relates back to an earlier comment I made about the importance of stakeholder engagement.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "FzBcGZdZgk8BxuyfX", "user": {"username": "SethBaum"}}, {"_id": "jsPa4tEzdyXJh5q8n", "postedAt": "2015-03-04T01:19:42.065Z", "postId": "65HMSxa4FjX4NB2qX", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>What are GCRI's current plans or thinking around reducing synthetic biology risk?

For example, we analyzed a scenario in which geoengineering catastrophe was caused by some other catastrophe: <a href=\"http://sethbaum.com/ac/2013_DoubleCatastrophe.html\">http://sethbaum.com/ac/2013_DoubleCatastrophe.html</a>. This weekend Max Tegmark was discussing how AI can affect nuclear war risk if AI is used for nuclear weapons command &amp; control. So they're not really distinct risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ultimately what's important to rank is not the risks themselves, but the actions we can take to reduce them. We may sometimes have better opportunities to reduce smaller risks. For example, maybe some astronomers should work on asteroid risks even though this is a relatively low probability risk.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, the answer to this question varies by time period. For, say, the next 12 months, nuclear war and pandemics are probably the biggest risks. For the next 50-100 years, we need to worry about these plus a mix of environmental and technological risks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And who do you think has the power to reduce those risks?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's the classic Margaret Mead quote, &quot;Never underestimate the power of a small group of committed people to change the world. In fact, it is the only thing that ever has.&quot; There's a lot of truth to this, and I think the EA community is well on its way to being another case in point. That is as long as you don't slack off! :)</p>\n<p>That said, I keep an eye on a mix of politicians, other government officials, researchers, activists, celebrities, journalists, philanthropists, entrepreneurs, and probably a few others.

The biggest mistake we made was letting ourselves get caught up on an ad hoc, unfocused mix of projects, instead of prioritizing better. The integrated assessment is now our core means of prioritizing.

Within the gcr community, I think the biggest mistake is not focusing on how best to reduce the risks. Instead a lot of people focus on the risks themselves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What do you think about the costs and benefits of publishing in journals as strategy?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We publish mainly in academic journals. It takes significant extra effort and introduces delays, but it almost always improves the quality of the final product, it attracts a wider audience, it can be used more widely, and it has significant reputation benefits. But we make heavy use of our academic careers and credentials. It's not for everyone, and that's OK.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you think the world has become better or worse over time? How?

But risks are piling up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you think the world has become more or less at risk over time? How? Why?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More, due mainly to technological and environmental change. Opportunities are also increasing.

Another plausible one is toxic chemicals, but this might not be big enough to merit that level of concern.
