I suspect it is going to get less attention than you might have hoped, given that effort and the importance you put on the issue. Here's what I'd suggest, either for a revamp of this post or for future posts:</p><ol><li>Paragraphing needs to be improved, with full spaces between paragraphs.&nbsp;</li><li>Be more specific about what EA is getting wrong on climate change. You speak about \"perceptions\" and \"assessments\" of climate change within the EA movement, but don't link, cite, or quote any such material. It would also help if you tried to research what (if anything) EA does about climate change right now, and showed how we ought to reprioritize it relative to other causes. For example, do you think climate change is more important than malaria bednets? If so, why? Although you've clearly spent a lot of time researching climate change, your post does not come across as engaging very deeply with EA arguments about climate change, despite that being ostensibly the key goal of your post.</li><li>Include a summary that hits not only your core claim (EA should put more resources into climate change), but the argumentative beats you use to defend that claim. I want to be able to read the first 1-2 paragraphs and decide if reading the rest is worth my time.</li><li>Overall, I'm just not clear on why Canadian climate policy has such central relevance to your core claim that EA should work harder on climate change.</li></ol><p>If EA is getting this wrong, I'm sure everybody wants to know!

I'm not sure if I understand the focus on Canadian policy and voters, either. I think it's because there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle between voters caring about climate change (and I think most of them do!) and humans being good at reversing climate change. For example, what does good policy look like? Does it exist already or does it need to be made? How can a voter tell what is good? And then zooming out from that: Are the proper industry supports in place to fully reap the benefits of good policy? Are the proper technological research, R&amp;D, entrepreneurial energy, removal of red tape for building things, and investment dollars there to flesh out the industry?</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "ruthgrace"}}, {"_id": "nmFre4bJzjQQjQSN9", "postedAt": "2022-10-30T19:57:10.458Z", "postId": "BFvtrhaea85CDYhBQ", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>When these factors are combined with the high population growth predicted in hotter countries, one report finds that 3.0 degrees celsius of averaged global warming translates to an average temperature increase as felt per individual of 7.5 degrees celsius.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.9jxewhrxiew0\"><sup><u>1</u></sup></a> The same report estimates that 30% of the world\u2019s predicted population will then be living in areas with an average temperature equal to or above the hottest parts of the Sahara desert by 2070.</p></blockquote><p>It's very unclear how someone can on the one hand expect this kind of damage to be caused by climate change and on the other hand expect that people in the future won't do geoengineering that leads to different temperatures.

The argument fails for two reasons. First, D) and E) seem unrelated to A), B), and C). Second even if A), B), and C) are supported, you need to explain how the conclusion follows. It could be the case the EAs are wrong on any or all of A), B), and C), but not by very much, so the relative ranking climate changes in terms of EA priorities doesn't change. Some attempt at scope or size of the variance is necessary.</p>\n<p>On the individual claims:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A) seems mostly correct, though it would be incorrect to say there is no interest in the cause area.  Climate change has middling interest among EAs <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/83tEL2sHDTiWR6nwo/ea-survey-2020-cause-prioritization\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/83tEL2sHDTiWR6nwo/ea-survey-2020-cause-prioritization</a>, though is weighted as less important the longer someone spends in the EA community.  Including some citations here as evidence would help support A).</li>\n<li>B) is the most important claim you make, and covers quite a few areas.  It's not clear how B is supported by D) and E). The IPCC reports give a lengthy treatment to the impacts on global food production from climate change, and the effects are modest when considered across all crops.  The variance in expected meat consumption for instance is more significant than stressors from climate change. You don't seem to be claiming that the studies comprising the IPCC report are wrong here, but it seems like you would need to do so to show there is a significant likelihood of \"a major collapse in global food production\".</li>\n<li>C) is a criticism of an accurate EA perception.  The perception that climate change isn't neglected comes from it being a top election issue, the UNFCCC existing, and ~$10 billion/yr in climate philanthropy (<a href=\"https://www.climateworks.org/report/funding-trends-2022/\">https://www.climateworks.org/report/funding-trends-2022/</a>).  The follow-up claim is media coverage isn't effective, which may be true, but it would be wrong to say it is neglected.  I also think it is incorrect to say that all $10 billion/yr of climate philanthropy is ineffective.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the future, it may be worth having someone review a draft of your post to evaluate the logical structure and provide readability edits as others have suggested.
