Since October 2021, they've ostensibly had disjoint sets of CEOs. By late 2021 I had watched several interviews with SBF and followed his output closely on Twitter, and saw people talking about Alameda and FTX in several crypto Discord servers. Nowhere did anyone say that Alameda had changed its name to FTX or otherwise act as if they were the same company (though everyone knew they were close).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[...]&nbsp;</p><p>How could [the former Alameda employee] &nbsp;know less about FTX and Alameda than me, who had never worked at either company and was just watching everything by the sidelines? &nbsp;If it was possible for this person to think that FTX was merely the new name for Alameda, that almost certainly implied that the FTX/Alameda leadership was putting a lot of effort into consistently lying to the public.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I suspect you will not be very impressed by this, and ask me why I didn't share my concerns widely at the time.

I just want to make a meta-comment about the mainstream media's feeding frenzy around EA, and its apparently relentless attempts to discredit EA.</p><p>There's a classic social/moral psychology of 'comeuppance' going on here: any 'moral activists' who promote new and higher moral standards (such as the EA movement) can make ordinary folks (including journalists) feel uncomfortable, resentful, and inadequate. This can lead to a public eagerness to detect any forms of moral hypocrisy, moral failings, or bad behavior in the moral activist groups. If any such moral failings are detected, they get eagerly embraced, shared, signal-amplified, and taken as gospel. This makes it easier to dismiss the moral activists' legitimate moral innovations (e.g. focusing on scope-sensitivity, tractability, neglectedness, long-termism), and allows a quicky, easy return to the status quo ante (e.g. national partisan politics + scope-insensitive charity as usual).</p><p>We see this '<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Comeuppance-Altruistic-Punishment-Biological-Components/dp/0674032284\">psychology of comeuppance</a>' in the delight that mainstream media took when televangelists who acted greedy, lustful, and/or mendacious suffered various falls from grace over the last few decades. We see it in the media's focus on the (relatively minor) moral mis-steps and mis-statements of 'enemy politicians' (i.e. those in whatever party the journalists don't like), compared to the (relatively major) moral harms done by bad government policies. We see it throughout cancel culture, which is basically the psychology of comeuppance weaponized through social media to attack ideological enemies.</p><p>I'm not positing an organized conspiracy among mainstream journalists to smear EA. Rather, I'm pointing out a widespread human psychological propensity to take delight in any moral failings of any activist groups that make people feel morally inadequate. This propensity may be especially strong among journalists, since it motivates a lot of their investigative reporting (sometimes in the legitimate public interest, sometimes not).</p><p>I think it's useful to recognize the 'comeuppance psychology' when it's happening, because it often overshoots, and amplifies moderately bad moral errors into looking like they're super-bad moral errors. When a lot of credible, influential media sources are all piling onto a moral activist group (like EA), it can be extremely stressful, dispiriting, and toxic for the group. It can lead the group to doubt their own valid ideas and values, to collapse into schisms and recriminations, to over-correct its internal moral norms in an overly puritanical direction, and to ostracize formerly valued leaders and colleagues.&nbsp;</p><p>I've seen EA do a lot of soul-searching over the last few months. Some of it has been useful, valid, and constructive. Some of it has been self-flagellating, guilt-stricken, and counter-productive. I think we should take the Time article seriously, learn what we can from it, and update some of our views of issues and people. But I think our reactions should be tempered and contextualized by understanding that the media's 'comeuppance psychology' can also lead to hasty, reactive, over-corrections.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "KERbqSZt2fPtsTCxr", "postedAt": "2023-03-16T17:15:54.290Z", "postId": "b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd", "htmlBody": "<p>I think I'd bet at like 6% that evidence will come out in the next 10 years that Nick knew funds were likely fraudulently obtained.

I'm not qualified to say how good a Board member Nick is, but want to pick up on something you said which is widely believed and which I'm highly confident is false.</p>\n<p>Namely - it isn't hard to find competent Board members. There are literally thousands of them out there, and charities outside EA appoint thousands of qualified, diligent Board members every year. I've recruited ~20 very good Board members in my career and have never run an open process that didn't find at least some qualified, diligent people, who did a good job.</p>\n<p>EA makes it hard because it's weirdly resistant to looking outside a very small group of people, usually high status core EAs. This seems to me like one of those unfortunate examples of EA exceptionalism, where EA thinks its process for finding Board members needs to be sui generis. EA makes Board recruitment hard for itself by prioritising 'alignment' (which usually means high status core EAs) over competence, sometimes with very bad results (e.g. ending up with a Board that has a lot of philosophers and no lawyers/accountants/governance experts).</p>\n<p>It also sometimes sounds like EA orgs think their Boards have higher entry requirements than the Boards of other well-run charities. Ironically, this typically produces very low quality EA Boards, mainly made up of inexperienced people without relevant professional skills, but who are thought of as 'smart' and 'aligned'.</p>\n<p>Of course, it will be hard to find new Board members right now, because CEA's reputation is in tatters and few people will want to join an organisation that is under serious legal threat.

I wonder if a startup or even a non-EA non-profit would be so self-flagellating for taking his money, even given they had heard some troubling reports. If not, I think EAs should chill out on thinking we could have been expected to do a deep investigation [Edit: apparently CEA did one on CEA/Alameda relations in 2019 but no comment yet on how it went] or hold-off on taking money. I mean everyone else had his expected net worth wrong too (Billionaire lists for example, and FTX's own investors who should have been much more interested in internals than donation recipients). [Some data/insider info on how much big charities like WWF or Doctors Without Borders investigate donors would be great here, but without seeing that I'm assuming it was normal to accept money from SBF]</p>\n<p>But as for the idea he was framed as a moral paragon by leaders, idk. I never got that vibe. Was I missing it? It seems more like he was framed, by news outlets and everyman EAs, and maaaybe some EA leaders on occasion but I actually don't even remember this except for from Sam's promos himself, as more of a cool-but-humble industrious  guy than a moral leader or rep of the movement itself if anything. I mean did he ever speak at an EAG or something? What would it even look like if EA leaders were tying EA's rep to his? Maybe he was mentioned some (usually non-EA) places as a notable personality in the movement.? But that doesn't to me say \"this guy's put on a pedestal by leaders\" and \"emulate this guy\" (in fact EAs wanted people to not emulate him and try direct work first).  I honestly wonder if I missed something.</p>\n<p>My weakly-held take is: You can't help it if cool-seeming billionaires get fans, and it is hard to help it if those cool billionaires get associations with the things they fund and <em>themselves talk about</em>. Ex: Elon who people associate with AI safety even though he has never worked on it himself. Associations in the eyes of the public, and news outlets/bloggers/Twitter bumping those associations are gonna happen. I'm not sure EA leaders did anything to boost (or stem!) this effect (fine with being proven wrong though). I do hope/demand that next time, EA leaders are more protective of the EA brand and do try to stem this potential association effect. Like \"Hey buddy, <em>we</em> already weren't gonna put you on a pedestal for being associated with our brand, but actually you don't get to do that either. Please keep involvement with us out of your public talks and self-promotion. We want to be known for the work we do, not who funds us\" Dustin does this (keeps EA out of his professional brand). And most wealthy people prefer to donate discretely so it was maybe a red flag that SBF leaned right into being associated with EA, and would be a red flag in future too. Idk.</p>\n<p>[Edit: You might consider the last part negligence, that EA leaders didn't give SBF a slap on the wrist for EA-associating. If so maybe you still aren't happy with leadership. But I just want to flag that if that is what happened that is still much better than leaders actively boosting him (could be wrong that the latter happened though) and would likely warrant different response. I guess  I view the former as \"mistakes of medium-size (but small for most leaders due to diffuse responsibility <em>if</em> there was no one whose job it clearly was to talk to Sam about this), passively made, not-unusual-behavior\" whereas I'd view active pedestalling or active tying-EA-rep-with-SBF to be \"big mistakes, actively made, unusual behavior\"]</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "WvBStLEiv54iveFyt", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "Eikjsmqme6PfDZaJy", "postedAt": "2023-03-17T15:08:37.502Z", "postId": "b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd", "htmlBody": "<p>MaxRa - I agree this is also part of the mainstream media's anti-EA mind-set: a zero-sum view of influence, prestige, and power.

None of the people who raised concerns about Bankman-Fried to EA leaders in 2018 and 2019 say they warned about specific criminal activity, nor did they foresee the size and scope of the alleged fraud at the heart of the FTX collapse. In charging documents, federal prosecutors identify the start of Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged fraud as 2019.</p></blockquote><p>So I'm not sure you can say there were warnings of \"obvious scams\".<br><br>Also</p><blockquote><p>Sometime [in 2019], the Centre for Effective Altruism did an internal investigation relating to CEA and Alameda, according to one person who was contacted during the investigation, and who said it was was conducted in part by MacAskill. Bankman-Fried left the board of the organization in 2019. The Centre for Effective Altruism did not respond to repeated requests from TIME to discuss the circumstances leading to his departure; MacAskill and others declined multiple opportunities to answer questions about those events.</p></blockquote><p>So I'm not sure it is accurate to say that \"EA didn't listen to\" the warnings which <i>were</i> given. I'm certainly curious about the quality of the internal investigation by CEA. I wouldn't be surprised if there were gaps/it was of low quality. But I <i>also</i> wouldn't be surprised if it was of expected/good quality given the nature of the complaints made. And I wouldn't be surprised to find that Sam would have fooled a non-EA, commissioned investigation too, enough that non-EA nonprofits would have felt comfortable taking his money. I mean, I assume Sam would have refused to give internal financial documents to independent investigators, and such a refusal to engage thoroughly from Alameda (\"Um, no you can't see our internal documents? Who do you think you are..?\") would be so normal for an investment firm that it can't even be seen as a red flag.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not surprised that CEA is refusing to comment til after the commissioned independent investigation is complete, whether or not their 2019 internal investigation was of high, decent, or low quality. I'm not sure which it was yet. I guess I'll wait to see.&nbsp;<br><br>[Edit: In general I'm against pushing to make others responsible for the sins of others &nbsp;without a lot of proof. &nbsp;Especially when the \"sinners\" had dark triad traits who could have been trying to manipulate the others. I know the general population and journalists don't think that way or have as much patience in that regard, but I'd like it if EAs did. Judge leadership for competence, and replace them if needed, sure, but comeuppance here is still likely to be punishment for trying and failing. And I think punishment should be reserved for the actual sinners themselves. I'm not at all sure anyone who didn't work directly with SBF at Alameda \"sinned\" here. And if they didn't, EA itself and EA leaders don't \"deserve\" comeuppance, IMO.&nbsp;<br><br>I find comeuppance as journalistic motivation plausible, but I also admit that comeuppance might <i>not</i> be the journalist's intention with this article, even subconsciously. But it sounds like you are also arguing that comeuppance would be warranted for other reasons here, and I just don't think so. Comeuppance is moral punishment. I'll reiterate that it would be fine to push that leadership should be changed (after the investigation). But let the actual sinners, and the sinners alone, be punished for their sins. [[I don't want to suppress discussion, so sure, <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/IsaacKing/by-the-end-of-2023-will-substantial\">place your bets</a>, but please don't <i>assume </i>moral fault yet.]]<br><br>Finally, I agree with you that many journalists are activists themselves. But I'll also note that when journalists and others say that \"EA isn't doing enough\", they are still potentially using another way to shame moral actors who otherwise appear to be doing more than them. It is a frame that EA has more agency and privilege than them (perhaps unjustly given), <i>but still has less actual goodness and merit than them</i>. So I still find it very plausible that the recent journalists are (consciously or unconsciously) doling out extra blame and shame to put aspiring altruists in their place. And if it is not the journalists themselves doing this, perhaps, as a business, they are catering to the many, many readers who click for and revel in \"comeuppance\".]</p>", "parentCommentId": "tGMfSricSn6RfHJhY", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "RAjaHFCN3MGqmqxxi", "postedAt": "2023-03-17T17:20:08.368Z", "postId": "b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd", "htmlBody": "<p>Yes, I think that him, e.g. being interviewed by 80K didn't make much of a difference.

However I remember ppl talking about it, and it was not by EA leaders or offical conference ppl. It was (if I heard correctly) <i><strong>some kind of joke by some attendee(s)</strong></i>. I still believe this because EAG conference staff are pretty serious about making the event professional, so even if they thought it was secretly funny I'd have a hard time believing they would do that. Worth noting I think this was also a meta-injoke about claims of EA being a cult, obviously by riffing on the WWJD and giving \"glorious leader\" vibes. (Trying to avoid sounding harsh, but to whoever likes this type of thing, here's a reason not to do rogue, injoke stuff like that at an official event. Now we are dealing with it as submitted evidence of potential leadership corruption a year later, and unfortunately it did make EA look more like a cult even though that was actually the punchline not the truth. I imagine some attendees at the time felt icky about it too. Expect the injoke to make it to the outgroup, and anticipate how it will look. Save it for the unofficial afterparty, at most please.)</p><blockquote><p>On the 80k website, they had several articles mentioning SBF as someone highly praiseworthy and worth emulating.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Honestly that just seems normal to me, idk. I have met a couple other people who have profiles on that website. They weren't being put on a pedestal, and 80K couldn't be fairly seen as tying 80k (let alone EA's) rep to theirs (because they aren't billionaires who would assume that). But it did make sense to list Sam as a notable <i>example</i> for earning-to-give, which is a recommended career path. It isn't like this was unwarranted use. Bad luck IMO. Seems like maybe what we are seeing in this instance is that if you want to use a billionaire like a normal example of something in a different talking point you are trying to make, society won't \"let\" you in the long run, because the billionaire's rep is actually bigger than yours and bigger than the rep of the point you are trying to make. So the billionaire's rep will swallow yours up whether you meant it to or not. EAs would do well to keep this lesson in mind for future prominent people even if those people are angels-on-earth. Still bad luck I say, I mean keep in mind SBF was likely trying to <i>actively fool</i> people (including himself methinks) as to his competence. [Edit: And as Ubuntu adds below, they aren't really EA leaders who had heard anything negative about SBF. Hence &nbsp;bad luck/big oof moment.]</p><blockquote><p>Will vouched for SBF \"very much\" when talking to Elon Musk.</p></blockquote><p>This was discussed elsewhere better than I can (I will hunt for the link and edit in shortly [Edit: I didn't want to dig for it so I just made this section longer]), but essentially anybody would do this for their friend or trusted acquaintance when they think something will be mutually beneficial, it was not a professional EA capacity and it was also in private text messages, not public. That it was shared publicly was tbh pretty uncool. I mean it's obvious Macaskill misjudged Sam's character/potential, but he actually wasn't trying to recommend Sam publicly there, and this sounds more like \"person-to-person, I think it's very much worth you guys having a conversation! You care about the same stuff and I know that stuff is why you both are interested in Twitter! Give it a go!\" than \"I, an EA leader, vouch for Sam, also an EA leader\" type of exchange. Will got duped but I'm pretty unclear he was acting inappropriately here in his own personal life. I mean when you have two fabulously wealthy acquaintances, and one wants to do a business deal with the other, you introduce them, and yes you vouch for the first if you know them reasonably well just so they give each other the time of day. There's no expectation that a deal will move forward without due diligence occurring, or that your vouch will become law. Musk knows that Will is not a finance professional, so he should know that Will can only vouch character. And no harm, no foul. But if there was harm for the EA brand here, it was by Musk making the private messages public which like, huh I'd never have expected that if I was Will. <s>It looks to me like Musk did so for a bit of clout to show he is hard-to-dupe.[I was incorrectly pairing this with another Elon text but the rest stands].&nbsp;</s> I don't think he wanted to make a dig at<i> </i>Macaskill<i> </i>for vouching tbh. Musk's financial professional (Michael Grimes) vouched for SBF too with about the same level of confidence. If I were Musk I'd prefer that people I like and respect (which it sounds like Will is one) keep trying to make connections for me when they believe the connections are of potential high value, and I/Musk would still always do my own due diligence. So it feels kind of weird to me that EAs are against Will having tried to connection-make when maybe even Musk wouldn't be so hard on him?&nbsp;</p><p>[Edit: I now realize that maybe some people are upset that Will was cool with arranging for \"possibly EA money\" to be spent on Twitter. To that, it's worth noting that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zuqpqqFoue5LyutTv/the-ea-community-does-not-own-its-donors-money\">EA doesn't own it's donor's money,</a> helping out your major donors and acquaintances in their goals is prosocial and normal, there <i>are</i> EAs who view social coordination and combatting misinformation as important cause areas, and it would have been a business move not a donation]</p><blockquote><p>Sam was invited to many discussions between EA leaders.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Sounds normal for a truly-massive donor who at least understood the movement or was thought to, and who people roughly enjoyed talking to as well. Again, keep in mind that SBF was likely actively trying to fool people here. I wonder if anyone reading this can say \"No, having Sam involved in discussion would have just absolutely been a hard-no from me. No way he could convince me that he, a huge donor, deserves a seat at the table. And if anybody felt he gave them good input in the past... their opinions wouldn't matter, I'd have said 'No, don't invite him.' In fact even if he gave <i>me</i> good input over the years in my leadership, controlled half my funding, and he was possibly expecting an invite, I would definitely still never have invited him.\" [This sounds so strong that it almost looks like I'm strawmanning the other side, I'm giving so little wiggle-room. But I do genuinely think to be able to judge leaders harshly here, you have to believe a claim as watertight as that quote would have been said by other experienced leaders, because I'm only confident a claim as watertight as that keeps competent actors and the rest &nbsp;from &nbsp;inviting Sam.] IDK I just find it quite surprising that readers are acting like disengaging with Sam, a major donor, was so black and white and easy. The majority of people got sucked in... it's easy to say what should have happened now.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Generally, almost everyone was talking about how great Sam is and how much good he has achieved and how, as a good EA, one should try to be more like him. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This perhaps yes. Lot of injokes and stuff in EA culture about SBF generally, too. But how much of this was grassroots in origination, because having a heckin billionaire in your extended crew is cool and interesting, vs how much of this was done by leaders publicly? Should people really not have felt excited and expressed it within their ingroup based on what they thought?</p><blockquote><p>There are probably more examples.</p></blockquote><p>I'd be interested to see them. In general I feel like what I'm seeing listed here is pretty human and normal and I wouldn't call it putting him on a pedestal, or tying EA's rep to his (intentionally or even in ways ppl necessarily could have anticipated would end up very entangled), or elevating him as moral paragon publicly.</p>", "parentCommentId": "4aqc8ASnFfLh586zA", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "ZkgkHsbPLRs5ETFcm", "postedAt": "2023-03-18T18:29:35.329Z", "postId": "b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd", "htmlBody": "<p>I mean, that's not how I read it.

I think it is clearly below 49%, and includes at least fraud against bondholders and investors that could reasonably be expected to cause them to lose money from what they paid in.</p><p>It's not so much the status of the company as a fraud-commiter that is relevant, but the risk that you are taking and distributing money under circumstances that are too close to conversion (e.g., that the monies were procured by fraud and that the investors ultimately suffer a loss). I can think of two possible safe harbors under which other actors' acceptance of a certain level of risk makes it OK for a charity to move forward:</p><ul><li>In many cases, you could imply a maximum risk of fraud that the bondholders or other lenders were willing to accept from the interest rate minus inflation minus other risk of loss -- that will usually reveal that bondholders at least were not factoring in more than a few percent fraud risk. The risk accepted by equity holders may be greater, but usually bondholders take a haircut in these types of situations -- and the marginal dollars you're spending would counterfactually have gone to them in preference to the equity holders. However, my understanding is that FTX didn't have traditional bondholders.</li><li>If the investors were sophisticated, I think the percentage of fraud risk they accepted at the time of their investment is generally a safe harbor. For FTX, I don't have any reason to believe this was higher than the single digits; as you said, the base rate is pretty low and I'd expect the public discourse pre-collapse to have been different if it were believed to be significantly higher.</li></ul><p>However, those safe harbors don't work if the charity has access to inside information (that bondholders and equity holders wouldn't have) and that inside information updates the risk of fraud over the base rates adjusted for information known to the bond/equity holders. In that instance, I don't think you can ride off of the investor/bondholder acceptance of the risk as low enough.</p><p>There is a final wrinkle here -- for an entity as unregulated as FTX was, I don't believe it is plausible to have a relatively high risk of investor fraud and a sufficiently low risk of depositor fraud. I don't think people at high risk of cheating their investors can be deemed safe enough to take care of depositors. So in this case there is a risk of investor fraud that is per se unacceptable, and a risk of investor fraud that implies an unacceptable risk of depositor fraud. The acceptable risk of investor fraud is the lower of the two.</p><p>Exception: If you can buy insurance to ensure that no one is worse off because of your activity, there may be no maximum acceptable risk. Maybe that was the appropriate response under these circumstances -- EA buys insurance against the risk of fraud in the amount of the donations, and returns that to the injured parties if there was fraud at the time of any donation which is discovered within a six-year period (the maximum statute of limitations for fraudulent conveyance in any U.S. state to my knowledge). If you can't find someone to insure you against those losses at an acceptable rate . . . you may have just found your answer as to whether the risk is acceptable.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ozdJFLHrqZ6SxPq3H", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "iATuKzEFsuXARyiEG", "postedAt": "2023-03-18T22:17:01.915Z", "postId": "b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>At EAG London 2022, they distributed hundreds of flyers and stickers depicting Sam on a bean bag with the text \"what would SBF do?\".&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>These were not an official EAG thing \u2014 they were printed by an individual attendee.</p><blockquote><p>To my knowledge, <strong>never</strong> before were flyers depicting individual EAs at EAG distributed.&nbsp;(Also, such behavior seems generally unusual to me, like, imagine going to a conference and seeing hundreds of flyers &nbsp;and stickers all depicting one guy.

People were otherwise pretty supportive of early EA ideas; I mean, it's hard not to support finding more cost-effective global health charities. When SBF emerged, I think this was a bit of a \"see, we told you so\" moment for EAs who had been around for a long time, especially because SBF had explicitly chosen to earn to give because of EA. So it wasn't just: \"look this guy is earning to give and has billions of dollars!\" The subtext was also: \"EA is really onto something with its thinking and advice.\" He became a poster boy for the idea that we <i>can</i> actually intellectualize our way to making the world better (so fuck the haters).</p><p>I think a more plausible defense of senior EAs is not that this pedestal thing didn't happen, but that (as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/stefan_schubert?mention=user\">@Stefan_Schubert</a> suggests) it may not have made that much of a difference. EAs might well have rallied around SBF even if senior people hadn't promoted him. And this is definitely possible, but I wonder if things would've played out pretty differently if senior EAs had been like \"look, we'll take your money, and we'll recommend some great people to work for you, but we don't want to personally serve on the board of FTX Foundation/vouch for you/have you on our podcast, etc because we have heard rumors about X, Y, and Z, and think they pose reputational risks to EA.\"</p><p>Lastly: it looks like the three former Alameda employees accused SBF of having \"inappropriate sexual relationships with subordinates\" around the beginning of the #MeToo movement. Alameda launched in the fall of 2017 and the confrontation with Sam occurred in April of 2018. The NYT published its article about Harvey Weinstein on October 5th, 2017, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/23/us/metoo-replacements.html\">dozens of men</a> were accused of harassment between then and February 2018. The fact that SBF's alleged inappropriate sexual behavior occurred around the height of the #MeToo movement doesn't make me think &nbsp;EA leaders had<i> less</i> of a reason to worry about the reputational risks of promoting him.</p>", "parentCommentId": "FfsxRcRuWmJtqRGME", "user": {"username": "hobbes"}}, {"_id": "D7uKotwLkjEMXZ2eH", "postedAt": "2023-03-19T17:03:03.882Z", "postId": "b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd", "htmlBody": "<p>That's fair but next time I strongly recommend you include context and thoughts so lurkers don't latch onto what you say as proof that leaders or anyone else did anything unreasonable.

It's about putting someone in a position above that where they'd naturally belong. I argue that if you think his treatment was normal, you also don't think he was \"put on a pedestal\" in a colloquial interpretation.<br><br>Here's a slightly different point I couldn't quite word well before: From my perspective, I am not even sure that anything EA did about him was anything they didn't do about other prominent people to the extent it made sense. Like, I don't pay that much attention and suck at names tbh, but I still know with high confidence that essentially everything people name as proof that SBF was unjustly elevated, anything an EA leader did toward/about SBF, they also did toward/about many others they have respected over the years. I just don't see it as unusual or bad (yet) at all. If ppl think that things like named above count as \"putting someone on a pedestal\" and \"tying EA's rep to theirs\" (implied=bad), then there are dozens, maybe 100+ who could be counted as such<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref04wsipl9pek5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn04wsipl9pek5\">[1]</a></sup></span>. &nbsp;I honestly wonder if it just looks like SBF was boosted a lot because he is a billionaire (who wanted to be boosted) and the general public think that is so cool. And EAs do too, like I think maybe EAs forget about other names who got boosted over the years but maybe who just didn't stick in our consciousness or public consciousness because they got little media fanfare? If the public had wanted to hear about something other than billionaires, wouldn't other peeople have been mentioned much more? If people wanted to hear about the founding of &nbsp;Givewell, wouldn't Karnofsky and Hassenfeld been boosted more than SBF? But we live in &nbsp;bugged world where people want to hear about billionaires instead (and the public or at least journalistic consciousness may have been tying him to EA no matter what) and I think that would have shaped almost <i>any</i> person's way of talking, including other electable leaders--leaders we might want to tell ourselves wouldn't have done as Will did, but I'll probably never feel confident of that.<br><br>So, yeah, I suppose the crux is that people think \"I or [other leaders we can elect now] wouldn't have spoken well of Sam if [we] had known what was said in 2018 or 2019 about Sam.\" But CEA did at least do an internal investigation into CEA/Alameda in 2019 and yet here we are. So I find it a little weird to say that.&nbsp;<br><br>Especially expecting that Sam is quite manipulative and EA leaders are just a bunch of high-trust humans (who I wouldn't change if I could press a button btw, because whatever way they think about things is literally why the movement got started). To me, idk, saying EA leaders made mistakes feel a bit like \"you guys shouldn't be the way you are as people, you should expect some people to try to grift\" and I disagree with that.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe we shouldn't have such high-trust people in leadership? I'm not sold. Actually I'm not even sold we can find people who would have noticed and investigated SBF's actual financial fraud who have anything close to a typical human psychology (Gladwell's book \"Talking toStrangers\" has a great section about Bernie Madoff's reception in this regard, but I digress). IDK. I feel so bad thinking that these people I know try so, so hard are being told they made mistakes which basically amount to them being kind and excited about a person, one person among many others they have been kind and excited about. Maybe this time it wasn't deserved, but, sigh, Will and the others are philosophers and altruists, not psychologists and business moguls who might be primed to spot a manipulative person or reputational risk. It feels like to me, as of right now, adding a new person(s) into the mix with more expertise in spotting manipulators and hazards, makes more sense than removing \"EA leaders\" including Nick or even Will from their posts.&nbsp;<br><br>But I will wait to see from the investigation!

In theory yes, for the specific legal, hard mechanisms you mention.

Hm I'm surprised then that it really seems like the journalist didn't turn up such quotes about fraud. I do think you are right that many of them expected a crash-and-burn... of some sort. I feel like I should have written something more precise like \"crash and burn 3 years later, after making 15B on paper\" which comes with so many signals over the years that if I were such a person I'd end up discounting my early suspicions. If I were in their or CEA's shoes I'd probably have expected something like what happened with Tara's company, a crash and burn pretty soon after (2019?), so I'd be assuming something got fixed along the way if not. Especially given how an ex-employee(s?) talked about burning through the Asian arbitrage dollars with bad trade decisions.. they'd have had to fix it, right, or they'd have gone belly-up way sooner?&nbsp;I guess crypto was just that much of a gold rush and so few \"adults in the room\" that they could keep fudging their numbers for that long..?<br><br>Maybe the investigation was worse than useless in the end, but reasonably any action taken was going to start with an investigation.

But my complaints are not focused on EA leaders specifically (I'm hesitant to call out any single person til CEA's commissioned investigation is complete), and are different from what the article discusses.

I'm sorry to anyone I upset.</p><p>Specifically, I regret not putting more effort into ensuring that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd/time-article-discussion-effective-altruist-leaders-were?commentId=4aqc8ASnFfLh586zA\"><u>my first comment</u></a> is not going to be misinterpreted, and ensuring to put things into context, e.g., that \"putting SBF on a pedestal\", if meaning something like \u201cholding SBF up as a role model\u201d, was\u2014<i>certainly</i>&nbsp;<i>for those who didn\u2019t know him well in person</i>!\u2014in the vast majority of instances reasonable and understandable at the time, and I would have easily done the same! (Some things like e.g. tying EA\u2019s reputation to SBF to such a close extent were perhaps not super wise but much of this is probably hindsight bias).</p><p>I feel also bad about mentioning the flyers, mostly because I got important information wrong which is a grave mistake in such a situation, and partly because my phrasing was too harsh/critical (if the person who created those flyers is ever reading this, I'm sorry, you had good intentions and it wasn't a big deal at all!).</p><p>I wrote the comment because I was disconcerted by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd/time-article-discussion-effective-altruist-leaders-were?commentId=FfsxRcRuWmJtqRGME\"><u>original comment</u></a> (and its initial high Karma count) which seemed to seriously question whether we \u201celevated [SBF] as a moral paragon and someone to emulate \u201c, or \u201ctied EA's reputation closely to his\u201d, and asked for specific examples. I still feel like it\u2019s a no-brainer that EAs, in general,&nbsp;<i>obviously&nbsp;</i>and<i> understandably</i> elevated SBF as a role model and someone worth emulating! Seriously questioning this still strikes me as defensive motivated reasoning and concerning. Many people seemed to agree with the commenter which made me worry that EAs would refuse to learn any lessons from this whole scandal which might risk repeating a similar monumental catastrophe. (Me being upset<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref73cesy0xaht\"><sup><a href=\"#fn73cesy0xaht\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;is not meant to be an excuse but if anything a further reason why I should have written this comment differently. As a general rule, it's simply bad to write comments when one is upset because it clouds one's judgment and reduces compassion, and this is an obvious mistake which I should not have made.)</p><p>So why did the FTX scandal happen? One simplistic perspective is (ignoring many other, more important causal factors!): someone with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LpkXtFXdsRd4rG8Kb/reducing-long-term-risks-from-malevolent-actors\"><u>dark triad/malevolent traits</u></a> got more and more power and ended up doing something extremely bad. Other people did not realize that this person is malevolent, or suspected it and didn\u2019t speak up (e.g., because of fear, miscalculation, or motivated reasoning, or opportunism). I\u2019ve seen that story before and it really shaped my outlook on life.&nbsp;</p><p>That\u2019s why I wanted to make the following argument: let\u2019s not put too much faith in the character judgment of the people who championed SBF (<i>and</i> have known him very well) going forward, to make sure that something like this doesn\u2019t happen again. Let\u2019s not be like \u201coh well, there is nothing we can learn from this, no need to change anything\u201d. That does seem like a very important point to me and I stand by that.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, importantly, I wasn\u2019t trying to imply that any EA leader knew about the fraud or did something illegal. I also wasn\u2019t trying to imply that mistakes like \u2018suboptimal character judgment\u2019 are&nbsp;<i>even remotely comparable</i> to the mistakes that SBF made. Of course, it\u2019s not even close. In some sense, it\u2019s a minor mistake that probably more than 95% of people would have made (because lots of things would have to come together to not make such mistakes). In fact, in my experience, many amazing people don\u2019t have great character judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>But on the other hand, it\u2019s still substantial and worth keeping in mind and should be factored in when making, e.g., board decisions (as board members appoint executive directors and those should have good character) or when trusting these people\u2019s character judgment in the future. (Also, I feel like some comments seemed to suggest that being naive and overly trusting is just cute but not worth worrying about which I don\u2019t agree with.)</p><p>As I also wrote in the original comment, I\u2019m not even sure that EA leaders, including Will, made any mistakes ex ante given the enormous uncertainty and complexity of the whole situation and all the important trade-offs involved. I do think that it\u2019s&nbsp;<i>plausible</i> though that some mistakes were made, including significant ones.&nbsp;</p><p>I also regret having singled out Will and I\u2019m sorry if this comment upset anyone. I worry that others may have interpreted my comment as trying to put&nbsp;<i>all</i> the blame on him which I really didn\u2019t want to. I did it, because, to my knowledge, Will was really the EA leader who championed SBF the most and had the closest personal connection to him (aside from people like Caroline, etc., of course). And generally, I think it\u2019s valuable to give specific examples when possible. It\u2019s important to note that many others were involved in this too and could have stepped in!&nbsp;</p><p>To be perfectly clear, I think EA leaders, including Will, have done tremendous good and worked very hard to make the world a better place. I don\u2019t want to belittle their extraordinary contributions.</p><p>Last, I worry that my comment was interpreted as taking the side of EA critics which is not the case. I think that much criticism of EA and EA leaders in the media has been unfair and exaggerated.</p><p>There is more I could write about all of this but this issue is emotionally taxing and I already spent several days on this comment, and I\u2019m trying to move on. (Several days for just writing this crappy comment? Yeah, most of this was just feeling guilty without being able to do anything else productive. This ties to the general issue of how much time to put into comments. FWIW, in the months before writing the comments in March, I was actively challenging myself to write comments more quickly (and often). In hindsight, this could have been a mistake since I may lack the necessary verbal intelligence to pull this off.)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>[Original comment.]<br><br>Thanks, these are good points.&nbsp;<br><br>I do think it's plausible that (some!) EA leaders made substantial mistakes. Spotting questionable behavior or character is hard but not impossible, especially if you have known them for 10 years and work very closely with them and basically were in a mentee-mentor relationship (like e.g. Will, is my impression). I don't fault other people, e.g. those who rarely or never interacted with SBF, for not having done more.<br><br>Either people ignored warning signs -&gt; clear mistake. Or they didn't notice anything even though others had noticed signs (like e.g. Habryka)-&gt; suboptimal character judgment. I think the ability to spot such people and don't let them into positions of power is extremely important.<br><br>Of course, the crucial question is what could have been done even if you know 100% that SBF is not at all trustworthy. It's plausible to me that not much could have been done because SBF already accumulated so much power. So it's plausible that no one made substantial mistakes. On the other hand, no one forced Will to write Musk and vouch for SBF which perhaps wasn't wise if you have concerns about SBF. On the other hand, it's perhaps also reasonable to gamble on SBF given the inevitable uncertainty about other's character and the large possible upsides. Perhaps I'm just suffering from hindsight bias.<br><br>Also, just to be clear, I agree that much of the criticism against EAs and EA leaders we see in the media is unfairly exaggerated. I'm wary of contributing to what I perceive as others unjustly piling-on a movement of moral activists, probably fueled by do-gooder derogation, and so on (as Geoffrey mentions <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/b83Zkz4amoaQC5Hpd/time-article-discussion-effective-altruist-leaders-were?commentId=CQsebP3yueCgrEiod\">in his comment</a>.)&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn73cesy0xaht\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref73cesy0xaht\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Why have I been so upset?
