So if a certain group of people were asked to be part of the experts in the field then it could become fairly self recommending from there on in, particularly if it were resourced / various benefits flowed from it.  I tend to view this as a bit of an issue within EAA, particularly at both ACE and the Open Philanthropy Project where approaches have a tendency  to not be given equal consideration, instead some are valued highly (particularly those aligned with direct utilitarianism) over others.  </p>\n<p>I think this can then lead to other issues in terms of internal evaluation.  So in-group bias wouldn't be challenged because external evaluation has been devalued.

Effectively I was involved as much as one could be in a charity.\nFortify Health - I was on the research team to pick the intervention + connected the co-founders when one reached out to me + Gave them a seed grant for their first 6 months + helped them in a consulting role ~5 hours a week over those 6 months. Effectively I was like a highly involved board member.</p>\n<p>2) I think this is a huge concern, I generally think EA charities should be aiming to be the highest impact charity in a given field. E.g. a lot of the value of CSH comes from the small chance we can be higher impact than AMF. If CSH for example fell between the effectiveness of GD and AMF, CSH would pretty aggressively try to seek funding outside of the EA community (including GW/OPP). This partly to do with \u201cthe last dollar spent\u201d in poverty likely being pretty high impact (see this post on talent gaps <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1ok/ea_doesnt_have_a_talent_gap_different_causes_have/\">http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1ok/ea_doesnt_have_a_talent_gap_different_causes_have/</a>  for more details). In something like AR, given the funding situation I think the more important consideration would be whether a new charity has a good chance of beating the bottom 25% of charities funded by OPP/ACE.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Qu6NZBy6YuoaHWH25", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "BttBCLccyHbXvjqJW", "postedAt": "2018-06-16T13:21:37.264Z", "postId": "MZPfcHuFZ36HdMy87", "htmlBody": "<p>On what grounds do you expect EAs to have better personal ability?</p>\n<p>Something I've been idly concerned about in the past is the possibility that EAs might be systematically more ambitious than equivalently competent people, and thus at a given level of ambition, EAs would be systematically less competent. I don't have a huge amount of evidence for this being borne out in practice, but it's one not-so-implausible way that EA charity founders might be worse than average at the skills needed to found charities.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "BenMillwood"}}]
