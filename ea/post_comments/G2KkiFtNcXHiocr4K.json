You note that \u201cso is preventing risks from AI\u201d, but preventing such risks seems to be higher impact than extending life. In general, causes vary both in how \u201cspeculative\u201d they are and in what their expected impact is, and EA may be seen as an attempt to have the most impact for varying levels of \u201cspeculativeness\u201d. One could argue that, while the impact of life extension as a cause is relatively high, its \u201cspeculativeness-adjusted\u201d impact is considerably lower \u2014 just like the risk-adjusted return of some financial instruments is low despite having comparatively high expected returns. This may in part explain why it is relatively neglected among EAs.
