I guess because people who are obese are more likely to turn to ASB.</p><p>\"For artificially sweetened beverages, publication bias and residual confounding were indicated\", but \"if publication bias was indicated, we adjusted summary estimates for the bias\". It looks like adjusting for adiposity can be tricky:</p><blockquote><p>Adiposity is likely to confound an association of beverage consumption with type 2 diabetes, particularly in research on artificially sweetened beverages.<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-6\"><sup>6</sup></a>\u2005<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-8\"><sup>8</sup></a>\u2005<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-10\"><sup>10</sup></a>\u2005<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-11\"><sup>11</sup></a>\u2005 Because of imperfect measurement of adiposity in an epidemiological study,<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-36\"><sup>36</sup></a>\u2005 adjustment for adiposity was likely to be insufficient, as discussed previously.<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>\u2005<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-6\"><sup>6</sup></a>\u2005<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-32\"><sup>32</sup></a>\u2005<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-37\"><sup>37\u201341</sup></a>\u2005 Thus, to assess if such residual confounding would be substantial, we performed simulation analysis to examine the influence of the bias.<a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/8/496#ref-42\"><sup>42</sup></a></p></blockquote><p>In addition, to really see if the glycemic load pathway is doing the work, one should control for fat consumption (which I think is what is mostly doing the work).
