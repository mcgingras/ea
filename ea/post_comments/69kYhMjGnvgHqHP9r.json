I donated with Be The Match as well, in March of 2020, which was interesting timing. They actually had to send me to a sister organization called Gift of Life, whose staff was amazing as well.

The call from Be The Match was such a specific call to action:<br>\"You\u2019ve been identified as a possible marrow match for a 57-year-old Male in need of a transplant. The patient\u2019s doctor is trying to determine treatment options as quickly as possible.\" My reaction was basically \"oh my god, of course!\" versus the kidney donation which was more like \"eh this is mildly annoying right now I'll just not\" since there was no single individual being called to my attention.</p><p>Interestingly enough, my experience donating stem cells was so rewarding that it reminded me of my previous attempt at kidney donation, and I restarted that process and donated my kidney later that year.
