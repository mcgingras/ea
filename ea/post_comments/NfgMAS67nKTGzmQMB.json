Most newspapers that I am familiar with give their reporters specified beats (topics that they focus on), to at least some extent, although I think there are also reporters that don't have specific beats. So if there's an important tech story that needs covered, like AI x-risk, some of that is going to be as a replacement for other tech stories and some of that is going to be taken from people who write on pretty much anything. That still might mean more AI present-risk coverage, because it's hard to talk about one without talking about the other, and because there's a lot of other room in tech to take away stories from, but I don't think it's as simple as it appears.</p><p>However, I'm basing this mostly off info from newspapers that wouldn't write important AI x-risk stories.

Alice probably thinks that a lot of their beliefs are utterly nuts. But it\u2019s pretty plausible that she sees them as kinda \u201con her side\u201d from a vibes perspective. (Hmm, actually, also imagine this is 20 years ago; I think there\u2019s been something of a tribal split between pro-tech environmentalists and anti-tech environmentalists since then.) So probably Alice would probably make somewhat diplomatic statements, emphasizing areas of agreement, etc. Maybe she would say <i>\u201cI think they have the right idea about deforestation and many other things, although I come at it from a more scientific perspective. I don\u2019t think we should take the Gaia idea too literally. But anyway, everyone agrees that there\u2019s an environmental crisis here\u2026\u201d</i> or something like that.</p><p>In your demon example, imagine someone saying <i>\u201cI think it\u2019s really great to see so many people questioning the narrative that the police are always perfect. I don\u2019t think demonic possession is the problem, but y\u2019know why so many people keep talking about demonic possession? It\u2019s because they can see there\u2019s a problem, and they\u2019re angry, and they have every right to be angry because there is in fact a problem. And that problem is police corruption\u2026\u201d</i>.</p><p>So finally back to the AI example, I claim there\u2019s a strong undercurrent of \u201cThe people talking about AI x-risk, they <i>suck</i>, those people are not on my team.\u201d And if there <i>wasn\u2019t </i>that undercurrent, I think most of the x-risk-doesn\u2019t-exist people would have at worst mixed feelings about the x-risk discourse. Maybe they be vaguely happy that there are all these new anti-AI vibes going around, and they would try to redirect those vibes in the directions that they believe to be actually productive, as in the above examples: <i>\u201cI think it\u2019s really great to see people across society questioning the narrative that AI is always a force for good and tech companies are always a force for good. They\u2019re absolutely right to question that narrative; that narrative is wrong and dangerous! Now, on this specific question, I don\u2019t think future AI x-risk is anything to worry about, but let\u2019s talk about AI companies stomping on copyright law\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>Very different vibe, right? Much less aggressive trashing of AI x-risk than what we actually see from some people.</p><p>To be clear, in a perfect world, people would ignore vibes and stay on-topic and at the object level, and Alice would just straightforwardly say \u201cMy opinion is that Gaia is pseudoscientific nonsense\u201d instead of sanewashing it and immediately changing the subject, and ditto with the demon person and the other imaginary people above. I\u2019m just saying what often happens in practice.</p><p>Back to your example, I think it\u2019s far from obvious IMO that the number of articles about police corruption are going to go down <i>in absolute numbers</i>, although it obviously goes down <i>as a fraction of police articles</i>. It\u2019s also far from obvious IMO that this situation will make it harder rather than easier to get anti-corruption laws passed, or to fundraise.</p>", "parentCommentId": "L2sP3imwiRYg553h3", "user": {"username": "steve2152"}}, {"_id": "FxnHEhrngYHRtYqTn", "postedAt": "2023-09-25T20:51:13.542Z", "postId": "NfgMAS67nKTGzmQMB", "htmlBody": "<p>That might be true in the very short term but I don\u2019t believe it in general.

In fact, I think that the speech you wrote for the police reformer is probably the best way to advance the police corruption cause in that situation, with one change: they should be very clear that they don't think that demons exist.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there is an aspect where the AI risk skeptics don't want to be too closely associated with ideas they think are wrong: because if the AI x-riskers are<i> proven</i> to be wrong, they don't want to go down with the ship. IE: if another AI winter hits, or an AGI is built that shows no sign of killing anyone, then everyone who jumped on the x-risk train might look like fools, and they don't want to look like fools (for both personal and cause related reasons).&nbsp;</p><p>I think there definitely is an aspect of \"<i>AI x-risk people suck</i>\", but I worry that casting it as a team sports thing makes it seem overly irrational. When Timnit Gebru says that AI x-risk people suck, she's saying they are <i>net negative</i>: they do far more harm in promoting the incorrect x-risk idea and the actions they take (for example, helping start openAI) than they do incidental good in raising AI ethics awareness. You might think this belief is wrong, but the resulting actions make perfect sense, given this belief.&nbsp;</p><p>To modify the Gaia example, it'd be like if the Gaia people were trying to block all renewable energy building because it interrupted the chakras of the earth, and also loudly announcing that an earth spirit will become visible to the whole planet in 5 years. Yes, they are objectively increasing attention to your actual cause, but debunking them is still the correct move here. They've moved from on your team to not on your team because of objective object level disagreements over what beliefs are true and what actions should be taken.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "h7qg93TyNGEWGqtCy", "user": {"username": "titotal"}}]
