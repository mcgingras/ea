I can send you a copy if you like, but I attached my full CV to it, so I don\u2019t want to publish it in its current form.</p>\n<p>The idea is to replicate the established model of such a SaaS provider but to convince companies to only match employee donations to highly effective charities to incentivize effective giving. Additionally, the management of the clients of such a provider will be in a perfect position to convey the idea of EA to their employees, so my idea was to add an EA outreach consulting service to the portfolio of the hypothetical SaaS provider.</p>\n<p>CSR can take the form of shared value, risk management, corporate philanthropy, and possibly some mixed forms. Such a SaaS provider could add little benefit for the company if it already runs a shared value scheme, but in the other cases, especially in the last, an EA matching gifts scheme would add value to CSR that focuses on such goals as attracting talent or improving public perception. Especially since a common criticism leveled against CSR is that it is often self-serving and hence unfocused and nontransparent about its impact, such a program would enable a company to distinguish itself from other companies that engage in CSR.</p>\n<p>My current plan is not to start such a SaaS provider, or not as a first option, but rather to first reach out to the existing providers of such software worldwide and ask whether they would be ready to use their position and leverage to approach their existing corporate clients and promote the same scheme themselves. With the help of AMF, I\u2019ve compiled a list of ten more or less large providers. If this is close to what Charity Science would be interested in pursuing, then I\u2019d be delighted to collaborate with you!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Telofy"}}, {"_id": "wsx9XCZcgNk4mL4Ew", "postedAt": "2015-01-26T12:28:04.847Z", "postId": "FzbdRr3uGEnHkyypi", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree with this.
