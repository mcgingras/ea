The flaw of averages is the idea that systematic errors &nbsp;occur when we base calculations on the average (expected value) of uncertain inputs, rather than the entire distribution of possible inputs.&nbsp;</p><p>So when in your formula you use <strong>i (average impact potential of participants)</strong>, that seems like a potentially major oversimplification of the reality that you might see a wide range of impact potentials within a certain intervention. Relying on averages in this way is known to actually mislead decision making (fields like risk management need to pay attention to this, a specific example is <a href=\"https://www.probabilitymanagement.org/climate-change\">flood damage</a> modeling, but it crops up all over the place).</p><p>For a simple example: say you are doing a fundraiser targeting students and parents (I'm using $ because it's easy to quantify and understand). You expect to reach 90 students and only 10 parents. You expect the likelihood increase for making a donation for students is 0.8, and the likelihood increase for donations from parents is 0.4.</p><p>The vast majority of participants are students, so you &nbsp;decide to classify your \"average giver\" as a student (since student vs parent are discrete categories). Having decided that the \"average\" target of the fundraiser is other students, you predict that the average participant who makes a donation will give $10. So if you convince 100 people to donate, by the formula, your expected value is $10*100*0.8=$800. Your predicted average donation is $8.</p><p>However, the reality is a bit different, because maybe your fundraiser reaches 90 students and 10 parents. Parents in this scenario have much greater disposable income, such that the parents who donate will &nbsp;each give $100. So now, &nbsp;your expected value is &nbsp;$10*90*0.8+$100*10*0.4=$1,120. Your actual average donation is now $11.2 per person, which is a 40% increase over your predicted average donation.</p><p>This is a simplified/exaggerated example of how heavy tailed distributions (which can be thought of as the technical term for black swan events) can distort statistics. Quantities like income and wealth are heavy tailed in reality. I think you could make the case that actual impact as an outcome (vs impact potential) is heavy tailed as well. Open Philanthropy seems to agree with this based on their <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/hits-based-giving/\">Hits-based Giving</a> approach. &nbsp;And you actually mention that &nbsp;the\"Open Phil Survey uses an impact scale of four orders of magnitude between people working on longtermist causes\".&nbsp;</p><p>\"The problem with observations or events from a heavy tail is that even though they are frequent enough to make a difference, they are rare enough to make us underestimate them in our experience and intuitions.\" This article \"<a href=\"https://michelfeit.medium.com/heavy-tails-and-altruism-when-your-intuition-fails-you-15a8b2b7299c\">Heavy Tails and Altruism: When Your Intuition Fails You</a>\" has more detail on the topic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Maybe your formula could allow for summation of different projected classes of participants? This could help it account for lower-likelihood/lower frequency, but higher-impact-potential participants. Since interventions could vary significantly in terms of relevance of these \"black swans,\" accounting for them seems important to me. You may be hinting at this approach in your explanation of example 2.</strong></p><p>Given that we care more about actual impact than impact potential, I personally feel pretty cautious about promoting a movement-wide approach to community building that might limit creativity/innovation/experimentation, and that potentially favors narrowing down over broadening outward.</p><p>P.S. - I want to acknowledge that it's much easier to critique other people's work than to attempt something from scratch. So I also wanted to thank you for writing this up and sharing it! I like the overall idea, enjoyed learning about the existing approaches thanks to your research, and appreciate you working on community building so thoughtfully.

One intuition that helps me is to think about the donors who donate toward community building efforts. I expect that these donors are mostly people who care about preventing kids from dying of malaria, and many donors also donate lots of money towards charities that can save a kid\u2019s like for $5000. They are, I assume, donating toward community building efforts because they think these efforts are on average a better deal, costing less than $5000 for a live saved in expectation.</p>\n<p>For mental health reasons, I don\u2019t think people should generally hold themselves to this bar and be like \u201cis my expected impact higher than where money spent on me would go otherwise?\u201d But I think when you\u2019re using other peoples altruistic money to community build, you should definitely be making trade offs, crunching numbers, and otherwise be aiming to maximize the impact from those dollars.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I would be extremely worried if I learned that community builders aren\u2019t attempting to quantify their impact or think about these things carefully (noting that I have found it very difficult to quantify impact here). Community building is often indistinguishable (at least from the outside) from \u201cspending money on ourselves\u201d and I think it\u2019s reasonable to have a super high bar for doing this in the name of altruism.</p>\n<p>Noting again that I think it\u2019s hard to balance mental health with the whacky terrible state of the world where a few thousand dollars can save a life. Making a distinction between personal dollars and altruistic dollars can perhaps help folks preserve their mental health while thinking rigorously about how to help others the most.
