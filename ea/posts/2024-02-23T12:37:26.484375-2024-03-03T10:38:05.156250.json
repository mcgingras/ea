I found this to cover some ground that wasn't present in the </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d9bamQHBAwAjuKtNA/alvea-s-story-wins-and-challenges-unofficial\"><i>Alvea postmortem</i></a><i>.</i></p><hr><h2>Excerpts</h2><blockquote><p>The caricature is that the FDA is the enemy of progress, medical regulators are the enemy of progress, and they're slowing everything down. On reflection, I don\u2019t agree with that take, and our experience doesn\u2019t really support it [...]</p><p>In drug development especially, making a thing that is plausibly good is much, much easier than making something that is actually, reliably, very good. Deploying drugs to scale requires that reliability.</p><p>It\u2019s a very hard socio-technical problem. All the different kinds of regulatory requirements, quality management, quality control, etc., that could be naively identified as red tape or boring paperwork that slow down the innovators are actually there to achieve that reliability.</p><p>Of course, when you get into the details, there are tons of ways this could be done more efficiently. But the fact that validation, testing, and ensuring that things are as they seem is 90% of the process is just the way the world works, not any fault of the regulators.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When you work with any vendor for a pharmaceutical company, almost everybody requires an NDA to be signed. This by itself can eat up to two weeks of time on both ends of this transaction. We had automated this NDA signing process so that it would usually happen in hours. Many of our vendors would follow up and tell us how insanely fast this was and how it was the smoothest and fastest contracting experience that they had ever had.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Another big pattern is that, for some reason, for a lot of these key processes that really move the needle on speed, the standard operating procedure for the industry is to talk to maybe three to five different vendors, compare them across a bunch of categories, and then pick one and go forward with them. That never seemed to work for us. We would approach it by finding every single vendor in the world who does the thing that we need done, finding the best people, and then going in and very closely redesigning and managing their process for maximum speed. Practically, this involves parallelization and then bottleneck hunting in the vendor\u2019s process to identify ways to make it faster.</p><p>A good example of that was the manufacturing of the drug itself, of the DNA plasmid that was our vaccine\u2019s main active component. Our initial quotes from the first few vendors were like two years. \u201cIt takes two years. There is no way around that. This is just how long it takes.\u201d Then we found some folks who said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard, but we can do it in a year.\u201d Then, once we have come in and looked at it deeply and redesigned it in collaboration with these folks, we ended up doing it in just over two months if memory serves.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "aarongertler"}}, {"_id": "eCAxw3EjuShi8eAt7", "title": "Open roles at 80,000 Hours: Operations team", "postedAt": "2024-03-03T00:51:39.149Z", "htmlBody": "<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1><p>Our operations team exists to build the organisation and systems that keep 80,000 Hours on track to achieve our <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/about/\">mission</a> of getting talented people working on the world\u2019s most pressing problems.</p><p>Over the next year, we\u2019re spinning out of <a href=\"https://ev.org/\">Effective Ventures</a>, our fiscal sponsor.

My main source of frustration wasn't just seeing EA being interpreted uncharitably, it was that the seeds for this criticism were sewn long before SBF and OpenAI became known entities.</p><p>EA's culture of ideological purity and (seemingly <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/q2M9DDoogZGTJjQbg/revisiting-ea-s-media-policy\">intentional</a>) obfuscation from the public sets itself up for backlash. Not only is this unfortunate relative the movement's good intentions, it's strategically unsound. EA fundamentally is in the business of public advocacy. It should be aiming for more than resilience against PR crises. As I say in the piece:</p><blockquote><p>The point of identifying and cultivating a new cause area is not for it to remain a fringe issue that only a small group of insiders care about. The point is that it is paid attention to where it previously wasn't.</p></blockquote><p>The other thing that's frustrating is that what I'm asking for is not for EA to entertain some race-to-the-bottom popularity contest. It's an appeal to respect human psychology, to use time-tested techniques like visualization and story telling that are backed by <a href=\"https://rene.kizilcec.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/final_version2.pdf\">evidence</a>. There are ways to employ these communications strategies without reintroducing the irrationalities that EA prides itself on avoiding, and without meaningfully diminishing the rigorousness of the movement.</p><p>On a final personal note:&nbsp;</p><p>I feel a tremendous love-hate relationship with EA. Amongst my friends (none of which are EAs despite most being inordinately altruistic) I'm slightly embarrassed to call myself an EA. There's a part of me that is allergic to ideologies and in-group dynamics. There's a part of me that's hesitant of allying myself with a movement that's so self-serious and disregarding of outside perceptions. There's also a part of me that feels spiteful towards all the times EA has soft and hard rejected my well-meaning attempts at participation (case-in-point, I've already been rejected from the comms job I wrote this post to support my application for). And yet, I keep coming back to EA because, in a world that is so riddled with despair and confusion, there's something reaffirming about a group of people who want to use evidence to do measurable good. This unimpeachable trait of EA should be understood for the potential energy it wields amongst many people like myself that don't even call themselves EAs. Past any kind of belabored point about '<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SjK9mzSkWQttykKu6/big-tent-effective-altruism-is-very-important-particularly\">big tent</a>' movements, all I mean to say is that EA doesn't need to be so closed-off. Just a little bit of communications work would go a long way.</p><p>Here's a teaser video I made to go along with the essay:</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/a7rSuOEuUFA\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a7rSuOEuUFA\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"></span></span>", "user": {"username": "blehrer"}}, {"_id": "zsxSdvKnLFLbrf3bJ", "title": "Announcing The Prediction Post", "postedAt": "2024-03-02T04:58:41.217Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>About The Prediction Post</h1><p><a href=\"https://thepredictionpost.substack.com/\">The Prediction Post</a> is a daily digest of news headlines accompanied by relevant prediction markets.

I enjoy the job well enough as I like being outside and using my body, and rationally I know that what I am doing is good for the world. However, nothing occupies my mind and heart more than big data's threat on privacy, the seemingly unmitigated effect that certain technologies are having on children's mental health and development, and surveillance capitalism's exploitation of autonomy and dignity.</p><p>The impulse to do something about the latter (admittedly a broad spectrum) keeps me up at night, even though I know that I am spending my days doing something that is good for the world, and potentially more effective than a role I could re-train for in some kind of tech policy job. Like I said, I enjoy my current job, and I do find it fulfilling (at least rationally so), but, strangely, combatting the climate crisis does not light a fire in me the way combating technological disruption does.</p><p>So my question is, have any of you grappled with this dilemma before?

I\u2019m confident that it will continue to be passed - in a roughly similar form -&nbsp; for the foreseeable future. The current version was passed in 2019 under a Republican senate and is due for reauthorisation in 2025.</p><p>Since the Obama Presidency, there\u2019s Republicans have begun to try to prevent bills proposed by Democrats from being passed by default. This is particularly easy for non-spending bills since for non-spending bills, 60 votes are needed to break the filibuster - a method used to prevent bills from being voted on - in the Senate. However, not only are defence bills consistently bipartisan, they have consistently high degrees of support from Republicans in particular. Therefore, I\u2019m not concerned about the DPA not being passed by a Republican senate and a Democratic President when it's next due for reauthorisation.&nbsp;</p><p>The DPA gives the President very wide-ranging powers since the goal of the act of the act is to ensure that the US industrial base is strong enough to fight and win any war the US might need to undertake. Concretely, this allows the President to instruct firms to accept contracts; incentive expansion of the industrial base; and a grab bag of other specific provisions aimed at making sure that the US production base is strong enough to win a war.</p><p>Until 1953 the act was much more powerful and essentially allowed the President to take control of the US economy. The act now doesn\u2019t give the President authority to set wage or price ceilings, control consumer credit or requisition stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Antitrust provisions</strong></p><p>Various AI governance proposals rely on explicit, voluntary agreements between leading AI labs. For instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/coordinated-pausing-evaluation-based-scheme\"><u>this</u></a> paper proposes a scheme in which AI firms agree to pause the rollout out and training of large models if one doesn\u2019t pass an evaluation which indicates that it could act dangerously. I think it\u2019s plausible that this agreement would be illegal under antitrust law. An agreement like this would be an explicit agreement amongst a small number of leading firms to limit supply.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This skirts pretty close to being a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/antitrust-resource-manual-1-attorney-generals-policy-statement#:~:text=Per%20Se%20Rule%3A%20Price%20fixing,se%E2%80%9D%20unreasonable%20restraints%20of%20trade.\"><u>criminal violation of US antitrust law</u></a>.

A West Virginia coal plant, for example, only considers the cost of fuel and electricity, not the cost of air pollution which accrues to people living in the surrounding mountain hollers.</p><p>In situations like this, West Virginians would be willing to pay coal mines to produce less and save them from the smog, but it is too costly to coordinate as a large group. These coordination frictions sully the conclusions of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics\"><u>fundamental theorems of welfare economics</u></a> and drain value from the economy.</p><p>This is an uncontroversial example of the phenomenon of market failure, but the <i>idea</i> of market failure is more susceptible to motte-and-bailey strategies.</p><p>Here is the most common and easily defensible motte: Define \u201cthe idea of market failure\u201d to be the claim that markets are not perfect; that there are &gt; 0 market failures. This claim is true, and anyone who denies it plants themselves on the far left side of the mid-wit meme.</p><p>There are imperfections in every market and there are many markets with massive externalities. All the econ 101 examples are correct. Pollution, traffic, science and invention all impose costs and benefits that are difficult to trade onto people who are difficult to transact with. It is important to identify and understand these failures.</p><p>But when market failure is taught in econ classes or wielded in policy, the idea reclaims the bailey: markets are not perfect, therefore governments are capable of consistently improving them using taxes, subsidies, rules and regulations. The concept of market failure is never taught without using it to study and justify government intervention in markets, implicitly or explicitly defining the government as a \u201csocial welfare maximizer.\u201d</p><p>It is this idea, that the imperfection of markets is easily improved by government intervention, that Milei is imploring us not to endorse.</p><h2>Governments don\u2019t automatically care about market failures</h2><p>Lets return to our mountain town in West Virginia. We know there\u2019s a market failure here: too much coal burning and too much of the smog it produces. On our econ homework we would call for a tax on coal producers to add the social cost of pollution into the coal plant\u2019s optimization problem.</p><p>But look at West Virginia in the real world. They are full of coal plants pumping out ash without any extra tax bill. In fact, the coal industry in West Virginia is <a href=\"https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/eliminate-west-virginia-met-coal-subsidy-to-assist-dislocated-coal-workers/\"><u>subsidized</u></a> <a href=\"https://mountainstatespotlight.org/2024/01/25/coal-tax-down-wind-tax-up/\"><u>and</u></a> <a href=\"https://governor.wv.gov/News/press-releases/2023/Pages/Gov.-Justice-signs-four-coal-related-bills-at-John-Amos-Power-Plant-in-Putnam-County.aspx\"><u>protected</u></a> by the state. All economists agree that coal plants have massive negative externalities that could be corrected with an optimal tax. Governments have lots of control over energy production and taxes, more than enough to implement this correction. Instead, they use their control to protect and expand the coal industry at deadly expense to many West Virginians.</p><p>This isn\u2019t at all unique to West Virginia. The US doesn\u2019t have a carbon tax. The German Green party shuts down its nuclear power plants in favor of coal. Environmental permitting regulations make it easier to frack for gas than geothermal and easier to set up offshore oil rigs than offshore wind farms. Europe and the US <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fossil-fuel-subsidies?country=Northern+America+%28UN%29~CHN~Europe+%28UN%29\"><u>subsidize their fossil fuel</u></a> industries.</p><p>It\u2019s not unique to pollution or climate change either. Governments <a href=\"https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/r-and-d-is-a-huge-externality-so\"><u>massively underfund research and development</u></a> despite it being the world\u2019s most important positive externality. Governments impose huge negative externalities across borders with tariffs and immigration restrictions. They also ignore <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#Risks_and_debates\"><u>the burden that debt places on future generations</u></a>.</p><p>In general, governments are not social welfare maximizers. They are personal welfare maximizers, just like the firms involved in market failures. More accurately, they are large collections of personal welfare maximizers who are loosely aligned and constrained by lots of internal and external forces.</p><p>Some of these forces improve social welfare, like democracies expanding civil rights and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/famines#democracy-and-oppression\"><u>avoiding famine</u></a>. Others do just the opposite. Powerful lobbying by <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/jones-act-burden-america-can-no-longer-bear\"><u>concentrated interest</u></a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex\"><u>groups</u></a> makes it profitable for legislators to spread out costs a few dollars at a time among millions of unaware voters while the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCQkCyCvk9M\"><u>benefits are concentrated</u></a> a few million dollars at a time among highly motivated rent-seekers. Self-interested local governments <a href=\"https://sfplanning.org/zoning\"><u>tax or ban construction</u></a> in their city as a massive negative-sum <a href=\"https://diegopuga.org/papers/Duranton_Puga_ECMA_2023.pdf\"><u>transfer from disenfranchised migrants</u></a> to landholding voters. Internal bureaucratic career incentives at the FDA <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3quCK79NT3r9tpC6Q/how-many-people-are-in-the-invisible-graveyard-1\"><u>caused tens of thousands of deaths</u></a> during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nationalism among voters and personal power seeking among leaders <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace\"><u>often makes war appealing to governments</u></a>, though it is almost always negative for social welfare.</p><p>The morass of incentives and agents that make up government do not aggregate into a social welfare maximizer.</p><p>Governments are not reliable stewards of social welfare, so identifying imperfections in markets is not enough to consistently improve them. If we want governments to help us correct market failures, we need better ways to monitor, constrain, and incentivize the people inside to do so. This is the true challenge of market failure but the intellectual culture in economics too often obscures it. Once Milei\u2019s fans (and detractors) get past econ 101, I am begging them to get started with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw4xIlFUyMc\"><u>public choice 101</u></a> before they start making policy recommendations that could easily make things worse, even in response to market failure.</p><p>Javier Milei is a politician and he is susceptible to incentives at least as much as anyone else. One of his incentives pulls towards sloganeering and shallow takes that spread quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t endorse the idea of market failure\u201d can be easily interpreted as a shallow rejection of economics, which might be popular, but is false.</p><p>Still though, the automatic connection between identifying a market failure and justifying government intervention in response is worth arguing against. Governments have no inherent incentive to correct market failures and often have incentives to exacerbate them. We can and should work to improve these incentives but that can only happen after we acknowledge the serious failure of the current ones.</p>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "fDYGvji3HwYA8BJwN", "title": "Review of EA Global Bay Area 2024 (Global Catastrophic Risks) ", "postedAt": "2024-03-01T15:16:03.291Z", "htmlBody": "<p>EA Global: Bay Area (Global Catastrophic Risks) took place February 2\u20134.

The previous essays gave some reasons to like wholesomeness, and projected a vibe that it was good. But they didn't really consider tradeoffs.</p><p>This essay turns to that question. It is interested in whether it\u2019s good at the individual level, and especially in whether it's good for communities to adopt a culture of acting wholesomely. Of course I can't think I'm offering the final word on this; instead I'll just give the cases I see on each side, and offer some concluding thoughts.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.12%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/ukibz2chyan5lznrevrk\"></figure><h1>Non-fragility</h1><p>So far, the main benefits of trying to act wholesomely that we\u2019ve discussed relate to a kind of robustness. This is very stark in contrast with an all-in shut-up-and-multiply attitude. The problem there is that calculations are&nbsp;<i>fragile</i>. If you\u2019re doing a lot of calculations, it\u2019s pretty easy to accidentally lose or gain an order-of-magnitude in one of them \u2014 in the calculation itself, or in a bad parameter estimate, or in a confused assumption about the setup. And this can completely change your sense of what\u2019s good or bad.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that that kind of fragility should be alarming when we\u2019re just considering our own actions. If we consider choosing a culture for an entire community, it seems even more concerning. A community where everyone does their own calculations and acts on them is going to include some people haring off in wildly wrong directions \u2014 and some of these will probably be destructive.</p><p>By not relying on the calculations but on a more holistic sense of what\u2019s good, we can keep things more robust. (This is blurring into a purely epistemic virtue; in doing any kind of calculation we may be more likely to catch errors if we keep in touch with a holistic sense of what the calculation is for and roughly how it should come out.)</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.24%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/eevwr1kcgrugnaksspka\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/r4pwp8bknee7wlthiine 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/riafxyzivzdmntx3uqhv 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/icoh0twoyywkin6ku67j 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/zuxahosnyfmu9misiws0 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/geh1bbzhtzt7inwj4wrv 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/ypbvikxlcgsq4lxlz7tn 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/jif16wv6trhsxjc8bgeu 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/uwssx2bkcvlybi4sinuv 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/grwiu2pzy8lg0hbdawbn 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/r9zb1jnbtmnpmmif7t4m 1024w\"></figure><p>The point about fragility is particularly stark for shut-up-and-multiply attitudes, but I think it applies much more broadly. People make mistakes, and then not-infrequently justify these mistakes to themselves \u2014 and to others. I\u2019m sure that a culture focusing on wholesomeness wouldn\u2019t be completely immune to this issue, but I do think that by construction it would be more resistant than most. This is because such a culture would encourage people to keep looking at the uncomfortable things, where issues are arising, and it would be a bit less tolerant of moves of the shape \u201cwell that\u2019s OK because it\u2019s in the service of the greater good\u201d.</p><h1>Social impacts of wholesomeness</h1><h2>Wholesomeness begets wholesomeness</h2><p>I think that the large majority of people would, in their hearts, like things to be wholesome. But it\u2019s much easier to take actions towards wholesomeness when things around you are generally wholesome. Because if there\u2019s a lot of existing unwholesomeness then it\u2019s harder to notice further issues \u2014 they fade into the background, and our emotional tracking of them isn\u2019t so capable. This applies to both the external environment (it\u2019s easier to act wholesomely in environments which don\u2019t contain a lot of unwholesomeness), but also our individual actions (it\u2019s easier for each new action to be wholesome if our actions are generally wholesome, so we can be appropriately sensitive and responsive to subtle feelings of unwholesomeness).</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.11%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/s0pdzecmgeuwrj0abwjl\"></figure><p>The flip side of this is that unwholesomeness can spread \u2014 both because it gets normalized, but also at times in a pretty direct manner. If you have something (significantly) unwholesome which others observe, part of them may feel that they should do something about it. If they don\u2019t, they take some (lesser) unwholesomeness into themselves. This reduces their capacity to notice further unwholesomeness.</p><p>For both of these reasons, if you think that wholesomeness generally leads to good things, you should be a bit more positive on it after accounting for its second-order effects than when you just consider the first-order effects.</p><h2>Wholesomeness waterlines</h2><p>We\u2019ve just seen that existing wholesomeness can make it easier for ourselves and others to further wholesome action, because it makes it easier to notice individual components of unwholesomeness. But there are further social effects. If things are generally wholesome, others are much more likely to notice new unwholesomeness \u2014 and react negatively towards it. So the \u201cwaterline\u201d of wholesomeness in an environment shapes the social incentives present in that environment, determining what types and degrees of unwholesomeness are socially acceptable. And while acting wholesomely can have good direct effects, being seen to act wholesomely can have a different set of effects, via its social impacts.</p><p>The social impacts of personally adopting different levels of tolerance for unwholesomeness depend on the existing waterline in that environment:</p><ul><li>Being much less tolerant of unwholesomeness than the waterline can look like \u2014 and in substance be \u2014 making a fuss over nothing, and is not necessarily productive;</li><li>Acting more wholesomely than typical, and being a bit less tolerant of unwholesomeness than the waterline can help to pull the waterline up;</li><li>Acting a little less wholesomely than typical, and being more tolerant of unwholesomeness than the waterline can pull the waterline down;</li><li>Acting much less wholesomely than the waterline is likely to get socially sanctioned.</li></ul><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.23%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/t73recvbkdbyuoe5c5b8\"></figure><p>So it will generally be correct to behave somewhere in the vicinity of the existing waterlines. The dimensions of how we act and how tolerant we are of other unwholesomeness come apart a bit \u2014 but not altogether, since e.g. ignoring unwholesomeness can itself be unwholesome. To a first approximation I think you can treat the question as \u201cshould one push the waterline a bit higher, or a bit lower?\u201d. Systems where people act with greater degrees of wholesomeness usually function better \u2014 e.g. I think unusually low waterlines of wholesomeness correspond pretty precisely with the notion of systemic corruption. I therefore think the typical answer will be \u201cit\u2019s good to nudge the waterline higher\u201d. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The main potential exception I can think of relates to it being unproductive to push for wholesomeness levels much higher than the waterline. Suppose you are part of a small group, which has various interfaces with broader society. Suppose further that your small group has a much higher waterline than society as a whole. Then it may be that in its interactions with broader society, the small group is in the position of unhelpfully rocking the boat or being perceived as sanctimonious, and if it moderated its impulses towards wholesomeness just a bit, it might more effectively be a force for wholesomeness in the world at large. In this scenario, it\u2019s plausibly better to nudge your small group to have a&nbsp;<i>lower</i> wholesomeness waterline than at present.</p><h2>Sanctimony and tolerance</h2><p>Striving too hard to make things wholesome can veer into sanctimony, and sanctimony is generally unwholesome \u2014 and especially in circumstances where people may freely choose to disassociate with the group.</p><p>At an individual level the biggest problem with pushing too hard to eliminate visible unwholesomeness is that it can instead create invisible unwholesomeness, as the person suppresses parts of the whole of themself which are not seen to be wholesome. On a collective level, the two major mechanisms of harm are (1) inducing this issue on the individual level, and (2) if someone perceives that they are (likely to be) judged to be insufficiently wholesome, they won\u2019t feel comfortable, and may disengage.</p><p>Tolerance is typically a wholesome virtue. It helps people to feel welcome, and it also helps people to be open, and so to avoid voluntary suppression of information (which could lead to further unwholesomeness, as important information might not get tracked by other parts of the system).&nbsp;</p><p>I think we should typically be less tolerant of unwholesomeness in our culture and our institutions than in individuals contributing to things. It\u2019s important to create space for people to be themselves and for that to have elements of unwholesomeness (which is certainly not to say that arbitrary behaviour should be tolerated). It\u2019s less important (but still matters) to have space for organizations with a variety of cultures, some less wholesome than others. It\u2019s less important again for central institutions to tolerate unwholesomeness in their composition (but remains important to tolerate nonzero amounts in their employees).</p><h1>Memetic impacts</h1><h2>Building a good reputation</h2><p>Around things that are wholesome, things work well. People have more good experiences, and more good-feeling toward the system. There are important benefits to these in any cases where we\u2019re building institutions, or culture, or social groups (and a lot of the value of a lot of what I consider to be the most important work factors through these). Therefore there are reasons, if doing such work, to strive to be wholesome, so as to have your wholesomeness shine forth as a kind of deeply true advert for the things you\u2019re doing.</p><p>This speaks in favour of promoting something like \u201cwholesome EA\u201d, as described in the last essay. This is a generalization of the central point explored in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/considering-considerateness-why-communities-of-do-gooders-should-be\"><u>considering considerateness</u></a>; I think that wholesomeness is a broader category than considerateness, and more the proper one to pay attention to. This has to be balanced with not developing a reputation for sanctimony.</p><h2>Avoiding seeming sanctimonious</h2><p>In order not to put people off or make people disengage, it may be important to avoid creating an impression of sanctimony.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"9dbqutzrito\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9dbqutzrito\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9dbqutzrito\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;An impression of sanctimony could drive away people who are worried about being judged; and also people who simply dislike sanctimony.</p><p>Avoiding this impression creates constraints on both substance and messaging. On substance: the standards for welcoming people should likely be \u201cthese people will be clearly positive to have in the community\u201d, not \u201cthese people excel at visible wholesomeness\u201d. On messaging: I\u2019m far from certain, but guess wholesomeness at the individual level should not be too celebrated, lest it create an impression of sanctimony. There is a delicate balancing act here.</p><p>In principle we might be concerned not just about wholesomeness being boring, or risking seeming sanctimonious, but the very idea of wholesomeness being an active turn-off for some audiences. I want to acknowledge this as a possibility \u2014 and also to express my main reaction to it, which is something like \u201cOh, come on!\u201d. I think that if people don\u2019t feel there\u2019s at least something good about trying to act wholesomely, are they really the people that we want to fill our communities with?</p><h2>The need to bring something new</h2><p>If effective altruism had from the start presented itself as \u201cwe just advise that people act wholesomely\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t have gotten very far. Recommendations that people who want to do good should act wholesomely aren\u2019t really new, and aren\u2019t likely to give much value to the audience. Contrast this with many of the more surprising claims of effective altruism, which I think were more memetically fit for a set of ideas to spread.</p><p>This speaks against emphasizing wholesomeness too strongly in introducing people to the ideas of effective altruism. But I don\u2019t think it speaks against discussing it when people start asking how EA ideas should be integrated with all of the other things we care about in our lives.</p><h1>Wholesomeness and visionaries</h1><p>Acting wholesomely involves attending to the whole that is.</p><p>Acting as a visionary involves attending to a whole that isn\u2019t.</p><p>This is a real tension, and is the point that gives me the most hesitance about recommending that cultures should encourage wholesomeness, as I think poor implementations could stifle visionaries. I think that visionaries can be crucial for some important kinds of progress, but that acting as a visionary is importantly different from \u2014 and in tension with \u2014 a focus on acting wholesomely with respect to the existing system.</p><h2>Visionary thought</h2><p>The first tension here is about attention. Leaning into acting wholesomely means spending attention on the things that are around, and making sure that things aren\u2019t out of balance there. But being a good visionary often means throwing this out entirely, and not being fettered by a need to comport with what already exists. I think it may be important that cultures don\u2019t stifle visionaries.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.13%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nm7PxHXYwiK6Kx962/wll7cul58iqoqn7lyl1a\"></figure><p>I do think that this tension is likely navigable. In fact despite the tension, knowing how to act wholesomely may be a very useful skill for visionaries. For in producing a vision it\u2019s not enough to imagine how some things are different \u2014 but to trace through the implications, work out what wouldn\u2019t work as a result, and then envision a way to fix that. So the mental motions of identifying unwholesomeness and addressing it are critical for the visionary; it\u2019s just that the places they need to look for unwholesomeness, and the ways of addressing it, differ.</p><p>My best guess, then, is that the right approach is to encourage wholesomeness \u2014 and also to encourage (some) people to explicitly carve out space to do the visionary thing. Perhaps if they\u2019re spending time on that they should be less pushed than normal towards regular wholesomeness. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s really a tradeoff there (but I\u2019m also not sure there isn\u2019t).</p><h2>Revolutionary action</h2><p>There is a related tension which can come up at the point where people are taking actions to make the world different, aiming at a vision. The actions which comport with the wholeness of what presently exist may differ from the actions which comport with the envisioned wholeness. For example, if you live in a system you believe to be completely unjust you may support revolution and take actions which bolster envisioned power-structures rather than reinforcing existing ones. Or if you thought it would be good if people used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/certificate-of-impact\"><u>certificates of impact</u></a> you might try to act as an early piece in an envisioned ecosystem with well-functioning impact markets, in the hope that by establishing that piece of things you make it easier for others to integrate with the envisioned wholeness (a part of which you have now made real).</p><p>This may look trickier to resolve. It\u2019s not just about attention, but about fundamental differences in what to do. But let\u2019s step back. Don\u2019t look at it as a contest between the wholeness of what presently exists and the wholeness that\u2019s envisioned; look instead at once at the&nbsp;<i>whole</i>&nbsp;<i>of things</i>, which includes both what is and what could be.&nbsp;</p><p>From this perspective I think this is just another case of finding the wholesome action when that action will generate some unwholesomeness. It would be unwholesome to focus just on what exists, and ignore the potential for what could be. But it would also be unwholesome to throw what exists out altogether and focus only on the hoped-for world. Finding the correct balance between these may be tricky (and I think this is an area where well-meaning people sometimes make large and damaging mistakes), but I don\u2019t see a reason to give up on the principle of seeking to act wholesomely \u2014 and on the contrary think that following that principle could help people to navigate these tricky situations wisely.</p><h1>Concluding thoughts</h1><p>Across these essays I\u2019ve centred a concept I hadn\u2019t previously given too much attention to, and suggested that it should be part of our culture. For all this, though, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m suggesting anything radical or even especially new. I\u2019m just giving a different frame which tries to capture things that many people already thought were good. In so doing, I\u2019ve given a possible resolution to the longstanding puzzle of how to relate to the fact that EA is naturally maximizing, and maximization is fraught.</p><p>If I try to imagine EA<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"fexjok4gtm4\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffexjok4gtm4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfexjok4gtm4\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;taking this wholesomeness stuff seriously, my sense is:</p><ul><li>It would be good, and wholesome, for it to have moderate attention; for it to be endorsed as true-but-mostly-boring, and to be brought out sometimes as a lens for considering a puzzling situation, or in conversation if people are confused about when to get off the maximization train.</li><li>If I imagine it going wrong, it's mostly because people stop giving enough attention to what's new and important about EA (being caught up in giving attention to other parts of the whole)<ul><li>This is a real concern, but I think there will be more wholesome ways to navigate it than to not think about the whole of things<ul><li>e.g. Perhaps just being explicit when people are learning about EA that a lot of what it has to offer are perspectives on what's important, and that's what learning should therefore focus on; but that this doesn't mean to forget, when the time comes for action, all that one already knows about doing good</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>It wouldn\u2019t feel wholesome if people made discussion of wholesomeness too front-and-centre.

And we could substitute the welfare range or capacity for welfare for realized welfare here.</p><p>When a given standard is otherwise not met for an individual or system, the corresponding welfare entry would have value 0 (or be empty). Humans plausibly realize more relevant features or functions and otherwise meet more standards than other animals, like more types and sophisticated versions of self-awareness, so other animals would get more 0s in their vectors than humans at any moment. The number of 0s would also, of course, vary across nonhuman animal species. And other animals could in principle meet some standards that humans don\u2019t, so we could have some 0s in entries for which they have nonzero values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that a standard could be met multiple times in a brain, and vary in number across brains, like if there are conscious subsystems (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/do-brains-contain-many-conscious-subsystems\"><u>Fischer, Shriver &amp; St. Jules, 2023</u></a>), and the standard itself could include the method for individuating and counting them (some ideas <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vbhoFsyQmrntru6Kw/do-brains-contain-many-conscious-subsystems-if-so-should-we?commentId%3DpAZtCqpXuGk6H2FgF\"><u>here</u></a>).

However, it need not be the case that they\u2019re mutually exclusive when they do apply, so we could value multiple theories of welfare simultaneously on one view, or value, say, hedonic welfare across multiple hedonic welfare standards simultaneously on another view.</p><p>We could apply some real-valued function f to the vectors, like</p><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n),\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;\">f</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">,</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">,</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">\u2026</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">,</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">n</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p>to obtain a moral value to aggregate and compare.

Each coefficient could be the product of the probability with which we apply the standard (which can sum past 100%) and its weight conditional on applying.</p><p>However, any specific function or set of coefficients would (to me) require justification, and it\u2019s unclear that there can be any good justification. This is effectively the problem of intertheoretic (reason) comparisons. There are probably no or very limited facts of the matter about how to weigh standards against one another. We could find some standards extremely improbable, but still assign them basically <i>any</i>&nbsp;relative moral weight compared to relatively probable ones anyway. For example, if we pick a common standard to compare the others to, it seems arbitrary which and it can have enormous influence under uncertainty about the relative moral weight of the standards (<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/two-envelopes-problem-for-brain-size-and-moral-uncertainty/\"><u>Tomasik, 2013-2018</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/#id-1111-issue-1-normative-uncertainty-and-philosophical-incommensurability\"><u>Karnofsky, 2018</u></a>). We can\u2019t avoid the problem by just being uncertain about which common standard to use.</p><p>I argued in a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/solution-to-the-two-envelopes-problem-for-moral-weights\"><u>previous piece</u></a>&nbsp;for weighing relative to the <i>still vague and uncertain</i> <i>human-relative</i>&nbsp;standard, which we could model as a random variable over the standards. However, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/solution-to-the-two-envelopes-problem-for-moral-weights#Multiple_possible_reference_points\"><u>there are actually also multiple distinct such vague and uncertain human-relative standards</u></a>, not just one, so we\u2019d still have the problem of weighing across them.</p><p>In that case, to weigh across groups of standards with no common scale, another approach to moral uncertainty that doesn\u2019t depend on such arbitrary but important choices may be preferred, like Open Philanthropy\u2019s worldview diversification approach (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/\"><u>Karnofsky, 2018</u></a>), variance voting (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198722274.003.0005\"><u>MacAskill et al., 2020</u></a>), moral parliaments (<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf\"><u>Newberry &amp; Ord, 2021</u></a>), a bargain-theoretic approach (<a href=\"https://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert2255/papers/bargaining-theory-and-MU.pdf\"><u>Greaves &amp; Cotton-Barratt, 2019</u></a>), or the Property Rights Approach (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/property-rights/\"><u>Lloyd, 2022</u></a>). In my view, all of these alternatives are superior because they don\u2019t depend on such apparently arbitrary weights<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2if680p9p9s\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2if680p9p9s\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and are less fanatical, despite the problems with them or cases for weighing across standards based on norms of instrumental rationality. For more discussion of these issues and moral uncertainty, see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198722274.001.0001\"><u>MacAskill et al., 2020</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Credences across standards may barely constrain relative moral weights</h2><p>Suppose chickens and humans respectively met 80% and 100% of the standards by credence, with all uncertainty coming from which standard to apply, not uncertainty about whether they met any particular standard.

Other discussions sometimes weight by some increasing function of degree of sophistication or complexity, sometimes an increasing function of the number of neurons (<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/two-envelopes-problem-for-brain-size-and-moral-uncertainty/\"><u>Tomasik, 2013-2018</u></a>, <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2015/11/various-functional-forms-for-brain.html\"><u>Shulman, 2015</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/net-impact-vegetarianism-factory-farm-suffering-vs-invertebrates-pasture-fields/#R\"><u>Tomasik, 2016-2017</u></a>).

Humans would get extra weight for meeting the standard for having at least 80 billion neurons. And we can imagine other possible moral patients with even more neurons meeting higher standards that humans don\u2019t.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Are there morally important standards humans don\u2019t meet?</h1><p>(This section builds on and is inspired by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/btTeBHKGkmRyD5sFK/open-phil-should-allocate-most-neartermist-funding-to-animal?commentId=Y9udovWnW6K75Jbbz\"><u>this comment by David Mathers</u></a>.)</p><p>However, are there really any morally relevant standards that humans don\u2019t meet worth granting much or any weight?</p><p>The main reason I separate all of the standards is because we haven't settled on what exactly welfare, consciousness or moral patienthood mean, or what they mean seems vague. For many animals or other systems, it will be unclear if they\u2019re moral patients or the degree to which they are moral patients in part because of this uncertainty or vagueness about the standards themselves, not just about what the animals are actually doing. On the other hand, it doesn\u2019t seem uncertain or vague whether or not you \u2014 the reader \u2014 can suffer, because <i>we\u2019re defining what it means to suffer in reference to humans</i>. Adding more neurons or functions or complexity to your brain wouldn\u2019t make it <i>more true</i>&nbsp;that you can suffer, or experience any kind of welfare already accessible to you. This would be like asking whether something is more like water than (liquid) H<sub>2</sub>O is water.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefla77mbonish\"><sup><a href=\"#fnla77mbonish\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We\u2019ve settled on defining water as (liquid) H<sub>2</sub>O. And we\u2019ve settled on defining suffering in reference to humans, but we\u2019re still working out the details. Our revisions will not exclude humans.</p><p>And when I consider chickens, fishes, insects, <i>C. elegans</i>&nbsp;or the Windows Task Manager, my reservations in attributing suffering to them are not because they just need <i>more neurons doing the same things they\u2019re already doing</i>&nbsp;to make it more true that they can suffer. It\u2019s because for some functions that turn out to be necessary for suffering, they either don\u2019t realize them or you\u2019d need to squint to say that they do. It could be only <i>sort of</i>&nbsp;true that they suffer. Neuron counts may serve as an indirect proxy for degrees to which the relevant functions are realized, but I\u2019m skeptical that we should give much weight to standards <i>directly specifying</i>&nbsp;neuron counts, although I\u2019m not sure enough to specify negligible credence and weight to this possibility.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk2uox1r1oif\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk2uox1r1oif\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><p><i>And if</i>&nbsp;we\u2019re weighing across standards (which we may choose not to do), a weighted sum of functions mapping systems to their welfare ranges will increase with neuron counts if any of them are more likely to apply with more neurons and none are less likely to apply with more neurons (or those that are less likely to apply are outweighed by those that are more likely to apply with more neurons). This is true no matter how little weight we give to such standards, as long as it\u2019s nonzero, although their influence will of course decrease with decreasing weight. Even if we aren\u2019t taking a weighted sum, we\u2019d have more reason to prioritize those with more neurons, <i>all else equal</i>, on most plausible approaches to normative uncertainty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It could also be the case that there are different kinds of welfare inaccessible to humans that could be accessible to other animals, aliens or artificial systems, in case they realize some important different functions that we don\u2019t or that we only realize vaguely. We might imagine a type of welfare beyond those I\u2019ve previously outlined, other than hedonic states, felt desires, belief-like preferences and choice-based preferences. Or, we might imagine aliens or AI more sophisticated than us with more sophisticated versions of them, like their own concept of <i>a-suffering</i>, to which they assign moral value. They could assess the degree to which humans can <i>a-suffer</i>&nbsp;at all and find it vague. I suspect this shouldn\u2019t look like them <i>just</i>&nbsp;having more neurons doing the same things in their brains than us or even realizing the same functions more often,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpqfabgfyweo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpqfabgfyweo\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but the arguments don\u2019t seem strong enough to outright dismiss the possibility.</p><p>So, it seems we should grant the possibility that their a-suffering is more important than our suffering. On the other hand, perhaps they <i>only</i>&nbsp;find it vague whether we a-suffer or that there are worthy standards we don\u2019t meet <i>because</i>&nbsp;they don\u2019t have access to our mental states or other valuable mental states that fall short of their concept of a-suffering. If they did, they would directly compare and trade off their a-suffering and human-like suffering intrapersonally without having to weigh them according to different standards. Similarly, if we had access to their a-suffering, we would do the same. We would all then realize there are no important standards humans don\u2019t meet, and we should dismiss such standards <i>now</i>. This seems reasonably likely, but I\u2019m not overwhelmingly confident in it.</p><p>The right response here may be to assign at least a non-negligible probability \u2014 e.g. at least 1% \u2014 to the possibility that there are important standards other beings can meet but humans don\u2019t. And 1% could be too small.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again, none of this is to say that other beings can\u2019t have greater moral weight even if the only valuable standards are standards humans meet. Some beings may have greater welfare ranges or meet the same standards more times than us, whether at a time or over time \u2014 through longer lives or meeting the standards more often.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To better weigh standards humans typically meet but other animals don\u2019t, we can investigate humans with the relevant functions disrupted, whether permanently by brain lesions (brain damage) or temporarily with drugs or transcranial magnetic stimulation (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1990-10.2010\"><u>Bolognini &amp; Ro, 2010</u></a>), although there may be unavoidable confounding with capacities for report between humans and nonlinguistic animals. We could imagine aliens or AI doing the same for standards they meet but we don\u2019t, and without confounding with capacities for report.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn8vjylf9grqc\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref8vjylf9grqc\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;It\u2019s not clear whether the proponents of Attention Schema Theory (AST) would accept the Windows Task Manager as conscious to any degree, because it\u2019s not the fact of just having an attention schema itself that makes a system conscious under AST.

About Dennett, Rothman (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/daniel-dennetts-science-of-the-soul\"><u>2017</u></a>) writes:</p><blockquote><p>He regards the zombie problem as a typically philosophical waste of time. The problem presupposes that consciousness is like a light switch: either an animal has a self or it doesn\u2019t. But Dennett thinks these things are like evolution, essentially gradualist, without hard borders. The obvious answer to the question of whether animals have selves is that they sort of have them. He loves the phrase \u201csort of.\u201d Picture the brain, he often says, as a collection of subsystems that \u201csort of\u201d know, think, decide, and feel. These layers build up, incrementally, to the real thing. Animals have fewer mental layers than people\u2014in particular, they lack language, which Dennett believes endows human mental life with its complexity and texture\u2014but this doesn\u2019t make them zombies. It just means that they \u201csort of\u201d have consciousness, as measured by human standards.</p></blockquote><p>In<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3aIfyl6fO34?list%3DPLY_s7b9LrR8UCcPqL59XuIII68ALjgLt7%26t%3D4597\">&nbsp;<u>this panel discussion</u></a>, Dennett seemed confident that chickens and octopuses are conscious, directly answering that they are without reservation, and \u201cyes\u201d to bees being conscious after hesitation. For bees, he said \u201cconsciousness isn\u2019t an all-or-nothing thing\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s not the light is on or the light is off,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of my confidence, it\u2019s a question of how minimal the consciousness is, and whether it deserves to be called consciousness at all.\"</p><p>And again, Dennett (<a href=\"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2019/00000026/f0020009/art00004\"><u>2019</u></a>):</p><blockquote><p>To appreciate what I see to be Chalmers\u2019 second contribution, we first need to distinguish two different illusions: the malignant theorists\u2019 illusion and the benign user illusion. Chalmers almost does that. He asserts: \u2018To generate the hard problem of consciousness, all we need is the basic fact that there is something it is like to be us\u2019 (2018, p. 49). No, all we need is the fact that we think there is something it is like to be us. Dogs presumably do not think there is something it is like to be them, even if there is. It is not that a dog thinks there isn\u2019t anything it is like to be a dog; the dog is not a theorist at all, and hence does not suffer from the theorists\u2019 illusion. The hard problem and meta-problem are only problems for us humans, and mainly just for those of us humans who are particularly reflective. In other words, dogs aren\u2019t bothered or botherable by problem intuitions. Dogs \u2014 and, for that matter, clams and ticks and bacteria \u2014 do enjoy (or at any rate do not suffer from) a sort of user illusion: they are equipped to discriminate and track only some of the properties in their environment.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, Dennett (<a href=\"https://davidrosenthal.org/Dennett-on-Seeming-to-Seem.pdf\"><u>2018</u></a>, p.168-169) also wrote:</p><blockquote><p>I have long stressed the fact that human consciousness is vastly different from the consciousness of any other species, such as apes, dolphins, and dogs, and this \u201chuman exceptionalism\u201d has been met with little favor by my fellow consciousness theorists.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThoughts are expressible in speech,\u201d he writes (p. 155), but what about the higher-order thoughts of conscious animals? Are they? They are not <i>expressed</i>&nbsp;in speech, and I submit that it is a kind of wishful thinking to fill the minds of our dogs with thoughts of that sophistication. So I express my gratitude to Rosenthal for his clarifying account by paying him back with a challenge: how would he establish that non-speaking animals have higher-order thoughts worthy of the name? Or does he agree with me that the <i>anchoring</i>&nbsp;concept of consciousness, human consciousness, is hugely richer than animal consciousness on just this dimension?</p></blockquote><p>And again in <a href=\"https://tufts.app.box.com/s/20ypcrlllasgz3b54gzxybzygpb83hh8\"><u>2020</u></a>, p.4:</p><blockquote><p>I have claimed that the differences between human consciousness and the consciousness of any other species are so great that they hardly deserve to be called variations of a single phenomenon.

I think it has some interesting lessons for AI Governance researchers.&nbsp;</p><p>Zuboff looks at the twin case studies of Google and Facebook, and argues that their business models are driven by novel \u201csurveillance imperatives\u201d. In this piece, I try to draw lessons from AI Governance researchers from the book, whilst side-stepping a critical examination of the book\u2019s key claims. I do not intend this piece to be a book review.&nbsp;<i>Surveillance Capitalism&nbsp;</i>was released several years ago; there are already excellent book reviews (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/capitalisms-new-clothes-morozov\"><u>Morozov</u></a>) and even a review of reviews by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14614448211019021\"><u>Jansen</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not to say that, given the book\u2019s critical acclaim, we can simply assume its conclusions. There are several key problems with the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Zuboff describes the loss of privacy from targeted advertising in extremely strong, emotive terms (e.g.<span> Facebook users are like abandoned elephant carcasses).</span>&nbsp;<span> But&nbsp;</span>she<a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/capitalisms-new-clothes-morozov\"><u> doesn\u2019t draw a clear line</u></a> between \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d and ordinary (nice) capitalism, which uses data to improve goods/services. So, when Amazon uses Kindle data to recommend books to users, are they being nice capitalists, or evil surveillance capitalists? It\u2019s unclear. Additionally, while the book is almost 700 pages, the<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2019/11/04/book-review-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-the-fight-for-the-future-at-the-new-frontier-of-power-by-shoshana-zuboff/\"><u> policy solutions are pretty thin</u></a>. A couple of pages are dedicated to describing artistic movements. And finally, Zuboff doesn\u2019t seem to engage much with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blaynehaggart.com/2019/02/15/evaluating-scholarship-or-why-i-wont-be-teaching-shoshana-zuboffs-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/\"><u>prior relevant scholarship</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;So in spite of all these problems, why is the book useful for AI Governance researchers?&nbsp;<i>Surveillance Capitalism&nbsp;</i>provides useful (and detailed) case studies into Google and Facebook in the early 2000s. I think this is a useful analogy because of two (fairly independent) reasons:&nbsp;</p><p>(I) similar \u201cBig Tech\u201d firms have significant control over AI Labs;&nbsp;</p><p>(II) today\u2019s AI entrepreneurs have remarkably similar incentives and worldviews to the internet/social pioneers of the 2000s&nbsp;</p><p>Let me outline both.&nbsp;</p><p>I) Big Tech\u2019s Influence Over AI Labs</p><p>Microsoft\u2019s influence over OpenAI was pretty visible in the recent Sam Altman saga (more on this below). The fraction of&nbsp;investment&nbsp;from Microsoft and Amazon into Generative AI is increasing and now exceeds conventional Venture Capital fundraising. Whilst I speak a little about the Altman saga below, I recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/05/1084393/make-no-mistake-ai-is-owned-by-big-tech/\"><u>Merredith Witthaker</u></a>\u2019s piece for a strong formulation of this claim.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps Google/Facebook have relatively less influence than Microsoft or Amazon. Though, perhaps they all fit into a similar reference class of \u2018large technology firms\u2019. So, by studying Google/Facebook in the early 2000s, we can learn how Microsoft/Amazon are likely to direct AI development.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EDCmxs9QpJBSB2hvH/lvn6hieuenwvcsgsptc4\"></p><p>From:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6b47d24-b435-4f41-b197-2d826cce9532\"><u>https://www.ft.com/content/c6b47d24-b435-4f41-b197-2d826cce9532</u></a></p><p>II) AI entrepreneurs and internet pioneers are similar agents</p><p>In addition, AI entrepreneurs and internet pioneers are similar agents, with similar commercial incentives surrounding similar technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, the internet is a useful analogue for AI. Both are described as \u2018general-purpose technologies\u2019 (GPTs).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/efficacy-of-ai-activism-have-we-ever-said-no\"><u>Elsewhere I have argued</u></a> that looking at other GPTs isn\u2019t a very useful way to make analogies to AI development. Many GPTs had very different incentives behind their development: for example, there was&nbsp;no paleolithic Sam Altman who pioneered the domestication of animals. Instead, I think the salient facts about AI development are that: (I) there are strong commercial and geopolitical incentives driving its development. Similar incentives were at play for Google and Facebook in the early 2000. Google\u2019s revenue was almost&nbsp;<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-long-took-google-reach-152710274.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALD4kQk-rRL_uVQCw0EBk4vo4qFo-GdD2OZ5KkHURZV6qkHUeSCscjrBCYC3zmxoMNsDTqYQCCuRL_KOxuNFfLTzvSRp5_yQyfqklXDzHnpSEvXIWyLUCEqQho_lKVaAjHjwmJ06yLW8fjLY0ZmpUOQ8vOe2FUNLHKCjZ0XD6lIl#\"><u>$1 billion in 2003</u></a>. Security services became particularly interested in the internet as a strategic asset after 9/11 (see below).&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, AI developers and internet pioneers had similar worldviews. Today\u2019s developers often describe the emergence of AI as an inevitability.&nbsp;Mustafa Suleyman\u2019s book describes AI development as \u201cThe Coming Wave\u201d. In an interview with the Economist, Sam Altman suggested \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcXzmO8zOLg\"><u>there\u2019s no \u201cmagic red button\u201d to stop AI</u></a>\u201d. As described by Zuboff, \u201cinevitabilism\u201d was also prominent amongst the executives of the nascent internet. For example, former Google Executives, Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen write \u201csoon everyone on Earth will be connected\u201d, so warned against \u201cbemoaning the inevitable\u201d. Mark Zuckerberg described Facebook\u2019s/Meta\u2019s mission in evolutionary terms: the next phase of social evolution will be a \u201cglobal community,\u201d facilitated by Facebook.</p><p>Further, AI developers envision AI development as potentially heralding utopia, notwithstanding existential risk. (Interestingly, inevitability rhetoric seems to be a general feature of modern utopianism.)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"taarot45ead\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftaarot45ead\"><sup><a href=\"#fntaarot45ead\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond\"><u>OpenAI\u2019s mission statement imagines</u></a> a utopian future \u201ca world where all of us have access to help with almost any cognitive task\u201d.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-says-could-help-213315216.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAh_ziotrj7qlGNSHWiyx9R9JA9fKAQF1CwtAUm2hTUJvY2-CB9OMFwEcd2BmA-Nh6yAM1qpchS0-EvWdotjAZC5w0U8urJrn3gk1u7eCqWPV2jRRkP1igc0hPPGzoT3YaQi_H3Yf9u29cQQi22Pjg02StCeRv2IloWfBqlv62sg\"><u>Satya Nadella</u></a> describes the default scenario of continued AI development simply: \u201cit\u2019s utopia\u201d. Zuboff describes the same worldviews for Facebook/Google executives.&nbsp;Eric Schmidt argues, \u201cTechnology is now on the cusp of taking us into a magical age\u201d; Larry Page suggests&nbsp;future society will enjoy total \u201cabundance\u201d; and&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg wrote \u201ca lot more of us are gonna do what today is considered the arts\u201d.</p><p>Even if you don\u2019t believe that \u201cBig Tech\u201d firms have any significant control over AI, it seems difficult not to agree that today\u2019s AI entrepreneurs are similar agents in similar circumstances to the internet/social media pioneers. Overall, therefore, I expect that studying Facebook/Google should yield some useful lessons for how AI development will unfold \u2013&nbsp;as directed by AI developers, or \u201cBig Tech\u201d. Hopefully, this qualitative research provides a useful complement to existing quantitative research on AI competition (e.g. from Armstrong et al.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-015-0590-y\"><u>here</u></a>). (Another interesting question is whether private surveillance contributes to suffering risks, or risks from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/40615/chapter-abstract/348242235?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"><u>stable totalitarianism</u></a>.

Please leave comments if you believe I have made any oversights.&nbsp;</p><h1>A) Aspirational Tech Companies Have Slippery Business Models</h1><p>Zuboff argues that asking Google to start honoring consumer privacy is \u201clike asking Henry Ford to make each Model T by hand or asking a giraffe to shorten its neck.\u201d We should be skeptical of this maximalist rhetoric.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"fxhlnwiunk5\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffxhlnwiunk5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfxhlnwiunk5\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, a weaker version of Zuboff\u2019s claim \u2013 e.g. financial pressures provide strong incentives for technology companies to move towards certain business models \u2013 is plausible. The case study of Google in the early 2000s is particularly clear.&nbsp;</p><p>Google was founded with aspirational intentions: early Google executives believed the internet technology would bring about a techno-utopia (see above). The motto \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d, which later formed part of Google\u2019s Corporate Code of Conduct, had its roots in the early 2000s: according to&nbsp;Google employee&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-16-n55.html\">Paul Buchheit</a>, the slogan was \"a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies \u2026 who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent\".</p><p>For the first couple years after its founding August 1998, Google\u2019s revenues came from mainly from licensing deals&nbsp;\u2013 providing web services to Yahoo! or BIGLOBE \u2013 with&nbsp;modest revenue from sponsored ads linked to keywords in searches. Competitors like Overture and Inktomi had different models, and allowed advertisers to pay for high-ranking listings. Founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page seemed opposed to an advertising-funded business model: in their seminar 1998 paper which introduced the concept of the internet,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/19/is-googles-domination-of-the-internet-finally-over-search-me#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20expect%2C%E2%80%9D%20they%20wrote,is%20transparent%20and%20in%20the\"><u>they wrote</u></a>,&nbsp;\"We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers... it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.\"&nbsp;</p><p>What changed? Zuboff identifies the dot-com crash (March 2000) as a key turning point. According&nbsp;to one commentator,&nbsp;\"The VCs were screaming bloody murder\": Google was running out of cash. In response, Google\u2019s founders tasked AdWords (the predecessor to Google Ads) with ways of increasing revenue. Brin and Page hired Eric Schmidt as CEO to pivot towards profit via a&nbsp;\u201cbelt-tightening\u201d program. The outcome? Targeting advertising. Instead of linking adverts to keywords, AdWords linked adverts to users, with&nbsp;pricing depending upon the ad\u2019s position on the search results page and the likelihood of clicks.&nbsp;</p><p>Zuboff\u2019s explanation here is slightly unclear.&nbsp;She wants to be analytical in describing the influence of \u201cimperatives\u201d of surveillance capitalism on Google, but a<a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/capitalisms-new-clothes-morozov\"><u>s noted elsewhere</u></a>, her writing sometimes seems descriptive or tautological. &nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"6d5xim95wta\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6d5xim95wta\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6d5xim95wta\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Again, however, Zuboff\u2019s argument can be saved by being watered down slightly. A more general interpretation here could be that without the Dot-Com Crash, it is less likely that Google would have transitioned to targeted advertising, or that any transition would have occurred later. So, the overall story is a large digital company moving away from the aspiration intentions of its founders, based on financial realities.&nbsp;</p><p>Does this sound familiar?&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 by Sam Altman and a group of Silicon Valley investors, including Elon Musk. However, by 2019,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/21/inside-openais-weird-governance-structure\"><u>only around a tenth&nbsp;</u></a>of the initial $1bn pledged had materialized. OpenAI needed more capital. So in 2019, it created a capped-for-profit subsidiary (OpenAI LP)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp\"><u>in order to&nbsp;</u></a>attract top AI talent and increase its compute investments.&nbsp;<span>OpenAI\u2019s techno-utopian \u201cmission\u201d, a word that appears 14 times in the announcement post, features front and center: \u201c</span>ensuring the creation and adoption of safe and beneficial AGI for all\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI\u2019s move towards commercialisation had significant knock-on effects during the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23967223/sam-altman-returns-ceo-open-ai\"><span><u>Sam Altman Saga</u></span></a><span> of November 2023.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;(For those who are somehow unaware, Altman was fired as CEO of OpenAI for not being&nbsp;<span>\u201cconsistently candid\u201d; after backlash from workers and investors, Altman was reinstated 5 days later).&nbsp;</span></p><p>Firstly, OpenAI\u2019s commercialisation gave significantly more influence to Microsoft. Microsoft had committed to invest $13 billion into Microsoft, which OpenAI had likely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/technology/openai-microsoft-altman-nadella.html\"><span><u>received a fraction</u></span></a> of by November.&nbsp;Microsoft used this pending investment as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/12/11/the-inside-story-of-microsofts-partnership-with-openai\"><u>leverage</u></a> to call for Altman\u2019s reinstatement.<span> Additionally, from 2019 Microsoft possessed rights to OpenAI\u2019s intellectual property for pre-AGI technology. Given this IP control, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could credibly recreate OpenAI within Microsoft.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Secondly,&nbsp;</span>commercialisation of OpenAI gave its employees more financial interest in higher profitability \u2013&nbsp;OpenAI started giving stock-options to employees. By the 6th of November 2023,&nbsp;738 out of OpenAI\u2019s around 770 employees&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-staff-walk-protest-sam-altman/\"><u>had signed an open letter</u></a> demanding Altman\u2019s return.&nbsp;<span>It seems like loyalty to Altman\u2019s leadership and OpenAI\u2019s mission were important contributors. However, financial incentives likely also played some role.&nbsp;</span>OpenAI was in discussion to sell existing employees\u2019 shares at an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-18/openai-is-in-talks-to-sell-shares-at-an-86-billion-valuation\"><u>$86 billion valuation</u></a>.<span> \u200b\u200b</span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-staff-loyalty-power-chatgpt-microsoft-2023-11?r=US&amp;IR=T\"><span><u>As one OpenAI staffer posted</u></span></a><span>, \"Everyone knew that their money was tied to Sam. They acted in their best interest.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The commercialisation of OpenAI in 2019 seems to have had a significant counterfactual impact on Altman\u2019s reinstatement as CEO, and the subsequent restructuring of OpenAI\u2019s independent board. In contrast, i</span>n conversations, EAs seem to emphasize different contingent factors. Perhaps the key problem was the Board\u2019s \u201cPR\u201d, and if only they had publicly explained what not being \u201cconsistently candid\u201d actually meant. Or perhaps it was down to bad corporate design. Both factors seem plausible. But, the \u2018inside view\u2019 should also include the historical influence of OpenAI\u2019s move towards commercialisation in 2019. (This is in no way a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/24/1215015362/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-fired-explained\"><u>new</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/09/technology/openai-altman-inside-crisis.html\"><u>point</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>The more novel point I wish to make is that OpenAI\u2019s corporate restructuring is not unprecedented for a technology firm founded with aspirational goals. Financial pressures pushed Google towards targeted advertising. I\u2019m not entirely sure what follows from this. Google only constitutes a reference class of 1. Perhaps the more general pattern is that, for companies with quasi-utopian goals, the ends can justify the means: major, unintended changes in direction are necessitated by the broader benefits for all of humanity. If this is true, and if existing corporate structures (e.g. OpenAI\u2019s Operating Agreement) become major impediments to profit, perhaps we should expect further changes to OpenAI\u2019s structure.&nbsp;</p><h1>B) Beware Securitisation&nbsp;</h1><p>Alongside the Dot-Com Crash, Zuboff cites a second crucial factor which encouraged Google to shift towards a targeted advertising business model, unconstrained by regulation: 9/11. Prior to 9/11,&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was edging towards privacy-protecting legislation:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/privacy-online-fair-information-practices-electronic-marketplace-federal-trade-commission-report/privacy2000.pdf\"><u>a report from 2000</u></a>&nbsp;recommended federal legislation, as \u201cself-regulatory initiatives to date fall far short\u201d. However, as noted by&nbsp;Peter Swire, \"everything changed\" after 9/11, with privacy provisions disappearing overnight. The Patriot Act and other measures expanded collection of personal information. FTC privacy guidelines shifted&nbsp;from the broader concerns of privacy rights to a \u201charms-based\u201d strategy: in effect, privacy rights only mattered if there were concrete physical harms (e.g. identity theft) which could be identified.</p><p>These changes were part of a broader tend, in which the internet became increasingly interconnected with perceptions of \u201cnational security\u201d and security services. This fits the model of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization_(international_relations)#:~:text=Securitization%20in%20international%20relations%20and,in%20the%20name%20of%20security.\"><u>securitization</u></a>\u201d, from International Relations, the word for a process in which&nbsp;state actors transform subjects from regular political issues into matters of \"security\".&nbsp;Former&nbsp;CIA Director Michael Hayden describes the \"militarization of the world wide web\" post-9/11:&nbsp;\u201cWhat 9/11 did was to produce socially negative consequences that hitherto were the stuff of repressive regimes and dystopian novels.... The suspension of normal conditions is justified with reference to the \u2018war on terrorism.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;Alongside a weakening of privacy regulation, there was cross-pollination between the private and public sectors: Google was awarded contracts for search technology by NSA and CIA, and its systems used for information sharing between intelligence agencies;&nbsp;and NSA starting to develop its own \u201cGoogle-like\u201d tools, including ICREACH, a search tool for analyzing metadata. The US PRISM program was implemented, using<span> automated processes to identify terrorist content online using data from US internet and social media companies. As&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X23000672#bib56\"><span><u>Burton writes</u></span></a><span>, these trends illustrate \u201csome of the key tenets of securitization theory: that states will use and implement special measures, including technological solutions, to what are seen as existential threats to the state\u201d.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Concerningly, AI is increasingly being framed in terms of existential security, both in the West and China. A study from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Mainframes-A-Provisional-Analysis-of-Rhetorical-Frames-in-AI.pdf\"><u>CSET</u></a>&nbsp;analyzes the rhetorical framing of AI, using&nbsp;English-language articles from 2012 to 2019 which had referenced to \u201cAI competition.\u201d It found, \u201csince 2012, a growing number of articles \u2026 have included the competition frame, but prevalence of the frame as a proportion of all AI articles peaked in 2015.\u201d This national security framing is increasingly prevalent amongst US policymakers.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, national security rhetoric around AI has been particularly prominent since the&nbsp;the State Council of China\u2019s \u201cNew Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\u201d in 2018. This document cites&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cnational security\u201d 8 times,&nbsp;\"national defense\" 11 times, and \u201csecurity\u201d 48 times (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/14/3/417/6352222?login=true\"><u>Zheng</u></a>). This language is also increasing rapidly in Chinese academic articles.<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EDCmxs9QpJBSB2hvH/gm8coamhdla7oqvdldra\"></p><p>From:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/14/3/417/6352222?login=true\"><u>https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article/14/3/417/6352222?login=true</u></a></p><p>The \u2018securitisation\u2019 of the internet in the early 2000s, in part,&nbsp;expanded state control/influence over the internet. State investment into AI has been increasing in recent years \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tnsr.org/2021/06/debunking-the-ai-arms-race-theory/\"><u>even if it falls short of the common-used \u201carms-race\u201d framing</u></a>. Chinese state investment into AI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinese-public-ai-rd-spending-provisional-findings/\"><u>was estimated at&nbsp;</u></a>several billion dollars in 2019; the US Chips Act, which aimed to boost domestic US AI capability, cost $280 billion. Similarly to the \u2018securitisation\u2019 of the internet, it seems plausible that \u2018national security\u2019 rhetoric has contributed to increased state investment. Perhaps this isn\u2019t intrinsically concerning, and all else equal, US federal investment into AI is good.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the \u2018securitisation\u2019 of the internet not only boosted state control, but also stopped progress on consumer-friendly regulation from the FTC regulation.&nbsp;Could the securitisation of AI also lead to weaker protections for consumers? Some technology CEOs have already used national security rhetoric to argue against breaking apart their companies. Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17584482/mark-zuckerberg-china-antitrust-breakup-artificial-intelligence\"><u>CEO Mark Zuckerberg</u></a> once warned that Chinese firms, who \u201cdo not share the values that we have\u201d, would come to dominate, if US regulators try to \u201cclip the wings of these [American] companies and make it so that it\u2019s harder for them to operate in different places or they have to be smaller\u201d. AI entrepreneurs don\u2019t seem to universally spit out the same rhetoric: e.g. Sam Altman has<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-10/openai-s-ceo-altman-calls-on-china-to-help-shape-ai-safety-guidelines#xj4y7vzkg\"><u> called for</u></a> increased global cooperation. (Although, in January 2024,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/collection/time100-companies-2022/6159390/openai/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a> agreed to start collaborating with the Pentagon.)</p><p>What can we learn from the \u2018securitisation\u2019 of the \u2018internet\u2019? It shows that rhetoric around \u2018national security\u2019 can contribute to (I) expanded state control over technology; and (II) weaker consumer protections. The former seems to already be occurring with AI development. Perhaps the latter may occur too.&nbsp;</p><h1>C) 'Best practices\u2019 have a mixed track record for protecting privacy</h1><p>Another important takeaway from&nbsp;<i>Surveillance Capitalism</i> are two prominent cases of self-regulation failing to protect consumer privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Take \u2018M-health\u2019 (Mobile-Health) tools. By 2016, there was over 100,000 m-health apps but no federal regulation surrounding their use. In April 2016, the FTC released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.foxrothschild.com/publications/navigating-the-ftcs-mobile-health-app-tool-and-guidance\"><u>\u2018Best Practices\u2019</u></a>, encouraging developers \u201cmake sure your app doesn\u2019t access consumer information it doesn\u2019t need,\u201d \u201clet consumers select particular contacts, rather than having your app request access to all user contacts,\u201d and let users \u201cchoose privacy-protective default settings.\u201d Zuboff argues these \u2018best practices\u2019 failed to stop M-Health companies sharing consumer data. A study,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openeffect.ca/reports/Every_Step_You_Fake.pdf\"><u>conducted by the Munk School</u></a>, found that most fitness trackers sent activity data to servers. Similarly, an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2499265\"><u>investigation of Diabetes apps</u></a> found they granted automatic data collection from third parties, activated cameras and microphones, and had ineffective or absent privacy policies. The M-Health tools example constitutes the failure of \u2018best-practices\u2019 to be followed by companies, post-agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Zuboff also describes inadequate outcomes&nbsp;<i>within the development of \u2018best practices\u2019</i>.&nbsp;In 2015,&nbsp;National Telecommunications and Information Association (NTIA) tried to create guidelines for biometric information for facial recognition, consulting with various consumer advocacy groups and corporate groups. The corporate groups insisted on using facial-recognition: as one lobbyist told the press, \u201cEveryone has the right to take photographs in public... if someone wants to apply facial recognition, should they really need to get consent in advance?\u201d Consumer Advocates eventually left the talks. NTIA\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/privacy_best_practices_recommendations_for_commercial_use_of_facial_recogntion.pdf\"><u>\u201cPrivacy Best Practice Recommendations\u201d</u></a> were eventually released in 2016. The results were pretty weak:&nbsp;companies who use facial recognition technology in \u201cphysical premises\u2026 [are] encouraged to provide \u2026 notice to consumers\u201d.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://consumerfed.org/press_release/statement-ntia-privacy-best-practice-recommendations-commercial-facial-recognition-use/\"><u>Consumer Federation of America</u></a> describes the regulations as offering \u201cno real protection for individuals.\u201d</p><p>These two examples provide pretty clear instances of \u2018best practices\u2019 for digital companies providing less than adequate protection for consumers. Several countries have started to use \u2018best practices\u2019 to regulate AI: e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/japans-approach-ai-regulation-and-its-impact-2023-g7-presidency\"><u>Japan's&nbsp;</u></a>focus on \"soft law\"; or voluntary safeguards in the US. At a first glance, the history of digital self-regulation/best practices might make you less optimistic about \u2018best-practices\u2019 for AI. This seems to be the view of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/21/ai-ethics-guidelines-google-meta-amazon\"><u>several consumer protection advocates</u></a>. Several caveats are needed though. First, neither case directly involved \u201cBig Tech\u201d companies.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"n0zyp4lpdp\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn0zyp4lpdp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn0zyp4lpdp\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Secondly, they only represent two (potentially cherry-picked) examples. Notwithstanding these caveats, I cautiously agree that the historical examples make me more skeptical of \u2018best practices\u2019 for digital technologies: that is, the gulf between \u2018best practices\u2019 and actual regulation for consumer protection is wider than I assumed<i>.&nbsp;</i>But, this doesn\u2019t suggest that \u2018best practices\u2019 have no benefits relative to worlds in which they are not implemented at all.&nbsp;</p><p>A fairly clear indication of this comes from&nbsp;perhaps part of <i>Surveillance Capitalism </i>which was most shocking to&nbsp;me, in which Zuboff describes Facebook\u2019s mass experimentation into social networks and voting. In 2012, Facebook researchers published a study titled \u201cA 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization.\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11421\"><u>You can read it today</u></a>. It involved manipulating the news feeds of Facebook users, to measure effects of \u201csocial contagion\u201d on voting in the 2010 midterms. Facebook carried out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full\"><u>a similar study in 2014</u></a> \u2013 experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks \u2013&nbsp; altering the news feeds of almost 700,000 people to test whether this would change their own posting behavior. Between 2007 and 2014, Facebook's Data Science group ran hundreds of tests, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-experiments-had-few-limits-1404344378\"><u>\u201cfew limits\u201d</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Wild stuff. Does this show that \u2018best practices\u2019 have no benefits? You could argue the contrary. Prior to any public commitments, Facebook experimented at their own will.&nbsp; Following public backlash to the release of the 2014 study,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/2/6894499/facebook-apologizes-for-manipulating-news-feeds-in-psychology-experiment\"><u>Facebook&nbsp;</u></a>announced a \u2018new framework\u2019 for research, which included internal guidelines and a review panel.&nbsp;I don\u2019t think Facebook&nbsp;has carried out (public) mass-scale social experimentation since .&nbsp; Zuboff wants to present this case study as a failure of self-regulation \u2013 which it may have been, all things considered. (These internal ethics guidelines haven\u2019t stopped Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/05/01/105987/is-facebook-targeting-ads-at-sad-teens/\">Targeting Ads at Sad Teens</a>, for example).&nbsp; But, this doesn\u2019t bely the claim that&nbsp;\u2018best practices\u2019 in 2014 might have positive counterfactual impact.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it's possible that \u2018best practices\u2019 might worsen the overall regulatory environment for consumers overall, if they&nbsp;legitimate undesirable behaviors, and make more stringent regulation less likely to happen. For example, NTIA guidelines for acceptable \u2018commercial facial recognition\u2019 might weaken public norms around the technology, and reduce the likelihood of a federal ban.

We wanted to get a better sense of how the people thinking about these threats every day perceive the risks.</p><p>So we decided to talk to more than a dozen biosecurity experts to better understand their views.</p><p>To make them feel comfortable speaking candidly, we granted the experts we spoke to anonymity.

(If you\u2019re not very familiar with biosecurity, that article may provide helpful context for understanding the experts\u2019 opinions below.)</p><p>Here\u2019s what the experts said.</p><h2><strong>Expert 1: Failures of imagination and appeals to authority</strong></h2><blockquote><p>In discussions around biosecurity, I frequently encounter a failure of imagination. Individuals, particularly those in synthetic biology and public health sectors, tend to rely excessively on historical precedents, making it difficult for them to conceive of novel biological risks or the potential for bad actors within a range of fields. This narrow mindset hinders proactive planning and compromises our ability to adequately prepare for novel threats.</p><p><strong>Another frequent problem is appeal to authority. Many people tend to suspend their own critical reasoning when a viewpoint is confidently presented by someone they perceive as an authoritative figure.</strong> This can stymie deeper reflections on pressing biosecurity issues and becomes especially problematic when compounded by information cascades. In such scenarios, an uncritically accepted idea from an authoritative source can perpetuate as fact, sometimes going unquestioned for years.</p><p>There are various appeals to tradition that frequently skews discussions in broader biosecurity communities. For example, the adage that \u201cnature is the worst bioterrorist\u201d has gained such widespread acceptance that it has become a memetic obstacle to more nuanced understanding. We can be biassed in the data we pay attention to, and in times of unprecedented technological progress, we are at great risk of falling prey to our assumptions and \u201cfighting the last war.\u201d</p><p>For example, before the detonation of the first atomic bomb, the idea that a single device could wreak destruction on an entire city was nearly inconceivable based on prior warfare technologies. Previous estimates of damage were based on conventional explosives and did not remotely approximate the catastrophic impact of atomic bombs.</p><p>The advent of nuclear technology led to a situation where traditional calculations and historical precedents were starkly insufficient in predicting the risks and outcomes. It would be wise to avoid the same errors of reasoning when thinking about future risks from biology.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 2: Exaggerating small-scale risks and Western chauvinism</strong></h2><blockquote><p>There is a vast difference between a disease-causing agent or pathogen and something that could actually create massive harm. That creates bad policies, when people think that they\u2019re the same thing. It\u2019s technically possible for someone to grow anthrax spores in their bathtub, but the amount of damage they could do is constrained by the fact that anthrax typically doesn\u2019t spread between people. So, focusing on the biological agents with the largest capability for harm would probably mean prioritising risks outside of anthrax.</p><p>I also think there\u2019s a lot of chauvinism in biosecurity. This is less true for those that work internationally, and more true for people who work in the US. People always think well, of course Johns Hopkins University isn\u2019t going to be part of a biological weapons programme. But that\u2019s not the viewpoint of Russia and China and DPRK. Stop being so jingoistic. Stop thinking Western governments are always well-meaning and non-Western governments are not. The best way to view a US action is: what would you think if you found out that China was researching the same thing?</p><p>The other point about chauvinism is that the risks aren\u2019t the same in the rich and the poor world. The rich world ignores the biosecurity of faecal-oral diseases because we have good sanitation infrastructure. Conversely, antibiotic resistance is top of mind for rich countries that use antibiotics as the cornerstone of a biological response, but will not change the consequences of an attack in a poor country that has limited stocks of antibiotics.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 3: Useless reports and the world beyond effective altruism</strong></h2><blockquote><p>I think there\u2019s plenty of failure modes in terms of how people go about trying to do good things in the world. <strong>Writing a report, sending it into the void, and then expecting impact is a massive failure mode.</strong></p><p>Another failure mode is assuming that things that are high status or visible within EA<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/anonymous-misconceptions-about-biosecurity/#fn-1\"><sup>1</sup></a> are the most effective. A lot of the best work in biosecurity comes from people that most EAs have just no idea exist, and those people should be more of the role models that EAs have.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 4: Overconfidence in threat models</strong></h2><blockquote><p>I think some people, including senior people, are overconfident in their threat models and have an overly simplistic view of certain issues. There are also a lot of other people who are under-confident and deferential in a way that I think is bad. So something to do with hierarchy and forming views based on deference is probably a big misconception.</p><p>Generally EA biosecurity has failed to really grapple with or seriously weigh the benefits of things like <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK285579/\">gain-of-function research</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p2002\">pandemic discovery</a>. I think the analysis of these things can be quite simplistic and people tend to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34XxbRFe54FycoCDw/the-bottom-line\">form the bottom line first</a>. I think most EAs think it is probably bad to discover new pandemic viruses in nature without thinking too much about it. I also think that\u2019s probably bad, but a lot of people could benefit from more openness to being wrong.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 5: Interventions that don\u2019t address the largest threats</strong></h2><blockquote><p>I\u2019m generally just witheringly sceptical of incrementalist biosecurity interventions like just hiring more doctors.</p><p>In global catastrophic risk, obviously <strong>you do want to reduce risk in an incremental way. But you do it by closing off particular parts of a threat landscape.</strong></p><p>I tend to favour interventions that are supported by a story that says something like, but for a given intervention, this particular threat would have killed 10 billion or 8 billion \u2014 but instead it only kills less than a billion, or something like that.</p><p>COVID was some evidence in favour of my position being correct. The main factor in saving lives was the vaccine. It\u2019s a very heavy-tailed distribution in terms of actual impact. It\u2019s probably an archetypical EA vibe to have, but it\u2019s one I am unapologetic in having.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 6: Over-reliance on past experience and overconfidence about the future</strong></h2><blockquote><p>There are two general categories of common failures in most policy efforts. One is based on an over-reliance on past experience and the other is based on a flawed sense of confidence about the future.</p><p>For biosecurity and pandemic risk, we shouldn\u2019t overly rely on successful interventions of the past in order to protect us against future biological incidents \u2014 such as vaccination and other medical countermeasures. One of the major successes during the COVID-19 pandemic was the rapid development of vaccines. So it\u2019s easy to understand why folks would want to double down on an approach that worked. In fact, it\u2019s an approach that has worked for combatting and eradicating infectious diseases for many decades.</p><p>However, medical countermeasures should not be the cornerstone of our playbook moving forward, not least of all because we\u2019ve seen their limitations in preventing disease transmission \u2014 plus anti-vaccine sentiments.</p><p>Plus, if we think that medical countermeasures are the answer to all of our pandemic problems, we may be motivated to use AI or research automation to design and develop medical countermeasures at any cost \u2014 even if the tools and approaches we use could be misused.</p><p>On the other hand, a future world where biology becomes increasingly programmable is often imagined by those with confidence and optimism about the future. But it\u2019s this same confidence in biology for good that prevents visualisation of a world where biology can be misused by those with less expertise and resources.</p><p>These optimists are often the same ones that believe nothing robust should be done to address dual-use risk because it will limit innovation and its potential life-changing transformations. But it doesn\u2019t quite make sense how innovations through AI and machine learning can be so life-changing for good without commensurate potential to be life-changing for bad. We need to think about minimising the risk with the same level of rigour as maximising the good.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 7: Resistance from governments and antagonising expert communities</strong></h2><blockquote><p>I think people overestimate how likely it is that an intervention that prevents global catastrophic biological risks (GCBRs) would be adopted by governments. In my experience, it\u2019s challenging to get interventions that provide measurable, real-world public health benefits funded and adopted \u2014 unless they can be proven to pay for themselves and offer regular benefits that can be reported to decision makers.</p><p>Interventions that may never be used or only be used very occasionally also can\u2019t be tested for their accuracy and usefulness in a real-world setting. Similar interventions used routinely can fail in unexpected ways or for reasons that weren\u2019t considered, so getting regular feedback based on real-world settings is crucial.</p><p>This is especially important in determining whether decision makers and the public trust the information provided, as a lack of trust or confidence can undermine a perfectly good early warning system. I also see people treat GCBR preparedness, public health, and global health interventions as different things when in reality, there are solutions that can be used for multiple purposes and can provide a better case for adoption if considered jointly.</p><p>Another issue I see is people positioning themselves in opposition to pathogen researchers, synthetic biologists, AI developers, or people working in public health due to disagreements about how they work and the information they generate. I\u2019ve heard frustrations that these groups won\u2019t engage on these issues from people who talk about them and to them in an extremely negative way.</p><p>I\u2019m not at all surprised that these groups aren\u2019t helpful and collaborative when they\u2019re being insulted. <strong>These communities offer a wealth of knowledge we desperately need to solve these problems effectively and taking an adversarial stance causes them to respond in kind.</strong></p><p>When you engage these groups as collaborators, I\u2019ve found that they are incredibly enthusiastic to get involved and adapt their practices. And when they\u2019re not, it\u2019s because they see a real-world harm as a consequence of caution that the biosecurity community hasn\u2019t recognized or valued enough.</p><p>This approach also leaves people in biosecurity re-inventing the wheel when existing solutions and infrastructure could be adapted to be more biosecurity-forward. People working with infectious diseases regularly have a great solution in mind that we could be advocating for instead of trying to come up with something new, having had no experience of dealing with a real outbreak.</p><p>It can also lead to biosecurity folks developing an intervention that would fail or not be adopted in practice. There seems to be this thinking that pathogen and public health researchers are too short-sighted to care about GCBRs or aren\u2019t clever/focussed enough to come up with solutions to the problems we worry about. In reality, they\u2019ve often tried and either the intervention didn\u2019t go as well as expected, or they couldn\u2019t get anyone to pay for it.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 8: Preparing for the \u201cBig One\u201d looks like preparing for the smaller ones</strong></h2><blockquote><p>I believe some in the effective altruism/longtermism community see a strong disconnect between \u201cordinary\u201d pandemics of the kind we have recently experienced or smaller, and \u201cexistential threats.\u201d <strong>While size and severity surely matter, the systems for responding to one are the same ones that will respond to the other</strong> \u2014 and failure to control a smaller one is the most likely way in which we get to a larger one. So investments in preparing for the \u201cBig One\u201d should primarily (maybe not exclusively) be those that also prepare for the small and medium-sized ones.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 9: ChatGPT is not dangerous</strong></h2><blockquote><p>The one that I hear most recently is that ChatGPT is going to let people be weaponeers. That drives me berserk because telling someone step-by-step how to make a virus does not in any way allow them to make a weapon. It doesn\u2019t tell them how to assemble it, doesn\u2019t tell them how to grow it up, it doesn\u2019t tell them how to purify it, test it, deploy it, none of that.</p><p>If you lined up all the steps in a timeline of how to create a bioweapon, learning what the steps are would be this little chunk on the far left side. It would take maybe 10 hours to figure that out with Google, and maybe ChatGPT will give you that in one hour.</p><p>But there\u2019s months and years worth of the rest of the process, and yet everyone\u2019s running around saying, \u201cChatGPT is going to build a whole generation of weaponeers!\u201d No way.</p><p>Another dubious take is having information hazards rule everything. That we should never do anything to create new information hazards.</p><p>To me, that is crazy. Because you basically are saying you\u2019re going to shut off your ability to understand the threat just because you\u2019re worried about possibly informing someone somewhere a little bit more, despite the massive pile of public literature that already exists.</p><p>It really ends up being an argument about who\u2019s going to be faster, the weaponeer or the person working on the defensive side. I would much rather have that contest than unilaterally disarm, which is what the information hazard argument insists we do.</p><p>I would also argue weaponisation is a years-long timeline.</p><p>We have never in human history created a virus from scratch to exploit a new vulnerability in a biological system. I can\u2019t imagine that taking place in less than a couple of years. Over the course of those years the individuals will be throwing off lots of signals that would be detectable.</p><p>And so the idea that those weaponeers would race to the finish in six months and have a little tube that they could throw around \u2014 I just don\u2019t buy it. I see no evidence of what humans have done so far that would get us anywhere near any of that. And telling ourselves stories about how hard that is or how easy that is, I think is really harmful.</p><p>We should at least be realistic in our estimates and judgments of how hard or easy that process would be. And right now, we\u2019re shortcutting all of that and just writing science fiction.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 10: The barriers to bioweapons are not that high</strong></h2><blockquote><p>There are a lot of misconceptions out there, in part because the academic community that writes about these things has been very small for a very long time. A lot of the writings that are out there on biological weapons are just wrong.</p><p>It\u2019s hard because a lot of it is classified, but a simple example would be the claim that a country would never use a communicable biological weapon because it would blow back on their own people. The fact is that the Soviet Union perfected smallpox as a biological weapon. So the fact that they did it tells me that countries will do it.</p><p><strong>One misconception that may once have been somewhat true \u2014 but now it\u2019s much less true, and in the future it will be even less true \u2014 is that tacit knowledge is required to make biological weapons.</strong> That the barrier is so high.</p><p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. I actually don\u2019t think that was the case 20 years ago or 30 years ago, but it\u2019s certainly not the case today.</p><p>I think it depends on which specific biological weapon. It\u2019s relatively easy with the information available today for a determined small group or individual to successfully produce and deliver biological weapons. There was a <a href=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801452888/barriers-to-bioweapons/\">book</a> written about this that studied the Soviet program, and the author spoke to many former Soviet bioweaponeers. I think it\u2019s natural that they would exaggerate their craft and describe how \u201conly people with special skills like me could do this.\u201d I think that biassed the conclusions of that book.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 11: We don\u2019t need silver bullets</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Some people think laws and rules, and the tools and technologies used to implement them, do not control bad actors. They only influence the behaviour of good actors. But this misses the deterrent effect of laws and rules.</p><p>Some people look only for silver bullets and <strong>they discount solutions that might be circumvented. This misses the point that raising barriers to malign misuse of technology can still be highly beneficial.</strong></p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 12: Three failure modes</strong></h2><blockquote><p>A few misconceptions and mistakes:</p><ol><li>Failure to engage broadly with knowledge and expertise in the community and trying to reinvent things from scratch.</li><li>Failure to account for the fact that biosecurity is exceptionally broad and other people are likely solving for different problems and have different threat models.</li><li>Failure to get out into the world and talk with people \u2014 most information still isn\u2019t written down.</li></ol></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 13: Groupthink and failing to be scope sensitive</strong></h2><blockquote><p>I think that there\u2019s a lack of scope sensitivity. People are not treating the catastrophic potential outcomes in biosecurity as six billion times more concerning \u2014 or whatever the right multiplier would be \u2014 than the cases where one or two people could get impacted.</p><p>I also think there\u2019s some groupthink in the effective altruism biosecurity community, and there is a very important need for people to work in and be exposed to other communities that have some very different perspectives on the issues to understand:</p><ul><li>Why are these the ideas that the effective altruism community has produced?</li><li>Why aren\u2019t they being implemented?</li><li>Why do people disagree with them?</li></ul><p><strong>I think that there\u2019s a whole set of sort of feasibility and implementation dynamics that are not well understood by many EAs in this field.</strong> I think it\u2019s really important that people expose themselves to the organisations and the people that have been working on this for a long time, the established institutions and scientists, to have a better understanding of why people are doing things the way they do. Sometimes you may still disagree and feel a different approach would be better, but there\u2019s usually a logic to it that is not always fully grasped.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Expert 14: COVID-19 does not equal biological weapons</strong></h2><blockquote><p>One common misconception is that because SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] was able to cause this horrific human pandemic, any biological weapon would be equally devastating. That this pandemic exposed our vulnerability to biological weapons and that state and non-state actors are immediately going to exploit that vulnerability and attack with biological weapons.</p><p>I think that is misleading because this virus evolved to be as infectious and contagious as it was. What Mother Nature is able to do with pathogens, I think, exceeds what humans can still do in this respect.</p><p>COVID-19 does not equal biological weapons, bluntly. This is a very specific pandemic that emerged that is not the same as what any country has been able to do in the past or any non-state actor is able to do.</p><p>There is also an assumption that because this vulnerability was revealed, lots of states and non-state actors are going to launch biological weapons programmes.</p><p>I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s the case. Most countries and terrorist groups don\u2019t have or want or need biological weapons because they will not serve their purposes. We should not expect this dramatic change in calculus based on this one natural pandemic. We\u2019ve had other pandemics historically, lots of flu pandemics that have not resulted in wholesale changes in the way that states or terrorist groups view these things.</p><p>Because the reality is biological weapons just don\u2019t work that well and aren\u2019t going to meet the objectives of countries and groups that are looking for new capabilities.</p><p>There are lots of misconceptions about how easy it is to develop and use a biological weapon. There are a lot of steps that go into converting a pathogen into an actual weapon that is capable of causing mass casualties, and that process is not necessarily going to be published in the open literature.</p><p>It\u2019s not something that people can just learn in grad school, right? There are very arcane knowledge and skills that go into this that are just not readily accessible. So <strong>there\u2019s a very common downplaying of the role of tacit knowledge in this process of weaponization. It\u2019s very easy for people to claim that if you can culture a pathogen, and find it in nature, then you can then turn it into a weapon to cause a pandemic or mass casualties.</strong></p><p>And that\u2019s just not the case. We\u2019ve seen nation states struggle to develop these weapons and non-state actors have been very unsuccessful with them because they are very challenging to acquire and develop and produce and use properly.</p><p>I guess the last misconception I\u2019ll highlight is that advances in life sciences about technology are democratising the proliferation of biological weapons \u2014 that this technology, these advances are easily converted into misuse.</p><p>And again, that\u2019s just not the case. The technologies that are developed are usually developed for very specific civilian scientific purposes that would need to be modified to be capable of causing mass casualties. That\u2019s not a simple, straightforward, easy process by any means.</p><p>People overestimate the degree of threats to biosecurity, which again, I\u2019m not saying that there aren\u2019t any, but I\u2019m saying the tendency is more to exaggerate the threats than not.</p><p>And frequently this comes from people who don\u2019t understand the biology of these organisms, and they come out of different epistemic communities. They don\u2019t understand the nuances and the complexities involved in what it takes to actually create a biological threat.</p><p>It\u2019s safe to say that the knowledge and capabilities are increasing because of advances in dual-use technologies. But that\u2019s very much a latent capability that\u2019s increasing. It\u2019s another thing to say: OK, this latent capability will transform into something capable of misuse, just assuming that there\u2019s someone out there with an intent and motivation to do so.</p><p>That latent capability for modifying pathogens or producing them is clearly expanding in terms of our level of knowledge and the number of people out there who are able to do it. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the intent is growing.

Simply put: making your model behave more predictably in unexpected scenarios can lead to it performing worse in everyday circumstances.</li><li><strong>Robustness to distributional shift:</strong> Similarly, it\u2019s easiest to develop and deploy systems that assume that the future will be like the past and present. For example, you don\u2019t need to <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/sleeper-agents-training-deceptive-llms-that-persist-through-safety-training?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>detect sleeper agents</u></a> if you only care about the training distribution.</li><li><strong>Safe exploration:</strong> Once AI systems are interacting with the real world, adding additional controls that prevent unsafe or unethical behaviours is more costly than simply allowing unlimited exploration.</li><li><strong>Avoiding power-seeking:</strong> AI systems that engage in power-seeking behaviour\u2014acquiring resources, colluding with other AI systems\u2014may be more economically valuable in the short term, at the expense of long-term control.</li></ul><p>All of these require more investment than the less aligned baseline comparison, and companies will face hard decisions about which to pursue.</p><h2>Alignment windfalls</h2><p>On the other hand, there are some ideas and businesses where progress on AI safety is intrinsically linked to value creation.&nbsp;</p><p>More specifically, let\u2019s say an <i>alignment windfall</i> is an investment that a company expects to help with alignment of transformative AI that also has a <strong>net positive </strong>impact on the company's bottom line over the next 3-12 months.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. </strong>RLHF comes with significant upfront costs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5vvz7zg2oe8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5vvz7zg2oe8\">[2]</a></sup></span>, but it easily pays for itself by producing a more valuable model. <a href=\"https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai/?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>Nathan Labenz</u></a> was one of the volunteers who assessed a \u201cpurely helpful\u201d version of GPT-4, and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/nathan-labenz-openai-red-team-safety/?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>found it was \u201ctotally amoral\u201d</u></a>.

As a sector, startups take a scattergun approach: each individual company is likely doomed, but the outsized upside for the lucky few means that many optimists are still willing to give it a go.</li><li><strong>Risk-taking behaviour.</strong> Startups thrive in legal and normative grey areas, where larger companies are constrained by their brand reputation, partnerships, or lack of appetite for regulatory risk.</li></ol><p>In this way, the startup sector is effectively searching over our legal and ethical landscape for unexploited money-making ideas. They're looking for the most efficient way to create value, and they're willing to take risks to do so.</p><p>This optimisation pressure will be especially strong for artificial intelligence, because the upside for organisations leading the AGI race is gigantic. For startups and incumbents alike, there is incredible countervailing pressure on anything standing in the way: alignment taxes start to look a lot like inefficiencies to be eliminated, and alignment windfalls become very appealing.</p><h2>Shaping the landscape</h2><p>The technical approaches which lead to taxes and windfalls lie on a landscape that can be shaped in a few ways:</p><p><strong>Regulation</strong> can levy taxes on unaligned approaches:</p><ul><li>Causes like environmental protection or consumer safety made progress when governments decreed that companies must absorb additional costs in order to protect the public: from pollution and unsafe products respectively. Regulation meant it was a smart economic decision for these companies to better align to the needs of the public.</li><li>Regulation is fast becoming a reason to pay some alignment tax for AI too. For example, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>red-teaming</u></a> will soon become required for companies building foundation models due to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence</u></a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Public awareness</strong> can cause windfalls for aligned approaches:</p><ul><li>While regulation is often used to set a minimum standard that companies must meet on prosocial measures, marketing strategies can push beyond this and incentivise excellence. For decades, <a href=\"https://beloved-brands.com/volvo-safety/?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>Volvo built immense brand equity</u></a> around the safety features in their cars with adverts demonstrating how crumple zones, airbags, and side impact protection would protect you and your family.</li><li>In AI, the marketing dynamic remains centred around avoiding PR disasters, rather than aiming for brand differentiation. Infamously, Alphabet briefly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/02/09/1155650909/google-chatbot--error-bard-shares?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>lost $100 billion of value</u></a> after its splashy launch adverts included a factual error. Hopefully, AI companies \u201cdo a Volvo\u201d and compete on safety in the future, but there probably isn't enough public awareness of the issues for this to make sense yet.</li><li>On the other hand, in a competitive world with many players, public awareness may not be enough to get to exceptionally high standards, whereas regulation could enforce it across the board.</li></ul><p><strong>Recruiting </strong>top talent is easier for safety-oriented companies:</p><ul><li>Given two similar employment choices, most candidates would favour the option which better aligns with their own moral code. Good examples of this will be found at mission-driven non-profit organisations, staffed by team members who could often find much better-compensated work at for-profit orgs, but who find significant value in aiding causes they believe in.</li><li>As for AI, the competition for talent is extraordinarily competitive. Panglossian AI optimists might not care about the safety stance of the organisation they work at, but most people would pay some heed. Therefore, AI companies that prioritise alignment\u2014even if it comes with a tax\u2014can boost their ability to hire the best people and remain competitive.</li></ul><p>In practice, there is often interplay between these. For example, regulation can help the public appreciate the dangers of products, and a positive public company profile is a boon for recruiting.</p><h2>Companies greedily optimise within the <i>known</i> landscape</h2><p>An important nuance with the above model is that companies don\u2019t optimise within the <i>true</i> landscape: they optimise within the landscape they can access. Founders don\u2019t know the truth about where all the windfalls lie: they have to choose what to build based on the set of possible approaches within reach.</p><p>Here are a couple of reasons why the full landscape tends to be poorly known to AI startup founders:</p><ul><li><strong>Startups are myopic. </strong>Startups tend to run on tight feedback loops. Using quick, iterative release schedules, they excel at pivoting to whatever direction seems most promising for the next month or two. They tend to make lots of local decisions, rather than grand strategies. This isn\u2019t to say that startups are unable to make bold moves, especially in aggregate, but in my experience the vast majority of decisions at the vast majority of startups are incremental improvements and additions to what\u2019s already working.</li><li><strong>Companies are secretive. </strong>If a startup did happen to find an alignment windfall, they would be incentivised to keep it secret for as long as possible. For example, many important details in how GPT-4 and Claude 2 were trained are not public.</li></ul><p>In contrast, researchers in academia have much more latitude to explore completely unproven ideas lacking any clear path to practical application\u2014and the expectation is that those results will be published publicly too. Unfortunately, because of the data and compute requirements associated with modern machine learning, it has become hard for aspiring researchers to do many forms of groundbreaking work outside of an industrial setting: they\u2019re embedded in these myopic and secretive organisations.</p><h3>Shaping knowledge of the landscape</h3><p>What does it look like to shape the broader knowledge of this landscape?</p><ul><li>Some of this is <strong>technical alignment work</strong>: discovering how to build AI systems that are robustly aligned while minimising alignment taxes or even maximising windfalls.</li><li>Another crucial part is <strong>exploring, testing, and promoting ideas</strong> for AI companies that <strong>exploit alignment windfalls</strong>. This is what Elicit is doing, as I\u2019ll explain in the following section.</li></ul><h1>Factored cognition: an example of an alignment windfall</h1><p>Let\u2019s consider a more detailed example. Elicit has been exploring one part of the landscape of taxes &amp; windfalls, with a focus on <a href=\"https://ought.org/research/factored-cognition?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>factored cognition</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref39k951uhp0l\"><sup><a href=\"#fn39k951uhp0l\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Factored cognition as a windfall</h3><p>Since the deep learning revolution, most progress on AI capability has been due to some combination of:</p><ul><li>More data.</li><li>More compute.</li><li>More parameters.</li></ul><p>Normally, we do all three at the same time. We have basically thrown more and more raw material at the models, then poked them with RLHF until it seems sufficiently difficult to get them to be obviously dangerous. This is an inherently fragile scheme, and there are strong incentives to cut corners on the \u201cnow make it safe\u201d phase.</p><p>Factored cognition is an alternative paradigm which offers a different path. Instead of solving harder problems with bigger and bigger models, we decompose the problem into a set of smaller, more tractable problems. Each of these smaller problems is solved independently and their solutions combined to produce a final result. In cases where factored cognition isn't great for generating a result, we can <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10627?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>factor a verification process</u></a> instead. Either way, we aim to keep the component models small and the tasks self-contained and supervisable.</p><h3>How we\u2019ve been exploring factored cognition at Elicit</h3><p>Elicit, our <a href=\"https://elicit.com/?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>AI research assistant</u></a>, is built using factored cognition: we decompose common research tasks into a sequence of steps, using gold standard processes like <a href=\"https://training.cochrane.org/handbook?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>systematic reviews</u></a> as a guide.</p><p>For our users, accuracy is absolutely crucial. They are pinning their reputation on the claims that they make, and therefore something which merely <i>sounds plausible</i> is nowhere near good enough. We need to earn their trust through solid epistemic foundations.</p><p>For Elicit, creating a valuable product is the same thing as building a truthful, transparent system. We don't have some people building an AI tool and also some people figuring out how to make it reliable. Trustworthiness <i>is</i> our value proposition.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Let's find and promote alignment windfalls!</p><p>Some of the top AI labs seem to be careful and deliberative actors, but as more competitors enter the race for AGI the pressure to avoid hindrance will increase. Future competitors may well be less cautious and even explicitly reject safety-related slow-downs.</p><p>If this is the world we're heading towards, AI safety measures which impose significant alignment taxes are at risk of being avoided. To improve outcomes in that world, we should discover and promote alignment windfalls, by which I mean mechanisms that harness the awesome efficiency of markets to create aligned AI systems.</p><p>I'm a proponent of other approaches\u2014such as regulation\u2014to guide us towards safe AI, but in high stakes situations like this my mind turns to the <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Human-error%3A-models-and-management.-Reason/5be041196e178402769ececabd3734085ac3a2ce?ref=blog.elicit.com\"><u>Swiss cheese model</u></a> used to reduce clinical accidents. We shouldn't hope for a panacea, which probably doesn't exist in any case. We need many, independent layers of defence each with their strengths and (hopefully non-overlapping) weaknesses.</p><p>In my view, Elicit is the best example of an alignment windfall that we have today. To have maximum impact, we need to show that factored cognition is a powerful approach for building high-stakes ML systems. Elicit will be a compelling existence proof: an example which we hope other people will copy out of their own self-interest and\u2014as such\u2014make AI safer for everyone.</p><h2>Want to help us?</h2><p>We are building the best possible team to make this happen\u2014you can see our open roles <a href=\"https://elicit.com/careers?ref=forum.effectivealtruism.org\">here</a>!</p><p><i>Many thanks to </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/jungofthewon?mention=user\"><i>@jungofthewon</i></a><i>, \u00c9tienne Fortier-Dubois, </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/owain_evans?mention=user\"><i>@Owain_Evans</i></a><i>, and </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/brachbach?mention=user\"><i>@brachbach</i></a><i> for comments on an early draft.</i></p><hr><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnl6u51g4fthh\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefl6u51g4fthh\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>E.g. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05862.pdf?ref=blog.elicit.com\">Hendrycks (2022)</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn5vvz7zg2oe8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref5vvz7zg2oe8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Jan Leike estimated RLHF accounted for 5\u201320% of the total cost of GPT-3 Instruct, factoring in things like engineering work, hiring labelers, acquiring compute, and researcher effort.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnuby0luciic\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefuby0luciic\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Of course, it\u2019s far from a complete solution to alignment and might be more akin to putting lipstick on a shoggoth than deeply rewiring the model\u2019s concepts and capabilities.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntwsumig7328\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftwsumig7328\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>But also: <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BinkknLBYxskMXuME/if-interpretability-research-goes-well-it-may-get-dangerous?ref=blog.elicit.com\">Some have noted</a> that interpretability could be harmful if our increased understanding of the internals of neural networks leads to capability gains.

In the first essay I introduced the idea of&nbsp;<i>wholesomeness</i> as a criterion for choosing actions. This essay will explore the relationship between acting wholesomely and some different conceptions of effective altruism.</p><h1>Tensions</h1><h2>Apparent tensions</h2><p>Acting wholesomely feels relatively aligned with traditional commonsense notions of doing good. To the extent that EA is offering a new angle on doing good, shouldn\u2019t we expect its priorities to clash with what being wholesome suggests? (It would be a suspicious convergence if not!)</p><p>Getting more concrete:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It feels wholesome to support our local communities, but EA suggests it would be more effective to support others far removed from us.&nbsp;</li><li>It&nbsp;<i>doesn\u2019t</i> feel wholesome to reorient strategies around speculative sci-fi concerns. But this is what a large fraction of EA has done with AI stuff.</li></ul><p>Surely there are tensions here?</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:74.98%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/v7dsotd08smbihcqd3me\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Aside: acting wholesomely and commonsense morality</h3><p>Although I\u2019ve just highlighted that acting wholesomely often feels aligned with commonsense morality, I think it\u2019s important to note that it certainly doesn\u2019t equal commonsense morality. Wholesome action means attending to the whole of things one can understand, and that may include esoteric considerations which wouldn\u2019t get a look in on commonsense morality. The alignment is more one-sided: if commonsense morality doesn\u2019t like something, there\u2019s usually some reason for the dislike. Wholesomeness will seek not to dismiss these objections out of hand, but rather to avoid such actions unless the objections have been thoroughly understood and felt not to stand up.</p><h2>The shut-up-and-multiply perspective</h2><p>A particular perspective which is often associated with EA is the idea of taking expected value seriously, and choosing our actions on this basis. The catch-phrase of this perspective might be \u201cshut up and multiply!\u201d.</p><p>Taken at face value, this perspective would recommend:</p><ul><li>We put everything we can into an explicit model</li><li>We use this to determine what seems like the best option</li><li>We pursue that option</li></ul><h2>Deep tensions between wholesomeness and straw EA</h2><p>There\u2019s a kind of simplistic version of EA which tells you to work out what the most important things are and then focus on maximizing goodness there. This is compatible with using the shut-up-and-multiply perspective to work what\u2019s most important, but doesn\u2019t require it.</p><p>I don\u2019t think that this simplistic version of EA is the correct version of EA (precisely because it misses the benefits of wholesomeness; or for another angle on its issues see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\"><u>EA is about maximization, and maximization is perilous</u></a>). But I do think it\u2019s a common thing to perceive EA principles as saying, perhaps especially by people who are keen to criticise EA<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefym5uz0ey0dn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnym5uz0ey0dn\">[1]</a></sup></span>. For this reason I\u2019ll label it \u201cstraw EA\u201d.</p><p>There is a quite fundamental tension between acting wholesomely and straw EA:</p><ul><li>Wholesomeness tells you to focus on the whole, and not let actions be dictated by impact on a few parts of things</li><li>Straw EA tells you to focus on the most important dimensions and maximize there \u2014 implicitly telling you to ignore everything else<ul><li>Indeed when EA is introduced it is sometimes emphasised that we shouldn\u2019t necessarily focus on helping those close to us, which could sound like an instruction to forget whom we\u2019re close to</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Wholesome EA</h1><p>I don\u2019t think that these apparent tensions are necessary. In this section I\u2019ll describe a version of effective altruism, which I\u2019ll call \u201cwholesome EA\u201d, which is deeply grounded in a desire to act wholesomely. Although the articulation is new, I don\u2019t think that the thing I\u2019m proposing here is fundamentally novel \u2014 I feel like I\u2019ve seen some version of this implicitly espoused (and followed) by people for years.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:89.91%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/rvkm7zrgncnvzpt7jj5c\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/mszg7kj5yrp89bmztihd 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/tgwntlpdoh6xtzhcbgfz 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/vj6rvtaycs2xwroczqty 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/yzhagzrtfqqz0najylez 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/djzwnkg2otbmzxhuenfp 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/ypddvd5b1ciqrzlhkau6 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/ad4qjyfvuwshwdy5wmzp 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/eyzyiyqkku1pcr1f1zfo 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/a0ulzb8xtzw0rr4yi0ql 1620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/orzxokgcwxrragbtbzbw 1792w\"></figure><p>My purposes in this essay are to show that there&nbsp;<i>is</i> a coherent unifying perspective which captures what\u2019s good about acting wholesomely as well as what\u2019s good about EA. I\u2019ll give some examples of how it might have helped to avoid some kinds of errors that have arisen in EA. But I\u2019ll leave discussion of its advantages and disadvantages as a set of ideas to spread until the third essay.</p><h2>Finding EA within a wholesomeness-focused worldview</h2><p>Suppose you are principally concerned with acting wholesomely. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with EA, or with the shut-up-and-multiply perspective, you\u2019re likely to choose quite different things than if acting from an EA perspective; e.g. you may put a lot of resources into your local community. (This is one concretization of the apparent tensions discussed above.)</p><p>But now suppose you read about, and spend time considering, EA and the shut-up-and-multiply perspective. What is wholesome depends on the&nbsp;<i>whole</i> system. After you\u2019re aware of the case for the importance of helping those who need it most,&nbsp;<i>it is unlikely to continue to feel wholesome to devote all your resources to your local community</i>.</p><p>Indeed, on this picture the central thing that EA is doing is calling out the unwholesomeness of getting absorbed in the local and not caring about what\u2019s most effective. This is a pain point, and calling it out \u2014 and building structures which better address it \u2014 is increasing global wholesomeness. The EA perspective is valuable because it changes our notion of what wholesome action entails \u2014 towards things that, at least when things are going right, are more truly wholesome and more likely to lead to a very good world.</p><p>Equipped with these new perspectives, you\u2019re likely to look for ways to better understand the larger wholes, and to put resources in effective ways towards bettering those. But you\u2019ll stay connected to a local desire for wholesomeness; not as something to be maximized, but as something to be upheld.</p><p>Let\u2019s revisit the concrete tensions from above:</p><ul><li>It\u2019s wholesome to participate constructively in our local communities, and people acting on a wholesome EA worldview will continue to do this<ul><li>e.g. while straw EA might present lines of reasoning like \u201ceffective charities will make so much better use of this money than the people serving us\u201d and recommend giving very small or no tips in restaurants, wholesome EA will reject this as unwholesome</li><li>But after participating constructively in local communities, people acting on a wholesome EA worldview will often still have a lot of resources which are their own to choose what to do with, and feel it\u2019s wholesome to devote those to the most effective causes they know of</li></ul></li><li>I think it\u2019s straightforwardly wholesome to take ideas seriously, and not look away from potentially big issues just because they sound weird or are unpopular<ul><li>There are ways of acting in light of this which I think are unwholesome \u2014 e.g. talking as though people who haven\u2019t looked into this or don\u2019t agree are stupid, or developing disdain for normal institutions; the wholesome EA perspective avoids doing these</li><li>(I do think that how to talk about issues which are not broadly recognized as issues is delicate and can be tricky to get right, and mistakes usually contain some trace of unwholesomeness \u2014 there is, after all, unwholesomeness everywhere \u2014 but this is less than the unwholesomeness that would come from refusing to think about things that seem like they may be the most important issues of our time)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Again, I don\u2019t think my picture here is a stretch from the normal English sense of the word \u201cwholesomely\u201d. Rather it\u2019s just part of taking the idea of acting wholesomely seriously. Here\u2019s what ChatGPT had to say when I asked it:</p><blockquote><p>Failing to act on the most important things can be seen as a failure to act wholesomely, especially when it reflects a neglect of moral responsibilities, a lack of concern for the well-being of others, or an absence of integrity in prioritizing what truly matters.</p></blockquote><h2>Finding wholesomeness within an EA worldview</h2><p>In some ways the picture I just presented doesn\u2019t have much content. It could be read as \u201cthose things you thought were obviously good anyway? EAs should still care about those\u201d. Well,&nbsp;<i>obviously</i>. Except \u2026 the reason I\u2019m writing this out is that while it may seem obvious that the final answer should involve caring about them, it\u2019s not necessarily obvious how to subsume them into the EA worldview.</p><p>In the last section I implicitly proposed that the whole question, \u201chow to subsume them into the EA worldview\u201d, might be the wrong way up. It\u2019s more natural to think of it as \u201chow to subsume the EA worldview into acting wholesomely\u201d, and this is also easier to answer.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:50.27%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/cdl5hr6bhh3g0wyextsg\"></figure><p>However, some readers may be&nbsp;<i>starting</i> with an EA worldview. In that case we might need to construct arguments for the importance of wholesomeness as a principle for high-level decision-making. I think this is possible; it is part of the purpose (executed imperfectly) of these three essays. It is now my tentative belief that it will be a roundabout way of putting wholesomeness on top. But I have not yet argued for that.</p><p>Still, the preceding section demonstrates that adopting a worldview which puts wholesomeness at the top need not involve giving up on the heart of EA. I think it will achieve many or all of the things of central importance to the EA worldview, and will additionally have advantages (discussed across the three essays) which are valued by the EA worldview. And the EA worldview is unusually committed to recommending the actions which are robustly predicted to have good consequences, whatever they are (hence including shifts in worldview). I have, therefore, argued that wholesome EA is at least a plausible contender worldview to adopt, even if starting with a purely EA worldview which does not value wholesomeness for its own sake.</p><h1>Central challenges of wholesome EA</h1><p>In this section I\u2019ll consider two central challenges that must be grappled with by people acting along wholesome EA lines. These challenges aren\u2019t unique to wholesome EA; in fact, versions of them can be framed for anyone trying to act wholesomely, or trying to do good. But a wholesome EA perspective makes them especially salient \u2014 in a way that I think is good. Since anyone acting must grapple with these challenges and make tradeoffs, it seems better to make those choices consciously than implicitly or without noticing that there are tradeoffs.</p><h2>Wholesomeness vs expedience</h2><p>Often people would prefer all else equal for things to be as wholesome as possible, but feel that all else&nbsp;<i>isn\u2019t</i> equal; making things more wholesome takes effort, and that\u2019s effort that could be put to other good purposes. Navigating this properly means handling two related balancing acts:</p><ol><li>When to prioritize moving forward faster vs addressing more known pieces of unwholesomeness</li><li>When to prioritize moving forward faster vs searching to find unknown aspects of unwholesomeness</li></ol><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:85.93%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/lzvaecjcopyy2qvqdtwf\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/lj58qrjijtcfomgnvo6n 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/i22f0xseowo0kzfudqek 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/nm4qowqd6w8p74btubr9 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/cwsoennz726dvefh2hjs 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/sxwuxziutg5aakhhslun 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/nenjuygvb9czndijfu4w 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/jwwjzg7jlcpbgq5caaqv 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/fsbjdrml1z1iguptkjpp 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/igd49o3kla9kyeebi4dy 1620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/skucmirheljyk1yfs5xx 1792w\"></figure><p>Of these, #1 is relatively the more straightforward: if you have the different considerations in front of you, you can hold them up and ask \u201cwhat is the more wholesome thing to do?\u201d. Sometimes this will mean moving forward and accepting the remaining issues (since your sense of what is wholesome should definitely be tracking the importance of moving faster); sometimes it will mean slowing down to deal with them. Ideally you accept that you are making tradeoffs, and don\u2019t fall into the failure modes of perfectionism, nor of pretending problems aren\u2019t there. Of course we all make many decisions of this type, and we frequently misjudge at the margin exactly where to draw the line, but that\u2019s a kind of challenge we have to just face and try to improve on.</p><p>I think that #2 can be a bit more gnarly. In principle it\u2019s the same kind of decision, but you\u2019re weighing up the known costs of slowing down versus looking for unknown unknowns. This is a subtle kind of judgement call \u2014 made harder by the fact that in the moment it\u2019s often not even recognised as a judgement call. I think people can fall into multiple traps:</p><ul><li>Being single-minded about their objective it can seem like a wasteful distraction to investigate issues that don\u2019t seem like they will help with the core goal (so they under-explore)</li><li>Feeling like it\u2019s crucial to understand all possible issues, people can be reluctant to move forward until they feel that they\u2019ve got a comprehensive grasp of things (so they over-explore)</li></ul><p>Oddly enough I think that EAs may be unusually vulnerable to&nbsp;<i>both</i> of these traps.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwqqpm8sa7ah\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwqqpm8sa7ah\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A relatively normal response to the issue is to invest a modest amount of time in searching for issues and then move forwards. But EAs care a lot about doing the right thing, and optimizing. They\u2019re unusually susceptible to talking themselves into the single-mindedness about their objectives, and they\u2019re also unusually susceptible to putting effort into trying to optimize everything, even when that doesn\u2019t make sense. After soaking in EA ideas, the kind of half-arsed search that someone might normally do doesn\u2019t intuitively feel like it\u2019s the right approach \u2014 but I think for deep pragmatic reasons it often is.</p><h2>Global vs local wholesomeness as the focus of attention</h2><p>We only have so much attention to go around. In the pursuit of wholesomeness, how should we best allocate that between the global and the local? By \u201clocal\u201d I don\u2019t just mean in the sense of \u201clocal communities\u201d, but also in terms of work we\u2019re doing.</p><p>We can imagine that we\u2019re parts of systems larger than ourselves which are collectively trying to make good things happen:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:63.49%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/ghu7lw7adxok3yvhsboa\"></figure><p>In seeking to contribute as well as we can, we could focus more on being a good role-player, learning how to be an excellent cog in the system we\u2019re embedded in, without too much regard for parts of the system far from us.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:70.51%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/qtnxbbkd44yy0p0ny4xq\"></figure><p>This works well if we\u2019re already in the right position and it\u2019s not necessary for our decisions to understand how they\u2019ll be used elsewhere. It works less well if we\u2019re giving up on opportunities to change role or shift the larger-scale behaviour of the system.</p><p>Alternatively we might focus on being a good strategist, building the best models we can of the big picture and what directions it would be best if it moved in, without fretting too much about our local interactions or how we\u2019re going to contribute.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:59.09%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/owgk5cnxffksjhxcv7wk\"></figure><p>This may be epistemically useful for people in the system to spend time doing, but it significantly limits the individual\u2019s ability to coordinate with and contribute well to local systems around them.</p><p>Of course both of these extremes are somewhat unwholesome. The ideal must be some balance, where we pay more attention to local details than details elsewhere in the system, but still maintaining some awareness of the big picture and our role in it.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:70.32%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/m7zigqn8jhpyg3ljaf3h\"></figure><p>Where does this balance lie? That\u2019s a subtle question, and the correct answer may vary significantly with details of the person choosing and their situation. My aim here is not to provide the answer for people, but to point out the existence of the question and the necessity of making tradeoffs. If people realise that they\u2019re making decisions on this whether consciously or not, I think it will be easier to take a bit of time to reflect and consider whether the current balance feels wholesome or needs adjustment.</p><h1>EA mistakes as failures of wholesomeness</h1><p>With my definition of wholesomeness, one might think that just about any mistake is unwholesome \u2014 \u201cthe system just wasn\u2019t putting enough weight on [other parts of the whole]\u201d.</p><p>Nonetheless I think there's a useful distinction between:</p><ul><li>Errors&nbsp;<i>of wholesomeness</i>, where different attitudes towards parts of the whole might predictably have avoided the error<ul><li>e.g. single-minded pursuit of an outcome; treating some issue as toxic in ways that block good judgements; refusal to consider certain classes of effect</li></ul></li><li>Mere errors of assessing the whole, which while failing to make the judgements that are truly best for the whole, don't do so because of some predictable blindspots</li></ul><p>I think that a good fraction of serious mistakes in EA have been errors of wholesomeness, and that if we had systematically better attitudes there, that might make an important difference. (To some extent the claim here is that errors of wholesomeness are more blameworthy than other errors, precisely because they are potentially foreseeable and avertable.)</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD/hhmkoiq3ikkxlt4pswpa\"></figure><p>I think that EA has been especially vulnerable to errors of this type, for reasons gestured at when we looked at the tensions between wholesomeness and straw EA. As a set of ideas, the value of EA comes in the important novel perspectives it offers. These can point to the crucial importance of things otherwise overlooked. Little wonder that people getting swept up in this have sometimes lost touch with all the normal (boring and non-crucial) reasons why normal (boring) things matter, especially if nobody has done the work to translate their importance into an EA ontology.</p><p>Even if you grant that many serious historical mistakes have had this character (which I won\u2019t try to justify in the body of the essay as I\u2019m trying to inhabit the general perspective rather than be too anchored to things in 2024), this isn\u2019t enough to demonstrate that EA&nbsp;<i>should</i> pay more attention to wholesomeness. But it\u2019s enough to demonstrate that there would be some concrete benefits to doing so. I\u2019ll go deeper on the general question of whether it\u2019s worthwhile in the final essay.<br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnym5uz0ey0dn\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefym5uz0ey0dn\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Mathematically-inclined readers might also be interested in Garrabrant\u2019s sequence of posts on<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4hmf7rdfuXDJkxhfg\"><i><u>geometric rationality</u></i></a>, which explore some perspectives which are gentler alternatives to shut-up-and-multiply, and feel thematically related to what I\u2019m saying here.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnwqqpm8sa7ah\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefwqqpm8sa7ah\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I\u2019m not confident about this; at least there are EA-mindset mechanisms which lead to each of the traps, but perhaps the general population has one or both of them at higher prevalence for other reasons.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "BvXkG3PLfdmvoECFb", "title": "This is why we can\u2019t have nice laws", "postedAt": "2024-02-28T18:44:00.172Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Note: This post was crossposted from the </i><a href=\"https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/this-is-why-we-cant-have-nice-laws\"><i>Open Philanthropy Farm Animal Welfare Research Newsletter</i></a><i> by the Forum team, with the author's permission.

First, the value of citizens' initiatives to bypass the factory farm lobby. All US state farm animal welfare laws to date have passed by ballot measure or the threat of one.

In particular, the report discovers the research needs of advocates, like more accessible material, summaries, and reports on how to effect change. These findings will be of interest to animal advocates, researchers, and those interested in the science of effecting change:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>https://faunalytics.org/research-and-data-as-tools/</strong></p><h2><strong>Key Findings:</strong></h2><ol><li><strong>Research and evidence in animal advocacy can be categorized in terms of five purposes, which may inform how the research should be undertaken.&nbsp;</strong>First, being evidence-based helps organizations establish their legitimacy. Almost all organizations report that framing their positions, priorities, and tactics as evidence-based increases their external legitimacy with all types of individuals and institutions they seek to influence. Research and evidence also support internal decision-making on how to act on foundational priorities. Research processes and outputs can build partnerships and alliances across animal advocacy organizations and with other related movements. Evidence is often used to catalyze action by individuals and institutions, and in communication more generally around identifying problems and solutions to animal welfare and wellbeing challenges.</li><li><strong>Most organizations and audiences see peer-reviewed publications and the research behind them as the gold standard for rigor.</strong> Government and industry research is often seen as biased, but also the basis for the dominant systems and narratives and thus cannot be ignored. Animal advocacy organizations are well-positioned to identify research priorities, collect data related to internal strategies, and share evaluation evidence. However, when research is used for the first category, external legitimacy, it is best done by an academic or other institutional researcher not directly affiliated with a specific animal advocacy organization or effort.</li><li><strong>Research is not often used to set foundational priorities for existing organizations, but it is used to shift tactics and identify emerging issues or opportunities for advocacy</strong>. That is, organizations are \u201c<i>tactic flexible and cause inflexible.\u201d&nbsp;</i>While they are not reorienting their missions based on research, they use research and data at every other level\u2014looking for information that supports existing positions, adjusting data points and messaging when new information emerges, and pivoting or reorienting their tactics in the face of new data. Research and knowledge translation that is oriented toward solutions or catalyzing action is useful for a wide range of audiences.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Organizations need evidence syntheses that provide a \u2018state of the state\u2019 on specific topics</strong>, including<strong>&nbsp;</strong>agreement on key facts and figures when possible, as well as detailed annotated bibliographies, exhaustive literature reviews, or similar extensive summaries of the current state of the knowledge on general topics.</li><li><strong>The most foundational gaps in the evidence base are related to how to effect change, especially regarding under-researched species and geographies.&nbsp;</strong>More social science research and knowledge translation is needed on the impact and efficacy of behavioral nudges on one hand and social movement tactics on the other. Organizations also noted that gaps in the evidence base related to particular species, often those that are low economic value or not common in the Global North, and related to specific geographies, especially in the Global South.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Challenges to using existing research include having the time and expertise to translate complexity and ambiguity in research findings into actionable information</strong>. More evidence is needed from evaluation and internal data collection about tactics that work AND tactics that do not work to achieve intended outcomes.</li><li><strong>Many organizations seek out research both actively and passively</strong>. Organizations access new information somewhat passively through extensive affinity networks, and intentionally through knowledge translation hubs and trusted individuals and organizations when seeking information for specific programming and communication purposes.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2><strong>Background:</strong></h2><p>While all animal advocacy organizations have clear mission statements, priorities, and tactics that guide both day-to-day activities and big-picture planning, groups vary in how they use data in their decision-making. There is a growing interest in the animal advocacy ecosystem across many focal areas in taking evidence-based actions and having a research foundation for statements and positions. However, some organizations hypothesize that research and data might not be seen as relevant or able to be integrated with these foundational commitments.</p><p>In the animal advocacy space, Faunalytics acts as a knowledge broker, committed to what\u2019s known as knowledge translation: the process of moving research, data, evidence from original researchers and research outputs into formats and framings for a wide range of actors. That\u2019s why Faunalytics commissioned this study about the use of research in animal advocacy. This isn\u2019t a program evaluation: none of the interview questions mentioned Faunalytics, though several of the participants did in their answers.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of this study is to explore how animal advocacy organizations access, interpret, and use research, data, and other forms of evidence in their work. The research project included primary data collection through interviews and thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. Participants were 20 staff members of animal advocacy organizations around the world, all of which include farmed animals in their mandate.</p><h2><strong>Research Team:</strong></h2><p>This project was conducted by Dr. Kristal Jones of JG Research and Evaluation. Dr. Jo Anderson (Faunalytics) contributed to the research design and reviewed the final report, but was not involved in data collection or analysis, to ensure that this study would provide an anonymous arms-length view of research in animal advocacy.</p><h2><strong>Conclusions:</strong></h2><p><strong><u>Animal Advocacy Organizations Use Research and Evidence in Several Ways</u></strong></p><p>Research and evidence are used to build legitimacy both internally and externally for the decisions, actions, and messages made by animal advocacy organizations. External legitimacy comes from using peer-reviewed and other rigorous research, and is a top priority for organizations whose tactics focus on institutional change in the public and private sectors. Campaigns and communications with the general public use data points alongside storytelling to support the identification of problems and description of solutions. Data are used strategically by organizations to catalyze action, especially on emerging or timely topics and contexts. Knowledge translation processes and formats are most effective when they reflect these varied purposes and applications of research and evidence.</p><p>The research and knowledge translation process can also help build partnerships among animal advocacy organizations, when questions, projects, and findings are coordinated or at least well communicated. Sharing research findings through the knowledge translation process can also build alliances with other social movements, including those focused on climate change, food system transformation, and human health. Collaborative relationships can also increase the efficient use of funding and human resources by ensuring that research projects are not duplicated if a settled evidence base already exists.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>More Evidence Is Needed on Effective Tactics and Emerging Production Systems</u></strong></p><p>The general consensus among interview respondents is that there is ample evidence related to animal wellbeing, animal sentience, and the negative impacts of industrial food and animal entertainment systems. The major and fundamental research gap identified by many people working across different types of organizations is related to the efficacy of different types of tactics. More evidence is needed on how to induce and sustain individual behavior change, the long-term impact of certain tactics like disruptive actions, and the keys to successful social movements. Many of these research topics require more engagement from and investment by social and behavioral science researchers, and also need longer time horizons than other types of research. Funders can support investments in research on tactics that are specific to animal welfare and wellbeing, and knowledge translation organizations and activities can put time into summarizing social and behavioral science evidence from other topics or sectors that could be relevant to animal advocacy organizations.</p><p>There are also evidence gaps for animal species and production systems that are not well-represented in the Global North. More research is needed focused on hotspots for animal production in the Global South, including South and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Many species in these systems are not well-known in the Global North and the evidence base for even a basic understanding of their wellbeing is lacking. Research is also needed about consumer preferences and behaviors in emerging markets, especially in middle-income countries where rising incomes could lead to more consumption of animal products but also more willingness to consider animal welfare and wellbeing, as compared to lower income contexts that lack the resources to make different decisions about the use of animals.</p><p><strong><u>Investments in Collaboration and Knowledge Translation Can Enhance the Impact of Research for Animals</u></strong></p><p>Several key bottlenecks exist in the knowledge translation process from research to application. We need to invest in relationship building among animal advocacy organizations and researchers to ensure that research is relevant for animal advocates. Collaborative relationships could help identify gaps in the evidence base, specific research questions or topics of highest priority, and appropriate translation pathways to ensure that interpretation of findings are able to be used. For instance, successful collaborations between academic researchers and advocates require clear communication of movement needs\u2014for example, to ensure that academics are asking the right questions\u2014as outlined in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/collaborating-successfully-psychological-scientists-and-animal-advocates/\"><u>blog</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ongoing researcher-advocate relationships can also support more efficient discovery and dissemination of new information, rather than individual organizations having to seek out information each time it is needed. Funders need to invest not only in primary research but also in synthesis research (for example, meta-analyses, evidence reviews, and landscape scans) that can highlight connections between animal welfare and wellbeing, and other issue areas like human health and climate. These cross-connections are seen as crucial to broadening campaign and action messages to reach a wider audience and are especially difficult to derive from a single study or disciplinary approach.</p><p>Funders also need to invest in knowledge translation activities. Knowledge translation can come from animal advocacy organizations that conduct their own applied research and evaluation activities, but the lack of time and capacity limits this in practice. Organizations should build time into their grant applications and budgets to support translation work when relevant. Knowledge brokers\u2014organizations that focus on summarizing, integrating, and communicating about the existing body of evidence and research\u2014can be the catalyst for building collaborative relationships early in the research process and can support increased coordination throughout the translation process.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "JLRiedi"}}, {"_id": "CouZejN34igmsTRL8", "title": "Join a live conversation and Q&A on Market Shaping for Impact with Probably Good and Leah Rosenzweig, Development Innovation Lab (UChicago)", "postedAt": "2024-02-28T16:15:27.759Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Probably Good is hosting a virtual conversation and Q&amp;A with Leah Rosenzweig, Director of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=market+shaping+accelerator&amp;oq=market+shaping+accelerator&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"><u>Market Shaping Accelerator</u></a> and Lead Researcher at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/development-innovation-lab/\"><u>Development Innovation Lab</u></a> at University of Chicago.

All opinions and errors are entirely my own.</i></p><h1><strong>0 \u2013 Executive Summary</strong></h1><p>Corporate governance underpins the proper functioning of businesses in all industries, from consumer goods, to finance, to defence. It enables organisations to execute on their primary business objectives by adding structure to systems, introducing independent challenge and ultimately holding decision making in firms to account. This work is essential for safety focused industries, with each having their own unique challenges. Frontier AI research is no different, and arguably contains more challenges than most. This is due to the high potential impacts to society, the accelerating development of research and the relative immaturity of the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Governance also serves a key role in firms by protecting the interests of society. It creates the mechanisms that allow trust to be built between employees and senior leadership, senior management and the board, and the firm as a whole and regulators. These relationships of trust are necessary for policy and regulation to work, and must be fostered with care.</p><h2><strong>0.1 Research Focuses</strong></h2><p>Good corporate governance must be designed intentionally, and tailored to the needs of each organisation. There is much work to be done to understand the systems of frontier AI organisations, and to adapt the lessons learnt in other safety critical industries such as aviation, nuclear, biosecurity and finance. This agenda proposes five primary research areas that can productively contribute to the development of safe AI by improving the governance of frontier AI organisations:</p><ol><li><strong>Risk Assessments&nbsp;</strong> <strong>\u2013 </strong>How should frontier AI organisations design their risk assessment procedures in order to sufficiently acknowledge \u2013 and prepare for \u2013 the breadth, severity and complexity of risks associated with developing frontier AI models?</li><li><strong>Incident Reporting Schemes \u2013 </strong>How should frontier AI organisations design incident reporting schemes that capture the full range of potential risk events, accurately measure risks to all stakeholders, and result in meaningful improvements to control structures?</li><li><strong>Committee Design \u2013 </strong>How can frontier AI organisations utilise committees to provide challenge to their policies and procedures that is informed, independent and actionable?</li><li><strong>Risk Awareness \u2013 </strong>How can frontier AI organisations foster a culture of risk awareness and intelligence across their entire workforce, empowering employees with the knowledge, tools and responsibility to manage risk?</li><li><strong>Senior Management and Board Level Role Definition \u2013 </strong>How should frontier AI organisations define senior leadership roles and responsibilities, ensuring that senior management and members of the board have competence and are held accountable for the harms their work may cause?</li></ol><h2><strong>0.2 Contents of the Document</strong></h2><p>The rest of this document is broken into eight main sections below:</p><ul><li><strong>Section 1</strong> provides an introduction to corporate governance, why it is valuable and the unique challenges of its implementation in the frontier AI industry.</li><li><strong>Sections 2-6 </strong>go into detail on each of the research focuses described above.</li><li><strong>Section 7</strong> lists a selection of open research questions from each of the five research focuses.</li><li><strong>Section 8 </strong>concludes the document, suggesting next steps to take in exploring and answering some of the questions raised above.</li></ul><h1><strong>1 \u2013 Introduction</strong></h1><h2><strong>1.1 What is Corporate Governance?</strong></h2><p>Corporate governance refers to the design, challenge and oversight of procedures, policies and structures within organisations in order to align:</p><ul><li>The objectives of the organisation with its effects on society</li><li>The workings of the organisation with its objectives</li><li>The incentives of individuals within the organisation with the organisation\u2019s objectives</li></ul><p>Corporate governance works to ensure that the people with agency in a company face accountability for the effects of the decisions they make. It does this by defining what good outcomes look like, and encouraging behaviours that achieve those outcomes whilst making malicious or negligent behaviours as inconvenient to perform as possible.</p><h2><strong>1.2 Why is Corporate Governance Valuable?</strong></h2><p>Corporate governance cannot replace good regulation, but it forms an integral and complementary part of any successful regulatory landscape. This is for a few reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Regulators have limited information and resources.</strong> It will be impossible for regulators to have a full understanding of the confidential inner workings of frontier AI organisations, as each one operates uniquely and with complexity. As such, it will be necessary to some extent for these firms to engage with regulators in policing themselves, which can only be trusted by designing robust processes.</li><li><strong>Senior leadership of firms operate with limited information. </strong>Members of senior management of large companies themselves cannot know of everything that goes on in the firm. Therefore, strong communication channels and systems of oversight are needed to effectively manage risks. Furthermore, the interests of individual members of senior leadership may conflict with the larger overall interests of the firm, a variant of the principal agent problem.</li><li><strong>Good intentions don\u2019t necessarily create good outcomes. </strong>The good intentions of individuals in any company cannot reliably be translated into good outcomes of the organisation as a whole. As such, it is important to design processes intelligently so that those good intentions can be acted upon easily.</li></ul><h2><strong>1.3 Challenges of the Frontier AI Industry</strong></h2><p>Although much can be learned from practices in other industries, there are a number of unique challenges in implementing good corporate governance in AI firms. One such challenge is the immaturity of the field and technology. This makes it difficult currently to define standardised risk frameworks for the development and deployment of systems. It also means that many of the firms conducting cutting edge research are still relatively small; even the largest still in many ways operate with \u201cstart-up\u201d cultures. These are cultures that are fantastic for innovation, but terrible for safety and careful action.&nbsp;</p><p>Another challenge is that the majority of the severe risks come from the rapidly developing and changing frontier of research. This means that any governance framework needs to be flexible enough to adapt to changes in technology and practice, whilst still having the necessary structure to provide accountability for actors at the individual, managerial and organisational levels.</p><p>A final challenge is the lack of existing regulation in the field. Regulations and guidelines provide a compass to firms wishing to understand where their direction of focus should be. It gives organisations templates for what good practice looks like, and this is sorely missing in the realm of frontier AI. In an absence of clear regulation individual actors will devise their own boundaries, resulting in a dangerous complexity and variation within the sector.</p><h2><strong>1.4 Research Focuses</strong></h2><p>The next sections of this document describe five key areas of research that should be prioritised to create effective structures of governance within frontier AI labs. These have been formed based on reviews of existing literature on corporate governance in AI, as well as a review of processes and policies that are well established in other safety-critical industries. They are split into the following sections:</p><ul><li>Section 2 \u2013 Risk Assessments</li><li>Section 3 \u2013 Incident Reporting Schemes</li><li>Section 4 \u2013 Committee Design</li><li>Section 5 \u2013 Risk Awareness</li><li>Section 6 \u2013 Senior Management and Board Level Role Definition</li></ul><h1><strong>2 \u2013 Risk Assessments</strong></h1><p>Risk assessments are a standard in any safety critical industry, and can be difficult to design. There are a few key considerations that warrant particular attention and focus.</p><h2><strong>2.1 Risk Methodologies</strong></h2><p>Effective assessment of risk requires the use of a diverse set of methodologies. Work is required to adapt the techniques of other industries, as well as learn from their experiences, so that they are suitable for assessing the operations of frontier AI labs.</p><h3><strong>Comprehensive Risk and Control Assessment</strong></h3><p>The Comprehensive Risk and Control Assessment (abbreviated here to CRCA) is a process to thoroughly catalogue the list of risks that a company may be exposed to, systematically evaluating their impacts and likelihoods. The effectiveness of controls mitigating each risk are then considered to determine an overall level of residual risk. Efforts to create comprehensive risk registers and develop a framework for accurately assessing impact and likelihood are needed.</p><h3><strong>Critical Scenario Analysis</strong></h3><p>Critical Scenario Analysis (CSA) processes take a severe set of scenarios and roleplay how a company would respond to them with senior managers. This allows the firm to gain an understanding of its critical weaknesses in handling worst-case incidents.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Incident Post-Mortems</strong></h3><p>When an incident has actually occurred, effective post-mortem processes will allow stakeholders to understand how things went wrong and enact remedial actions to prevent such incidents from happening again. Robust processes need to be designed so that these post-mortems feedback into the risk management framework. This is discussed further in Section 3.</p><h2><strong>2.2 Designing Effective Risk Assessments</strong></h2><p>For risk assessment processes to actually be useful in the prevention of disasters, they must be developed with the following properties in mind.</p><h3><strong>Risk coverage</strong></h3><p>The most essential consideration of any risk assessment framework is whether it is successful in considering <i>all</i> risks.&nbsp; In other industries, comprehensive coverage of risks has only been achieved the hard way, through the loss of money and lives. This is a route that cannot be taken for frontier AI. Instead, failure modes must be anticipated, with risk registers that account for the potential of as many things going wrong&nbsp; as possible. Work must be done to prepare for black swans, how they can be handled when they appear, and to adapt and grow risk registers as the field itself grows.</p><h3><strong>Risk prioritisation</strong></h3><p>Although a broad understanding of the full risk landscape is necessary, special attention needs to be paid to the risks that present the most danger. Prioritised risks should be defined at a more granular level, and have deeper control frameworks to accompany them. As such, creating the right metrics for deciding this prioritisation is very important.</p><h3><strong>Risk thresholds</strong></h3><p>It is impossible to fully eliminate risk, but it can be possible to define what acceptable thresholds of risk look like. This has been achieved in other industries, and must be done for frontier AI. There is a unique challenge to AI governance in creating thresholds that take into account the many ways that this technology can negatively impact society.</p><h3><strong>Control frameworks</strong></h3><p>For any risk assessment to be meaningful, it must come with a thorough audit of the control frameworks that exist to mitigate the risks. Control ecosystems for specific areas of risk must be defined robustly to prevent the worst outcomes. Having understood the current control framework, this must then be challenged and adapted to prepare for&nbsp; the perceived scenarios of the future.</p><h1><strong>3 \u2013 Incident Reporting Schemes</strong></h1><p>It is impossible to prevent all bad outcomes. As such, it is essential to understand when things have gone wrong and why. Developing strong incident reporting schemes will be necessary for any model evaluation regimes to be effective, as well as many other forms of regulation.</p><h2><strong>3.1 Incident definition</strong></h2><p>Successful schemes require clear definitions of what constitutes an incident, as well as understanding when certain events are \u201cnear-misses\u201d, where an incident was prevented by sheer luck. These definitions should allow for firms to better identify weaknesses in different aspects of their control environment, and prioritise the most important issues to remedy.&nbsp;</p><p>Strong definitions also make it easier for everyone inside a firm to know when a problem requires reporting, making it harder for mistakes to go unscrutinised.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3.2 Measuring harms</strong></h2><p>As part of incident reporting, data collection methods must be designed so that firms will be able to measure the impacts that an incident has had. These harms can be broken down into categories:</p><ul><li>Harms to the firm</li><li>Harms to clients</li><li>Harms to society</li></ul><p>For frontier AI labs, harms to society may be the hardest to measure, but should be considered the most important. Developing processes that recognise this requires engagement with end-users, application developers and regulators in order to conduct such measurements effectively; this should be considered vital.</p><h2><strong>3.3 Effective post-mortems</strong></h2><p>One of the key features of good incident reporting processes is the output of well documented post-mortems. Understanding the main actors and systems involved in an incident or near miss and the timeline of events is necessary for identifying weaknesses in process, as well as harms that may not have been initially obvious.</p><h2><strong>3.4 Accountability</strong></h2><p>Measures to provide appropriate accountability for the firm following incidents need to be developed. These should take the work of post-mortems and turn the understanding of where systems failed into actions that prevent future issues. In particular, there should be clear procedures that may be triggered by the discovery of certain incidents, including:</p><ul><li>Updating risk assessments</li><li>Disciplinary actions taken against certain employees</li><li>Research pausing</li><li>Recall of model deployments</li><li>Regulator notification.</li></ul><h1><strong>4 \u2013 Committee Design</strong></h1><h2><strong>4.1 Properties of well-designed committees</strong></h2><p>Well-designed committees can effect large change in organisations, coordinating larger risk management strategies and protecting the interests of third parties. In order for this to happen, committees should be designed to provide effective challenge and have agency in the company\u2019s decision making.</p><h3><strong>Challenge</strong></h3><p>Providing effective challenge refers to the ability to diagnose relevant issues in the company and propose practical options to solve them. Doing so requires an in-depth understanding of the company\u2019s processes and technology, and an ability to consider systems from intrinsic and extrinsic points of view.&nbsp; It also requires self-awareness about how personal motivations of the members may conflict with the stated objectives of the committee, combined with an active effort to adjust for those biases. These requirements can be considered along two axes of context and independence, as shown below.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7vcEq6nGojvhSTKo2/pxx7clxyicltjnbvimjo\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7vcEq6nGojvhSTKo2/pxx7clxyicltjnbvimjo 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7vcEq6nGojvhSTKo2/l7b2z3ndclcx111c5tnx 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7vcEq6nGojvhSTKo2/n4bwplkostathdyfhgx2 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7vcEq6nGojvhSTKo2/zo8vjsk0654mdost4kie 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7vcEq6nGojvhSTKo2/whxf3qyxlsqrgn4qmaze 1024w\"></p><h3><strong>Agency</strong></h3><p>Beyond the ability for a committee to effectively challenge firm practices, it must also be able to act on those challenges and have meaningful decision-making power. This comes as a result of careful process planning, where committees review plans at key strategic moments. Processes should be designed to prioritise the gathering of information such that relevant committees can make informed decisions at the earliest opportunities, preventing wasted work and undesirable outcomes. These decisions should include the ability to prevent the deployment and perhaps even training of models \u2013 work needs to be done to consider the full list of appropriate actions for different committees to be able to take.</p><h2><strong>4.2 Types of committees</strong></h2><p>The following list is not exhaustive, but should be considered a minimum for firms to consider implementing.</p><h3><strong>Audit and Evaluations</strong></h3><p>Audit committees are a standard part of the corporate governance framework for any major company, informing the processes by which audits take place and providing accountability for the implementation of recommendations. A key expectation of an effective audit committee is that it reviews not just the processes and the figures, but equally importantly the thinking, rationale, risks, and potential for variance that sit behind those processes and figures. For frontier AI labs this needs to go one step further, with model evaluations being considered a core additional part of the auditing framework. This will require extra technical expertise on such committees, and it may be advantageous to consider the use of separated subcommittees for each function.</p><h3><strong>Risk</strong></h3><p>Risk committees form an essential part of the risk assessment and management framework, working to define appropriate risk thresholds and oversee the strengthening of control frameworks. Risk committees also hold a responsibility to ensure the risk assessment methodologies are sound and create a full coverage of risks as discussed in Section 2.1. In particular, AI firms should consider forming additional subcommittees for cybersecurity and advanced capabilities research.</p><h3><strong>Ethics</strong></h3><p>Ethics committees take a key role in decision making that may have particularly large negative impacts on society. For frontier AI labs, such committees will have their work cut out for them. Work should be done to consider the full list of processes ethics committees should have input in, but it will likely include decisions around:</p><ul><li>Model training, including<ul><li>Appropriate data usage</li><li>The dangers of expected capabilities</li></ul></li><li>Model deployments</li><li>Research approval</li></ul><h1><strong>5 \u2013 Risk Awareness</strong></h1><p>Despite the importance of procedure, policy and strategy in developing a safety-first organisation, these will never be sufficient to fully eliminate risk. In fact, a company can have a well-designed risk management framework on paper that is completely ineffective in practice, due to the lack of awareness with which it is operated. As such, development of techniques to foster a risk-aware culture in frontier AI organisations that understands the unique dangers of the technology is vital. There are multiple routes to fostering risk awareness across a workforce that require careful implementation in these firms.</p><h2><strong>5.1 Training</strong></h2><p>One standard across many industries is training initiatives to raise awareness of specific risks. This is often implemented in other industries in order to directly address the requirements of more prescriptive regulations; the finance industry employs Anti-Money Laundering training to all employees as a standard, just as food safety training is mandated in the catering industry.&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge for frontier AI firms by comparison is that many of the severe risks posed by AI are of a more esoteric nature, with much current uncertainty about how failure modes may present themselves. One potential area of study is the development of more general forms of risk awareness training, e.g. training for developing a \u201cscout mindset\u201d or to improve awareness of black swan events.</p><h2><strong>5.2 Control frameworks and monitoring</strong></h2><p>Developing a more risk aware culture also involves the development of control frameworks that make risks easier to detect, empowering all people in an organisation with the information required to be able to raise issues and take appropriate actions. Understanding the right data that is needed, how best to visualise it and who to communicate it to will be an important step in the building of a strong risk management infrastructure.</p><h2><strong>5.3 Culture</strong></h2><p>Beyond the specific measures described above, the importance of good company culture cannot be overstated. An effective, risk-aware culture serves multiple purposes, from encouraging workers in every function to spot and report potential incidents, to building stronger control frameworks, to deterring rogue-employees-to-be from taking actions that would incite disaster.&nbsp;</p><p>Though culture can be the strongest asset in an organisation\u2019s risk management toolkit, it is also the hardest to build, measure, and take credit for. It requires a strong control framework in all other aspects, constant maintenance, and a genuine commitment from senior leadership.</p><h3><strong>The role of risk management functions</strong></h3><p>One guidepost in developing and assessing the level of risk awareness in an organisation\u2019s culture is the internal attitude towards risk management functions. Companies with strong control frameworks on paper can suffer major incidents, only for it to later be realised that those control frameworks were seen as tick box exercises, rather than genuinely valuable processes to engage with. This has been seen in many safety critical industries, from finance to biosecurity.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to build risk aware cultures, a positive relationship with risk processes must be fostered. This involves work on both sides. Efforts must be made to emphasise the importance of risk prevention and mitigation for those not in risk management roles, but the people developing risk processes must also endeavour to make them as unburdensome as possible whilst still effectively solving the problems they are meant to address.</p><h1><strong>6 \u2013 Senior Management and Board Level Role Definition</strong></h1><p>Effective governance requires effective leadership. In particular, senior leadership roles need to have a clear understanding of their responsibilities. With these responsibilities well defined, senior managers and members of the board are empowered to make themselves aware of the risks from their functions, with a mandate to act in mitigating these risks. Equally, it also means that there are clear routes to accountability when there is a failure to sufficiently anticipate and mitigate risk.</p><h2><strong>6.1 Defining roles effectively</strong></h2><p>In order to effectively define roles, there must first be a clear definition of the functions that operate in the business. This allows roles to then be defined such that:</p><ul><li>Someone in senior leadership has responsibility over each function</li><li>The skills and experience needed to successfully fill the senior role are easy to determine</li><li>There can be meaningful separation of duties</li></ul><p>Firms may wish to take inspiration from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\u2019s Senior Managers Regime in creating this definition, though a standardised framework should be built for the industry.</p><h2><strong>6.2 Reporting lines</strong></h2><p>To create meaningful structures of responsibility within organisations, clear reporting lines need to be established at all levels. This refers not just to the concept of an \u201corg chart\u201d of who manages who, but also reporting lines at the process level, with well understood ownership of cross-functional processes. This also applies to risks, with risk owners that have the tools necessary to mitigate them within the thresholds defined in consultation with the risk committee. These reporting lines will feed back into the senior leadership, concretely defining their responsibilities on a practical level. Care should be taken to ensure this practical definition, based on the actual operations of the company, is aligned with the on paper definitions described above.</p><h3><strong>Communication channels</strong></h3><p>As part of creating meaningful reporting lines, communication channels must be structured so that important information is able to reach the correct set of people. Although formal channels such as regular meetings, reports and reviews are necessary, informal channels should also be recognised and carefully considered. These communication channels are vital for effective implementation of the risk assessments, incident reporting schemes and committees described previously.</p><h2><strong>6.3 Accountability</strong></h2><p>Creating clearly defined senior roles in organisations allows firms and regulators to develop measures to enforce accountability. This has shown to be effective in other industries, with a report on the UK\u2019s Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR) for financial institutions finding that senior leadership meaningfully changed practices as a result of becoming individually liable for harms from incidents.</p><h1><strong>7 \u2013 Open Research Questions</strong></h1><p>All of the research focuses discussed above are broad in scope and largely unexplored within AI governance. As such, there are many questions that need answering in order to develop the field and create practical implementations for firms and regulators alike. This section lists a selection of more concrete research questions that currently deserve more in-depth investigation.

designing good corporate governance practices are complex, and require the involvement of experts both in industry and in government. The previous section demonstrates the breadth of questions in this area that need answering. Within these questions lies an opportunity for society to develop this revolutionary technology of frontier AI whilst avoiding the potential catastrophes it may bring.&nbsp;</p><p>There are huge technical research questions that must be answered to avoid tragedy, including important advancements in technical AI safety, evaluations and regulation. It is the author\u2019s opinion that corporate governance should sit alongside these fields, with a few questions requiring particular priority and focus:</p><ol><li>How can frontier AI organisations design effective risk and control assessments that take into account as many of the severe scenarios as possible?</li><li>How can frontier AI organisations design informed, independent and agentic committees to challenge the aspects of their business that can cause the most harm to society?</li><li>How can frontier AI organisations create a culture of careful, risk aware individuals and robust control frameworks that can react to the numerous black swans that the future may hold?</li></ol><p>These problems are tractable, and solving them would contribute significantly to avoiding the worst outcomes capabilities research may cause.&nbsp;</p><p>Most safety critical industries have learnt these lessons through a path of blood and tears \u2013 the scope of disaster that frontier AI models may cause means we must do better.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Appendix \u2013 Existing Literature</strong></h1><p>The following are all papers specifically concerning topics of corporate governance in the frontier AI industry.</p><h2><strong>Broad Overviews</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/7/275\"><i>Corporate Governance of Artificial Intelligence in the Public Interest</i></a><i> </i>(P Cihon, J Schuett &amp;

I went through a stint in partial hospitalization earlier this semester, while I still taught at a small liberal arts college (I still have my job there), and now have a treatment plan that me and my doctors must now follow. It's been immensely helpful, thankfully.</p>\n<p>I'm a fourth year Ph.D student in Experimental Psychology who is basically one of the \"unicorns\" who got in with a questionable academic record (3.3 BS, 3.48 MA GPA and 3.25 years of research experience and one graduate conference poster prior to my Ph.D). Suffice it to say, I didn't exactly have a good graduate career and who I've consulted (career services and even my own advisor) has not helped me in the slightest. Currently, I'm a visiting full time instructor at a SLAC and have a fellowship where I need to teach full time for a year in exchange for funding. I thought this position would give me some spark to get back into the game but it's done the opposite and made me more jaded. I also have a conference coming up that my advisor wants me to go to despite having a public panic attack at the exact same conference last academic year. This past summer I wasn't working at all sadly.</p>\n<p>Notable \"mishaps:\" -Waiting on my MA advisor to say something before I did anything (he never even read my program progress reports). I wound up racking up a multitude of \"red flags\" that I had no idea were a thing by the time I applied to Ph.D programs (low Master's GPA, C+ grade in a core course that I did not remediate, no additional 10 hours of research or teaching related work in the second year of my program that I could've applied for my first Spring semester).</p>\n<p>-Despite this, I got an interview at an R1 (got rejected cause I bombed the interview) and accepted at an R2. I feel like I hit my stride my first year of my Ph.D program by getting all As and A-s in my program. However, I was told to work on nothing but my quals project my second year of my Ph.D and didn't do any additional projects or conferences. My advisor eventually dumps me due to a misunderstanding and I was fortunately picked up as an advisee by the department chair. Although the department chair wanted me to work on additional research projects, this never happened because I couldn't focus at all. I now know this was due to borderline cognitive functioning assessed via the RBANS. That and the severe autistic burnout I had this past summer meant no additional research projects whatsoever.</p>\n<p>I'm in a bind now since I got a competitive fellowship that awarded me $11k and I need to complete a year's worth of full time teaching as well as graduate with my Ph.D or I have to return the money. Thankfully, I will fulfill those requirements via a visiting instructor position at a SLAC this academic year (which I'm not doing well at all). What could I do post Ph.D that fits within the limits of what I can reasonably do? My CV is only 3 pages and I don't have much going for me. I'm not eligible to go on disability either but I can get a Schedule A hiring letter at least.</p>\n<p>Being brutually honest with myself as well, I would go as far as to say I did everything wrong.</p>\n<p>I never did multiple projects, never collaborated with others in the department, and always worked on one major project at a time (even now that's the case).</p>\n<p>Here's more things that went wrong:</p>\n<p>-Not taking additional research assistant experience when I had 10 hour assistantships at the MA level</p>\n<p>-Not being mindful in class the first year of my MA program (hence the low overall MA GPA)</p>\n<p>-Cs in Spring seminars both years of MA program's presentations (which gave me a B and B+ in those classes and hurt my overall GPA)</p>\n<p>-Accidentally overstated my undergrad research assistant experience as 9 months rather than 3 months due to a misunderstanding on my end, but the programs I applied to took it as is anyway</p>\n<p>-Went into an MA program that gave an assistantship without a tuition waiver despite it being thesis based. The reason I did this? That specific program had 80% of students who were interested in a Ph.D program get their foot in the door. I regret this big time since I had a fully funded offer on the other side of the country for a Psychology MA program (no specific subdiscipline) that was more clinical based but it would've prevented me from taking out $24k in student loans for just tuition in the Experimental Psychology (now called Psychological Science) program I attended at a well known regional college in the NC state system. It would've been only $8k for a Master's overall if my first year was in-state tuition but it wasn't. I didn't learn till after the fact that the admit rate from their program to Ph.D was that high since those students got into R2 Ph.D programs for the most part (which I'm in right now)</p>\n<p>-All of the other \"notable mishaps\" on my old post</p>\n<p>Ph.D stuff:</p>\n<p>-Not doing well at a visiting instructor position at SLAC (see my other posts on this account if you want to know the details but it's not necessary to review them)</p>\n<p>-Not doing other work outside of my quals project, even though my advisor wanted me to work on it for 7 hours a day and indirectly discouraged me from pursuing additional research or more work. Since it wasn't like I was being monitored at all, I could've done so much more.</p>\n<p>-Never collaborating with anyone else and doing one project at a time.</p>\n<p>External factors:</p>\n<p>-MA program and its awful funding</p>\n<p>-COVID (obvious, but needs to be stated since I didn't have much going for me from 2018 to February 2020 and COVID happened at the same time). Even if I had more initiative, COVID would've stopped any additional studies I planned during my MA since in-person subjects were a necessity</p>\n<p>-Ph.D program and its awful funding. Got a $14k a year stipend (it was modest given I'm in a low COL rural area in Michigan). This got knocked down to $7k by my third year and I used the whole tuition waiver to pay off the rest of my program. This meant this year wasn't funded for me and is why I decided to be a visiting instructor at the SLAC.</p>\n<p>-MA advisor not really giving me much advice at all and gave me a bit too much freedom to my own detriment that was part of the reason for my currently awful resume and CV</p>\n<p>-First Ph.D advisor dumping me over a misunderstanding about lab procedures by the end of the second year of my Ph.D program (this was partially because she knew of the budget cuts coming). She (my first advisor) dumped all projects she wanted to do with me (keep in mind they were submitted to the IRB, but I wasn't allowed to work on them at the time) after my qualifier project was done and passed. This didn't happen though and, for the rest of that Spring 2022 semester and Summer 2022, I didn't work on additional projects with who would by my new advisor until he saw that I passed my qualifier project.</p>\n<p>How did someone like me get into an MA and then Ph.D program if I didn't take much initiative and have bad social anxiety?</p>\n<p>I had a career coach help me write and edit materials accordingly so I knew how to sell myself to get in the door. I had an LOR from someone I did RA work in high school, a family friend who was a professor who taught full time, and a graduate student whose stats class I got an A in (my undergrad didn't do plusses or minuses). I also reached out and contact folks in programs in 2018 by meeting with them virtually via Skype at the time. They looked out for my application. It was difficult for me to do it all on my own. There was also that error for lab experience that worked out in my favor. I also had lab experience my senior year of high school for internship credit and that helped too.</p>\n<p>I'm working with this career coach again and have been for over a year now since I originally thought I was going to finish early with my old advisor, but that didn't happen after the fallout. Thankfully, the career coach was able to help me with remaining professional in the midst of the fallout and not make things worse. Since I recently finished data collection and need to analyze the results soon, I just need to analyze my data, write up everything (Results and Discussion), then defend it hopefully in a couple of months. I haven't done anything towards it for the past few weeks due to how behind I am in teaching (still) and grading after my stint in partial hospitalization.</p>\n<p>For my final thoughts, I know some are going to say Imposter's Syndrome and that I have more than what I'm giving myself credit for in this case. However, I don't think that's the case here. I truly had barriers (both my own and outside of my control) that got in the way and now I'm in a weird position. I definitely wished I didn't do graduate school or a Ph.D at all in hindsight since I never had Imposter's Syndrome but was completely and totally out of my depth given all of the outside help (my parents hired a life coach who I'd speak to weekly or as needed since they didn't want me to take a break from undergrad at all or they wouldn't support me), mental health that's only got worse (PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder - Severe), and extremely low productivity on my end.</p>\n<p>What can I do to salvage my situation and find work that may be potentially more suited to what I have?</p>\n<p>For those wondering, I'm working with a vendor through vocational rehabilitation so they can officially find me jobs and (this is the biggest thing) apply to them for me. I'm meeting them tomorrow to go over the resume, CV, and cover letter they made for me as well as what work would be reasonable for me given my current skillset and level of functioning. I also have a Schedule A letter and am applying for job listings in the social science categories (e.g., Social Science Analyst) for disabled individuals specifically so I don't need to go through competitive hiring at all.</p>\n<p>I'm in the US.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "zzmnd"}}, {"_id": "fKKML2xvuTNcAtwbj", "title": "Hello everyone!", "postedAt": "2024-02-29T13:49:54.454Z", "htmlBody": "<p>New user here looking forward to contributing. 4th year student in Applied Experimental Psychology slated to graduate hopefully by this August.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "zzmnd"}}, {"_id": "qtDLZsM5rypkEHxYm", "title": "Counting arguments provide no evidence for AI doom", "postedAt": "2024-02-27T23:03:49.333Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Nora Belrose"}}, {"_id": "FdixLsmC6BzeqwJe7", "title": "IV.

I will attach the video at the end of this blog.</p><p><i><strong>A</strong>nimal Weapons: The Evolution of Battle is written by an evolutionary biologist, who extended research into arms and armament evolution while studying the origin of weapons in varied species found all across nature.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here we go...</p><p>In the final part, the author starts by recalling the significance of defense in the setting of a conflict. We are introduced to Siafu, a deadly variety of predatory African ants. These ants are known to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rhmCIuhSAqA?si=YUrTpd6Nwt4u9u81\">kill and eat anything</a> in their way. Surprisingly, these ants have a hard time with termites because of their sophisticated shelters. Termite mounds are built like fortresses, with walls acting like force multipliers, dedicated alarm signals, and kill zones. Breaching a colony of termites is difficult for Siafu as their strength lies in their numbers. Inside the mounds, a direct duel in the tunnels results in the termite\u2019s victory due to their large weapon and body size. The sheer number of ants is neutralized by the meticulous fortification of the mounds. The chain of command works like clockwork, with workers blocking the gates upon receiving the signal and soldiers facing the intruders in several blocks while the queen and eggs are secured on the top of the towers. Other times, when the ants get lucky, large tunnelers like aardvarks gape through the mounds to get a fill of termites. The ants use this opportunity as a cheat to breach the defense and launch an all-out attack.</p><p>Similar arrangements of siege warfare are observed across Europe, Middle-east and parts of Asia throughout history. Just like the Saifus and termites, battles have unfolded between the Assyrian societies and Lachish.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"zqo2o3ujjr\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzqo2o3ujjr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzqo2o3ujjr\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;According to the author, the city of Lachish exemplified this style of ancient fortification. The Assyrian siege strategies applied overwhelming forces to different parts of the fortress, with carefully engineered siege towers constructed on-site at the same time. These towers house huge iron-tipped battering rams suspended by a frame large enough to swing back and forth. Upon breach, the strength of the Assyrian army was unmatched at the time, with rapid-firing archers and foot soldiers with shields, pikes, and swords in massive numbers. Defense architecture has undergone multiple changes/updates in different parts of Eurasia. We do not observe such fortifications in the case of Mayans, Aztecs, and other Mesoamerican civilizations, as they did not develop heavy siege weapons. Towers, Castles, forts, Starforts, etc, have their remains scattered at present times. What caused their extinction are not ballistas and catapults. Gunpowder and explosives changed everything.</p><hr><h2>What sets the human arms race apart?</h2><p>One valid argument is that humans manufacture weapons from the materials obtained from the environment. They act as separate entities to our battles. They get damaged, broken, and repaired but do not affect our bodies in the process. Whereas in animals, the weapons are attached to their bodies and get modifications parallel to their anatomy. One could argue that there is a clear distinction between our world and theirs, so there shouldn\u2019t be a correlation between the two arms races. The author argues that the circumstances triggering the arms race and the stages of the evolution of weapons are the same regardless.</p><p>Animals also manufacture their weapons, just like we saw in the case of termites. Genetic information is transferred from parents to offspring through templates of their DNA. The evolution of their DNA and further mutation directly result from how efficiently or poorly the previous weapon performed. For instance, the antlers of the progeny resemble the father, for he was the victor of the battle of strongest antlers. Although the cultural information is not encoded in the DNA, the transmission along the timeline follows the same path. The selection pressure applied is the same. Biological evolution is a diverse criterion, but there are apprenticeship and replication criteria that play connecting roles in both arms races. Cultural information travels faster than genetic information. It can cross borders and taught by other agents like spies and travelers. Since cultural information is learned rather than inherited, it can transferred from person to person. The same is present in bacteria and viruses, which carry and transfer genetic information, deriving mutations across animal species.</p><p>The key difference is that the cultural traits of a weapon are not related to the reproductive success of the wielder. Antlers are evolved along with the body of the elk who wears them. Human evolution works independently from weapons evolution. If we keep them separate, we can compare the animal weapons with ours. The successful traits of human weapons like rifles and missiles are passed down to the next generation. Innovation takes the role of mutation. The constant experimentation with design and use efficiency is replicated with each update along with the changes. As we have seen, advances in artilleries pushed for better fortifications and strategies and vice versa. This cycle spirals into an arms race, just like in the case of prey and predators. The battles we get are reminiscent of the ones with beetles, crabs, elks, etc.</p><hr><h2>Warring States of the Modern Times</h2><p>The wars of modern times are quintessentially defined by armed vehicles. Vehicles can be considered very similar to animals as they burn energy to travel while carrying the weight of their body and maintaining speeds.</p><p>As the majority of the space on Earth kept getting established,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"394hl4u2td6\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref394hl4u2td6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn394hl4u2td6\">[2]</a></sup></span>the competition and economic defensibility grew exponentially among the turbulent governments around the world. During the Modern Era, the seas were rampant with naval warfare fueled with gunpowder and canons.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"agvehqqgj85\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefagvehqqgj85\"><sup><a href=\"#fnagvehqqgj85\">[3]</a></sup></span>As the first two ingredients were provided by the states, ships started dueling at close range triggering another arms race at the sea in the 1600s. This time marks the development of the sailing warship, The Galleon. These ships were propelled by wind and had sturdy hulls capable of withstanding storms and extending the voyages in the open ocean. The evolution of this technology was so significant that it gave rise to the golden age of piracy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"njc4cuxzvu\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnjc4cuxzvu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnjc4cuxzvu\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;With time, they grew larger, faster, and deadlier, with the number of canons pushing the size of the ships to be bigger than battlegrounds on lands. But soon, like in animals, the size proved to be a liability than an advantage. Big galleons were ill-suited for ramming; smaller, faster ships would sneak into the fleet with men carrying fast-loading rifles and dismantle the formation, or taint the canons. By the eighteenth century, bigger ships weren\u2019t just worth the cost, and the arms race ended. The invention of airplanes changed everything. Battleships nowadays have some to the point of extinction and sea travel has become central to global trade and export.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"l71570psqo8\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl71570psqo8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl71570psqo8\">[5]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Air reconnaissance was deemed the future of wars for centuries before the invention of the aircraft.

By the WWII, \u201cair superiority\u201d had become the priority for success in battle. The planes had categories by then\u2014from transport carriers to lightweight fighter bombers and heavy bombers.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"22rgtqmobkg\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref22rgtqmobkg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn22rgtqmobkg\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The fierce competition pushed the arms race to exponential heights. <i>Model after model hit the skies, each a bit faster and better than the last.</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"gc95l04r6yh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgc95l04r6yh\"><sup><a href=\"#fngc95l04r6yh\">[8]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p>By the time the war ended, human civilization was posed to enter the two arms races interlinked together to form the deadliest one in history: Air superiority and Nuclear warfare. The rapid evolution of bomber aircraft even forced the pilots to their limit, with fighter jets pushing past the supersonic speeds. The two superpowers remaining after the war, the United States and the USSR, made way for the grandest scale of arms race between the rival nations. States are even more like animals than vehicles. They consume resources while competing with each other for the control of these resources<i>. </i>In this case, unlike the ancient times, these rival nations compete to get access to energy, mainly in the form of oil. When states compete, the individual that confronts each other are rival governments. During this time, these states spend more and more of their resources on weapons until the race culminates into an outright war. Or one spends beyond its capabilities and collapses. Just like the Irish Elks, who took too much calcium and phosphorus from their skeleton to develop their antlers. They are now extinct.</p><p>Following WWII, the two superpowers entered the Cold Wars along with a series of proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and the Middle East. These were deemed low-risk conventional means for both states to signal to the opposition military and act as deterrents for a full-scale conflict. Most states have a limited resource pool (GDPs) and a discretionary pool. In the case of rich countries like the US and the USSR, these pools extended up to trillions of dollars. In the next forty years, right after dropping nuclear warheads on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we saw the growing fleet of nuclear submarines, dozens of generations of supersonic fighter jets, a new generation of tanks, Unmanned aerial vehicles(UMVs aka Drones), antitank and antiaircraft missiles, anti-mines and bridging vehicles and a barrage of technological advancements for wars fought during that time. On the nuclear side, silos with intercontinental ballistic missiles(ICBMs) were born with nuclear warheads placed into their nose cones. Possessing nuclear power was only as good as living with the explosives in your house. The power to launch them anytime and anywhere was the ultimate deterrent. It pushed Humanity into the space race in the 1960s when the Soviets launched the first space satellite, proving the world their technological prowess. The decades followed huge investments in rocket technologies, missile guiding systems, and propulsion fuels, all designed for the offensive. It was high time for full-scale nuclear war to unfold.</p><p>It is estimated that the US spent 10% of its GDP each year and 70% of its discretionary funds on defense during this period. For the Soviets, the numbers were unclear, but it is believed to be at least 15-17% of the GDP (40% by some estimates) while exceeding the discretionary funds. In December 1991, the USSR collapsed; the following year, all the republics declared independence.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"4frgn95io2\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4frgn95io2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4frgn95io2\">[9]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Weapons of Mass Destruction</h2><p>Humanity faced high chances of extinction more than once during the period of the Cold War, avoided only by luck and the individuals who refused to press the button.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"10\" data-footnote-id=\"oxg4p84p8u\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoxg4p84p8u\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoxg4p84p8u\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We nearly escaped these events, and in the end, deterrence prevailed because of the looming threat of mass destruction. In the Cold War, obtaining nuclear warheads was expensive. They were seen as an honest signal of strength. At present, obtaining them has become both accessible and inexpensive for small rival states. Deterrence only works up to a point. Even in animals, when rival males back off against a stronger opponent, they then seek the ones they can defeat. Both deterrence and honest signals are effective in avoiding a full-scale war, but the case of mass destruction propagates further from this logic. Smaller rivalries involving nuclear warfare can be sudden as well as deadly for the entire planet. As the author states, collateral damage from weapons of mass destruction is likely to be staggering, and this changes the stakes of conflict. The primary use of deterrence is choosing the battles wisely and using honest signals to predict the fighting ability of the rival. In the absence of honest signals, anybody can make these weapons and use them. This paves the way for the evil actors of war to use sneaks and cheats to get on top of a conflict, irrespective of the inevitable consequences.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/LrIRuqr_Ozg\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LrIRuqr_Ozg\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>The existential risk of weapons of mass destruction is not limited to nuclear weapons. Bioweapons are equally likely to cause near-extinction events for humanity. Living in 2024, we even have precedent for such scenarios. These weapons are not even expensive to make. Many countries are investing in research and technology for tons of heat- and cold-resistant strains of viruses that are beyond the comprehension of the general population. In the presence of constant global conflict, there is fierce competition to prepare vaccines for a future attack of bioweapons. New studies are aided by advanced computing tools of machine learning and big data processing.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"11\" data-footnote-id=\"m2u8r1nfw0p\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm2u8r1nfw0p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm2u8r1nfw0p\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Since the possibilities of bioweapons are endless, the decisions of catastrophic life and death lie in the hands of unreliable government states and often in the hands of rogue individuals capable of producing the tiniest weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The author ends the book on the high by stating that Humanity would not survive the next arms race. In terms of X-risks, it is probably right up there at the top(along with probably AI misalignments and Climate Change). Through this book, we understand that the primary factors of any arms race are the same. We can not discount economic defensibility from our systems. And most probably, it is going to stay with humans forever. Duels, on the other hand, can be considered as the direct result of competition. If we think about the stakes that are involved with weapons of mass destruction, I can argue that states can potentially avoid a competitive setting. Peter Theil, in his book, states that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D8Vo9hRyw\"><i>Competition is for losers</i></a>. In the case of the arms race, Humanity always ends up on the losing side. Although Theil wrote this line in entrepreneurial settings, it can be understood as humans\u2019 tendency to imitate the traits of others, especially animals; in this case, the competitive need to fight. We are attracted to do things other people do. Competition always helps in improvements and makes us better at things we are competing for. But it comes with a price: we lose sight of what\u2019s more valuable.</p><hr><p><i>Huge thanks to </i><a href=\"https://www.super-linear.org/\"><i>Superlinear </i></a><i>for supporting me in covering this book.

"<h1>Summary</h1><p>In a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare\"><u>previous piece</u></a>, I defined and discussed four potential types of subjective welfare: hedonic states, felt desires, belief-like preferences and choice-based preferences. Setting aside the moral question of which types of welfare matter intrinsically, humans are of course capable of all four types of capacities. Many other animals seem capable of (conscious) hedonic states and felt desires, and plenty has been written on the topic (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/2017-report-on-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood/\"><u>Muehlhauser, 2017</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/invertebrate-sentience-table\"><u>Waldhorn et al., 2019</u></a>), but this is not entirely uncontroversial. I will not focus on these. Instead, my focus and key takeaways here are the following:</p><ol><li>It doesn\u2019t seem too unlikely that belief-like preferences are also available to animals with conscious hedonic states and conscious felt desires and even more likely still in mammals (and probably birds) in general, with these conscious hedonic states and conscious felt desires being or grounding belief-like preferences, but more sophisticated capacities could be required (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/which-animals-realize-which-types-of-subjective-welfare#Belief_like_preferences_in_other_animals\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>I make a probably controversial case for global belief-like preferences \u2014 e.g. belief-like preferences about the individual\u2019s own life as a whole \u2014 in other animals, as potentially degenerate or limiting cases: global belief-like preferences could just consider only the immediate, and so conscious hedonic states or felt desires could qualify or ground them &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/which-animals-realize-which-types-of-subjective-welfare#Global_belief_like_preferences\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>It\u2019s unclear if choice-based preferences are also available to animals with conscious hedonic states and conscious felt desires; this could be fairly sensitive to our characterization of choice-based preferences (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/which-animals-realize-which-types-of-subjective-welfare#Choice_based_preferences_in_other_animals\"><u>more</u></a>).</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>Thanks to Brian Tomasik, Derek Shiller and Bob Fischer for feedback on earlier drafts. All errors are my own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Absence of evidence is a weak argument</h1><p>Before commenting further on specifics, we should be careful not to treat absence of evidence for a given capacity in an animal as strong evidence for its absence. No one may have set up the right experiment or observed them under the right conditions to find evidence for or against a given capacity. The number of cognitive capacities recognized in other animals has also grown substantially over the past decades, although there may also be false positives, overinterpretation and publication bias. This could warrant assigning at least non-tiny probabilities, like 10%, to the possibility that an animal has a given capacity, unless there are specific strong arguments against.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Belief-like preferences in other animals</h1><figure style=\"width:64.72%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/gxwwepjoqr5vdv7wczpz\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/dxggslvntgioljrrpetv 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/fey0dkyzx1lpqvbfxnjl 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/qnytwj4klkxjvxj6sow2 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/jmpppduv8tfm6rjilqeo 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/rqn6mwlmgrbtii6qcy40 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/bwb2hv2kz430fyrptc8d 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/drhi4uoh2mmkc8n6un6h 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/dmaqkchwh6u3okejx8yx 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/qq7adra75qbnseisw09x 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iyHfk7jzzbLjp2RCd/t4rikcdu993pvxbwfkvu 1024w\"><figcaption>A thinking rat (Credit: ChatGPT's image generator, DALL\u00b7E)</figcaption></figure><p>Recall my definition and illustrations from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare\"><u>a previous piece</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Belief-like preferences:</strong>&nbsp;judgements or beliefs about subjective value, worth, need, desirability, good, bad, betterness or worseness.

Other examples include:</p><ol><li>our everyday explicitly conscious goals, like finishing a task or going to the gym today,</li><li>more important explicit goals or projects, like getting married, raising children, helping people,</li><li>moral beliefs, like that pain is bad, knowledge is good, utilitarianism, against harming others, about fair treatment, etc.,</li><li>general beliefs about how important things are to us, other honestly reported preferences, overall judgements about possible states of the world.</li></ol><p>Howe (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-6962.1994.tb00710.x\"><u>1994</u></a>), Berridge (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00201740903087359\"><u>2009</u></a>), and Berridge and Robinson (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171207/\"><u>2016</u></a>) use the term <i>cognitive desires</i>&nbsp;for a similar concept. Howe (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-6962.1994.tb00710.x\"><u>1994</u></a>) also uses <i>desiderative beliefs</i>, and Berridge (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00201740903087359\"><u>2009</u></a>), <i>ordinary wanting</i>.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It seems likely (e.g. with 80% to ~100% probability) to me that many other animals have (capacities worth calling) beliefs, including even many insects and also probably some existing AI systems.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"o3i6g6orym9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo3i6g6orym9\"><sup><a href=\"#fno3i6g6orym9\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It also seems reasonable to assign conscious animals substantial probability of having <i>beliefs about value</i>, and that some such beliefs are conscious or at least represented roughly by conscious states, so qualify as belief-like preferences. In particular, as discussed in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#More_on_unification\"><u>a previous piece</u></a>, (conscious) hedonic states and (conscious) felt desires (if any), as <i>subjective appearances of value or reasons</i>, may themselves already qualify or generate them. For example, if believing something is bad means representing it in some kind of negative light, being motivated to avoid, stop or prevent it, or otherwise acting <i>as if</i>&nbsp;it\u2019s bad (see <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/\"><u>Schwitzgebel, 2023</u></a>, section 1 for various accounts of belief), then hedonic states and aversive felt desires seem to do these<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"qso9v20a4tq\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqso9v20a4tq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqso9v20a4tq\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and should qualify. Conscious hedonic states and felt desires could play several (functional) roles by which we would normally characterize beliefs, concepts and judgements. Belief-like preferences could therefore be quite common across animals, realized by all animals with conscious hedonic states or conscious felt desires.</p><p>The hedonic states and felt desires of animals could also qualify as the conscious recognition and application of <i>their concepts of good and bad</i>: when they believe something is bad, they feel bad. And this feeling is also a <i>conscious judgement</i>&nbsp;that something is bad.</p><p>This presents a basic case, but we could require more for belief-like preferences. I will discuss some possibilities, their plausibility and some relevant evidence in other animals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Requiring conscious thought</h2><p>If we expect belief-like preferences to be conscious (or that they could be conscious), we might require conscious thought, e.g. the individual must <i>think</i>&nbsp;to themselves that something is bad, good, better, worse, etc.. What would that mean?</p><p>Conscious thoughts seem to be a special case of experiencing sensations caused by our beliefs and desires (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24475346\"><u>Carruthers, 2013</u></a>). There seems to be a lot humans can do with them that\u2019s unavailable to or very limited in other animals.</p><p>We can reason and deliberate in conscious thought. However, whether or not other animals can do these, I wouldn\u2019t require them in my account of belief-like preferences, because some thoughts are basic and not the result of explicit reasoning or deliberation at all. It\u2019s usually immediately obvious when something hurts, and there are simple and direct ways to represent that in thought, like thinking \u201cOw!\u201d or \u201cThat hurts!\u201d. We don\u2019t need to explicitly weigh the evidence for and against in thought before deciding that something hurts.</p><p>Given this possible simplicity, whatever causal, functional or representational role conscious thought is meant to play here between belief or desire and conscious representation, it\u2019s plausible to me that conscious hedonic states and felt desires can play that role on their own. The conscious unpleasantness or aversion is just like a conscious <i>expression</i>&nbsp;that something is bad. The mode could be conscious unpleasantness or aversion rather than sensory, via inner speech.</p><p>There also appear to be basically otherwise normal humans who don\u2019t have any or extremely limited conscious mental imagery, including no visual imagery (aphantasia) or inner speech (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mJ4PAT17z38?t=159\"><u>Austin &amp; Jess, 2020</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/drFuO81sI5g?t=89\"><u>Quiet Mind Inside, 2020a</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/khlzCvTwB8I\"><u>Quiet Mind Inside, 2020b</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10670-023-00706-2\"><u>Krempel, 2023</u></a>), so either they wouldn\u2019t have belief-like preferences, or much more plausibly and less arbitrarily, we also count their thinking done with external aids, like speaking out loud, drawing, writing or sign language. So, the fact that thinking happens&nbsp;<i>internally</i> doesn\u2019t seem to matter morally, and saying \u201cOw!\u201d or \u201cThat hurts!\u201d&nbsp;<i>out loud</i> should count, too.</p><p>And besides through conscious hedonic states and felt desires, conscious animals can also be indirectly conscious of their beliefs and desires in general by experiencing the sensations caused by them, e.g. by hearing their own vocalizations or sensing their own body movements. Many other animals have their own ways of saying \u201cThat hurts!\u201d, whether by vocalization or gesture, and of which they can also be conscious.</p><p>So, it doesn\u2019t seem like conscious thought should draw an important qualitative line here between humans and other animals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Requiring more from judgement</h2><p>Perhaps mere consciousness of some consequences of their beliefs or desires isn\u2019t enough, and instead, they must consciously <i>judge</i>&nbsp;something to be the case, e.g. consciously judge a situation to be bad. What does that take?</p><p>As already mentioned, conscious unpleasantness and aversion seem like conscious judgements that something is worse or bad. Even without pinning down exactly what\u2019s required of conscious judgement, this may already be enough.</p><p>Or, we might require some metacognition. Perhaps, they must be conscious of <i>their degree</i>&nbsp;of belief or confidence. There\u2019s evidence of varying strength for metacognition across a wide variety of species, including some invertebrates.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"99zduw2hnn6\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref99zduw2hnn6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn99zduw2hnn6\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But this could be unconscious. Still, some animals may in fact have specifically <i>epistemic emotions</i>&nbsp;and <i>metacognitive feelings</i>&nbsp;like curiosity, surprise, uncertainty, confidence or feeling of knowing, or appraisals (felt evaluations) of the value of cognitive effort (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105117\"><u>Carruthers and Williams, 2022</u></a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-020-01557-1\"><u>Carruthers, 2021</u></a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105325\"><u>Goupil and Proust, 2023</u></a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51673-4_3\"><u>Vogl et al., 2021</u></a>) that track epistemic states and confidence, and could indeed be conscious. And they would presumably be about things that matter subjectively to the animal, e.g. to choose between options with differing attractiveness or unattractiveness, because it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019d be any other adaptive use for them.</p><p>Another possible requirement could be the (conscious?) <i>self-attribution</i>&nbsp;of a belief, goal, desire or preference, e.g. \u201c<i>I</i>&nbsp;believe <i>p</i>\u201d, which would presumably require a concept of a belief, goal, desire or preference, a concept of self and one's own mind. This may not include many species, only those with enough theory of mind and capacity for higher-order consciousness.</p><p>But when someone says or thinks \u201cThat's bad\u201d, that seems to be a judgement. Where exactly is the self-attribution of belief? It's either unconscious or not linguistic. If it's conscious but not linguistic, how is it experienced? And do other animals have experiences that can play similar roles? And if it's unconscious, why does it matter?</p><p>Blasimme and Bortolotti (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43046829\"><u>2010</u></a>, p.84) make a more general objection to beliefs requiring the concept of belief:</p><blockquote><p>We don't normally think that in order to have something we need to possess the concept of that something</p></blockquote><p>For example, a dog doesn\u2019t need to have a concept of a stomach to have a stomach. Requiring the <i>self-attribution</i>&nbsp;of something would go even further. However, here, we are considering the possibility that <i>judging</i>&nbsp;requires a concept of belief and its self-attribution, not that belief requires these. Judging could be more demanding than belief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Requiring more from normative concepts or reasons</h2><p>As discussed above, hedonic states and felt desires may already be consciously felt applications of normative concepts.</p><p>However, there is also another sense in which individuals could potentially recognize and apply a concept of bad: if they can generalizably discriminate subjective badness from its absence in particular, a kind of higher-order. Rats and pigs seem to be able to discriminate <i>anxiety</i>&nbsp;from its absence generalizably across causes with a learned behaviour, like pressing a lever when they would apparently feel anxious.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"pkvbbijjyp\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpkvbbijjyp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpkvbbijjyp\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>I could not find any similar studies in other animals. Still, I would guess the discrimination of anxiety would apply generally across mammals and birds. I expect a rough <i>upper bound</i>&nbsp;on the requirements for similar behaviour would correspond with having working memory, voluntary/top-down attention control, and for the feeling of anxiety to enter into working memory and so be available as a discriminative stimulus (although unconscious discrimination of unpleasantness or aversion is also possible). According to the review <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763422003542\"><u>Nieder, 2022</u></a>, there is good evidence for working memory and the voluntary/top-down control of attention at least across mammals and birds, and some suggestive evidence for them in <i>some</i>&nbsp;fish and evidence of working memory in honeybees. On the other hand, Neider (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763422003542\"><u>2022</u></a>) only cited one negative result for <i>any</i>&nbsp;species, specifically for working memory in archerfish.</p><p>I also couldn\u2019t find any studies even on the generalization between anxiety or fear and other unpleasant or aversive states independently of any anxiety or fear they involve, like physical pain, disgust, anger, hunger or frustration. Such generalizability between all unpleasant and/or aversive states, perhaps weaker the less similar, doesn't seem very unlikely, in case there\u2019s some common feeling to unpleasantness or aversion regardless of its cause.</p><p>Putting these results into perspective, humans often believe that what we find unpleasant or aversive is bad, including often the unpleasantness or aversion themselves. Our concepts of bad and some other normative concepts could roughly be elaborations of and generalizations from other animals\u2019. Our moral concepts may also be based in part on our <i>moral emotions</i>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-19650-3_650\"><u>Walsh, 2021</u></a>), some of which also seem to appear in other animals. Even concerns for fairness and altruistic concern for others are found in some other animals, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequity_aversion_in_animals\"><u>inequity aversion</u></a>&nbsp;and emotional empathy/contagion that motivates helping behaviour. See <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/wcs.1560\"><u>P\u00e9rez-Manrique &amp; Gomila, 2022</u></a>&nbsp;for a comprehensive review finding evidence for emotional contagion and/or helping behaviour across a fairly wide variety of species. In particular, there is good evidence for emotional contagion driving helping behaviour in rats, who are generally well-studied.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"btd1w0yjjeu\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbtd1w0yjjeu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbtd1w0yjjeu\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Furthermore, the apparently selective emotional contagion of hens to the distress of their chicks (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098%2Frspb.2010.2701\"><u>Edgar et al, 2011</u></a>) and not of familiar adult conspecifics (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098%2Frspb.2010.2701\"><u>Edgar et al., 2012</u></a>) also seems best explained evolutionarily as motivating protective responses. Anger as a moral emotion also seems available to animals who aggressively protect their offspring but are less aggressive without offspring. Some other moral emotions also seem plausible in other animals.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"x00dyhfdb6c\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx00dyhfdb6c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx00dyhfdb6c\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still, we could require more. It\u2019s unclear if what rats do, say, extends to a more general concept of a <i>reason</i>, on which Silverstein (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00048402.2016.1254263\"><u>2017</u></a>)\u2019s account of <i>normative self-governance</i>&nbsp;is based.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"kkuc595gkid\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkkuc595gkid\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkkuc595gkid\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;At first, this may seem far too abstract for nonlinguistic animals, but, again, we should consider what they themselves care about and whether they have a concept that serves a similar functional role in decision-making. Do they have concepts capturing pleasure and unpleasantness together, and appetitive desire and aversion together, or all of them together under a general concept of a reason? As far as I know, there\u2019s no evidence either way. Generalization between all hedonic states doesn\u2019t seem very likely to me, because pleasure and unpleasantness just feel different.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"pqeq4aofo2\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpqeq4aofo2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpqeq4aofo2\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, the animal\u2019s own mechanism of motivational salience \u2014 which drives attention to stimuli and so, in one way, <i>makes</i>&nbsp;them subjectively important \u2014 could be one about which an animal could more plausibly have beliefs and so form concepts, but this would be a minimal theory of (own) mind, a relatively sophisticated capacity.</p><p>Even if they have reasons and those reasons are weighed together, e.g. via attention, motivational salience or even, say, by alternatingly attending to different desires and reasons, they may not use any <i>concept of reason</i>&nbsp;to do this. A further possibility is that they have a concept of a reason, but rather than act on the basis of these concepts, they act instead directly on the basis of the reasons themselves. It\u2019s not clear if they\u2019d form belief-like preferences in this case.</p><p>It\u2019s not obvious either way that we should require them to have a concept of a reason if they still have concepts for kinds of reasons, e.g. of bad or even for a specific bad part of an experience, e.g. anxiety like rats apparently do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We could further require that the preferences be based on (normative) principles or standards, like Korsgaard (<a href=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:5141952\"><u>2010</u></a>)\u2019s account of <i>normative self-government</i>. However, her account seems too strict to apply even to many humans in many instances, and, so in my view, implausible as a grounds for belief-like preferences. Moral particularists, virtue ethicists (<a href=\"https://www.amacad.org/publication/intuitive-ethics\"><u>Haidt &amp; Joseph, 2004</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"hdur3ppdffh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhdur3ppdffh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhdur3ppdffh\">[9]</a></sup></span>, <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/virtue/\"><u>Athanassoulis, 2010</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"10\" data-footnote-id=\"3m4ssajjo7f\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3m4ssajjo7f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3m4ssajjo7f\">[10]</a></sup></span>, <a href=\"https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/keith/\"><u>Frankish, 2021</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"11\" data-footnote-id=\"kvf35viepm9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkvf35viepm9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkvf35viepm9\">[11]</a></sup></span>) and some others reject principles or standards, and are guided primarily by direct intuition, \u201cgut\u201d or feelings, or at least decide on their basis after reflection, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/do-the-math-then-burn-the-math-and-go-with-your-gut\"><i><u>Do the math, then burn the math and go with your gut</u></i></a>. Few or no other animals may \u201cdo the math\u201d or otherwise use principles or standards, but many seem guided by their feelings, guts or intuitions. The process could be essentially the same, just in other animals the limiting or degenerate case where actually no formal principles or standards are applied. And again, often in humans, no principles or standards are applied at all before judging. So, requirements like Korsgaard\u2019s normative self-government seem too demanding to be very likely to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Requiring beliefs to be less ambiguous</h2><p>One issue with treating (conscious) hedonic states or felt desires like actual beliefs or as grounding or representing corresponding beliefs is that it can lead to apparent conflicts in beliefs. Someone could believe going to work is good, in the typical cognitive sense, but find it pleasant or be attracted to it in the attentional sense, and they could even instead find it unpleasant or aversive. Their feelings can also change over time. Can someone believe something is both good and not good (or even bad) simultaneously? In general, can someone believe both <i>p</i>&nbsp;and <i>not p</i>&nbsp;simultaneously?</p><p>There are multiple responses to this.</p><ol><li>The beliefs are actually about (slightly) different things. Work (or an aspect of work) is good in one way, and not good or bad in another way. Work could be bad for someone in the moment based on their feelings about it while or before working, but good for them in the long term. Or, parts of their job could be bad \u2014 unpleasant or aversive \u2014, but not the job <i>as a whole</i>.</li><li>The beliefs come from separate systems or processes, so any disagreement is more like interpersonal disagreement instead of one individual holding contradictory beliefs.</li><li>We can just have directly inconsistent beliefs. In general, we can have logically inconsistent beliefs, and directly holding <i>p</i>&nbsp;and <i>not p</i>&nbsp;is a special case. This can happen in practice due to framing, e.g. asking someone a yes-or-no question in two different ways but with identical meanings.</li><li>Hedonic states and felt desires aren't beliefs and don't directly ground or represent beliefs.</li><li>Instead hedonic states and felt desires could just be or could just ground <i>appearances</i>. Appearances can conflict, i.e. things can seem multiple ways, and beliefs may (typically) result from the weighing of appearances. Beliefs may themselves also be types of appearances, but not all appearances are beliefs.</li><li>Other animals could still have beliefs about their hedonic states and felt desires or that otherwise take them into account.</li><li>Why doesn't the problem apply symmetrically to the typical cognitive beliefs? We're saying cognitive beliefs and feelings can't both be (or directly ground or represent) beliefs because they can disagree in an individual. Why not deny that cognitive beliefs are (or directly ground or represent) beliefs instead?</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Assigning credences</h2><p>Taken together, considering both my uncertainty about the standards for defining belief-like preferences and the capacities of various animals, it doesn\u2019t seem very unlikely that other animals \u2014 and especially mammals and birds \u2014 have belief-like preferences. Assigning credences seems fairly arbitrary at this point given my uncertainty not just about animals\u2019 capacities but also the target. I\u2019ll make an attempt anyway, with fairly wide ranges.</p><p>As I mentioned above, it seems likely (e.g. with 80% to ~100% probability) to me that many other animals have (capacities worth calling) beliefs, including even many insects. But belief-like preferences aren\u2019t <i>just</i>&nbsp;beliefs and might not be beliefs at all. They are beliefs \u2014 or perhaps just appearances \u2014 of <i>value or reasons</i>. Plausibly, we should also require them to be consciously experienced by the animal, and perhaps specifically as <i>conscious judgements</i>. Conscious hedonic states and felt desires could already qualify as conscious judgements and conscious representations of beliefs about value or reasons, and are themselves appearances of value or reasons. This was the basic case.</p><p>I find it reasonably likely that the basic case is enough, but it also seems reasonably likely that this is missing something important in what it means to <i>judge</i>, e.g. metacognition. It\u2019s also possible that more general concepts of good and bad, or of <i>a reason</i>, are required and should be used in the right way. Beliefs in general, desires in general, hedonic states and felt desires together wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>I\u2019d guess there\u2019s a 30-80% chance that conscious hedonic states and felt desires (and simpler/more common capacities like beliefs and desires) are enough for belief-like preferences, i.e. that (almost) any animal with conscious hedonic states and felt desires has belief-like preferences.</p><p>For example, I\u2019m quite confident that mammals generally have conscious hedonic states and felt desires, e.g. 80-95%. Treating the probabilities as independent, this gives a lower bound range of 80%*30%=24% to 80%*95%=76%.</p><p>However, mammals, including rats, who \u2014 I\u2019d guess \u2014 would be near the lower end of sophistication among mammals, given their relatively small brains, seem more impressive in multiple ways than just having (conscious) hedonic states and felt desires. Rats seem able to generalizably discriminate anxiety from its absence. Still, it\u2019s not clear that rats do so for unpleasantness or aversion in general, and it seems unlikely that they have a concept of <i>a reason</i>&nbsp;that they would generalizably discriminate similarly. I\u2019d also expect many mammals to have epistemic emotions or metacognitive feelings, and would expect some in rats. So, I\u2019d tentatively guess mammals generally have belief-like preferences with probability 40-90%.</p><p>Birds don\u2019t seem too far behind. They don\u2019t seem much less likely to be conscious at all or have conscious hedonic states and felt desires. I also expect them to generalizably discriminate anxiety from its absence. Perhaps 30-80% for belief-like preferences across birds.</p><p>The probabilities would be lower in reptiles, amphibians, fishes, cephalopods, arthropods and other invertebrates, but at least around 30-80% of their probabilities of having conscious hedonic states and felt desires at all. For some estimates of the probabilities of consciousness/sentience across species, see <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/2017-report-on-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood/#id-42-my-current-probabilities\"><u>Muehlhauser, 2017</u></a>, section 4.2 and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUvMKRkEOJQcc6V7VJqcLLGAJ2SsdZno0jTIUb61D8k/edit#heading=h.b6byx9suvlcn\"><u>Duffy, 2023</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Global belief-like preferences</h1><p>On the other hand, other animals may seem especially unlikely to have <i>global belief-like preferences</i>, i.e. belief-like preferences about their lives as a whole (<a href=\"https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil1100/Parfit1.pdf\"><u>Parfit, 1984</u></a>) like life satisfaction (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/life-satisfaction-and-its-discontents/\"><u>Plant, 2020</u></a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year\"><u>quality-adjusted life years</u></a>&nbsp;(QALYs), and generalizations of QALYs to include extrinsic goals (<a href=\"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/deca.1060.0082\"><u>Hazen, 2007</u></a>), or other preferences about the state of the world as a whole or all-things-considered, like an individual's moral beliefs, their utility function or preferences over outcomes, prospects or actions. These contrast with <i>local preferences</i>, which are narrower in scope, like just about your job in general, your current project, that a meeting goes well, or scoring that goal in a soccer match.</p><p>About global preferences in other animals, Plant (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/life-satisfaction-and-its-discontents/\"><u>2020</u></a>) writes and then further defends the following:</p><blockquote><p>Many sentient entities seem incapable of making these sorts of judgements, such as non-human animals or humans with cognitive disabilities. Such evaluations require complicated cognitive machinery that these beings conspicuously lack; to make an overall evaluation, one must decide which standard(s) you\u2019re going to use to evaluate your life and then, taking all the various bits and pieces of your life in aggregate, make a judgement. We might, for instance, believe that dogs can feel pleasure and pain, have beliefs and desires, likes and dislikes, but nevertheless doubt they are capable of deciding how satisfied they are with their lives as a whole.</p></blockquote><p>He claims self-awareness is required, and proposes mirror self-recognition as a minimal bar to pass, which few species do. And if global preferences are as Plant describes them above, I\u2019d set the bar even higher, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_identity\"><u>narrative identity</u></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_time_travel\"><u>mental time travel</u></a>&nbsp;and/or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_thinking\"><u>counterfactual thinking</u></a>, or more broadly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonoetic_consciousness\"><u>autonoetic consciousness</u></a>, allowing them to recall and judge their pasts and imagine and judge possible futures.</p><p>However, there are at least a few things we can say in defense of global preferences in other animals, to which Plant (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/life-satisfaction-and-its-discontents/\"><u>2020</u></a>) has not already replied. I think it\u2019s possible that global (belief-like) preferences \u2014 or at least things worthy of being called global preferences and treated similarly \u2014 don\u2019t require all of what Plant expects of them or the mental faculties I just listed.</p><p>First, other animals may have global (belief-like) preferences that happen to only take into account their immediate concerns. These could just be their hedonic states or overall felt desires in response to what\u2019s currently happening to and around them, or related beliefs. It\u2019s coherent and possible in principle \u2014 even if not very psychologically plausible in practice \u2014 for a human to report their life satisfaction based just on how they\u2019re feeling at the moment and believe it. Perhaps more plausible, if a human had severe amnesia, both retrograde and anterograde, forgetting their past and being unable to form much in terms of new memories, they might judge their life so far on the basis of how they\u2019re feeling at the time. They could still have global preferences about their futures beyond the immediate, but life satisfaction is a judgement about life so far (and perhaps where they expect it to go). It\u2019s unclear how odd or objectionable the implications of counting hedonic states or felt desires as global preferences in other animals would be.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"12\" data-footnote-id=\"9j2j8iuq8v5\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9j2j8iuq8v5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9j2j8iuq8v5\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><p>Or, other animals\u2019 global preferences could be their particular <i>dispositions</i>&nbsp;to generate hedonic states or felt desires in response to specific circumstances. Humans\u2019 global preferences probably are also just our <i>dispositions</i>&nbsp;to think certain things or are otherwise rarely conscious. How often do people think about their life satisfaction or what kinds of lives they want to live, say? If someone recently and unexpectedly lost their child, we should be able to say they are worse off according to their global preferences, as long as they <i>would judge</i>&nbsp;their own life badly even if they just haven\u2019t yet because they\u2019ve been too preoccupied with the loss. Plant (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/life-satisfaction-and-its-discontents/\"><u>2020</u></a>) also agrees with using hypothetical rather than just actual judgements.</p><p>Plant (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/life-satisfaction-and-its-discontents/\"><u>2020</u></a>) also considers but ultimately rejects the proposal of <i>imagining how animals would report their life satisfaction if they could</i>, basically because it\u2019s too large a departure in capacities and the kind of being they are. I\u2019m inclined to agree with him on this, but I\u2019m not sure.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"13\" data-footnote-id=\"h1qrgnh1w2h\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh1qrgnh1w2h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh1qrgnh1w2h\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><p>Finally, it\u2019s not clear that it should be required that they decide by what standards to judge or that that even picks out something special. The decision doesn\u2019t seem to make the preference a <i>different kind of thing</i>; it\u2019s still just another belief-like preference, but caused by a decision or an intention. It seems enough to be able to imagine or even just recognize presentations or descriptions of their life so far or possible futures for themselves (attributing those to themselves) and just judge them, and how pleasant, unpleasant or attractive they feel could count as such judgements.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"14\" data-footnote-id=\"gpyy6dr8q0n\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgpyy6dr8q0n\"><sup><a href=\"#fngpyy6dr8q0n\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Now, other animals might or might not recall their pasts and imagine their futures and judge them even in this way \u2014 that\u2019s mental time travel \u2014 or even properly attribute the events to themselves if presented with them, but they can judge the present, and as I just argued, that might be enough, giving them extremely short-sighted global preferences.</p><p>So, it seems to me there is at least some case for many other animals having global preferences, enough to not entirely dismiss the possibility, but also not enough for great confidence that they do have them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a separate question about whether global belief-like preferences should even be granted more moral weight than other belief-like preferences. I'd guess they're the same kinds of belief-like preferences, realized in essentially the same ways, just about different things. When someone is deciding what food they prefer or what kind of life would be best for themself, essentially the same neurological and mental processes are probably (or can be) involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Choice-based preferences in other animals</h1><p>Recall my definition and illustrations from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Choice_based_preferences\"><u>a previous piece</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Choice-based preferences:</strong>&nbsp;our actual choices, as in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference\"><i><u>revealed preferences</u></i></a>, or what we <i>would</i>&nbsp;choose.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"15\" data-footnote-id=\"qlb5v7nc6s\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqlb5v7nc6s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqlb5v7nc6s\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If I choose an apple over an orange when both are available in a given situation, then, on this account and in that situation, I prefer the apple to the orange.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"16\" data-footnote-id=\"78weyjr3n0v\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref78weyjr3n0v\"><sup><a href=\"#fn78weyjr3n0v\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In order to exclude reflexive and unconscious responses (even if learned), I\u2019d consider only choices under voluntary/top-down/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions\"><u>cognitive control</u></a>, driven (at least in part) by <i>reasons</i>&nbsp;of which the individual is conscious, (conscious) intentions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"17\" data-footnote-id=\"wzezyin0sk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwzezyin0sk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwzezyin0sk\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and/or choices following (conscious) plans (any nonempty subset of these requirements).

If that\u2019s all that\u2019s required, then effectively all animals with conscious hedonic states or felt desires and top-down control could have choice-based preferences.</p><p>However, we might require intentions or plans, or even that the animal be conscious of them. Which other animals have intentions or plans? Which ones are they conscious of their intentions or plans?</p><p>There is evidence for <i>anticipatory planning</i>&nbsp;in some other animals, there\u2019s <i>so far</i>&nbsp;no evidence for <i>strategic planning</i>, according to Selter (<a href=\"https://brill.com/display/title/55887\"><u>2020</u></a>). There\u2019s evidence for mental time travel, prospective reasoning and future planning in corvids (crows, ravens, jays, magpies) and nonhuman apes (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/32384/chapter-abstract/268661896\"><u>Carruthers, 2019, p. 26-29</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393219302441\"><u>Corballis, 2019</u></a>, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/147470491301100307\"><u>Zentall, 2013</u></a>), but these animals are not exploited by humans in very large numbers, so they\u2019d probably be difficult to help cost-effectively.

Perhaps consciousness of plans is most useful in nonhuman animals for the communication of plans.</p><p>Stepping back, it seems that many other animals have plans and intentions of some kind. However, it\u2019s not clear which are specifically conscious of them at all or often, and I\u2019m not aware of much evidence either way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Multiple lines</h1><p>Even if other animals turn out to have choice-based preferences, belief-like preferences and even global preferences, humans seem far ahead in our capacities for them, or at least the number of possible considerations and depth. We might have more morally valuable versions of these types of preferences, or it could be <i>vague</i>&nbsp;whether animals have them at all or the differences could otherwise matter a lot.</p><p>We recognize far more concepts and far more sophisticated concepts. We\u2019re more self-aware: we have self-narratives, introspect more and more flexibly, and have greater social self-awareness. We have fine and flexible control over highly compositional and expressive representations through our uses of language and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_time_travel\"><u>mental time travel</u></a>&nbsp;and scenario building. Whatever versions of these capacities other animals have, when they even have any at all, seem rarely used or very impoverished (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24475346\"><u>Carruthers, 2013</u></a>). We use ours frequently, and they facilitate several other potentially important capacities in us, but that are likely absent or rare in other animals. We can decide by what standards to judge our lives and more clearly have global preferences at all (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/life-satisfaction-and-its-discontents/\"><u>Plant, 2020</u></a>). We can deliberate in normative terms, using principles and standards, about what we should do (<a href=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:5141952\"><u>Korsgaard, 2010</u></a>). We can plan strategically (<a href=\"https://brill.com/display/title/55887\"><u>Selter, 2020</u></a>).

I reply, \"Because he realizes that the path is slippery.\" I do not imply that the proposition, \"This path is slippery,\" crossed his mind. Another example: I wave at a man across the quad. Later on I may say to someone, \"I saw Kaspar today.\" It may be true that I recognized Kaspar, or recognized that the man across the quad was Kaspar, but not true that I thought to myself, \"That is Kaspar.\" Turning from propositional verbs to emotions and sensations, it is plainly false that whenever a man is angry he thinks of the proposition, \"I am angry\"; or that whenever he feels a pain in his leg the thought, \"I have a pain leg,\" occurs to him.</p></blockquote><p>and it is natural to attribute beliefs to other animals in similar ways:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose our dog is chasing the neighbor's cat. The latter runs full tilt toward and oak tree, but suddenly swerves at the last moment and disappears up a nearby maple. The dog doesn't see this maneuver and on arriving at the oak tree he rears up on his hind legs, paws the trunk as if trying to scale it, and barks excitedly into the branches above. We who observe the whole episode from a window say, \"He thinks that the cat went up that oak tree.\" We say \"thinks\" because he is barking up the wrong tree.

A virtuous person is one who has the proper automatic reactions to ethically relevant events and states of affairs, for example, another person\u2019s suffering, an unfair distribution of a good, a dangerous but necessary mission. Part of the appeal of virtue theory has always been that it sees morality as embodied in the very structure of the self, not merely as one of the activities of the self. Even Aristotle supposed that in developing the virtues we acquire a second nature, a refinement of our basic nature, an alteration of our automatic responses.</p><p>One of the crucial tenets of virtue theory is that the virtues are acquired inductively, that is, through the acquisition, mostly in childhood but also throughout the life course, of many examples of a virtue in practice. Often these examples come from the child\u2019s everyday experience of construing, responding, and getting feedback, but they also come from the stories that permeate the culture. Each of these examples contains information about a number of aspects of the situation, including the protagonists\u2019 motivations, the protagonists\u2019 state of being (suffering, disabled, hostile, rich, etc.), the categorization of the situation, and the evaluation of the outcome offered by more experienced others.

For him to be able to judge his life, it would require changing him into a very different sort of being, at which point this cognitively enhanced pooch would not be Fido assessing Fido\u2019s life, but some other entity evaluating its own life.

It\u2019s probably vague for humans, too, because a great number of possible circumstances could affect our judgements even if we don\u2019t explicitly consider them, like our current mood, what we just ate, what we\u2019ve thought about recently, anything we\u2019ve just been primed with ahead of time.

With no sense of direction, you'll just get tossed about by the waves.</p><p>I think that\u2019s a fair description of where the WHO is now with its approach to pandemic risk management. It doesn't seem to know what the solution is, nor where it can be found. But without any stated goals for the world \u2013 global or national \u2013 and no specific outcomes to target or plan for, both it and the world are drifting aimlessly from one crisis to the next.</p><p>It needn\u2019t be this way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Pandemic Papers</h1><p>The WHO has written three major papers on global pandemic influenza preparedness. The most recent was published in <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789241547680\">2009</a>, building on the earlier ones from <a href=\"https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/68998\">2005</a> and <a href=\"https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/66155\">1999</a>.</p><p>There is plenty of good advice in these papers (much of which was ignored by policy-makers during Covid-19) but what stands out to me, is that there is no goal. Nowhere in any of these papers does the WHO state the overall outcome that all of this planning and preparation is supposed to achieve.</p><p>This is not a trivial point.</p><p>Plans exist to achieve goals. The goal is the destination and the plan is the route to it. So how can I build a plan without first knowing what outcome it is supposed to achieve? How can I set a course for a port which has not been determined? I can\u2019t.</p><p>All planning must begin with goal-setting, including pandemic planning. So in these papers, there should be a clear, worthwhile goal that the nations world can aim for, and around which they can build their plans (whether the nations go along with it is another matter) but the WHO seems to have missed that point. Instead, we get vague recommendations, pointless exhortations, and consultant-speak.</p><p>For example, in the 2009 paper (p11), the WHO says: \u201cEffectively meeting the challenges of the next influenza pandemic will require robust and extraordinary advance planning on the part of WHO and countries worldwide.\u201d I\u2019m sure it will, but what does the WHO mean by \u2018effectively meeting the challenges\u2019? What does it mean to be \u2018effective\u2019, and by what metrics would I measure it? How would I know whether my planning is on course to be effective? (What am I supposed to do with this advice?)</p><p>Other advice is equally vague: \u201cThe goal of recommended actions during these phases is to reduce the impact of the pandemic on society.\u201d What does it mean to \u2018reduce the impact\u2019? Reduce it from what, and to what? If we were to prevent a single infection then we would have reduced the impact on society. Would that be enough? It\u2019s a bit like saying, \u2018the goal is to win\u2019, or \u2018the goal is to solve the problem\u2019. (Again, what am I supposed to do with this advice??)</p><p>There is much talk of strengthening systems or minimising risks, and more international coordination is always recommended, but nowhere do they state what specific outcome all of this activity is supposed to achieve. How strong do our systems need to be? How do we measure their strength? How should we co-ordinate, both in advance and in the midst of an outbreak? How <i>can</i> we co-ordinate, when we don\u2019t even know what we're trying to achieve?</p><p>The lack of a goal around which to orient our risk management plans is a major hindrance to global pandemic prevention. Part of the reason why the WHO has neglected to offer one (aside from politics) is that the organisation is largely populated by medics, and their perspectives on pandemic influenza are shaped by their experiences of seasonal influenza.</p><p>Let me explain\u2026</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Seasonal Influenza vs Pandemic Influenza: Hurricanes vs Fires</h1><p>Hurricanes exist independently of our actions. We can't stop them, in other words. All we can aim to do, is to endure them better. So we stockpile resources, board up the windows, head down to our shelter if we have one, or get out of town if not. We understand that the hurricane is going to do whatever it is going to do, and we endeavour to make ourselves as resilient as possible to it.</p><p>Fires are different to hurricanes in that they are <i>inter</i>dependent. That is, our fire-fighting actions will determine the path of the fire. If we act quickly, the fire can be snuffed out before it gets going. If we stand around looking at each other, then it will spread and grow and become a much bigger problem. A pan fire or a few sparks from a faulty electrical heater can be suppressed with a fire blanket, or it take out a whole apartment block; it all comes down to our risk management response.</p><p>The point is that medics treat pandemic influenza like a hurricane, when thy should be treating it like a fire. They take for granted that it will happen and that there\u2019s nothing they can (or should) do to stop it. So they see &nbsp;no specific epidemiological outcome to be achieved, other than a vague sense of \u2018doing better\u2019 i.e. fewer cases, less stress on the health service, etc.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this.</p><p>One is that the virus mutates quickly, so herd immunity isn\u2019t an option as vaccines are only temporarily effective. Another is that medics are trained to cure individuals, so they are more focused on what happens after people get infected, not what could or should happen in advance to prevent it.</p><p>A third, less-appreciated reason is that a seasonal influenza virus is not threatening at the population level. Both the R number (less than 1.5) and the IFR (less than 0.1%) are low, so the overall threat it poses to society is bounded. It may cause a lot of deaths in absolute terms, but those deaths are steady from one season to the next, so we know what to expect. Decades of experience has shown us that there is little risk of wider societal disturbance from a seasonal influenza virus. Seasonal influenza has \u2018thin tails\u2019, as they say.&nbsp;</p><p>Pandemic influenza is more dangerous than seasonal influenza. It generally has a higher R number and a higher IFR, and it may be a novel pathogen too, at least insofar as there is little existing immunity and novel medicines will be required. Pandemic influenza may also exhibit other nasty features such as asymptomatic / pre-symptomatic transmission, unknowable long-term effects, or a high levels of super-spreading (high dispersion ~ the k number) all of which makes it significantly more dangerous at the individual <i>and</i> population levels. Pandemic influenza has \u2018fat tails\u2019, making it significantly more dangerous than a regular seasonal influenza.</p><p>The problem we have is that the medics at the WHO have taken their passive, medical approach from managing seasonal influenza into their fight against pandemic influenza. But pandemic influenza is a completely different beast, and the passive approach can be suicidal. It's like hoping that the pan fire will burn itself out, when it's far more likely to engulf the kitchen, the apartment, and then the whole tower block.</p><p>Pandemic influenza must be treated like a fire, not a hurricane. We must attack it to prevent it, not prepare to endure it. &nbsp;The goal must be to find it and snuff it out ASAP.</p><p>Speaking of goals\u2026</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Without Goals, We Cannot Co-Ordinate</h1><p>Co-operation and co-ordination enable us to become more than the sum of our parts. This is as true for ants, herds of animals, and human beings in their communities, as it is for whole nations in a global society. So international co-ordination will be essential if we are to gather and disseminate information, implement travel restrictions, and manage global supplies of medical resources \u2013 all of which play essential roles in pandemic prevention.</p><p>However, we can\u2019t co-ordinate at the international level unless we first have goals and plans in place at the national level.</p><p>Think about it like this\u2026 If I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re planning to do when the time comes, then I can\u2019t co-ordinate with you. I can only watch and react. If I don\u2019t know what <i>I\u2019m</i> going to do when the time comes, then I can\u2019t co-ordinate with you, or with anyone! We each need to have some idea of what we would do in these future scenarios before we can make any progress on co-ordinating those future responses.</p><p>Exhortations from the WHO for more co-operation and co-ordination do not fall on deaf ears: they are seeds falling on barren ground. \u2018Co-operate!\u2019, they say. But with who, and on what, and to achieve what outcomes? Without goals and plans at the national level, there is nothing to co-ordinate international level.</p><p>It\u2019s going to be very difficult to protect ourselves from PPPs until that changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Without Goals, We Cannot Progress</h1><p>The practical reality is that we can achieve very little at all in pandemic risk management without first stating our goals.</p><p>Goals are essential because they streamline our decisions: by stating a goal, we automatically define the infrastructure and resources needed to achieve it. At the same time, we eliminate all other potential decisions and paths. Specific goals thereby create a finite \u2018to do\u2019 list for our pandemic prevention efforts.</p><p>Goals also serve as a metric against which we can assess our performance. In preparation, we can track our progress against our \u2018to do\u2019 list. When the outbreak begins, we can determine whether we are on course to achieve our primary goal, or whether we need to change tack. Goals guide our decision-making at all times.</p><p>Without clear goals, preparation efforts will be ignored, deferred, or become box-ticking exercises for apathetic civil servants, while plans will be implemented reactively, amid a media storm, and driven by the political expediency of the day. We\u2019ll have no choice but to respond to events as they happen, instead of taking control and setting our own course. Our attention will be dragged from one thing to the next, and \u2018managing the narrative\u2019 will take prominence over managing the outbreak. The Covid-19 pandemic was a case-study in how badly things can go wrong in these scenarios. As things stand, we are on course to repeat it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>A pandemic is a risk management problem. Risk management problems start with goals, and the risk management process is what takes us from where we are, to wherever that goal may be. By first sketching our goals and ambitions, we will naturally create a shared direction of travel, which then forms a basis for greater international co-operation and co-ordination.</p><p>We may not agree on the exact details of what we want to achieve at a national level, but we don\u2019t need to either. As long as our national goals have \u2018enough\u2019 in common, we can work together in areas of shared interest, and there will be more coherence to the next global response, when the time comes. The WHO has, potentially, an important role to play in helping to shape those goals.</p><p>In the WHO\u2019s 2005 pandemic paper, they stated that one of the WHO\u2019s objectives was: \u201cTo promote the development of harmonized global, regional and national influenza pandemic preparedness plans.\u201d This was the right idea. We need national plans that align, and that allow for co-operation and co-ordination. However, the next logical step is that we need national goals that align, since the plans are determined by the goals.</p><p>The WHO has made attempts to build on this idea, but they still fall short of what is required. A <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2017-1\">2018 paper</a> focused on the harmonisation of preparedness and response, but again, it misses the key point: we need to harmonise the goals first, then the plans will fall into place. In the absence of such goals, the WHO is once again left issuing nebulous advice like 'identify priorities' and 'strengthen capacities', which is too vague, lacks purpose, and will only be put on the long-finger by politicians and civil servants alike.</p><p>If we are to protect the world from future pandemics, we need to think about clear, ambitious, national and global goals: goals that can align our responses and which all the world\u2019s nations can get behind. As things stand, we don\u2019t appear to have any idea that this is even required, and it is costing us time, resources, and ultimately, lives.</p><p>To summarise, we need goals:</p><ol><li>To motivate and inspire us</li><li>To achieve worthwhile outcomes</li><li>To provide an organising structure for our pandemic risk management efforts</li><li>To streamline our decision-making</li><li>To avoid box-ticking and other forms of political waste</li><li>To create metrics for assessing our performance</li><li>To provide a basis for co-ordinating international efforts</li><li>Because we cannot solve these problems without them!</li></ol>", "user": {"username": "PandemicRiskMan"}}, {"_id": "XrrhBLi7GYJYnYFSc", "title": "Draft Amnesty Coworking Session #2", "postedAt": "2024-02-27T16:52:12.356Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This event is one of two coworking events the Forum team is running the week before <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NyNa4YYAm7zQuLLva/announcing-draft-amnesty-week-march-11-17\">Draft Amnesty Week</a> (March 11-17) to give people accountability to draft or polish posts.&nbsp;</p><p>We are holding the event in the EA Gather-Town co-working area<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxrrtguykd3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxrrtguykd3\">[1]</a></sup></span>.

The survey consisted of 20 questions asking which interventions played a significant role in people\u2019s decisions to go Vegan (aswell as some general question). The first question of the survey can be found here, all following questions are linked from it: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1arfnyc/the_2024_rvegan_survey_part_1_conversations_with/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1arfnyc/the_2024_rvegan_survey_part_1_conversations_with/</a>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Primary goal of this survey:</strong> My primary aim compared to similar polls in the past (such as this one: <a href=\"https://vomad.life/survey/\">https://vomad.life/survey/</a> ) was to find out for what percentage of people who came in contact with a specific intervention this intervention played a role in their decision to go Vegan. (Hypothetical example: A lot more people might have seen Vegan posts on Social Media than might have come in contact with Street Activism prior to going Vegan, yet if Street Activism played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for a higher percentage of people who came in contact with it than Social Media posts, it might still be a more promising intervention overall.)<br><br><strong>Part 1 - Interventions with played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for the largest number of people who came in contact with them before going Vegan:</strong><br>In this first part of the results, I want to answer the primary question of the survey: which intervention played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for the largest percentage of people exposed to it prior to going Vegan:<br><br>1 - 91,7% - Watching a Vegan Documentary played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 122 out of 133 people who saw such a Documentary before going Vegan.<br><br>2 - 83,3% - Participating in a Vegan Starter Challenge played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 10 out of 12 people who participated in such a challenge before going Vegan.<br><br>3 - 80,4% - Conversations with friends and family members played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 131 out of 163 people who had such conversations before going Vegan.<br><br>4 - 80,4% - Vegan Speeches played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 45 out of 56 people who saw such Speeches before going Vegan.</p><p>5 - 78,4% - Books and scientific articles played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 58 out of 74 people who had read them before going Vegan.<br><br>6 - 74,5% - Short Videos on Social Media played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 70 out of 94 people who had seen such videos before going Vegan.</p><p>7 - 64,8% - Posts on Social Media played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 92 out of 142 people who saw such posts before going Vegan.<br><br>8 - 59,3% - Interacting with animals in real life played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 83 out of 140 people who had frequent contact with animals before going Vegan.</p><p>9 - 57,1% - Public events other than street activism played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 8 out of 14 people who attended such an event before going Vegan.</p><p>10 - 54,9% - Influencers/Celebrities played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 28 out of 51 people who came in contact with a Vegan Influencer/Celebrity before going Vegan.</p><p>11 - 42,9% - Reports about Veganism in the Media played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 15 out of 35 people who saw/heard positive reports about Veganism before going Vegan.</p><p>12 - 35% - Vegan and Animal Rights Organizations played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 14 out of 40 people who came in contact with such organizations before going Vegan.</p><p>13 - 34,1% - More and cheaper Vegan Products being available played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 47 outof 138 people who live in an area where Vegan products are available cheaply and easily.<br><br>14 - 31,4% - Vegan/Animal Rights street activism played a significant role in their decision to go Vegan for 11 out of 35 people who were confronted with street activism before going Vegan.<br><br><strong>Notes on part 1:</strong><br>It is not be entirely fair to compare these numbers, as some of them require deliberate participation (such as watching an entire Documentary or signing up to a Vegan Starter Challenge) while some of them are easier to \u201astumble upon\u2018 (such as a post on Social Media or coming in contact with Vegan Street Activism), and we would expect interventions that require deliberate participation to have significantly higher percentages of people for whom these played a significant part in their decision to go Vegan compared to those people can more easily \u201astumble upon\u2018.<br><br>Also, some of these interventions (such as Vegan Starter Challenges or Public Events) had a very low number of people who answered that they participated in them before going Vegan, which makes their results less reliable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Part 2 - Interventions people most commonly came in contact with overall:</strong><br>While the primary aim of the survey was to find out what percentage of people who came in contact with different interventions were significantly impacted in their decision to go Vegan by those interventions, I think it is also interesting to look at which types of interventions the largest number of people came in contact with in the first place. Here are the 6 most common interventions (over 40%):<br><br>1 - 92,6% or 138 out of 149 people who responded to the survey had frequent contact with animals in real life before going Vegan.<br><br>2 - 71,4% or 140 out of 196 people who responded to the survey had heard of a Vegan starter Challenge before going Vegan.<br><br>3 - 59,9% or 142 out of 237 people who responded to the survey saw Vegan posts on Social Media (other than Short Videos) before going Vegan.<br><br>4 - 57,8% or 163 out of 282 people who responded to the survey had conversations about Veganism with friends or family members before going Vegan.</p><p>5 - 53,4% or 133 out of 249 people who responded to the survey saw a Vegan Documentary before going Vegan.</p><p>6 - 45,4% or 94 out of 207 people who responded to the survey saw Vegan Short Videos on Social Media before going Vegan.<br><br><strong>Part 3 - Interventions sorted by topic (Animals/Ethics, Environment, Health)</strong><br>The first 4 questions of the survey aswell as questions 6 and 7 sorted answers by topic (for example: Conversations about Animals/Ethics vs. Conversations about the Environment vs. Conversations about health, added up this is how many responses each of these three topics got.<br><br>Animals/ethics \u2013 373 votes<br><br>Environment \u2013 52 votes<br><br>Health \u2013 59 votes<br><br><strong>Conclusions:</strong><br><br>While this survey was not conducted according to scientific standards and with the notes on part 1 aswell as the notes below in mind, I am personally taking the following conclusions from this survey (Please take these with a huge grain of Salt!):<br><br>- Documentaries and Conversations with Friends and Family Members seem to be the two standout interventions, that convinced a very high percentage of people who saw/had them to go Vegan, and reached a very high percentage of participants overall.<br><br>- Vegan starter Challenges might be highly effective if people sign up to them, but too few survey participants participated in a Vegan Starter Challenge to say this with any confidence.<br><br>- Our movement might be overly focused on street activism, considering it had the lowest percentage of people exposed to it being significantly influenced by it. (They might however still be a great intervention to build capacity in the movement and get more people to start being active.)<br><br><strong>Notes:</strong><br><br>- The survey originally had an accompanying post explaining what it was all about which linked to the first part of the survey. I also promoted the survey by posting a link to this accompanying post on other subreddits, aswell as other Social Media platforms outside reddit. Unfortunately, this accompanying post was removed by the r/Vegan moderators.<br><br>- Several people pointed out that conducting a survey of 20 questions with 20 different linked polls on reddit was quite difficult to navigate through, which likely resulted in a lot more people answering the first few questions compared to the last few.<br><br>- The survey was conducted online, which might favor interventions people come in contact with online (like Social Media Posts or Documentaries) over real life interventions (like Street Activism or contact with Animals)<br><br>- Questions 16-19 of the survey were about participants\u2019 age, gender, location and how long they have been vegan. Compared to other surveys among Vegans, it is particularely noteworthy that more participants identify as male than female, while comparable surveys almost always have a higher amount of female participants. This was to be expected, as reddit is overwhelmingly male, but it also means that the participants poorly represent the overall Vegan Community.</p>", "user": {"username": "PreciousPig"}}, {"_id": "fXMyB2XeGqmyRrc2m", "title": "Biosecurity and AI: Risks and Opportunities", "postedAt": "2024-02-27T18:46:36.102Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Recent decades have seen massive amounts of biological and medical data becoming available in digital form. The computerization of lab equipment, digitization of medical records, and advent of cheap DNA sequencing all generate data, which is increasingly collected in large data sets available to researchers.</p><p>This bounty of data is driving rapid progress in AI. In combination with increasingly cheap and powerful DNA synthesis and laboratory automation, AI promises to deliver revolutionary advances in medicine via rapid design-build-test cycles. However, <strong>the same capabilities that are driving everything from drug discovery to diagnostic techniques could also revolutionize bioterrorism</strong>, with plausible scenarios ranging from a flu-level virus to a pandemic with an impact exceeding Covid.</p><p>Fortunately, there is much that can be done to mitigate the risk of an AI-assisted pandemic. This is often framed as a conflict between progress and safety, but that needn\u2019t be the case. <strong>Many mitigations are simply sensible public health measures</strong>, such as improved ventilation in public spaces. Where it is necessary to manage the development of AI capabilities, this can be done in a targeted manner. We have the opportunity to simultaneously improve public health, reduce the risk of pandemics, and smooth the path for progress.</p><h2>How AI Could Enable Bioterrorism</h2><p>There are multiple paths through which advances in AI could lead to the deliberate release of a harmful virus. One scenario hinges on the fact, not widely recognized, that the genetic sequences for tens of thousands of human viruses (presenting varying degrees of danger) are already widely available.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref04wl4omqmqws\"><sup><a href=\"#fn04wl4omqmqws\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Advances in DNA/RNA synthesis make it theoretically possible for a disturbed or radicalized individual to recreate a virus; the greatest barrier is knowledge of lab techniques.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref425ynhjd1gw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn425ynhjd1gw\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For many viruses, that barrier is surprisingly low. If the individual had managed to identify a particularly dangerous virus, tens or even hundreds of thousands of deaths could result, comparable to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjh25rnt1qp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjh25rnt1qp\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Future chatbots seem likely to be capable of lowering the bar to such an attack. As models become increasingly \u201cmultimodal\u201d, their training data will soon include video, such as university lectures and lab demonstrations. Such systems would not be limited to providing written instructions; they could plausibly use a camera to observe a would-be terrorist\u2019s work and coach them through each step of viral synthesis. Future models (if not mitigated) also seem likely to be able to provide meaningful help in planning attacks, brainstorming everything from general planning, to obtaining equipment, to applying published research toward creating more-hazardous viruses, to where and how to release a virus to cause maximum impact.</p><p>It is sometimes suggested that these systems won\u2019t make a meaningful difference, because the information they are trained on is already public. However, the runaway success of chatbots stems from their ability to surface the right information at the right time. Google can provide a list of ten web pages that are loosely related to a desired topic; ChatGPT can interpolate between vast amounts of training data to provide precisely the information a user needs, even if they don\u2019t properly know how to ask for it. For instance, a multimodal AI might be able to point out to a would-be bioterrorist that they are committing an error in lab technique that would contaminate their sample and ruin their attempt at viral synthesis.</p><p>Developments in biology could further raise the stakes. Ongoing gain-of-function research could yield the genome for an unusually dangerous virus; or field work could uncover a dangerous animal virus. Alternatively, progressing in characterizing viruses\u2019 pandemic potential might eventually allow an attacker to select the most dangerous of the existing public genomes for synthesis.</p><p>Finally, we must consider the possibility that future specialized biotechnology AIs will be able to support the design of proteins having specific desired behaviors in the body.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff2mee5iyddn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf2mee5iyddn\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This possibility underlies much of the hoped-for potential of AI to revolutionize medicine, but if protein design tools eventually progress as far as some proponents envision, they could be used to increase the transmissibility or lethality of a virus. This could abet the creation of a \u201csupervirus\u201d \u2013 say, combining the rapid spread of measles, the fatality rate of smallpox, and/or the incubation period of HIV.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq7mojt13a2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq7mojt13a2\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The creator of such a virus could then release it under circumstances that allow it to disperse widely before first being detected. It is plausible that the impact would be so severe that people might be afraid to leave their homes, and essential workers might be unable or unwilling to remain on the job, conceivably leading to a breakdown of civilization.</p><h2>General Mitigations for Respiratory Viruses</h2><p>The danger rests on the fact that modern society is highly vulnerable to respiratory viruses in general. Endemic viruses such as flu, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxffsgmdmlb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxffsgmdmlb\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;cause over half a million deaths per year. Actions which make it more difficult for viruses to propagate will yield health and economic benefits today, in addition to reducing the risk of bioterrorism.</p><p><strong>Improvements to air ventilation, filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet lighting</strong> make it more difficult for respiratory viruses to travel from one person to another. UV lighting in particular is an area of active research with considerable potential to reduce viral circulation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref26ie03rp72n\"><sup><a href=\"#fn26ie03rp72n\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Development of broad-spectrum vaccines and antivirals</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaw9x1kddjpa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaw9x1kddjpa\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;could reduce the impact of common viral families such as flu and coronaviruses.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe2v9cb74j4\"><sup><a href=\"#fne2v9cb74j4\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This would reduce the potential for a bad actor to leverage the extensive genetic sequences and knowledge base around these families.</p><h2>General Mitigations for Pandemics</h2><p>Early-detection and rapid-response capabilities can reduce the impact of both engineered and natural pandemics. The Covid pandemic killed over six million people,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8p97qcby7fv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8p97qcby7fv\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and the economic impact is measured in trillions of dollars; some actions to reduce the potential for another pandemic could be carried out at comparatively low cost. The next Covid might be a century away, or Patient Zero might already be developing symptoms today.</p><p><strong>Aggressive monitoring for novel viruses </strong>could detect new viruses before they are able to spread widely. Wastewater monitoring (especially targeting airports and other travel hubs)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvmjfrps6i6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvmjfrps6i6\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;may be particularly effective, but should be combined with other measures, as not all viruses present in wastewater.</p><p><strong>Build the capability to very quickly manufacture and distribute test kits</strong> once a new virus has been identified. Aggressive testing around early cases can help prevent a virus from establishing itself.</p><p><strong>Develop improved PPE</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref28zndvog8jw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn28zndvog8jw\">[12]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;for airborne viruses</strong>, targeting cost/durability, effectiveness, and practicality/comfort. Stockpile PPE for rapid deployment to essential workers.</p><p><strong>Further accelerate our ability to rapidly create, test, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine</strong> for a novel virus.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefehwwei1iw1c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnehwwei1iw1c\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Preventing a Deliberate Virus Release</h2><p>As AIs become more powerful, we will need to carefully manage access to tools that could assist in causing harm, as well as information regarding dangerous viral genomes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqe90ne10dfk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqe90ne10dfk\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Restrictions can be designed to minimize impact on legitimate research, but in some cases there will be tradeoffs to be made.</p><p><strong>Monitor patterns of behavior in users of biotech tools</strong>, to identify individuals who may be attempting to create a dangerous virus.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref11q0tjzeu6fk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn11q0tjzeu6fk\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Encourage reporting of suspicious behavior.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiw94sf4c7d\"><sup><a href=\"#fniw94sf4c7d\">[16]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Limit access to tools needed for creating, synthesizing, or testing a virus</strong>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe119cq2w7st\"><sup><a href=\"#fne119cq2w7st\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;such as specialized AI models (e.g. protein design tools), DNA / RNA synthesis equipment, and other specialized equipment. Measures should include \u201cknow your customer\u201d requirements, tracking of equipment over time, and comprehensive screening of synthesized DNA / RNA sequences. If and when protein design tools become capable of enabling the creation of novel viruses, screening will need to be expanded to detect such novel viruses (a potentially difficult problem).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgn15aakh5ai\"><sup><a href=\"#fngn15aakh5ai\">[18]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Develop techniques for detecting \u201cwarning shots\u201d</strong>. A failed attempt at engineering a pandemic might sicken a small number of people (perhaps the perpetrator). Techniques for identifying novel, suspicious viruses could allow us to head off a successful attack.</p><p><strong>Exclude certain categories of biological knowledge</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5vfrsb4js19\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5vfrsb4js19\">[19]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;from chatbots</strong> and other widely accessible AIs, so as to prevent them from coaching a malicious actor through the creation of a virus. Access to AIs with hazardous knowledge should be restricted to vetted researchers.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwsr3rxs39k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwsr3rxs39k\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Evaluations and red-teaming</strong> to prevent the release of AI models that can assist with the synthesis and release of a virus.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbkayckv3rxd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbkayckv3rxd\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Training an AI to assist with the development of new viruses will likely require assembling large amounts of data regarding the behavior of viruses in the body, so the development of such data sets should be monitored.</p><p><strong>Limit (to the legitimate research community) access to genetic sequences</strong> or other specific information which would identify a specific pathogen as potentially capable of generating a pandemic, and facilitating the synthesis of that pathogen.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzbbxlr3j7up\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzbbxlr3j7up\">[22]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Limit research into techniques for evaluating the potential for viruses to cause harm in humans</strong>, particularly with regard to transmissibility. Especially limit the open publication of such research.</p><p><strong>Apply rigorous risk-benefit analysis to viral gain-of-function research</strong>, including the decision of whether to openly publish the results. This analysis should take into account anticipated developments in synthesis techniques. For instance, if a virus might plausibly be easy to synthesize using the equipment that will plausibly be available ten years from now, then unrestricted publication of the viral genome today might be considered high risk.</p><p>These measures will require identifying legitimate researchers, and restricting access to certain narrow categories of information and tools to people in that circle. Maintaining such restrictions in an effective manner will require new practices in certain scientific and engineering communities.</p><h2>Fostering Security Mindset For Biological Research</h2><p>Restricted access is at odds with the established practices and norms in most scientific fields. Traditionally, the modern academic enterprise is built around openness; the purpose of academic research is to publish, and thus contribute to our collective understanding. Sometimes norms need to adapt to changing circumstances,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe210yz269nf\"><sup><a href=\"#fne210yz269nf\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but this is never easy.</p><p>It is worth noting that virology, like many fields, is already under a heavy regulatory burden, designed to protect both research subjects and the eventual consumers of new drugs and procedures. Adding to this burden should not be taken lightly, but in some cases will be necessary. Historically, regulations and norms have not always been designed to provide the maximum protection in return for the minimum impact on research. Meanwhile, the stakes are higher than ever before: the impact of a new pandemic could be vastly greater than that of an improperly approved drug. And if we wait until the first cases of an engineered virus become visible before applying restrictions on research, that will be much too late to head off the resulting pandemic.</p><p>The important question is whether or not we succeed in preventing an engineered pandemic, as opposed to merely adhering to regulations. Effective biosecurity will require helping the scientific community to adopt a security mindset, educating them on the principles of security and making them into enthusiastic and active participants.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0891lrrrhn8l\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0891lrrrhn8l\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Measures might include:</p><ul><li><strong>Developing specific regulations and best practices</strong>, updated on a regular basis.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Transparent measurement of security effectiveness in practice</strong>, including \u201cred teaming\u201d. For instance, measure the effectiveness of DNA synthesis services at rejecting dangerous sequences,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp297ise3qv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp297ise3qv\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the difficulty of evading know-your-customer measures, and the ability of AIs to assist with lab procedures required to synthesize a virus.</li><li><strong>Promoting a risk-benefit approach</strong> to evaluating research projects.</li><li><strong>Incorporating security and risk management practices</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffjk43y11b4k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfjk43y11b4k\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;into undergraduate education, funding criteria, and publication criteria.</li><li><strong>Education regarding the responsibilities of the scientific community</strong> and how to fulfill them, so that bioscientists and AI developers can not only follow the letter of these procedures and guidelines, but support their spirit, guarding against developments or loopholes that could allow a malicious actor to bypass security mechanisms.<strong>\u200d</strong></li><li><strong>Establish a support center</strong> to provide advice for how to maintain security in specific situations that arise in practice.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd5bb1jgb3h5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd5bb1jgb3h5\">[27]</a></sup></span></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Advances in AI, DNA synthesis, and laboratory automation promise to revolutionize medicine\u2026 but could also open the door to bioterrorism. Through a thoughtful mix of public health measures and targeted management of access to advanced capabilities, we can not only manage this risk, but also reduce the ongoing burden of natural disease.</p><p><i>Guest author Steve Newman, a co-founder of eight startups including Google Docs (n\u00e9e Writely), is now searching for ways to reduce the tension between progress and safety by building a more robust world.

It goes something like this: within any species, or across species, if you have two individuals that communicate, you have senders of information and receivers of information. Both have to benefit from communication. The sender has to, on average, benefit from communication, otherwise they would evolve to stop sending messages. But the receiver also has to, on average, benefit from communication, otherwise they would simply evolve to stop receiving messages. The same way as cave-dwelling animals might lose their vision, because vision is pointless, if most of the signal you were getting from others was noise \u2014 or even worse, it was harmful \u2014 then you would just evolve to stop receiving these signals.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. So in the book you point out that, having said that, a lot of people will be thinking about persuasion and gullibility and convincingness and perceptiveness as a sort of evolutionary arms race between people\u2019s ability to trick one another and people\u2019s ability to detect trickery from others and not be deceived. But your take is that this is sort of the wrong way to think about it. Can you explain why?</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Yes. I think this view of an arms race is tempting, but it\u2019s mistaken in that it starts from a place of great gullibility. It\u2019s as if people started being gullible and then they evolved to be increasingly sceptical and so to increasingly reject messages. Whereas in fact, what we are seeing \u2014 hypothetically, because we don\u2019t exactly know how our ancestors used to communicate \u2014 but if we extrapolate based on other great apes, for instance, we can see that they have a communication system that is much more limited than ours, and they\u2019re much more sceptical.</p><p>For instance, if you take a chimpanzee and you try pointing to help the chimpanzee figure out where something is, the chimpanzee is not going to pay attention to you as a rule. They\u2019re very sceptical, very defiant in a way, because they live in an environment in which they have little reason to trust each other. By contrast, if you take humans as an endpoint \u2014 I mean, obviously chimpanzees are not our ancestors, but assuming our last common ancestor was more similar to the chimps than it was to humans \u2014 if you take a human as the opposite endpoint, we rely usually on communication for everything we do in our everyday life. And that has likely been true for most of our recent evolution, so that means that we have become able to accept more information; we take in vastly more information from others than any other great ape.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> So one take would be that you need discerningness in order to be able to make the information useful to the recipient, so that they can dismiss messages that are bad. And there\u2019s a kind of truth to that. But the other framing is just that you need discerningness in order to make communication take place at all, because if you were undiscerning, you would simply close your ears and, like many other species, basically just not listen or pay no attention or do not process the information coming from other members of your species. So it\u2019s only because we were able to evolve the ability to tell truth from fiction that communication evolved as a human habit at all. Is that basically it?</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Yes, exactly. It\u2019s really striking in the domain of the evolution of communication how you can find communication that works \u2014 even within species, for instance, that you think would be very adversarial. If you take a typical example of some gazelles and some of their predators, like packs of dogs, you think they\u2019re pure adversaries: the dogs want to eat the gazelle; the gazelle doesn\u2019t want to be eaten.</p><p>But in fact, some gazelles have evolved this behaviour of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stotting\">stotting</a>, where they jump without going anywhere \u2014 they just jump on the same place. And by doing that, they\u2019re signalling to the dogs that they\u2019re really fit, and that they would likely outrun the dogs. And this signalling is possible only because this stotting is a reliable indicator that you would outrun the dogs: it\u2019s impossible if you\u2019re a sick gazelle, if you\u2019re an old gazelle, if you\u2019re a young gazelle, if you\u2019re a gazelle with a broken leg. You can\u2019t do it. So the dogs can believe, so to speak, the gazelles, because the gazelles are sending it on a signal.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How AI could make the information environment worse</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I want to come to this other worry, which I called spam. To me, this is the most plausible way that AI could make the information environment worse. This is just helping to produce and disseminate just vast amounts of low-quality or misleading content, even more than exists currently. And now we don\u2019t really expect that it\u2019s going to persuade anyone to buy any particular conclusions, but it\u2019s an alternative effect where it\u2019s just increasing the noise that\u2019s out there; it\u2019s just cluttering up the internet with lots of untrustworthy information, where it\u2019s kind of effortful to figure out that it\u2019s untrustworthy because it looks like a paper, it looks like a real study, it looks like a real blog post.</p><p>So people realise that this is the case and they just begin to mistrust everything that they see a little bit more, because a lot of the cues that they might use to judge the credibility of things are no longer as reliable as they used to be, because they\u2019re too easy to fake. So the end result is just that, for practical reasons, they give up on trying to form strong views on most topics, and they end up feeling that it\u2019s just not really worth the effort to learn about what\u2019s going on, because it\u2019s so easy to generate some fake video of events that never happened, or fake papers purporting to show some conclusion, or fake accounts creating the false impression about what people believe.</p><p>I think one reason I worry about this is that, as I understand it, this has been an approach that many governments have used with their own populations when they\u2019re worried about them rebelling against them: just to produce an enormous amount of noise and confusion. Where it\u2019s not that people believe that the regime is good, but they no longer trust any particular thing that they\u2019re observing, so they just kind of opt out of public discourse.</p><p>What do you think of that risk? Can you imagine that being something that plays out over time?</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> My intuition would be that most people still rely on curation to a large extent. So if you\u2019re going to trust a piece of news to some extent, you make up your own mind based on the content of the news \u2014 and if it\u2019s something that\u2019s too implausible, then you\u2019ll be sceptical. But for all the things that are within the range of things that are broadly plausible, the main moderator is going to be the source. So if you read that in a reliable newspaper, or if it\u2019s tweeted by a colleague that you trust, at least within a given area of expertise, then that\u2019s how you know that the information is reliable, or at least kind of worth considering.</p><p>And the fact that there\u2019s a lot of junk out there shouldn\u2019t change that fundamentally. The only problem would be that if these courtiers of information \u2014 these people who are going to relay information to you by creating it themselves \u2014 if they become less reliable, if their job becomes so hard that they stop being reliable, then everything stops working. But I\u2019m not sure that LLMs are going to make the jobs of journalists that different, in terms of figuring out what\u2019s true or not. I mean, you still have to talk to people, you still have to check your sources. And in many ways, LLMs can help them as well. So on balance, it\u2019s not clear it\u2019s going to make things harder.</p><p>You\u2019re right when you were saying that obviously the strategy of many governments that already have a not-very-trustworthy political system is to increase that mistrust, so that at least potentially more trustworthy agents can\u2019t gain a foothold. That\u2019s why the Germans were trying, in the Second World War, to discredit the BBC: because they knew it was impossible to get the Germans to believe German propaganda anymore, but at least they could try to discredit the other side. And you have the same thing in Russia and China, et cetera. But that can only work if there is not much trust to start with. If you have some actors that are trusted, it\u2019s not obvious how you\u2019re going to make that trust go away.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Redefining beliefs</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> You want to say that people professing silly beliefs that they don\u2019t actually act on, or intuitively incorporate into their world model, that that doesn\u2019t show deep, real gullibility.</p><p>And there are also various other cases of seemingly really daft behaviour that you want to defend and explain in the book as motivated by really understandable, pragmatic, selfish concerns. Basically, if people are persuaded that their self-interest requires them to say that they believe some stupid thing, typically they are willing to do it. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019ve been persuaded of the belief on a deep level. So it\u2019s less, in these cases, an epistemic error, and more a matter that they\u2019re kind of being bribed; they\u2019re being paid to claim that they believe in magic or whatever else.</p><p>One of the examples of this you\u2019ve alluded to earlier is a nontrivial number of people say that they believe the Earth is flat, for instance. How could you explain that? Typically the reason is that people are really enjoying the social group, the kind of social dynamic that comes along with these flat-earther groups. Is there much more to say about that, other than that people who are kind of lonely and maybe don\u2019t feel like they have many allies in life often kind of look for unusual beliefs that can bind a group together that they can all profess? And then that increases the loyalty between them, and allows them to hang out and feel like they have something special?</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Yes, I think that\u2019s a potential explanation. It seems as if people who turn towards conspiracy theories are people who maybe don\u2019t have the status that they think they should have. In the sense that instead of being people who influence others, in terms of having strong opinions about current events and these sort of things, they\u2019re mostly down to just, you have to accept what\u2019s in the newspaper, you have to accept what the authorities say \u2014 and that might not be fully satisfying.</p><p>A lot of people want to contribute to creating their epistemic environment. And if you can\u2019t do that professionally, like if you\u2019re a journalist or researcher or something like this, then it\u2019s tempting to do it in a way that will make up for it \u2014 but because you\u2019re not in a nurturing institutional context, it\u2019s likely to go astray. So people do their own research, and they create these sometimes very elaborate and quite knowledgeable theories about vaccination, or the fact that the Earth is flat, or that whoever is killed\u2026</p><p>In a way, I can really understand their motivation. And I was talking to a journalist who has studied a lot of QAnon people, and he was describing the work that these people were doing and the feelings that they had when they felt they were uncovering new evidence was not very different from what he felt as a journalist when he was figuring out how a story was making sense together. So he really was understanding, in a way, their motivation. Unfortunately, the outcome isn\u2019t great, but the motivation isn\u2019t intrinsically bad.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Vaccine hesitancy</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I guess people who are reluctant to get vaccinations have been pretty vilified in recent years. One explanation for this belief is generally bad judgement; another might be that people are gullible and that they don\u2019t know who to trust, so they\u2019re trusting these quack doctors. What\u2019s your explanation for why so many people are scared to get vaccinated?</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> In a way, we can tell that it\u2019s not sheer gullibility, because we find the same pattern everywhere, and we have found it since the beginning of mandatory vaccination or inoculation in Britain about two centuries ago. In every society, there will be a few percent of people who will quite staunchly oppose vaccination, really kind of anti-vax people. And you\u2019ll have 10%, 20%, 15% or more who are more vaccine hesitant. The worst country probably is actually France, which I\u2019m a bit ashamed about. So you have this, and you find that just about everywhere in the world. Again, you find that in England, as soon as vaccination was introduced. So it just seems to be a fact of human nature that some people will find vaccination to be a bad thing.</p><p>And I think it resonates with a lot of people. Even people who are mostly pro-vax can at least sort of understand the intuition that injecting something that is related to a disease into a baby that is perfectly healthy doesn\u2019t seem like the most straightforward thing to do. Imagine if you didn\u2019t know anything about vaccination and you encounter a tribe that takes a bit of blood from a sick cow and puts it in a perfectly healthy baby. You\u2019re going to think that they\u2019re nuts. I\u2019m taking the example of the cow because that\u2019s how inoculation started with smallpox in the UK.</p><p>So obviously, given everything we know about vaccination, you should do it for all the vaccines that are recommended by the health system. But I can see how it\u2019s not the most intuitive therapy. It\u2019s not like if you have a broken arm and someone said, \u201cProbably we should put the bone right.\u201d \u201cOK, sure. Yeah, let\u2019s do it.\u201d They say, \u201cOh, your kid is perfectly fine. We should take this thing from that sick person and transform it and then put it in your kid.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound great. So there\u2019s an intuition I think that many people share, that vaccination isn\u2019t the best therapy.</p><p>And we know that this is the prime driver and not the stories about vaccination causing autism, for instance. Because as much as in every culture, there are people who are going to doubt vaccination, the reasons that they offer to justify that doubt are going to vary tremendously from one culture to the next. So in the West, it has been a lot recently about vaccines, the MMR vaccine in particular, causing autism. It used to be that the smallpox inoculation would turn you into a cow. There are many cultures in which it\u2019s going to make you sterile, it\u2019s going to give you AIDS, it\u2019s going to give you all sorts of bad things. The justifications vary a lot, because these are the ones that you get from your environment. But the underlying motivation to dislike vaccine is pretty much universal \u2014 not universal in the sense that everybody shares it, but that in every population you\u2019ll have people who are very keen on being anti-vax.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. It does make a lot of sense. At most points in history, if doctors had said, \u201cWhat we should do is take the thing that makes someone else sick and put it on you,\u201d then that actually you would have been pretty justified in saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I think I\u2019m just going to go get the homoeopathy, take just the water,\u201d because that would be a much safer option.</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> It is quite counterintuitive that you should take someone who\u2019s healthy and then give them a transformed disease, basically. So it\u2019s just an unfortunate fact of reality that that actually is the best treatment.</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> That is really bad luck.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Open vigilance</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> It comes from the concept of <a href=\"http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010_clement-et-al_epistemic-vigilance.pdf\">epistemic vigilance</a>, and it\u2019s really the same thing; it\u2019s just kind of rebranding.</p><p>The \u201copen\u201d comes from the fact that all of these mechanisms, as we were hinting at earlier, their main function really is to help us be more open: be more accepting of information, be influenced by others when they\u2019re right and when we\u2019re wrong. That is the ultimate function. We start from this place of we just have our own beliefs that we form through perception and inference, and then the more open we are, the more we\u2019ll be able to benefit from the fact that other people have different knowledge, they have different information from what we have, and we can use that.</p><p>And the \u201cvigilance\u201d comes from the fact that this openness, as we were also kind of saying earlier, is only made possible by the fact that we are vigilant. So it is because we check what people tell us, and we check whether we can trust them or not, that we can afford to be open to what they\u2019re telling us.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> In what ways would you say that we are open to new information?</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> For instance, when someone gives you a good argument, people tend to change their minds. This is something they\u2019ve studied a lot in the lab, in which we give people small logical or mathematical problems to which there is a perfect argument \u2014 like, you can just demonstrate the correct answer in a relatively easy manner, even though most people get it wrong originally, and it\u2019s one of these kind of trick questions, and people have a very strong intuition that they got it right. And in spite of that, when you give them a good argument, they change their minds quite easily. So in a way, the argumentation is the way in which you can exert the most dramatic changes of mind, when you have arguments that are strong enough.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. Many people will have the idea that giving people good arguments for beliefs is not always that effective, and often people will throw out good arguments on spurious grounds, or just because they conflict with what they already believe. You have this example in the book of people who\u2019ve studied whether people sensibly incorporate new information in changing their beliefs. I think many listeners will, like me, have heard of this experiment where people who supported the Iraq War were told later on that WMDs were never found in Iraq, and in fact they didn\u2019t exist, and that this shockingly caused them to become more in favour of the Iraq War rather than less, as you might expect.</p><p>You point out that there\u2019s been a whole slate of experiments of this type done, and that was actually the only case in which people\u2019s beliefs updated in the wrong direction relative to what you might expect. In some cases they didn\u2019t move so much, but that was the one case out of dozens in which it went in the wrong direction. Do you think to some extent people are maybe cherry-picking cases where folks are resistant to arguments, and they ignore the familiar everyday cases when arguments persuade us sensibly all the time?</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Yes, I think there are at least two documented cases of this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance\">backfire effect</a>. There is another one with vaccine hesitancy, I think for one specific vaccine and one specific range of the population. But yes, there are now dozens, if not hundreds, of experiments showing that in the overwhelming or the quasi-entirety of the cases, when you give people a good argument for something, something that is based in fact, some authority that they trust, then they are going to change their mind. Maybe not enough, not as much as we\u2019d like them to, but the change will be in the direction that you would expect. In a way, that\u2019s the sensible thing to do.</p><p>And you\u2019re right that both laypeople and professional psychologists have been and still are very much attracted to demonstrations that human adults are irrational and a bit silly, because it\u2019s more interesting. Look, people can speak \u2014 it\u2019s the most amazing thing maybe in the biological world that we have language. It\u2019s like, well, sure, obviously we have language, but sometimes, one time every maybe 50,000 words, there\u2019s a word that you can\u2019t remember, you have on the tip of the tongue: \u201cOh my god, this is amazing how our brains have been working so poorly.\u201d So yeah, we are attracted by mistakes, by errors, by kind of silly behaviour, but that doesn\u2019t mean this is representative at all.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Intuitive and reflective beliefs</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Intuitive beliefs are beliefs that are formed usually through perception. If I see there\u2019s a desk in front of me, I have an intuitive belief that there\u2019s a desk in front of me, and I\u2019m not going to try walking through it; I know I can put my laptop on it. And also beliefs that are formed through some simple forms of testimony. So if my wife tells me she\u2019s at home tonight, then I\u2019m going to intuitively believe she\u2019s at home tonight. So I will base my behaviour on that, and I will act as if I had perceived that she was at home tonight, for instance. And that\u2019s the vast majority of our beliefs, and things work really well, and these beliefs tend to be consequential and to have behavioural impact.</p><p>By contrast, reflective beliefs are beliefs that we can hold equally strongly as intuitive beliefs, so it\u2019s not just a matter of confidence, but they tend to be largely divorced from our behaviour. So you can believe something, but either because you don\u2019t really know how to act on the basis of that belief or for some other reasons, it doesn\u2019t really translate into the kind of behaviour that one would expect if you held the same belief intuitively.</p><p>So an example that is really striking is conspiracy theories. If you take someone who intuitively believes in a conspiracy \u2014 for instance, someone who works in a company or in a government, and they\u2019ve seen that their boss was shredding documents or was doing something really fishy, and they have good evidence that something really bad is going on \u2014 their reaction is going to be to shut up. They\u2019re going to be afraid for their jobs and, in some places, for their lives. They have a strong emotional component, and their behaviour will be one of really not wanting to say anything, or if they say anything, they won\u2019t want to shout it from the rooftops \u2014 they\u2019ll contact a journalist anonymously or something like this.</p><p>If you can contrast that to the behaviour of conspiracy theorists who don\u2019t have actual perceptual or first-hand evidence of a conspiracy going on, then these people tend not to be afraid. They can say, \u201cI believe the CIA orchestrated 9/11 and they\u2019re this all-powerful, evil institution\u201d \u2014 and yet they\u2019re not going to kill me if I say this. So at worst they\u2019re going to say things, but their emotional and behavioural reactions are really stunted, or really different from what you would expect from someone who would have a similar intuitive belief.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. You give the contrast between, in Pakistan, the intelligence services are known for engaging in all kinds of conspiracy theories all the time, and engaging in basically committing crimes on the regular in order to pursue their agenda. And everyone in Pakistan believes that this is the case, and they know intuitively that it\u2019s the case, and they don\u2019t go out and organise a conference talking about how the security services orchestrated a terrorist attack, because they think that they would be killed.</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Yeah, people who have tried would be dead.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Right. And by contrast, in other places where people claim to believe that the security services are equally evil and organising terrorist attacks all the time, they don\u2019t seem to have much fear that there\u2019ll be any repercussion to saying this. And that\u2019s the difference between intuitive and reflective claims.</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Yes. And ironically, that means that the more vocal conspiracy theories, the more everywhere it is, the less likely it is to be true, in a way \u2014 at least when it comes to an actor that still has a lot of power now. If it comes to old things in the past, then fair enough. But if it comes from an actor, like an institution that is supposed to be really powerful now, the more huge the claims are, the less likely it is to be correct, otherwise you would not be out there saying that.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How people decide who to trust</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> There are two main dimensions of trust, really. One has to do with competence \u2014 essentially, how likely is it that what you\u2019re telling me is true? And that depends on how well informed you are, how much of an expert you are, whether you\u2019re someone who is very knowledgeable in a given area. And for this, we keep track of informational access, for instance. So let\u2019s say we have a friend in common, and I know that you\u2019ve seen her recently. If you tell me something about her, I will tend to believe you, because presumably you\u2019re better informed because you\u2019ve seen her more recently.</p><p>More generally, we are pretty good at figuring out who is an expert in a given area, sometimes on the basis of relatively subtle cues. Like if you have a friend who manages to fix your computer, you\u2019re going to think they\u2019re a good computer person, and maybe you\u2019ll turn to them the next time you have a computer problem.</p><p>So that\u2019s the competence dimension: Does that person know the truth? Do they themselves have accurate beliefs? And the other dimension, which is maybe what we really call trust in everyday life, is: Are they going to tell us that? Because even if I can believe that you\u2019re the most expert person in the world in a given area, if I don\u2019t trust you, if I don\u2019t believe that you will share with me the accurate beliefs that you hold, then it\u2019s no use to me.</p><p>That second dimension, of really trust per se, depends broadly on two things. One is your short-term incentives. So even if you\u2019re my brother, or you\u2019re a very good friend, if we play poker together, I\u2019m not going to believe you \u2014 because I know that if you tell me to fold, you have no incentive to be truthful in the context of poker; we have purely opposite incentives. So there\u2019s this kind of short-term, what can you get from me with that specific message?</p><p>And then there\u2019s the long-term incentives, like: Are you someone whose interests are kind of intermeshed with mine, and someone who would benefit from me doing well? And is that something that\u2019s going to be true moving forward? So if you\u2019re a family member, if you\u2019re a good friend, I know that you don\u2019t have any incentive, or very small incentives, to mislead me \u2014 because then that will jeopardise our relationship, and the cost to you as well as to me would be quite high.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Would you generally say that we have good judgement about who to trust?</p><p><strong>Hugo Mercier:</strong> Yes, on the whole. We make mistakes, but on the whole, I think we\u2019re pretty good. And I think most of the mistakes we make are mistakes of the type that we don\u2019t trust people enough, rather than trusting them too much.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "s6D5Rxsbkm5wpErGP", "title": "Comparing sampling strategies for early detection of stealth biothreats", "postedAt": "2024-02-26T23:14:01.845Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The <a href=\"https://naobservatory.org/\">Nucleic Acid Observatory</a> (NAO) project produced this report to guide our research on disease surveillance methods capable of detecting novel <a href=\"https://www.gcsp.ch/publications/securing-civilisation-against-catastrophic-pandemics\">stealth pathogens</a>.

Summary</strong></h1><p>The NAO\u2019s fundamental mission is to ensure that humanity can reliably detect <a href=\"https://www.gcsp.ch/publications/securing-civilisation-against-catastrophic-pandemics\">stealth pandemics</a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"juyfv01w4h\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjuyfv01w4h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjuyfv01w4h\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;as soon as possible. To achieve this, we need to implement a monitoring system capable of reliably detecting novel outbreaks even in the absence of a strong clinical signal. Such a system could be based on a wide range of possible sampling strategies, including both those that collect material from individuals (<strong>individual sampling</strong>) and those that collect it from the human environment (<strong>environmental sampling</strong>). Different sampling strategies differ in key properties, including detection capability, cost, and credibility to those with the power to initiate an effective response to detection.</p><p>The <strong>detection capability </strong>of a sampling strategy depends on both the size and composition of its <strong>catchment</strong> (the population of individuals contributing material to the sample) and the <strong>microbial composition</strong> of the resulting samples. How these affect detection depends in turn on the methods used to analyze the resulting sequencing data, which can be divided into <strong>static detection</strong> (which detect potential threats based on nucleic-acid sequence features) and <strong>dynamic detectio</strong>n (which detect potential threats based on suspicious temporal patterns of sequence abundance). Dynamic detection methods are typically more vulnerable to noise arising from temporal variability in catchment and microbial composition, and hence benefit more from large, consistent catchments and stable microbial communities with high pathogen abundance.</p><p>Major <strong>costs</strong> associated with biosurveillance include those associated with gaining and maintaining approval; sample collection; sample processing; metagenomic sequencing; and computational analysis. The cost of a given sampling strategy will depend in many ways on its <strong>scale</strong>, in terms of the size of the catchment sampled; the geographic area covered;&nbsp; the temporal density of sampling; and the degree of sequencing effort. In general, individual sampling approaches will exhibit a steeper increase in costs as scale increases, due to the need to collect and process rapidly increasing numbers of individual samples. Conversely, environmental sampling approaches will typically exhibit flatter financial and personnel costs with increasing scale, at the cost of decreasing per-person sensitivity. Environmental sampling strategies also seem likely to incur substantially lower regulatory burdens than individual strategies that involve collecting and handling individually identifiable medical information.</p><p>Finally, in addition to detection capability and cost, sampling strategies differ in their ability to enable and motivate an effective response to a novel outbreak. In general, sampling strategies with smaller catchments will provide more actionable information to policymakers when it comes to targeted responses (e.g. contact tracing and isolation). Sampling strategies that provide identifiable cases and affected constituencies may also prove more effective at motivating a response from policymakers with strong political incentives to avoid drastic interventions. However, sampling strategies that might struggle to enable and motivate an immediate targeted response can still provide scientists and policymakers with invaluable situational awareness about pathogen distribution, prevalence and spread. Overall, a multi-tiered approach, in which large-catchment surveillance triggers more targeted monitoring when signs of an outbreak are found, may prove most effective at balancing competing needs for sensitivity, credibility, and cost-effectiveness.</p><h1><strong>I. Introduction &amp; background</strong></h1><p>To reliably detect stealth pandemics<a href=\"https://naobservatory.org/reports/comparing-sampling-strategies-for-early-detection-of-stealth-biothreats/#fnref-1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, we need a suitable monitoring system that collects samples in the right places, processes them in the right way, and analyzes the resulting data using algorithms with the right detection capabilities. So far, the work of the NAO has primarily focused on wastewater sampling. This has many advantages, but also faces major challenges in the context of untargeted pathogen detection. Thus, while we will continue to invest in wastewater sampling, we also want to make sure that we aren\u2019t missing out on alternative, possibly more effective strategies. This report provides an introduction and conceptual framework for this work.</p><h2><strong>Goals &amp; assumptions</strong></h2><p>In order to prioritize among different sampling approaches, we need to be clear about what our goals are. There are several key assumptions going into this analysis that it\u2019s important to make explicit:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial detection of a stealth pandemic:</strong> The core objective of the NAO is to detect novel stealth biothreats \u2013 pathogens that are able to infect many people without being detected by existing systems of infectious disease surveillance<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"jqai8n1d2de\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjqai8n1d2de\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjqai8n1d2de\">[2]</a></sup></span>, e.g. due to a very long incubation period. This goal is very different from ongoing monitoring of a known threat: the objective is to detect the pathogen &amp; identify it as a major threat at least once, anywhere. Techniques and approaches that are suitable for ongoing monitoring may not be appropriate for effective initial detection, and vice versa<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"ilm9om9xpkc\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefilm9om9xpkc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnilm9om9xpkc\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</li><li><strong>Detection, not suppression:</strong> In traditional public health, the primary function of early detection of outbreaks is to suppress them via targeted interventions (e.g. isolation, contact tracing, or ring vaccination). Many discussions of biosurveillance tacitly assume this framing. We are both more pessimistic and more optimistic than this traditional framing: pessimistic that a stealth threat will be detected early enough to achieve suppression, and optimistic that even much later detection (e.g. at 1/1000 or even 1/100 cumulative incidence) can provide major benefits<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"25i5n2amsrb\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref25i5n2amsrb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn25i5n2amsrb\">[4]</a></sup></span>compared to no detection. As such, we are not primarily assessing detection strategies on their ability to enable rapid targeted response or suppression, but rather on their ability to enable reliable early detection per se.</li><li><strong>Pathogen-agnostic detection via metagenomic sequencing:</strong> When it comes to initial detection of a novel pathogen, targeted detection approaches like qPCR are inadequate; instead, we need an approach that is capable of picking up signatures of pathogens we aren\u2019t already looking for. Currently, the most promising technology for this purpose is <a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/cmr.00119-22\">metagenomic sequencing</a> (MGS)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"hbydp0ykgh6\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhbydp0ykgh6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhbydp0ykgh6\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(Gauthier et al., 2023). While it\u2019s possible that a future NAO-like system may come to rely on technologies other than MGS, for the purpose of this report we\u2019re assuming that MGS is the core detection technology being used.</li></ul><h2><strong>Categorizing sampling approaches</strong></h2><p>Given our focus on human-infecting pathogens, all our sampling strategies of interest involve collecting material produced by human bodies. This material can be collected directly from individuals (<strong>individual sampling</strong>) or from environmental substrates into which it has been shed (<strong>environmental sampling</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"aan4ljuisg8\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaan4ljuisg8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaan4ljuisg8\">[6]</a></sup></span>). Individual and environmental sampling thus represent two broad categories, each of which encapsulates a number of specific sampling strategies. Examples of promising individual sampling strategies include saliva, blood, and combined nose/throat swabs, while examples of promising environmental strategies include municipal wastewater, aggregated airplane lavatory waste, and air sampling from airplanes or crowded indoor areas.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/s6D5Rxsbkm5wpErGP/kmzavkherfekrqvmsnin\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Environmental vs individual sampling.</strong> Individual sampling collects specimens (e.g. swabs, blood, saliva) directly from individual people, whereas environmental sampling collects environmental specimens (e.g. from air, wastewater, surfaces) containing emitted human material.</figcaption></figure><p>Within both individual and environmental sampling, strategies can differ in both the type of material that is collected (specimen type), and the population of individuals contributing to the sample (catchment). Both have critical implications for the value of a given sampling strategy, and are discussed further below.</p><h2><strong>Formalizing threat detection methods</strong></h2><p>The suitability of different sampling approaches for early detection of a subtle pathogen depends on the computational method used to analyze the resulting data. As such, it\u2019s helpful to have a clearer formalization of how such methods might function.</p><p>Consider a population of human individuals, within which we aim to detect any newly-emerged stealth pathogen as early as possible (within resource constraints). Call this the <strong>population of interest</strong>; depending on context, this could be the population of the world, a particular country, or a specific sub-population<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"00rotqzrv398g\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref00rotqzrv398g\"><sup><a href=\"#fn00rotqzrv398g\">[7]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>In order to detect pathogens spreading in the population of interest, we collect samples containing material contributed by some subset of individuals from that population; this contributing subpopulation is the <strong>catchment</strong>. These samples are subject to sample preparation, MGS, and data processing; the end result is a collection of nucleic-acid <i>sequences</i> (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer\">k-mers</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contig\">contigs</a>) along with counts assigned to each sequence quantifying their abundance in the sample.</p><p>From here, the goal is to identify sequences corresponding to genuine <i>threats</i>: pathogens (especially stealth pathogens) present in the catchment that threaten the health of the population of interest. To do this, the sequences and counts are fed into one or more <strong>threat detection methods</strong> that attempt to distinguish threatening from non-threatening sequences<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"w1v4b7z4zlk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw1v4b7z4zlk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw1v4b7z4zlk\">[8]</a></sup></span>. While a thorough survey of possible detection methods is beyond the scope of this report, we can sketch out two broad categories that share certain features:</p><p><strong>Static detection</strong> methods focus primarily on the sequence component of the processed data, attempting to identify nucleic-acid <i>sequence features</i> associated with potential threats. Potential forms of static detection include:</p><ul><li><i>Homology-based detection, </i>wherein sequences are tagged as threatening based on their similarity to existing known threats (e.g. a novel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-related_coronavirus\">sarbecovirus</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filoviridae\">filovirus</a>).</li><li><i>Genetic engineering detection,</i> wherein detection algorithms identify signatures of artificial sequence tampering as signals of a potential threat.</li><li><i>Pathogenicity prediction,</i> wherein detection algorithms attempt to directly identify sequence features predictive of causing ill-health.</li><li>Heuristic <i>by-eye </i>approaches, wherein abundant sequences in a sample are manually inspected for \u201cobvious\u201d warning signs (which might include elements of any or all of the above approaches).</li></ul><p><strong>Dynamic detection</strong> methods, in contrast, focus on the observed counts of different sequences over time, identifying potential threats based on specific temporal patterns that are deemed suspicious. Potential forms of dynamic detection include:</p><ul><li><i>Growth-based detection</i>, wherein the counts associated with particular sequences are used to estimate (explicitly or implicitly<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"32bynm2giws\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref32bynm2giws\"><sup><a href=\"#fn32bynm2giws\">[9]</a></sup></span>) the true abundance of the corresponding sequence in the population at large.

Genetic engineering detection identifies signatures of artificial sequence tampering. Growth-based detection uses sequence count time-series data to track and flag suspicious growth patterns. Novelty detection uses previously seen sequencing data as a reference against which to identify and flag novel sequences.</figcaption></figure><p>Static and dynamic detection methods have some important differences:</p><ul><li><strong>Agnosticity/generality: </strong>Any static-detection method must make specific assumptions about what characteristics make a sequence potentially threatening. They thus leave open the risk of missing threats that do not satisfy (or have been deliberately engineered to evade) these assumptions. In contrast, dynamic detection approaches only assume that a pathogen\u2019s sequence will grow in a particular way, which seems much more difficult to avoid or evade.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Specificity: </strong>The very minimality of their assumptions may also leave dynamic-detection approaches more vulnerable to <i>false positives</i>: sequences that happen to grow in a \u201cthreatening\u201d manner without posing a true threat to the population of interest. Conversely, the reliance of static methods on more detailed features of NA sequences will likely allow for fewer false positives (i.e. greater specificity).</li><li><strong>Reliance on time-series data:</strong> By definition, dynamic detection methods identify threats by tracking changes in sequence abundance over time. As a result, this approach requires collecting relatively dense (and expensive) MGS time series, in which the relative abundance of each sequence can be estimated at multiple successive time points. In contrast, static methods can identify threats based on data from a single time-point, and so do not require extensive time-series data<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"11\" data-footnote-id=\"eq0y6h83oaw\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeq0y6h83oaw\"><sup><a href=\"#fneq0y6h83oaw\">[11]</a></sup></span>.</li><li><strong>Reliance on accurate abundance estimates:</strong> As described above, some dynamic detection methods rely on the ability to discern particular growth signatures over time. To achieve this, growth trends inferred from sequencing data should correspond to real epidemiological trends in the population of interest. These methods will fail if noise and (inconsistent) bias in the data obscure these real-world trends. In static detection or novelty detection, conversely, the accuracy of inferred abundances relative to the real population is not of critical importance, as long as (1) the sequence of interest occurs at all in the dataset, and (2) its count is high enough to be confident that it reflects a real sequence present in the catchment (as opposed to a sequencing error, contamination, etc)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"12\" data-footnote-id=\"ppq3tc2m9fj\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefppq3tc2m9fj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnppq3tc2m9fj\">[12]</a></sup></span>.</li></ul><p>Many detection methods \u2013 especially those that are heuristic in nature \u2013 will in practice combine elements of both temporal and static detection, and consequently sit at an intermediate point on these various axes. Ultimately, the detection of a threat is a Bayesian process, in which many different features of a sequence (both temporal and static) can contribute to an overall assessment of threat.</p><h1><strong>III. Detection capability across sampling strategies</strong></h1><p>Central to any discussion of the viability of any sampling strategy is its <strong>detection capability</strong>: its ability, when implemented competently and combined with a suitable detection method, to identify a wide range of threats in a reliable and timely manner. The detection capability of a sampling strategy is affected by a range of factors, most of which fall into two broad categories: those pertaining to the <i>catchment</i> of individuals sampled by a given strategy, and those pertaining to the composition of the <i>specimen</i> obtained<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"13\" data-footnote-id=\"ksoix4hy1y\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefksoix4hy1y\"><sup><a href=\"#fnksoix4hy1y\">[13]</a></sup></span>.</p><h2><strong>Catchment</strong></h2><p>As defined <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrgAJP1hhapzNtTL13xqrv_hdcZl1w1pSxuehFjefho/edit#heading=h.flk6x7xtcx3q\">above</a>, the <i>catchment</i> of a sampling strategy is the set of human individuals contributing material to the collected sample<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"14\" data-footnote-id=\"9ymnijb7qta\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9ymnijb7qta\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9ymnijb7qta\">[14]</a></sup></span>. This catchment is a subset of the <i>population of interest</i>, within which we are aiming to detect the emergence of a novel pandemic pathogen. The relationship between the catchment and the population of interest \u2013 in particular, the <i>size</i> of the catchment and its <i>composition</i> relative to the population of interest \u2013 is a central factor in the overall efficacy of any given sampling approach.</p><h3><strong>Catchment size</strong></h3><p>In accordance with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers\">law of large numbers</a>, aggregated samples taken from catchments of increasing size will tend in composition towards the overall composition of the population of interest, reducing the expected deviation between the measured abundance of each sequence in sequencing data and its true prevalence in the larger population. For dynamic detection methods, this effect is highly desirable, as it reduces noise in estimates of sequence abundance and increases the power of these methods to detect suspicious temporal trends. As a result, catchment size is a key factor to consider when selecting a sampling strategy for dynamic detection.</p><p>In many cases, larger catchments are also desirable for static detection methods. When the prevalence of the pathogen of interest is sufficiently high in the population, the reduced noise of larger catchments enables these methods to detect it more reliably. However, when prevalence is low, larger catchments can actually harm detection capability for these methods: in this latter case, a large-catchment sample will fall below the method\u2019s detection threshold with high probability, while a small-catchment sample that contains a few infected individuals might exceed the threshold through chance alone (Figure 6, Appendix 1). Hence, while frequently helpful, increased catchment size is less of an unalloyed good for static than for dynamic detection.</p><p>Large catchments also have other potential downsides in practice:</p><ul><li>Most obviously, for many (but not all) sampling approaches, sampling from a larger catchment is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrgAJP1hhapzNtTL13xqrv_hdcZl1w1pSxuehFjefho/edit#heading=h.jb9snub757t4\">much more expensive</a> than sampling from a small one.&nbsp;</li><li>Sampling from a larger catchment will also generally increase the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrgAJP1hhapzNtTL13xqrv_hdcZl1w1pSxuehFjefho/edit#heading=h.vev34k17384g\">background complexity</a> of the sample, as different individuals will contribute distinct microbial signatures to the final dataset.</li><li>For some sampling approaches such as wastewater, increasing catchment size also frequently increases the degree of dilution by abiotic or nonhuman material, reducing <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrgAJP1hhapzNtTL13xqrv_hdcZl1w1pSxuehFjefho/edit#heading=h.clva24q4inzu\">pathogen abundance</a>.</li></ul><p>Small catchments allow creation of richer metadata on the individuals included in the catchment, enabling both richer data analysis and more targeted <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrgAJP1hhapzNtTL13xqrv_hdcZl1w1pSxuehFjefho/edit#heading=h.5675t6y51a1a\">responses</a>.</p><p>In some cases, the tradeoffs between small and large catchments can be avoided by taking many small-catchment samples in parallel, then pooling material or data from these samples to create larger catchments synthetically. This allows the effective catchment to be adjusted as desired, while retaining the rich metadata of the small-catchment samples. However, for sampling approaches with relatively flat <a href=\"http://cost/\">cost/catchment scaling</a> (such as wastewater), this parallel pooled approach will often still be much more expensive than sampling a smaller number of larger catchments.</p><h3><strong>Geographic bias</strong></h3><p>In any monitoring system, the population of interest will be distributed spatially across some area<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"15\" data-footnote-id=\"tyrndjuysf\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftyrndjuysf\"><sup><a href=\"#fntyrndjuysf\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the US or the world. Different catchments will vary in how representatively they reflect this geographic distribution; we can define a catchment as more global if its spatial distribution is representative of the population of interest, and more local if it instead exhibits a strong bias towards particular locations.</p><p>Any sampling method requires geographical co-location between the sampling mechanism and the sample source, be that a person or an environmental area. As a result, many sampling strategies<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"16\" data-footnote-id=\"ieisga3bky\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefieisga3bky\"><sup><a href=\"#fnieisga3bky\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;are constrained to sample local catchments, composed primarily of people who live and/or work close to the sampling location. In order to instead achieve global sampling, some special effort is needed, such as:</p><ol><li>Conducting local sampling in parallel at multiple locales (e.g. wastewater sampling at multiple treatment plants in different cities). This method is simple and effective, but resource-intensive and logistically challenging.</li><li>Conducting remote sampling, in which individuals widely distributed in space are requested to collect and mail samples in their local area (e.g. self-collected swabs or \u201ccitizen science\u201d surface swabbing (McDonald et al., 2018; Roberts, 2020)). This approach is potentially lower cost than parallel local sampling, but requires coordination among many unaffiliated individuals.</li><li>Targeting local sampling to sites that are highly enriched for individuals who have recently traveled long distances, effectively achieving a more global catchment at a single sampling site. The most attractive sites for this purpose will typically be long-distance transport hubs and/or vehicles, with airports and airplanes offering the greatest potential for a truly global sample. While cost-effective, the catchment sizes accessible with this approach will inevitably be lower than some more local sampling approaches \u2013 for example, the population contributing the airport wastewater, while more geographically diverse, will also be much smaller than that contributing to the local wastewater treatment plant.</li></ol><p>The effect of the geographic bias of a catchment on detection capability is significantly more complex and case-dependent than that of catchment size. In particular, the impact of spatial distribution on detection depends heavily on the dynamics of disease spread relative to the spatial migration of individuals. For example, if the incidence of new infections is sufficiently low relative to migration, then the issue of local versus global sampling can largely be ignored, as the disease will effectively be well-mixed across the population even at low prevalence. Conversely, if migration is very slow relative to disease spread, then the disease will progress as a series of largely independent outbreaks in different locations, in which case the location at which sampling is taking place will have a major impact on the speed of detection. Intermediate cases will exhibit complex interdependencies between transmission, migration and other factors, the understanding of which will require further investigation.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/s6D5Rxsbkm5wpErGP/b41fstpvkxgnneais2h4\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Geographic bias. </strong>Catchments can differ in their spatial representativeness compared to the population of interest (gray). A more global catchment (blue) is more representative of the spatial distribution of the underlying population, while a more local catchment (green) exhibits unrepresentative concentration in one or more particular areas.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Consistency of composition</strong></h3><p>Some sampling methods will sample from a very consistent population: the residents of a particular building, the students and staff at a particular school, the employees of a particular company. Others will show some variation in catchment from day to day, but maintain a reasonably high level of consistency overall: the current population of a particular town, or the commuters passing through a particular rail station at 8.45am.</p><p>Other sampling strategies, however, will sample from catchments that change dramatically from day to day. Long-distance travel hubs especially will often show very low consistency, with only a minority of the population<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"17\" data-footnote-id=\"pkyycca7j6n\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpkyycca7j6n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpkyycca7j6n\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;passing through on day n returning on day n+1. Furthermore, the distribution of geographic origins of these individuals might also vary significantly day to day; given that the metagenomic content of both human and environmental samples shows significant geography-dependent variation, this could result in greatly increased day-to-day volatility in the resulting MGS data.</p><p>As with local vs global catchment distribution, we don\u2019t yet have a deep understanding of the effects of catchment inconsistency on detection capability. On the one hand, as an additional source of noise and variable bias, it could act as a confounding variable reducing the detection capability of dynamic detection approaches<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"18\" data-footnote-id=\"oewo3jjbwbg\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoewo3jjbwbg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoewo3jjbwbg\">[18]</a></sup></span>. On the other hand, by varying the catchment day-by-day, it can avoid risks of \u201clock-in\u201d to a poorly chosen initial catchment, thus increasing the detection capability of static detection methods. Further investigation is needed to improve our understanding of the importance of this factor in assessing different sampling strategies.</p><h3><strong>Correlation with infection status</strong></h3><p>When it comes to outbreaks, not all catchments are created equal. Some groups \u2013 whether delineated by location, occupation, or some other factor \u2013 will tend to experience more infections earlier in an outbreak than the general population. Early in an outbreak, these groups (e.g., healthcare workers, airline staff, military personnel, or international travelers) will be significantly enriched for infected individuals \u2013 e.g. because they are especially likely to contact infected individuals, be targeted by a bioattack, or be particularly susceptible to infection.&nbsp;</p><p>Targeted sampling of such \u201csentinel\u201d populations could thus give advance warning of an outbreak. Weighed against this benefit, the main costs of focusing on a sentinel population are (1) the logistical burden associated with identifying and targeting members of that population, and (2) the smaller <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrgAJP1hhapzNtTL13xqrv_hdcZl1w1pSxuehFjefho/edit#heading=h.v8nstf8f6932\">catchment size</a> associated with excluding non-members from your sample. The severity of (1) depends on the sentinel population in question; populations that are easier to identify and access will make more promising sentinels than those that are more difficult. The severity of (2) depends substantially on the cost/catchment scaling of your chosen sampling approach: the cheaper a marginal increase in catchment size, the greater the counterfactual cost of focusing on a smaller sentinel group compared to the general population.</p><p>At a finer level of detail, some populations will be enriched for cases at a particular stage in the course of infection, e.g. disproportionately early or late cases. The most obvious example of this is symptomatic patients at a hospital: while these will be highly enriched for diseases able to cause their symptoms, they will also be highly enriched for being in the later, symptomatic stages of infection. As a result, relying on hospital cases might result in later detection than if you\u2019d sampled a population with a greater proportion of early cases, even if the total enrichment for cases is much lower (e.g. municipal wastewater).</p><h2><strong>Specimen composition</strong></h2><p>Even holding the catchment constant, different sampling strategies will provide specimens with significantly different microbial content. MGS data produced from these specimens will thus differ in both the observed abundance of pathogens of interest, and in the composition and complexity of the microbial background. Both of these can have important implications for our ability to detect novel threats.</p><h3><strong>Pathogen abundance</strong></h3><p>Not all pathogens get everywhere in the human body. They have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_tropism\">tropisms</a>, disproportionately infecting specific cell and tissue types within the host and avoiding others. Respiratory pathogens will tend to infect cells or tissues in the respiratory tract, while gastrointestinal pathogens will tend to be found at high concentrations in the gut lumen and gut epithelial cells. Pathogens also differ in the <i>breadth</i> of their tropism, with some (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) infecting many more cell types than others (e.g., influenza)<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/D8bra9/GEZW\"> </a>(Flerlage et al., 2021). As a result, different pathogens will show dramatically different <strong>shedding patterns</strong>, which in turn result in very different abundances across different sampling strategies, whether individual (e.g., nasal swabs vs blood samples) or environmental (e.g., wastewater vs air sampling).</p><p>In addition to shedding dynamics, pathogen abundance in a sample will also be critically affected by its <strong>physical stability</strong> during the period between shedding and sample collection. This is especially important for environmental sampling: the more quickly a pathogen degrades in the environment \u2013 whether due to environmental nucleases, abiotic reactions, bacteria, bleach, or some other factor \u2013 the less of it will be detectable in the sample upon collection. In addition to the composition of the environment (e.g. concentration and activity of nucleases), stability depends heavily on the physical composition of the pathogen in question: for example, enveloped viruses will generally be less stable outside a host than non-enveloped viruses, and RNA genomes will degrade more quickly than DNA genomes.</p><p>In addition to physical stability, the locational/<strong>spatial stability</strong> of the pathogen at the sampling site will also affect its abundance. If some process (e.g. water flow or cleaning) removes intact pathogen from the sampling location before it can be sampled, its measured abundance will be reduced. Higher rates of removal effectively act as degradation processes, reducing the half-life of the pathogen at the sampling site.</p><p>Finally, the abundance of a pathogen in an environmental sample will depend on the degree of <strong>dilution</strong> of human material in the sample by nonhuman and/or abiotic material. This again varies dramatically between sample types \u2013 for example, municipal wastewater is far more dilute (with many more liters of water per unit mass of stool) than airplane wastewater, and virtually all environmental sampling will be far more dilute than any kind of human sampling. Increased dilution has the effect of reducing the absolute abundance of all human-originating microorganisms in the sample, as well as potentially introducing new, non-human-infecting microorganisms (e.g. from soil or other animals).</p><p>Factors like these are primarily of concern insofar as they alter the <i>relative</i> abundance of pathogen sequences compared to other nucleic acids in the sample. Lower relative abundance will increase noise and reduce sensitivity, necessitating a corresponding increase in sequencing effort (&amp; concomitant costs) to compensate. <i>Variability</i> in relative abundance (absent true changes in pathogen prevalence) will confound dynamic detection methods by obscuring trends in pathogen growth. Within reason, changes in <i>absolute</i> pathogen abundance that do not affect relative abundance (e.g. due to dilution by abiotic material) are not of huge concern for detection capability; however, extreme reductions in absolute abundance, beyond our ability to concentrate the sample, can impact sensitivity<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"19\" data-footnote-id=\"zzdnajxzvso\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzzdnajxzvso\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzzdnajxzvso\">[19]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>While some processes affecting pathogen abundance (e.g. flow rates) can to some degree be considered in isolation from any specific pathogen, others (e.g. physical stability or tropism) depend sensitively on the specific properties of the pathogen in question. While we can make some general statements about the classes of pathogens we\u2019re concerned about from the perspective of a severe pandemic<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"20\" data-footnote-id=\"t2ttkgxl12f\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft2ttkgxl12f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt2ttkgxl12f\">[20]</a></sup></span>, it\u2019s difficult to make strong claims<i> ex ante </i>about the detailed shedding or stability characteristics of the pathogens a system needs to detect. Consequently, it\u2019s important to design these systems with a broad range of pathogen properties in mind.</p><h3><strong>Microbial background</strong></h3><p>In addition to the abundance of the pathogen itself, the abundance and composition of a sample\u2019s microbial <i>background</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"21\" data-footnote-id=\"sbmzld2kur\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsbmzld2kur\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsbmzld2kur\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;also impacts detection capability. Different sampling strategies will result in backgrounds that differ dramatically in both composition and complexity: the microbiome of stool is very different from that of exhaled breath, which in turn is very different from that of saliva. MGS data obtained from these different samples will in turn exhibit very different composition.</p><p>The most straightforward way in which background affects detection capability is by altering the relative abundance of any pathogens of interest in the sample. Due to the compositional nature of sequencing data, the number of reads obtained from any given sequence depends not only on the abundance of that sequence, but also on that of all other sequences in the sample. A sample with lower absolute pathogen abundance might still produce a stronger signal if the absolute abundance of the microbial background is lower still.</p><p>Beyond simple considerations of relative abundance, many people have the intuition that more complex samples \u2013 those whose background is more taxonomically diverse and/or shows more complex temporal dynamics \u2013 should be worse for detection capability. Formalizing this is challenging, but there are a number of factors that point in the direction of this intuition being roughly correct. In discussing these, we can broadly separate arguments that relate to the static taxonomic diversity of the background from those that relate to dynamic changes in composition over time.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/s6D5Rxsbkm5wpErGP/ut5knpq4l4jplvcm5fkf\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 4: Static complexity and Dynamic complexity. </strong>Static complexity refers to the taxonomic diversity of an individual sample, with more complex samples containing more taxa and/or more uneven abundance distributions among taxa.

We expect some sample types of interest (e.g. wastewater) to be much more complex than others (e.g. blood<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"22\" data-footnote-id=\"othmehyz7oh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefothmehyz7oh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnothmehyz7oh\">[22]</a></sup></span>), with implications for their suitability for threat detection:</p><ul><li>One way to increase the relative abundance of pathogens of interest, and thus increase sensitivity, is to specifically reduce the absolute abundance of the background. This kind of background depletion is much more effective when the background is simpler: by depleting only one or a few particular taxa, one can significantly alter the relative abundance of any potential pathogens of interest. For example, in the case of human sampling, targeted removal of human nucleic acids can significantly increase MGS sensitivity &amp; reduce costs (Shi et al., 2022). Conversely, when the background is highly taxonomically complex (comprising e.g. many hundreds or thousands of abundant taxa), background depletion becomes much more challenging.</li><li>The more taxonomically complex the background, the more difficult it will be to characterize its composition adequately to reliably detect notable/threatening additions. From a Bayesian perspective, observing a new sequence in a highly simple and stable community is a strong signal of a genuine &amp; interesting addition, while in a highly complex community with many low-abundance members it is much more likely to be an artifact of measurement or random low-level fluctuations.</li><li>Depending on the distribution of abundances within a microbial community, high taxonomic complexity can confound attempts to improve detection capabilities through increasing sequencing effort. If a community is roughly power-law distributed, with very many low-abundance species, increasing sequencing effort will roughly always discover previously unseen (but not genuinely new) taxa, while measurement noise will constantly raise \u201cnew\u201d taxa above the threshold of detection. As such, complex communities will likely exhibit much more severe problems with noise and false positives than simple ones.</li></ul><p><strong>Dynamic complexity: </strong>No microbial community is static. Over time, the microbial composition of a series of specimens taken from a given source will change as a result of endogenous ecological and evolutionary processes; seasonal and other changes in the abiotic environment; changes in the composition of the sample catchment; and changes (e.g. dietary) in the behavior of the human individuals in that catchment. The composition of any resulting metagenomic dataset will thus vary over time, with several important effects on detection capability:</p><ul><li>Changes in background will directly affect the measured abundance of any pathogen of interest, both by altering its relative abundance in the sample and by altering the average sequencing efficiency (McLaren, Willis and Callahan, 2019) of the background relative to the pathogen. The resulting noise might obscure true changes in pathogen abundance. Dynamic detection methods will be especially vulnerable to these effects, increasing the relative attractiveness of static approaches for high-temporal-complexity samples.</li><li>Growth and decay of non-pathogenic background taxa will also increase the number of innocuous sequences that appear to be undergoing threatening changes in abundance, resulting in an increased number of false positives raised by any given dynamic detection method. This effect will be particularly strong in cases where the rate of growth seen in background fluctuations is similar to the typical growth rate expected in genuinely concerning cases. If severe enough, this effect could impede a system\u2019s ability to effectively investigate and identify true threats.</li><li>Finally, high dynamic complexity will also further confound attempts to improve sensitivity through background depletion (see above), as the most important background components to deplete will change over time.</li></ul><h1><strong>IV. Cost</strong></h1><p>So far, we\u2019ve discussed the detection capabilities of different sampling strategies in the abstract, without reference to the cost and feasibility of actually implementing different approaches. However, given limited resources, the costs associated with any given sampling strategy&nbsp; \u2013 in money, time, personnel hours, political capital, and other resources \u2013 are inevitably critical in determining its viability.</p><p>Any sequencing-based biosurveillance project will incur a wide range of different costs, both fixed and scaling with the number of sites, samples, and days of operation (Table 1). These costs will vary substantially between sampling approaches, both in their initial magnitude and their scaling behavior. While a detailed, quantitative cost model of different sampling strategies would require in-depth modeling beyond the scope of this report, we do feel able to make some qualitative observations:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Stage</th><th style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Description</th><th style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Examples</th><th style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Scaling</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Approval</th><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Delays, staff time, and possibly payments involved in securing agreement from site owners, regulatory authorities, and other major stakeholders.</td><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Approval from hospital to collect samples from patients; approval from airport operator to install samplers in terminals.</td><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Primarily per-site.</td></tr><tr><th style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Sample collection</th><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Space, equipment, consumables, staff time and energy costs involved in obtaining samples from individuals or the environment.</td><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Buying and operating a wastewater autosampler; collection tubes for saliva samples; staff training for collection of nasal swabs.</td><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Per-site (space, equipment), per-sample<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"23\" data-footnote-id=\"o33o67y4ce9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo33o67y4ce9\"><sup><a href=\"#fno33o67y4ce9\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(consumables), and per-unit-time (staff pay, equipment rental).</td></tr><tr><th style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Sample processing</th><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Costs associated with laboratory processing of collected samples, including lab space, equipment, consumables, and staff time.</td><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Rental of lab space &amp; equipment; reagents for sequencing library prep; operation of freezers for long-term sample storage; staff time for protocol development and execution.</td><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Per-site (if performed locally but not if centralized), per-sample (consumables), per-unit-time (staff pay, equipment rental)</td></tr><tr><th style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Sequencing</th><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Costs associated with sequencing processed samples, including relevant consumables, equipment, energy costs, and staff time.</td><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Costs of purchasing &amp; operating sequencers; payments to outsource sequencing to external providers.</td><td style=\"border:0px solid currentcolor;padding:0.25rem 0.5rem\">Per-site (if performed locally but not if centralized), per-sample (consumables, outsourcing costs), per-unit-time (staff pay, equipment rental).</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Cost categories associated with each sampling strategy.</p><ul><li><strong>Sampling effort: </strong>In general, most individual sampling approaches seem likely to be markedly more intensive than environmental sampling in terms of materials (especially consumables) and staff time. The number of \u201csample collection operations\u201d performed by each staff member per day is likely to be much higher for individual<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"24\" data-footnote-id=\"h3e774zyu9q\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh3e774zyu9q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh3e774zyu9q\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;than environmental sampling, as is the number of parallel laboratory steps carried out during sample processing.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Pathogen abundance: </strong>In contrast, the relative abundance of a pathogen of interest will likely be considerably higher in a well-chosen individual sample from an infected individual, than in an environmental sample. This means that the amount of sequencing required could be significantly lower, reducing costs commensurately.</li><li><strong>Costs of catchment scaling:</strong> Individual and environmental sampling also differ significantly in the costs associated with increasing catchment size. To a first approximation, the cost of individual sampling scales linearly with catchment size: in order to sample twice as many people, one needs roughly twice as many consumables, twice as much staff time, et cetera<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"25\" data-footnote-id=\"7ouvfh6xve2\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7ouvfh6xve2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7ouvfh6xve2\">[25]</a></sup></span>. In contrast, for environmental sampling, one can often alter catchment size without increasing sampling effort by changing the sampling location, resulting in flat or even decreasing cost as catchment size increases<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"26\" data-footnote-id=\"t748iedz0xb\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft748iedz0xb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt748iedz0xb\">[26]</a></sup></span>. Consequently, very large catchments can become extremely expensive for individual sampling, but are far more feasible for environmental sampling approaches.</li><li><strong>Costs of spatial scaling: </strong>The cost of obtaining a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrgAJP1hhapzNtTL13xqrv_hdcZl1w1pSxuehFjefho/edit#heading=h.qdwt4s704znp\">more global sample</a> also differs between sampling strategies. Individual samples that can be self-collected with high success rates (e.g. saliva) are far more amenable to cheap distributed sampling approaches than those that require trained medical staff (e.g. blood). Adding a well-located major airport to a wastewater sampling program will have a far bigger effect on spatial coverage than adding a new wastewater treatment plant.</li><li><strong>Regulatory overhead: </strong>Many individual sampling approaches generate individually identifiable information that may be subject to complex and onerous medical privacy laws in many jurisdictions. Conversely, environmental sampling collects human material in a highly aggregated and anonymized fashion, to which there appear to be relatively few legal barriers in the United States. While the details of regulatory approval in different jurisdictions lie beyond the expertise of the current authors, it seems likely that establishing and maintaining such approval will often be significantly more costly for individual than for environmental sampling.</li></ul><h1><strong>V: Credibility and response</strong></h1><p>In addition to cost and detection capability, one final important way in which sampling strategies differ is in their capacity to trigger an effective response to prevent or mitigate a severe pandemic. This varies along two main axes: the degree to which that sample provides the information necessary to <i>enable</i> different kinds of response actions, and the degree to which threat detection in a sample represents a<i> credible signal </i>that can persuade relevant authorities to take such actions.</p><p>When it comes to enabling effective response, a key factor is the degree of detail available regarding the infected individuals giving rise to the pathogen signal<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"27\" data-footnote-id=\"u3tk6d0dik\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu3tk6d0dik\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu3tk6d0dik\">[27]</a></sup></span>, which is typically a function of catchment size. Small-catchment samples can provide a great deal of detailed information about the infected individuals, up to and including their identity, and are consequently far more useful for targeted responses such as isolation, contact tracing, and follow-up testing. In contrast, large-catchment samples (e.g. municipal wastewater) only enable broad responses, such as an increase in surveillance effort or (in extreme cases) a local lockdown. Intermediate catchment sizes enable intermediate responses \u2013 for example, identification of a threat in wastewater from an individual plane would narrow the field of potential cases to that plane\u2019s passengers and crew.</p><p>This difference in response capability is sometimes raised as a major disadvantage of large-catchment sampling strategies; however, as <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrgAJP1hhapzNtTL13xqrv_hdcZl1w1pSxuehFjefho/edit#heading=h.or21lifmk49f\">discussed above</a>, targeted response is not a central concern for the NAO, and as such is not a primary consideration in this report.</p><p>A second, more subtle link between sampling strategy and response is the degree to which threat detection in a given sample type is credible to the actors (e.g. governments, pharmaceutical companies, or the medical &amp; scientific establishment) that have the ability to execute relevant interventions. If nobody listens when a threat is identified, then the system that identifies it is useless. If certain sampling strategies (most plausibly, clinical sampling) are much more credible to these actors than others, it might be necessary to deploy them even if they are otherwise uncompetitive with alternative approaches. The cost of this could be mitigated by rolling out these credible approaches in response to an initial detection event elsewhere, at some cost in speed.</p><h1><strong>VI: Conclusion</strong></h1><p>In this report, we reviewed a number of key factors affecting the relative attractiveness of different sampling strategies for a biosurveillance system focused on early detection of novel stealth pandemics. These factors include the composition and size of a strategy\u2019s catchment; the microbial composition of the resulting samples; the cost of scaling that strategy in different ways; and the ability of the resulting data to motivate a meaningful response. Along the way, we have defined and clarified terminology describing different sampling strategies, detection methods, and pathogen properties of relevance for comparing sampling approaches.&nbsp;</p><p>Future work will build on the qualitative frameworks described here to create more sophisticated quantitative models investigating different factors \u2013 including a more thorough and quantitative treatment of the cost of different sampling strategies \u2013 as well as applying these frameworks to concretely evaluate specific sampling strategies of interest.</p><h1><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h1><p>While this report was written by the named authors, the ideas expressed are the product of several years of thinking about the problem of early detection by a number of people. We\u2019d like to especially thank Kevin Esvelt, Mike McLaren, Jeff Kaufman, Dan Rice, Charlie Whittaker, &amp; Lenni Justen for their thoughtful comments, suggestions and contributions before and throughout the writing process.</p><h1>Appendix 1 - The impact of sample size on static detection sensitivity</h1><p>The following defines a simple toy model to explore how probability of detection of a novel pathogen varies with catchment size. It assumes a simple, uniform model of infection and shedding; a simple, static, MGS-based detection method with a flat detection threshold measured in number of pathogen reads; and uniform sampling across the catchment with no bias based on infection status.

I've learned to push myself more on questioning my own assumptions, work with teams, and produce a tailored final deliverable.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cIt was quite different from what I anticipated but in a better way. I anticipated the program to be more about just me and my mentor working on a research project, but there was a good amount of interaction with my cohort that I didn't expect. I met many great people and also learned a lot of things I didn't know from the weekly workshop and group meeting (such as unfamiliar areas like nuclear and biotech threats, and different perspectives in AI policy/safety).\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cGoing into this program, I had pretty low self-confidence of my capacity to do a technical project and was fully planning to just write a governance report.

In practice this involves leveraging our emotional intelligence to help recognise which actions or effects are (un)wholesome. This is a skill which many people already exercise implicitly; it can be practised, and can help us to avoid moral errors. Unwholesomeness can never be completely eliminated, so we must learn to relate to it wholesomely \u2014 rather than ignore it or treat it as toxic, we may do best to relate to it as a wise parent towards a child who is hurting others.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:40.06%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/ta6ohuyokolkgdactcac\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the second essay,&nbsp;<i><u>Wholesomeness and Effective Altruism</u></i>, we will see that there are tensions between wholesome action and a simplistic interpretation of EA. But they can be unified in a \u201cwholesome EA\u201d perspective. Serious pursuit of wholesome action will integrate core EA principles, and serious pursuit of EA will (as I argue in the third essay) integrate a desire for wholesomeness. This might have helped to avert major historical mistakes in EA. There remain challenges to be tackled (when to act carefully vs quickly; when to focus on reducing local unwholesomeness vs more global), but these are just normal challenges in seeking to act wholesomely.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:40.18%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/g6nup1nxbq0glusdofrw\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the third essay,&nbsp;<i><u>Wholesome Culture</u></i>, we will ask how much wholesomeness should be an integral part of our culture. We have seen robustness-flavoured benefits in the previous essays. There are also important social effects: it is easier to act wholesomely in wholesome environments, so wholesome action can help to raise the waterline. And a reputation for wholesomeness could be attractive (though care is needed to avoid sounding boring or sanctimonious). While the fetishization of wholesomeness could stifle visionaries, this is a navigable issue. In conclusion, wholesomeness should be an important strand in the foundations of our culture, though it should rarely be the focus of attention.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:40.18%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/pvfppkuzs0cyhavzklwy\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acknowledgements: Thanks to Adam Bales, Alex Zhu, Jan Kulveit, Nick Beckstead, Rio Popper, and Toby Ord for conversations and/or comments. In memory of Sebastian Lodemann, whose wholesomeness was an inspiration to those around him.</p><h1>What does it mean to act wholesomely?</h1><h2>The basic idea</h2><p>I suspect many readers will already have a sense of what it means to act wholesomely, even if they don\u2019t normally think in these terms. It may be most easily pointed at in negatives: Acting wholesomely means avoiding, and sometimes giving a wide berth to, things that are unwholesome. An extremely non-exhaustive list of unwholesome things:</p><ul><li>Suppressing public discussion of issues with your charity that donors would want to know about (&amp; that don\u2019t create privacy issues)</li><li>Skirting the law for convenience, and encouraging your employees to do similarly</li><li>Manufacturing urgency (even if the urgency is then real!) to put pressure on potential hires to accept offers</li><li>Disregarding rules for personal benefit</li><li>Insincere flattery, to get someone to think well of you<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Some slightly more subtle cases of unwholesomeness:</p><ul><li>Gaming systems that others have established, in ways that aren\u2019t aligned with the intent of the creators</li><li>Fastidious rule-enforcement, in ways that don\u2019t track the purpose of the rules and fail to notice times when it would be better to bend the rules</li><li>Taking many meetings with people at a conference, and abruptly ending them as soon as it\u2019s apparent that the person can\u2019t help you</li><li>Not apologizing for things you\u2019ve done wrong, for fear that could open you up to lawsuits</li><li>Unnecessarily hurting someone\u2019s feelings, out of a refusal to shy away from saying harsh things</li><li>Using an organization as a vehicle of convenience for something quite different from what people generally understand it to do</li></ul><p>(Note that it will sometimes be correct to bite the bullet and accept such subtle unwholesomeness. For now, I just want to be able to look at and acknowledge that there is some unwholesomeness in these things.)</p><p>I think this is a pretty normal English use of the word. I asked ChatGPT to explain what it meant to act wholesomely, and it said:</p><blockquote><p>To act wholesomely means to behave in a manner that is morally sound, kind, and considerate towards others and oneself. It involves making choices that reflect integrity, honesty, and a sense of responsibility. Wholesome actions are characterized by their positive impact on individuals and the community, fostering trust, respect, and empathy. This behavior often entails selflessness, putting the well-being of others before one's own desires. It's about creating an environment of positivity and support, where actions are guided by a deep sense of ethical values and a commitment to doing what is right, fair, and beneficial for all involved.</p></blockquote><p>So why am I talking about the normal meaning of an English word? First, because I think the concept is a useful one and could bear more attention. Second, because I want to talk about some angles of my understanding of the central concept, having established a baseline so we all know roughly what\u2019s going on.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.2%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/lipuhyvehsaavkbbntxc\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/rvekqauvsrdx8fjyaoum 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/s9rau1lokrhb9ysorex0 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/lzysc3nygx6lapr060ke 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/p8euvu0vnet7uchtllzt 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/ex0q2qkgw7das1wd0nuh 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/a03hlk65ufcrqmbgpqdz 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/uoebrw2kto2rgfcypoaq 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/jzw7emrzmnsazkgmjx6p 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/ahxzujuf70q1tklhicl9 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/lqbimjppyp06lvjy5kb1 1024w\"></figure><h2>Exploring the concept</h2><p>So far I\u2019ve been pointing to the concept of acting wholesomely via examples or general descriptions rather than trying to define it explicitly. If I had to venture an explicit definition, it would be something like:</p><p>Acting wholesomely means paying attention to the&nbsp;<i>whole</i> system around us, and contributing well as a part of that whole without introducing unnecessary friction or pain points.</p><p>My notion of the \u201cwhole system\u201d is inspired in part by Christopher Alexander\u2019s books on architecture<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvmqq4nq8evo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvmqq4nq8evo\">[1]</a></sup></span>. He discusses how buildings will be better if they are made in ways where they are as a whole, and in each part, sympathetic to and supportive of what already exists around them. Based on my understanding of that theory, here\u2019s a cartoon of two ways you might look to add a purple building near an existing black building:</p><p><img style=\"width:39.06%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/ydbniushmsjoxel3i2jn\"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;\u2026 or \u2026</p><p><img style=\"width:45.43%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/yooddnmk2hvmjq8bcp8h\"></p><p>Here the version on the top is sympathetic to what\u2019s there, and the buildings \u2014 and the spaces between the buildings \u2014 support each other. This is not true in the version on the bottom, where the buildings kind of clash unharmoniously, and leave the nearby outdoor spaces more strained (this may be a subtle effect, but I do think that if people spend a while dwelling on the two layouts they will fairly reliably prefer the one on the top). But the shape of the purple building is identical in the two cases; so this information was not accessible by considering just the new building in isolation.</p><p>Taking broader actions in the world we won\u2019t have such simple geometric principles guiding us. But I feel that there is often something spiritually similar going on. Acting wholesomely means striving for harmony in relation to other parts of the system. This especially means with respect to other parts of the system one has strong interactions with, but in its deepest form it also means attending to important&nbsp;<i>potential</i> interactions.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.28%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/ggrms5xzc1kgo09oq8zw\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/rwq9ei97qtf2oyzs7c3k 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/yeqtymcqfwqhzcy64uhb 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/zy4gdzjcoax7m4zydobg 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/hfc3ab8p1hqp6gcsnqmn 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/rftthypzmq5nbyf548xg 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/scftws0s6mtxt1wuspqt 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/u2orwvso8u7gqsmbzyfg 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/xxfpttxyebpy5zxcrxbd 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/ofe7idysjq2jcagztq5y 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/w5vx5katgmqezuenz6jg 1024w\"></figure><p>Looking again at my examples of acting unwholesomely, they all involve creating some tension or feeling-of-imbalance in part of the system, e.g.</p><ul><li>\u201cManufacturing urgency to put pressure on potential hires to accept offers\u201d<ul><li>\u2026 means that the people considering offers will be making decisions while stressed, which is generally not conducive to good decision-making.</li></ul></li><li>\u201cSuppressing public discussion of issues with your charity that donors would want to know about\u201d<ul><li>\u2026 means that there will be a mismatch between what donors know and what they \u201cought\u201d to know, so:<ul><li>The donors\u2019 decisions may not align with what they\u2019d most endorse</li><li>Your employees will feel a pressure on their own communications to maintain the narrative</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>\u201cInsincere flattery, to get someone to think well of you\u201d<ul><li>\u2026 means that there is a mismatch between what you think, and what they think you think, so:<ul><li>You\u2019re implicitly pressuring yourself to keep up the illusion, in ways that constrain your future actions</li><li>You\u2019re damaging their world models, and may result in less wise actions from them than absent the flattery</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>In contrast, the word \u201cwholesome\u201d evokes a sense of things being in balance and straightforwardly good. Parts of the whole are well-adapted to their positions.

I\u2019m indicating the class of things to pay attention to, but I\u2019m not saying exactly how different degrees of unwholesomeness in which places should trade off against each other. In practice, of course, a lot of the substance of making good judgements will depend on those details. A full account of that is much deeper than I can go in these essays, and should be the subject of many conversations and life-long learning. In presenting the idea of \u201cacting wholesomely\u201d, I\u2019m not trying to pin down what that means in every situation, but to offer a high-level frame and orientation that I hope will be helpful for people learning to make robustly good decisions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Comparisons with related concepts</h2><h3>Virtue ethics</h3><p>Acting wholesomely overlaps with virtue ethics, in that many unwholesome actions will feel unvirtuous \u2014 and that some virtues (e.g. honesty) are specifically about avoiding certain kinds of unwholesomeness. Compared with virtue ethics, acting wholesomely puts more emphasis on understanding the impacts of one\u2019s actions on others. It also doesn\u2019t centre the virtues \u2014 with some hope that this could avoid cases where people focus single-mindedly on excelling at one virtue while ignoring other issues.</p><h3>Consequentialism</h3><p>Consequentialist perspectives provide axiologies \u2014 accounts of which states of the world is good. The idea of acting wholesomely does not provide such an axiology, but just heuristics for good actions. Like consequentialism, it is significantly concerned with the impacts of our actions. But it is sceptical of our ability to explicitly reason about what those impacts will be, and therefore recommends trusting one\u2019s holistic feeling about what is wholesome (while still often being in favour of attempts to explicitly reason about impacts).</p><h3>Pre-theoretic deontology</h3><p>Wholesomeness overlaps with deontology \u2014 especially an intuitive, pre-theoretical deontology \u2014 in focusing on avoiding certain things that are felt to be bad. But whereas deontological intuitions often have a flavour of \u201cnothing could justify this wrong\u201d, and flinching away from toxic bads, acting wholesomely more treats them as major costs to be weighed, but sometimes wholeheartedly accepted (and grieved for) without feeling that one is thereby doing wrong. Wholesomeness also has an element of caring about doing an excellent job of contributing to the system around, rather than just dictating certain things to be avoided.</p><h3>Clean / traditional living</h3><p>Working a normal respectable job, going to church on Sundays, staying sober and off drugs, avoiding sexual promiscuity or strange counterculture \u2014 these are all kinds of \u201cclean\u201d living that might sometimes be called \u201cwholesome\u201d.</p><p>Often they will also be somewhat wholesome on my concept. Over-indulgence in general, and addiction in particular, are unwholesome as they ground in an imbalanced sense of priorities. And, all else equal, there is something wholesome about comporting with the culture around us. However, all else is not always equal. There\u2019s something wholesome about letting people do the things they\u2019re drawn to, and unwholesome about puritanically suppressing that. Moreover, there\u2019s something important and wholesome about people experimenting \u2014 both for their own learning, and ultimately to find better ways for things to be.</p><h3>Sincerity</h3><p><a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2022/12/23/on-sincerity\"><u>Carlsmith\u2019s notion of \u2018sincerity\u2019</u></a> (or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xhE4TriBSPywGuhqi/integrity-and-accountability-are-core-parts-of-rationality#Integrity\"><u>Habryka\u2019s notion of \u2018integrity\u2019</u></a>) captures an important dimension of what could be thought of as \u201cinternal wholesomeness\u201d or \u201cbeing true to yourself\u201d. My concept of wholesomeness could be understood as sincerity combined with something like the opposite of sociopathy \u2014 a true tracking of, and caring about, the impacts your actions have on people and structures around you. In some cases this could mean not leaning all the way into sincerity (e.g. it can be wholesome to decline to bring up political views you know will cause friction at a family dinner, even if asked).&nbsp;</p><h1>The internal motions of wholesome action</h1><p>For now I\u2019m going to set aside the question of whether one&nbsp;<i>should</i> try to act wholesomely (I think it\u2019s a good idea, but I\u2019ll go deeper into this in the subsequent essays), and instead ask&nbsp;<i>how</i> one can act wholesomely. What kind of mental motions can be involved, and which are most effective? What are the pitfalls, where one is most likely to slip away from unwholesome action?</p><p>If you come in with an optimising mindset, a natural approach might be to say \u201cOK, this is about making the systems around us healthy? Well then let\u2019s think explicitly about the health of the systems and take moves which will optimise for that.\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is usually the wrong approach. This isn\u2019t to say that it isn\u2019t worth thinking about the health of the systems (indeed I think it can be quite important to do so), but that it is an error for the final step in decision-making to be an attempt to optimise.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead I think that the core motion for wholesome action is:</p><blockquote><p>Think about things from various angles, and then take the action that<i> feels to you to be wholesome</i>.</p></blockquote><p>Why am I putting feeling at the heart of this?</p><h2>Leveraging emotional intelligence to track downsides</h2><p>If something doesn\u2019t feel altogether wholesome to me, this usually means there\u2019s some issue somewhere. I may not know exactly what it is \u2014 my feeling could be sparked by a sense of things not lining up correctly in a way that is indicative of a problem rather than seeing the problem directly \u2014 and even if I know where the issue is I may not yet know how to articulate it.</p><p>This is a strength of paying attention to my feeling<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbbufoxek30v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbbufoxek30v\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;about whether something is wholesome. It can let me notice issues&nbsp;<i>before</i> they\u2019re part of my explicit models. (And can also therefore, in conjunction with something like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eccTPEonRe4BAvNpD/the-felt-sense-what-why-and-how\"><u>focusing</u></a>, be used to articulate issues and add them to my explicit models.)</p><p>I think what\u2019s going on here is just that feelings are relatively good at tuning in to things holistically \u2014 they don\u2019t require&nbsp;<i>frames</i> or&nbsp;<i>comprehension</i> to let us know whether things seem good, or if there are niggling issues. There\u2019s an analogy here with noticing confusion (in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/5JDkW4MYXit2CquLs\"><u>sense of Yudkowsky</u></a>). Noticing confusion helps with identifying concrete epistemic errors. Noticing unwholesomeness helps with identifying concrete moral errors.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.2%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/csa0rdthmbs00xpagmxw\"></figure><h2>Identifying wholesomeness as a skill</h2><p>As I\u2019m describing it here, noticing whether something feels wholesome or unwholesome is a skill. It\u2019s one that I think most people (almost everyone?) has to some degree, and in many cases I think it can beat our explicit reasoning (we may feel that something is wrong without having a story about why). But I think it\u2019s something one can be better or worse at.</p><p>Believing there\u2019s a skill here doesn\u2019t require buying into some abstract notion of wholesomeness. The skill could just be thought of as \u201chaving your intuitive feeling about something do a good job of tracking the endorsed judgement you\u2019d reach if you had a lot more information, and spent a long time thinking it through\u201d.</p><p>As a skill, it can be practiced, and I strongly suspect it can be trained. I don\u2019t really know how to train it. I\u2019m giving some pointers here to how I think about the skill; I can offer my thoughts about what\u2019s wholesome in specific situations; and I can generate generic advice like \u201cpractice deliberately, and then reflect on how you did\u201d. But I wonder if one can go deeper than this, and I think it might be very valuable if someone worked out how to do an excellent job of training the skill.</p><h2>Making space for good judgements</h2><p>If we haven\u2019t thought about something very much, it can be easy to not appreciate important facets of the whole. If we make decisions at this point, they\u2019re more likely to be incorrect, and perhaps in some way unwholesome. That isn\u2019t to say that this isn\u2019t sometimes the correct move \u2014 we have limited time and attention to spend, and we can\u2019t afford to give enough to reach excellent judgements on everything. But it\u2019s a factor which can get in the way of wholesome action.</p><p>Similarly when we are stressed or otherwise emotionally distracted, I think that we can lose touch with our sense of the whole of things. I think there\u2019s a lot to the metaphor of strong emotions acting like a cloud, in which we are no longer able to perceive our subtler emotional reactions to things.</p><p>When we care about making good judgements, therefore, especially if we\u2019re concerned about accidentally choosing unwholesomely, I think it can be best to try to give ourselves&nbsp;<i>space</i>. Sometimes I find it effective to sit in the bath or go on a walk, turning things over. Sometimes I realise there\u2019s a facet of things it would be good to talk over with someone. At the end of this process I can, sometimes, reach a sense of confidence in my decisions, grounded in a sense of the whole around them.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wholesome vs virtuous vs right?</h2><p>OK, but even if we\u2019re making use of our feelings to track things, why is \u201cwhat is wholesome\u201d a contender for how we should make decisions, rather than \u201cwhat is virtuous\u201d or \u201cwhat is right\u201d?</p><p>Getting deeply into what is the correct choice will be a subject for a subsequent essay, but for now I want to note that it\u2019s easier to justify actions with large costs with a frame of \u201cwhat is virtuous\u201d or \u201cwhat is right\u201d, because the costs may be overwhelmed by projected benefits. Of course sometimes it will be correct to bite the bullet and incur costs (discussed in the next section, as well as subsequent essays), but unwholesomeness is uncomfortable and there\u2019s often a significant temptation to look away from it. If there is a justification for it as \u201cvirtuous\u201d it can become easier to stop giving it attention altogether.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0j44r5tmgmsb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0j44r5tmgmsb\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.2%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/xshgnhdby93axgnty4mb\"></figure><p>That stopping-giving-it-attention is a looking-away-from-the-whole-of-things. It cuts one off from the ability to recognise what is wholesome. Perhaps a bullet was worth biting in one case, but if it\u2019s learned just as \u201cthat was the right thing to do\u201d, we may come to forget that there was a bullet to be bitten there at all, and start biting it at times when it\u2019s decidedly wrong to do so.</p><p>I think if we keep on asking ourselves \u201cwhat is wholesome?\u201d rather than \u201cwhat is right?\u201d, we are less likely to fall into this trap of not looking at big swathes of issues. Another question that might work is \u201cwhat is good and right and comfortable?\u201d. We may feel that something unwholesome is right, but it\u2019s hard to feel entirely comfortable about that. When we truly feel ourselves to be acting wholesomely, we are aligned \u2014 both internally, and with the whole we are a part of.</p><h1>Meta-level wholesomeness</h1><h2>Nothing is fully wholesome</h2><p>Try to imagine a system where people have managed to get rid of all of the unwholesomeness \u2014 everything is always done for the right reasons, nobody is ever meaningfully under-informed, etc. Maybe just for a moment close your eyes and try to conjure it up; not (of course) all of the details, but just a holistic sense of what a system might be like, and what you would feel about it.</p><p>When I try to picture this, I get a feeling of unease \u2014 although locally wholesome, it feels like the system as a whole must somehow be sickly. It\u2019s&nbsp;<i>too</i> perfect. I think I\u2019m implicitly realizing that a tremendous amount of effort would be required to eradicate every last trace of unwholesomeness \u2026 which is either the wrong call as a question of resource allocation, or more likely a sign that the unwholesomeness is being hidden rather than removed (which would be pretty unwholesome).</p><p>Perhaps this is simply a failure of my imagination. But at least relative to our current society, and things in its near vicinity, it is not. We already saw that making good wholesome decisions takes time and space, and sometimes the tradeoffs won\u2019t make spending that time the right decision. Moreover any system which is trying to do anything in the world will create vortices of friction and unwholesomeness as it goes. e.g. some people will operate on partially misguided assumptions; some decision processes won\u2019t have access to all the information they should, and make suboptimal choices as a result. Proper management will reduce these frictions, and avoid ones above a certain magnitude, but it will not eradicate them.</p><p>I mention this not as apologetica for EA. I don\u2019t think the importance of our work gives us licence to be less wholesome than other parts of society \u2014 in fact, I think we should strive to be more wholesome, as I\u2019ll explain in later essays. Rather, I mention this because I think there&nbsp;<i>will</i> as a matter of fact be some degree of unwholesomeness in every system we create or interact with, and we can relate to that in more or less healthy ways.</p><h2>Failure modes in relating to unwholesomeness</h2><p>Before looking at what I think healthy ways to relate to unwholesomeness are, I\u2019ll discuss what I see as frequent but ultimately unhealthy approaches. These apply to unwholesomeness which is in ourselves or in systems that we regard ourselves as part of.</p><h3>Pretending it isn\u2019t there</h3><p>Unwholesomeness is uncomfortable, and we often don\u2019t like looking at uncomfortable things. If we can just \u2026 not see the issue, or pretend to ourselves that it\u2019s fine, that\u2019s a simple way to not engage with the uncomfortableness. This can be quite subtle; since we don\u2019t like conceiving of ourselves as people who would look away from issues, we won\u2019t turn away very directly, we\u2019ll just subtly downplay it, and not get around to investigations that might turn something up.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.2%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/hofdhughwfvac3io7dwr\"></figure><p>This is not a strategy that is conducive to resolving the unwholesomeness. On the contrary it compounds the issue: there\u2019s something unhealthy (in ourselves) about refusing to admit problems, and it\u2019s worse if gets socially projected (so that other people feel pressure to believe it\u2019s not an issue).</p><h3>Treating it as toxic</h3><p>When we regard something as toxic we want it changed or gone, but we don\u2019t want to engage with the details. This is another way of not engaging with the uncomfortableness.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:75.2%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/ieqis6cgkasbjdagslt6\"></figure><p>Treating unwholesomeness as toxic&nbsp;<i>can</i> be effective at removing the unwholesomeness, but it\u2019s not a very wholesome way of doing it. Because it doesn\u2019t engage with the details, it can miss more effective or proper ways to address the issue. Worse, it can function as a screen to enable us to pretend that unwholesomeness in our response isn\u2019t there. At times this can lead to a response that\u2019s more unwholesome than the original issue.</p><h2>Wholesomely relating to unwholesomeness?</h2><p>The model which feels most salient to me as good handling of unwholesomeness is a wise parent dealing with a child who is hurting others. The parent doesn\u2019t look away from the harm that is being caused; nor do they freak out. They are firm, and seek to understand the issue and address the root cause.</p><p>If the unwholesomeness is in something which is under our control, I think that the appropriate attitude is similar. Look openly and honestly at what\u2019s going on. Try to name the unwholesomeness. Then try to think honestly through what to do about it. If it should be addressed, address it soberly. Don\u2019t hide it, or the way you\u2019ve addressed it, from others.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:65.04%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/uuxknwudshkotafmtx2y\"></figure><p>In some cases unwholesomeness&nbsp;<i>shouldn\u2019t</i> be addressed. It should be accepted as a necessary cost. But it\u2019s still worth looking straight at it, and grieving for not having found a better way, which avoids it. Bearing a cost without grieving for it is unwholesome for having a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html\"><u>missing mood</u></a>.</p><p>Moreover I think people should be somewhat slow to move to acceptance. Sometimes there is no immediate apparent fix for unwholesomeness; or rather the fixes seem more costly than accepting it to stay. But if people keep attention on the ways in which it\u2019s unsatisfactory, they will devote some energy to working out how to do the things they valued in other ways. It will often be that this process uncovers a solution which is better than the original, even if that possibility wasn\u2019t apparent at the start.</p><p>In other cases when noticing unwholesomeness it may not be properly in our gift to address it. The unwholesomeness lives in some system we are engaging with, but not in control of. I still think that something of the parent\u2019s stance is, if we can access it, usually a good idea. Don\u2019t look away from the unwholesomeness. When the time is right, draw others\u2019 attention to it, patiently but firmly. If the unwholesomeness has spread into the social domain, such that people are socially punished for drawing attention to it, then gently but firmly, draw attention to&nbsp;<i>that</i>. Don\u2019t imply that the whole system is bad, and don\u2019t necessarily make a big deal out of the badness that\u2019s there (it can be graceful to turn the other cheek), but don\u2019t submit to a narrative where the badness isn\u2019t bad.</p><p>Note that this isn\u2019t supposed to mean that you make everything about rooting out unwholesomeness. You could think some things were somewhat unwholesome \u2014 and speak openly about that when it comes up \u2014 while still not wanting to make that your priority.</p><p>In some cases we may not feel we have the power to safely do this. I grieve for that, while not wanting to put the responsibility on the powerless. If you personally have more of a safety net (this could mean financial or social, depending on the consequences you are concerned about), I believe you have extra responsibility to try to recognise and name unwholesomeness.</p><h1>More posture than goal?</h1><p>Carlsmith has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/01/04/deep-atheism-and-ai-risk#yin-and-yang\"><u>nice articulation</u></a> of a distinction between&nbsp;<i>yin</i> \u2014 being receptive to the will of others, and&nbsp;<i>yang</i> \u2014 projecting your will into the world. Acting wholesomely is about marrying the&nbsp;<i>yin&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>yang&nbsp;</i>correctly. Not so&nbsp;<i>yang&nbsp;</i>that you ignore the wills and desires of others, but not so&nbsp;<i>yin&nbsp;</i>that you accept things as they are without seeking to improve them<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe0qk27od306\"><sup><a href=\"#fne0qk27od306\">[5]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>In seeking to act wholesomely, I think we can let either of these steer, and if they\u2019re properly integrated it shouldn\u2019t ultimately matter which is on top. We soften our&nbsp;<i>yang</i>, letting it be receptive to what we perceive \u2014 but not losing touch with its heart. Then when we act from the&nbsp;<i>yang</i>, it already contains the&nbsp;<i>yin</i>. Or we can steer with&nbsp;<i>yin</i>, trying to be receptive to the wholeness we perceive \u2014 but this includes the&nbsp;<i>yang</i>-within, our sense of how things should be. So acting from the&nbsp;<i>yin</i> encapsulates the&nbsp;<i>yang</i>.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:45.01%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw/r0siqldvw7ldbcybeht3\"></figure><p>In this way, I feel that acting wholesomely may be best understood as a posture. It can give rise to goals, but it isn\u2019t&nbsp;<i>fundamentally</i> goal-oriented. And wholesome action for different actors often looks a little different as they perceive different facets of things. Nor is it in any way necessary for wholesome action to conceive of itself as such.

LMICs in regions such as South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Africa collectively send millions of workers every year to richer countries in neighboring regions, such as countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Malaysia, or Singapore. However, this type of migration is a complex, risky, and often costly process for the migrants, reducing the returns for those who manage to migrate and incurring losses for those who don\u2019t.</p><p><strong>Potential migrants typically learn about and get access to job opportunities via networks of intermediaries</strong> who use their privileged position to charge exorbitant fees \u2013 often multiples of people\u2019s annual salaries \u2013 and extract value from the market.</p><p>Existing intermediaries often have incentives to underinform or misinform their clients, resulting in migrants accepting jobs with lower-than-expected salaries and worse working conditions. Individuals who start the application process but, for whatever reason, fail to migrate often suffer huge losses and sink their families into debt.</p><p><strong>The idea behind this charity is to create a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d service to support potential migrants along the process of learning about working abroad, finding the right job, and fulfilling the necessary requirements for successful migration.</strong> It would achieve this by creating a digital platform featuring a job board paired with free, transparent information on the pros &amp; cons and the practicalities of migrating, personalized one-to-one support (via a call center), and recommendations to high-quality third-party services.</p><p><strong>While there are many existing organizations that offer some of these services, we have not found any that provide all of them on a unified platform.</strong> Additionally, the existing market is dominated by for-profit organizations that often exploit individuals\u2019 motivation and extract value from them. A new, impact-oriented nonprofit organization operating in this space could create large economic and welfare gains. There is good evidence that well-managed international labor migration can create such returns, and the barriers to achieving this are also relatively well understood. While the theory of change behind this charity is somewhat complicated, most of the activities have been done by past actors, demonstrating their tractability.</p><p><strong>We have modeled several cost-effectiveness estimates for this charity.</strong> A model that assumes the charity would only reduce the cost of migrating, and not result in a counterfactual increase in migration rates, estimates 13&nbsp;DALY-equivalents per $1000 spent (or, equivalently, $78/DALY) for a charity operating in Nepal. If the charity charged its successfully-migrating users a modest $50 fee, it would achieve 25&nbsp;DALYs per $1000 (or $39/DALY). Lastly, if it managed to create some counter-</p><p>factually additional migration, its cost-effectiveness would be 38 DALYs per $1000 (or $26/DALY), even in the absence of fees. This means that the charity would be more cost-effective than the top charities recommended by the charity evaluator&nbsp;<a href=\"https://givewell.org/\"><u>GiveWell</u></a>.</p><p><strong>We have several uncertainties about this charity\u2019s operation</strong>, including how difficult it would be to gain users\u2019 attention their trust for them to use the platform and benefit from it; how many (potentially costly) personalized services the charity would have to offer on top of the digital platform itself; and where it should aim to operate.</p><p><strong>The experts we spoke with agreed that misinformation, high fees, and exploitative practices are extremely prevalent, and that solutions to address these problems are needed in multiple countries.&nbsp;</strong>While they have warned that an information-only platform may fail to attract users and effectively support them on their migration journey, they believed that a more personalized recruitment/facilitation service could achieve this, potentially at significant financial and well-being benefits to the migrants.</p><p><strong>Our main model of this charity assumes that most migrants would go to established destination countries with relatively saturated labor migration markets.&nbsp;</strong>Therefore, we did not assume that the charity would create additional, counterfactual migration. However, we think that there is a potential upside where this charity manages to work directly with employers in destination countries (potentially in less well-establishedd markets) and thereby create new migration that wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise. Given the large financial returns to working abroad, this could significantly increase the charity\u2019s impact and cost-effectiveness. However, such expansion might be complex and costly to undertake, so we haven\u2019t factored it into our main models.</p><p><strong>Overall, our view is that this is an idea worth recommending to future charity founders.</strong></p><h1>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Introduction</h1><p><strong>This report evaluates the idea of a digital \u201cone-stop shop\u201d platform for international migrant workers from LMICs.</strong> The aim is to assess how promising it is for the Charity Entrepreneurship (CE) Incubation Program.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CE\u2019s mission is to cause more effective non-profit organizations to exist worldwide.</strong> To accomplish this mission, we connect talented individuals with high-impact intervention opportunities and provide them with training, colleagues, funding opportunities, and ongoing operational support.</p><p><strong>CE researchers chose this idea as a potentially promising intervention within the broader areas of the best targets within the Sustainable Development Goals.</strong> This decision was part of a multi-month process designed to identify interventions that are most likely high-impact avenues for future non-profit enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This process began by listing hundreds of ideas, gradually narrowing them down, and examining them in increasing depth.</strong> We use various decision tools such as evidence reviews, theory of change assessments, group consensus decision-making, case study analysis, weighted factor models, cost-effectiveness analyses, and expert inputs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This process is exploratory and rigorous but not comprehensive \u2013 we did not research all ideas in depth.</strong> As such, our decision not to take forward a non-profit idea to the point of writing a full report does not reflect a view that the concept is not good.</p><h1>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Background</h1><h2>2.1 Cause area: Sustainable development goals</h2><p><strong>In this research round, CE focused on identifying promising ideas for new charities within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&nbsp;</strong>Researching these two areas meant evaluating ideas from various fields, including maternal health, chronic diseases, neglected tropical diseases, migration, public administration governance, and education.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Best targets within the Sustainable Development Goals&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><strong>The SDGs are a mechanism designed to focus global action toward specific objectives.&nbsp;</strong>Like the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) before them, these goals aim to redirect efforts and funding toward an agreed-upon list of priorities. They were agreed to by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly as part of its post-2015 ambitions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/YwbBdB/N0pb\">(Wikipedia contributors, 2023)</a>. Unlike the MDGs, the SDGs have grown significantly in number of goals and targets (from eight to 17 and 21 to 169, respectively).&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/j3bi0skgwkpljldatyfe\"></strong></p><p><strong>Figure 1: The United Nations\u2019 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</strong></p><p><strong>The global community succeeded in some of the most critical MDGs.</strong> MDG targets related to poverty reduction and safe drinking water, among others, were met. Despite missed targets, observers have noted the role of a concise list of eight priorities in focusing energies and driving progress. By drawing comparisons to the MDGs, observers have criticized the SDGs for being too many and too broad (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Things-First-Bjorn-Lomborg/dp/1940003482\"><u>Lomborg, 2023</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Progress toward achieving SDG goals has stalled.</strong> Only 15% of SDG targets are on track to completion, 48% are moderately or severely off-track, and 37% are regressing or stagnating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/YwbBdB/ulIS\">(United Nations Publications, 2023)</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The purpose of this research round was to investigate if a nonprofit organization of the style CE incubates could support the progress toward the goals and associated targets cost-effectively.</strong> We used the list of goals from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://copenhagenconsensus.com/halftime\"><u>Copenhagen Consensus\u2019 Halftime to the SDGs</u></a> project as an initial departure point, listing all interventions prioritized in that project and supplementing the list with research from other sources, such as the Global Education Evidence Advisory Panel\u2019s smart buys in education&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/YwbBdB/uLzo\">(Banerjee et al., n.d.)</a>, and our own brainstorming and consultation exercise.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.2 Topic area: Supporting international migrant workers via better information and facilitation of services</h2><h3><strong>Why care about international labor mobility</strong></h3><p><strong>There is a staggering amount of income inequality between countries.&nbsp;</strong>Some 60% of the variability in global incomes can be explained by people\u2019s country of citizenship (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/assets/richmedia/channels/publicLecturesAndEvents/slides/20110208_1830_theHavesAndHaveNots_sl.pdf\"><u>Milanovi\u0107, 2010</u></a>). This inequality exists even for people with the same skills: The exact same worker may earn 10+ times more money (in nominal terms) in some countries than in others (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1233047\"><u>Clemens et al., 2008</u></a>).</p><p><strong>One reason these differences exist is that much of the economic productivity of a worker is determined not by their work itself but by the economy of their place of work</strong>. Workers providing services in higher-income places create a greater economic value than workers providing similar services in lower-income places. Regionally, such differentials will often result in a reallocation of labor, with workers seeking out jobs in places where productivity and wages are higher (such as in cities instead of rural areas). However, internationally, significant differences in productivity and wages may persist in the long term due to a range of legal and practical barriers preventing workers from migrating and getting higher-paying jobs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>While many of these returns are only theoretical and unrealized, there is growing evidence that international labor mobility can be transformative for families experiencing poverty.</strong> For instance, the families of the winners of a visa lottery that allowed some Bangladeshi citizens to migrate for work to Malaysia experienced a 109% increase in their household incomes (<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20220258\"><u>Mobarak et al., 2023</u></a>). Observational evidence also shows that employment abroad allows workers to send back home considerable amounts of money as remittances and that a 10% increase in remittances is, on average, associated with 3.5% decline in the share of people living in poverty (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X08001368\"><u>Adams, 2009</u></a>).</p><p>The potential benefits are, in reality, reduced by a range of factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Overcharging by intermediaries:</strong> Intermediaries \u2013 i.e., individuals and organizations that assist people with getting jobs abroad \u2013 often capture 10-30% of the monetary returns to migration (<a href=\"https://www.migrationdataportal.org/themes/migrant-recruitment-costs\"><u>Migration Data Portal, 2021</u></a>).</li><li><strong>Exploitation by intermediaries and employers:&nbsp;</strong>Intermediaries and employers have a lot of power over migrant workers and often abuse it. For instance, migrants\u2019 passports are often withheld by intermediaries or employers, thereby not allowing them to switch to another intermediary or a different employer (a so-called \u201chostage mechanism\u201d).</li><li><strong>Migration via illegal means</strong>, which benefits some migrants but puts many at risk of harm, exploitation, and financial loss.</li><li><strong>Extensive misinformation</strong>, which leads to migrants making suboptimal decisions or decisions they later regret and attempt to revert.</li><li><strong>Migration failure:&nbsp;</strong>As a result of misinformation and fraudulent practices, people often fail to migrate \u2013 in as many as 15-30% of cases in India and Bangladesh. This typically incurs a financial loss of several hundred dollars.</li></ul><h3><strong>Opportunities for charitable interventions</strong></h3><p><strong>Governments of migrant-sending countries, as well as intergovernmental organizations, have been trying to address the issues discussed above.</strong> So far, however, top-down approaches have only had limited success. For example, the International Labor Organization (a UN agency) and the Institute for Human Rights and Business (a think thank) have been pushing for all costs to be covered by employers \u2013 the so-called \u201cEmployer Pays Principle\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.ihrb.org/employerpays/the-employer-pays-principle\"><u>IHBR, n.d.</u></a>). However, this has yet to happen. Governments of countries like Nepal have also tried to set ceilings on the fees intermediaries can charge; however, these are often not followed in practice (<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2017/06/nepal-unscrupulous-recruiters-given-free-rein-to-exploit-migrants/\"><u>Amnesty International, 2017</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2023/01/30/nepal-is-a-champion-country-for-fair-recruitment-but-on-paper-only-observers-say\"><u>The Kathmandu Post, 2023</u></a>). As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/10576\"><u>Martin (2017)</u></a> says, overcharging may often go unreported if workers get what they want, i.e., a well-paying job abroad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This situation creates a high-impact opportunity for nonprofits to intervene and assist potential migrant workers in getting jobs abroad in an affordable, safe, and well-informed way.</strong> We believe that \u201cbottom-up,\u201d migrant-focused solutions may be especially effective in this environment where there is political support for change, but the on-the-ground reality is lagging. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.afwbvw9lmtzj\"><u>section 3</u></a> of this report, we map out the barriers to better-quality labor migration and explore the range of activities nonprofits in this space can undertake.</p><p><strong>The main nonprofit idea explored in this report is to create a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d service consisting of a digital platform \u2013 a website plus a mobile app \u2013 and light-touch personalized facilitation&nbsp;</strong>aimed to help potential migrants find suitable jobs, fulfill any migration-relevant requirements (obtaining visas, medical checks, skill certificates, etc.), and be informed about the pros &amp; cons and the risks of migrating. This process currently typically relies on large networks of intermediaries who transmit information about job opportunities from large agencies to potential migrants living in local towns and villages and who then assist their clients with securing those jobs. We expect that this charity could have a positive impact in several different ways:</p><ul><li>By digitizing much of the facilitation process and providing the service either for free or at cost (without a profit motive), this service could reduce the large inefficiencies in this market and reduce the intermediation fees paid by migrants by up to an order of magnitude (from over $1,000 to potentially less than $100).&nbsp;</li><li>By creating maximum transparency and not charging potential migrants upfront, the charity should be able to significantly reduce the rates of costly migration failure.</li><li>By making the service digital first and significantly reducing the fees, it could open the possibility of labor migration to less well-off and more rural candidates than the current costly in-person facilitation process.</li><li>It could help fill jobs that would otherwise remain vacant, thereby increasing the number of people who reap the benefits of labor migration.</li><li>Further value could be created by directly offering relevant services, such as skill certification, or by signposting users to verified good-value third-party services.</li></ul><p><strong>The focus of this report is primarily on temporary low- to mid-skilled voluntary and regular migration (also known as guest work), from low- and lower-middle-income countries to upper-middle-income countries.</strong> It does not focus on permanent migration, irregular migration, or refugee support, and it gives comparatively less attention to high-skilled migration and migration to high-income countries in Europe, North America, or East Asia \u2013 even though the charity could conceivably expand to serve these types of migrants as well.</p><p><strong>The reasons for this focus are:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Temporary labor migration is a widespread form of migration.</strong> While we couldn\u2019t find exact estimates, out of the 169 million international labor migrants worldwide (<a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_808935.pdf\"><u>ILO, 2021</u></a>), the majority may be temporary rather than permanent. For example, nearly all labor migration within Asia is temporary (<a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_146244.pdf\"><u>ILO, 2007</u></a>). Focusing on temporary migration is also more tractable due to generally higher political acceptability.</li><li><strong>Most people experiencing poverty don\u2019t have advanced degrees or specialist skills.</strong> While skilled laborers (such as nurses, doctors, and engineers) can obtain greater returns to migration when expressed in dollar terms (<a href=\"https://copenhagenconsensus.com/publication/halftime-sdgs-skilled-migration\"><u>Maskus, 2023</u></a>), low- and mid-skilled laborers are those who can gain the most from the point of view of welfare and poverty reduction.</li><li><strong>Economic migration is receiving very little philanthropic attention despite the potentially large social impacts.</strong> This stands in contrast to work focused on irregular migration and forced displacement \u2013 the focus of a range of national and international organizations \u2013 and skilled migration, which is relatively better catered to by the private sector (although still arguably neglected).</li><li><strong>Migrants traveling via legal channels with a confirmed job at the destination are less likely to suffer detrimental outcomes&nbsp;</strong>(like poverty, unemployment, or forced labor) than irregular migrants, and we are therefore more confident that this type of migration is net beneficial.</li><li><strong>Migration to upper-middle and high-income countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia is already prevalent, and the processes and barriers to impact are well understood&nbsp;</strong>(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.87mx2rwta4y5\"><u>section 3.1</u></a>). In contrast, migration to high-income countries in Europe, North America, and East Asia is currently more limited, less well understood, and the process is often more complicated, requiring workers to speak the local language and be more highly skilled. That being said, migration to these countries \u2013 especially via counterfactually new pathways \u2013 could create especially large returns. We explore the possibility of the charity expanding into this space in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.z00deup9j44i\"><u>section 3.4</u></a>.</li></ol><p>The focus on temporary labor migration is also in line with the priorities of governments, as well as intergovernmental organizations, such as the UN or the World Bank, all of whom have recently been creating new formal pathways for workers to get jobs abroad (based on our expert interviews).</p><h1>3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Theories of change</h1><h2>3.1 &nbsp; Barriers</h2><p><strong>There is a complex set of barriers preventing potential migrant workers from getting good, fair jobs abroad and migrating safely at a low cost.&nbsp;</strong>These barriers must be simultaneously overcome for labor migration to be successful and generate greater social returns.</p><p>We can organize these barriers into multiple levels:</p><ol><li>Personal barriers on the level of individual migrants<ul><li>Lack of awareness of opportunities: Potential migrants may not be aware of existing opportunities matching their skills and preferences.</li><li>Lack of knowledge of how to navigate opportunities: International migration is a complex process, and most migrants need support with it, either from friends and family members or from dedicated organizations.</li><li>Misinformation about costs and potential earnings: To make good decisions, people need to know how much the process of migrating costs and how much they can expect to make at the destination. However, past studies have found evidence of misinformation: Migrants from Tonga to New Zealand expected to earn about 40% less than typical migrants actually earn (<a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/34228/1/555455335.pdf\"><u>McKenzie et al., 2007</u></a>) \u2013 likely resulting in a reduced supply of migrants \u2013 while people in Bangladesh typically overestimate earnings abroad, by as much as 50% (<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=0dpzEAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Toward+Safer+and+More+Productive+Migration+for+South+Asia&amp;ots=WoVnCjPbMf&amp;sig=ZMSeE6JALMOzUCu7UvAyaQLyxpU&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Toward%20Safer%20and%20More%20Productive%20Migration%20for%20South%20Asia&amp;f=false\"><u>Ahmed &amp; Bossavie, 2022</u></a>) \u2013 often resulting in disappointment and indebtedness.</li><li>Limited awareness of the risks of working abroad: International migration carries a number of risks to one\u2019s physical and emotional well-being. This is especially true in the case of low-skilled migration, which may expose migrants to hard working conditions and various forms of exploitation. However, awareness of such risks is low: some 60% of Bangladeshi migrants are never exposed to information about how to migrate safely (<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bosssavie, 2023</u></a>).</li><li>Uncertainty and fear:&nbsp;On top of incorrect information, potential migrants experience a high level of uncertainty: They may simply not know what it is like to live and work abroad and prefer the known over the unknown (<a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/d7b69e9f-631e-54c8-b9db-b2a2d97abdc4/content\"><u>McKenzie, 2023</u></a>). Relatedly, fears of undesirable outcomes may keep people from migrating. These factors are likely more prominent in regions with currently low levels of migration where people can\u2019t learn from the experiences of others in their communities.</li><li>Lack of necessary skills, such as language skills: Language skills often form a barrier to obtaining visas and foreign employment, even in lower-skilled jobs such as agriculture and hospitality. However, these are less of a concern in the destination countries we are considering (such as the Gulf countries), where the large numbers of migrant workers, even at managerial levels, allow people to work there without knowing the local language very well.</li><li>Lack of certifications for existing skills: Obtaining such certifications may be difficult or costly.</li><li>Lack of financial resources: Potential migrants need money upfront to pay for visas, upskilling, skill certification, travel, and any intermediation services that help them in the migration process.</li></ul></li><li>Barriers related to local countries of origin<ul><li>Expensive intermediaries: Many countries with large potential-migrant populations (such as India or Bangladesh) rely on large numbers of local intermediaries who offer services like help finding jobs and obtaining the necessary paperwork. These often long chains of intermediaries create an inefficient and expensive system. Typical recruitment costs range from around $1,000 in India, Ethiopia, and Nepal to over $3,000 in Bangladesh \u2013 equivalent to almost ten months of earnings at the destination (<a href=\"https://www.migrationdataportal.org/themes/migrant-recruitment-costs\"><u>Migration Data Portal, 2021</u></a>).</li><li>Fraud and exploitation: In some cases, intermediaries may be fraudulent or undertake various exploitative practices, which can result in failure to migrate and huge financial losses for the person and their families&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6574658k\"><u>Das et al., 2014</u></a>).</li><li>Lacking or low-quality migration-related services:&nbsp;Some regions may not have a sufficient supply of quality services for migrants, such as language training or skill certification. In our conversation with the Labor Mobility Partnerships (LaMP), an NGO, we learned that healthcare workers from Kenya may need to travel to South Africa to obtain employer-recognized certificates.</li><li>Lack of financial services geared toward international migrant workers: International migrant workers often require borrowing money to finance skill acquisition or travel expenses, but there is a lack of financial organizations willing to provide them with credit.</li></ul></li><li>Barriers related to destination-country employers<ul><li>Finding workers: Employers may not know where to look for potential migrant workers and how to effectively advertise their jobs abroad (although this is somewhat less of a concern in well-established migration corridors).</li><li>Recognizing workers with relevant skills:&nbsp;Employers may struggle to recognize which potential workers have relevant skills and, therefore, be reluctant to hire them.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>National/international barriers<ul><li>Limited visa options: Many developed countries restrict the number of worker visas they issue or make it difficult for potential migrants to obtain them.</li><li>Global priorities of funders: Labour mobility has not been a major priority for international aid organizations. LaMP estimates that only 0.5% of private philanthropy goes toward the economic inclusion of people on the move, and only a fraction of this focuses on providing opportunities for potential migrants \u2013 as opposed to supporting refugees or actively deterring migration.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>The importance of each of these barriers will vary substantially between different countries.&nbsp;</strong>For instance, countries with an extensive culture of labor migration (like Nepal) will experience different barriers (and enablers) than countries where international labor migration is currently more limited.</p><h2>3.2 &nbsp; Potential charity activities to support international labor migration</h2><p><strong>There is a wide range of services that charities in this space can offer to increase labor migration rates and ensure that people can migrate safely and affordably and reap the benefits they expect to get from working abroad.&nbsp;</strong>In Figure 2 below, we map the needs of potential migrants (in grey) and show how they relate to potential charity activities/services (in yellow). The figure also displays several \u201cenablers,\u201d i.e., features that enable the usage of the yellow services. These include transparent information (about what services are needed and what exactly is being offered), recommendations for high-quality (third-party) services, and financial affordability, which can either be achieved by making the services low-cost or by offering financial products, such as loans or insurance.</p><p><strong>The relative importance of each of these services will depend on the specific context in which the charity operates.</strong> Different countries of origin may be experiencing different gaps in service provision that act as the key barriers to migration \u2013 charities in this space will need to assess local needs and services that are already available to determine where they can be most effective. They may also choose to provide a combination of services, such as linking job boards with initial stages of recruitment or offering pre-departure training on top of language training and certification.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/k6w8buqsorlguillxyri\"></p><p>Figure 2:&nbsp;Barriers, services, and enablers needed for prospective migrants (in countries where visas and job opportunities are available).</p><p>While all of these services are important, we believe that transparent information provision paired with job boards and low-cost support with applications are especially promising. This is for several reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Extensive evidence indicates that potential migrants lack access to high-quality information</strong> about how to get jobs abroad and how to migrate in a way that is safe and that maximizes one\u2019s financial returns (se</li><li><strong>Information also serves as an enabler of existing services</strong>.&nbsp;In many places, services such as language training or skill certification may already exist, but potential migrants may struggle to find them or identify high-quality providers (<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w29588\"><u>Bazzi et al., 2021</u></a>). By providing recommendations for third-party services, the charity may help facilitate migration without providing these services directly.</li><li><strong>While information is important, it alone may not be enough to attract people\u2019s attention</strong>: What potential migrants look for are job opportunities and assistance with applying, rather than information per se (based on our expert interviews). As such, a charity is much more likely to gain users (and achieve impact) if it actively helps people get jobs abroad \u2013 and provides high-quality information at timely points along the process.</li><li><strong>Information provision and support with the application process can be provided in a cheap, scalable way</strong> \u2013 especially if the charity uses a digital-first approach.</li><li><strong>By directly helping people get jobs, the charity will have options for creating sustainable financing models</strong>. The experts we spoke with indicated that some past projects in the space of international labor migration failed because they couldn\u2019t attract long-term funding. A charity that actively helps match migrants with jobs will have the option to charge a small fee for its services \u2013 either to the migrants or to the employers/employment agencies \u2013 thereby reducing its reliance on donor funding. We discuss this in more detail in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.dvqcz5lwaz2\"><u>section 7</u></a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Experts we spoke with highlighted access to finance as a priority need</strong>. This is especially true for individuals intending to get higher-skilled jobs abroad, which may require expensive certificates and months-long language courses. However, for lower-skilled migrants, most expenses are spent on intermediary fees (see Figure 6 in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.xu4gjwwmcel0\"><u>section 4.2</u></a>). As such, we believe it is more tractable and cost-effective to work on reducing these fees rather than providing loans to help cover them.</p><p><strong>Note that the mapping above assumes that a lack of job opportunities or visas would not be a major barrier.</strong> This is unlikely to be the case: in fact, a promising avenue for a charity may be to focus on advocacy for increased numbers of work visas between specific countries of origin and destination. However, based on our conversation with Prof. Mushfiq Mobarak, we have deprioritized this option, for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The expansion of international migration corridors is already the focus of large international organizations, such as the World Bank and the Center for Global Development.&nbsp;</li><li>Reaching agreement between pairs of countries is a complex political task, and it is unlikely that it is where a new, small charity could make the most difference.</li><li>An arguably better way for a new charity to contribute to these efforts is to help strengthen the argument that international labor migration can be done safely and effectively.</li><li>A charity that focuses on the \u201csupply\u201d side of the migration issue can still achieve a significant impact. Firstly, by improving the \u201cquality\u201d of migration (reducing the costs and risks), and secondly, by helping to fill jobs that are currently harder to fill.</li></ul><p>In the following section, we explore how exactly a charity focused on information provision could operate and how it would achieve social impact.</p><h2>3.3 &nbsp; Theory of change of this charity</h2><p><strong>The key idea behind this potential charity&nbsp;is to create a semi-automated service consisting of a digital platform and one-on-one facilitation, aiming to reduce&nbsp;the many inefficiencies, information gaps, and exploitative practices that potential migrant workers in LMICs experience.&nbsp;</strong>There are multiple ways such a platform could be developed to address different kinds of migrant needs. Correspondingly, this charity may need to undertake a range of activities and may have several ways of achieving impact. The charity founders will need to engage in repeated strategic planning and re-evaluations to identify the highest-impact marginal activities.</p><p><strong>In Figure 3 below, we explore these different theories of change in detail.</strong> The diagram highlights which elements of the theory of change we consider to be key for any charity in this space but also includes elements that we think are optional or secondary in importance.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/fpvusvnwjy8vvz3qzpwx\"></p><p><strong>Figure 3: Theory of change of the charity.</strong> Boxes with full outlines signify key activities, outputs, outcomes, and ways of achieving impact; dotted boxes highlight optional activities or secondary ways of achieving impact. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.twtcqk8jzygx\"><u>Appendix 1</u></a> for a simplified version.<br><br>Each numbered circle is associated with an assumption about the link between elements of the theory of change. We explore these assumptions below:</p><ol><li><strong>The charity can gather necessary information and organize it in a user-friendly format on a website or an app</strong> (likely): Creating a user-friendly app with high-quality information will be a key activity of the charity. This is not an easy task: it will require extensive web-based and in-person research paired with quality web/app development. However, we believe that this is a tractable challenge.</li><li><strong>The charity can collect information and set up systems in such a way that the provided information is up to date</strong> (likely): A major challenge of creating a large service like this is ensuring that all of the information (e.g., about visa options, job opportunities, or government regulations) is up to date. Setting up such a system will require careful planning and may require a mixture of algorithmic solutions, in-country contractors, and user input. While challenging, this is also where major value can be created for the users.</li><li><strong>It is possible to create a functional job board&nbsp;</strong>(highly likely): A job board can be created either by connecting directly with employers or by working with existing employment agents and third-party job boards. Unless there are local restrictions preventing a charity from advertising jobs, this should be a tractable task.</li><li><strong>It will be possible to partner with employers and/or international organizations to create new job opportunities&nbsp;</strong>(medium uncertainty): We expect employers and international organizations in the labor migration space to be happy to collaborate with this charity. We are unsure whether this is likely to lead to the creation of new job opportunities or only better information about existing opportunities. Note also that new job opportunities are only possible between pairs of countries where the governments have agreed to allow temporary labor migration.</li><li><strong>It is possible to partner with existing organizations&nbsp;</strong>(highly likely): Our expert interviews indicate a large willingness of different actors in this space to collaborate, either to increase their impact as nonprofits or to increase their revenues as businesses.</li><li><strong>It is possible to assess the quality of third-party services&nbsp;</strong>(medium uncertainty): Creating a well-functioning rating and recommendation system may not be an easy task, but there are plenty of existing organizations (apps like Yelp, Trustpilot, etc.) that the charity could learn from.</li><li><strong>It is possible to set up algorithms for personalized recommendations&nbsp;</strong>(highly likely): Setting up at least a simple recommendation system should be a tractable task for skilled software developers.</li><li><strong>The charity will be able to provide other high-quality services at a low cost&nbsp;</strong>(medium uncertainty): We have not explored this question in detail. We believe that the provision of some services (such as skill certification or pre-departure training) should be feasible, though it may require significant additional effort and may not be as cost-effective as other activities of the charity.</li><li><strong>The charity can set up a call center to provide extra support where needed</strong> (likely): In order to build trust and minimize risks, it may be necessary to set up a system through which users can receive personalized human support if needed, such as via a call center. While we have some concerns about the cost implications, we think that this would be a tractable activity for the charity.</li><li><strong>Outreach and advertising activities can create user trust and lead to uptake of the service&nbsp;</strong>(key uncertainty):<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In many migrant-sending countries, the process of migration relies on a network of intermediation services provided in person by individuals trusted by potential migrants. Creating enough trust in a largely digital service without prior brand recognition may be a key challenge for the charity. The charity may initially have to invest heavily in various outreach and advertising activities to get early users on board. While we believe that this will require careful attention, we do not think that this is an intractable problem.</li><li><strong>Online/over-the-phone support is sufficient for most users&nbsp;</strong>(medium uncertainty): Our model of this charity assumes that users of the platform will be able to successfully migrate using the information and functionality provided by the platform supported by personalized human assistance (via WhatsApp or phone calls). However, it is possible that some users will require assistance beyond this; for instance, being escorted to government offices issuing visas or having their paperwork reviewed. We have some uncertainty about the need for these in-person tasks, how often users may need them, and how easy or difficult it may be to delegate them to third parties.</li><li><strong>The platforms will reduce the cost of migrating compared to counterfactual options</strong> (highly likely): By focusing on maximizing the value for the users, designing efficient systems, and not seeking to make a profit, it is highly likely that the charity will be able to reduce users\u2019 cost of migrating, compared to their counterfactual options.</li><li><strong>The platform will help reduce loss of money due to migration failure</strong> (highly likely): By providing transparent information about what jobs are available, how much they pay, and how to get them, the platform will very likely reduce the rates of migration failure and the associated loss of money.</li><li><strong>The platform will help migrants get better jobs</strong> (likely): Depending on the exact activities of the charity, it may be able to help individuals who would have migrated anyway to get better jobs \u2013 jobs that better match their skills and preferences, that pay more, or where they are treated better.</li><li><strong>The charity can discourage some people from migrating&nbsp;</strong>(likely): We find it likely the charity can discourage from migrating some people who aren\u2019t a good fit for it. For instance, by providing transparent information on all the costs and benefits, those who would otherwise overestimate the financial returns may now decide against migrating.</li><li><strong>Usage of the platform will lead to an increased number of migrants</strong> (medium uncertainty): Whether the charity would be able to create additional (\u201ccounterfactual\u201d) migration depends on the saturation of the job market and on whether some jobs would otherwise go unfilled. Some experts we spoke with believed that markets in destinations such as the Gulf countries and Southeast Asia are saturated, and additional migration is, therefore, unlikely. In contrast, others indicated that some jobs still go unfilled, and a digital service with a wide reach and low fees may be able to help fill these vacancies. Overall, we are somewhat uncertain about the exact balance between these two arguments.

See, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction\"><u>Ortiz-Ospina and Roser (2013)</u></a>.</li><li><strong>The charity will generate valuable information for CE and other actors</strong> (highly likely): International labor migration is a highly understudied field, with few large-scale academic and nonprofit projects underway. This organization could make a significant contribution to the knowledge base about what works to improve migration, thus supporting other future efforts in this space.</li></ol><p>The above analysis focuses primarily on activities targeted at individuals who intend to migrate but haven\u2019t done so yet. However, the charity could conceivably provide services that support the full life cycle of a migrant, from before they even consider migrating to support during migration and after return (<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bossavie, 2023</u></a>). We omit these from this report, as we don\u2019t think their inclusion is critical for deciding in favor of or against this charity idea. However, we encourage potential future founders to think about such additional services they may be able to provide.</p><h2>3.4 &nbsp; Potential expansions of this theory of change</h2><p>The main path to impact assumed in the previous section is improving the quality of low- and mid-skilled international labor migration, by improving access to information, reducing fees migrants are asked to pay, and reducing the chance of migration failure. However, there are additional ways that this charity could achieve positive impact:</p><ol><li>Helping higher-skilled workers to migrate</li><li>Increasing the amount of migration (to current destination countries)</li><li>Facilitating migration to novel, higher-income destinations</li><li>Allowing poorer people to migrate</li></ol><p><strong>These are generally less well-evidenced, or we are less confident in their feasibility</strong>, but they may be worth considering for the charity founders.</p><p><strong><u>1. Helping higher-skilled workers to migrate</u></strong></p><p><strong>The charity could use much of its infrastructure built for supporting low- and mid-skilled workers to also support high-skilled workers to migrate.</strong> Based on our shallow review of the evidence and conversations with experts, we understand that high-skilled workers \u2013 such as engineers, IT staff, education workers, or healthcare workers \u2013 also face extensive information barriers that prevent them from migrating, such as information about available visa options or achievable job opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, high-skilled workers may also face additional barriers not experienced by lower-skilled workers</strong>, such as needing to know the language of the destination country to a high level of proficiency, having their skills certified by an internationally recognized agency, or otherwise being able to demonstrate their skills to employers from a different country and cultural background. These additional barriers may necessitate additional charity activities. While these could be costly, they may still be cost-effective, as the returns to high-skilled migration can be especially high: In terms of benefit-to-cost ratios, skilled migration was actually identified as one of the \u201cbest investments for the SDGs\u201d by the Copenhagen Consensus Center (<a href=\"https://copenhagenconsensus.com/publication/halftime-sdgs-skilled-migration\"><u>Maskus, 2023</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Additionally, helping skilled workers migrate raises the risks of causing harm through brain drain.</strong> This is most concerning to us in the domain of healthcare, where the emigration of professionals may have significant negative consequences on care provided in the country of origin. However, this topic is a complex one, with experts disagreeing about the effects and their magnitudes. For instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/22/think-again-brain-drain/\"><u>Clemens and McKenzie (2009)</u></a> argue that physician emigration creates incentives for more people to locally train as physicians, thereby being net positive. But&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1570677X11000037\"><u>Bhargava et al. (2011)</u></a> found that while emigration does induce more training, the magnitude of the effect doesn\u2019t fully offset the loss due to migration. We do not have a strong view on this debate, but we highlight these considerations in case future founders wish to expand in this direction.</p><p><strong><u>2. Increasing the amount of migration (to current destination countries)</u></strong></p><p><strong>We are uncertain about the amount of counterfactually additional migration that the basic charity model would create.</strong> On the one hand, multiple experts we spoke with indicated that migration to well-established destination countries (such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Qatar) is very saturated, with high awareness of this option by populations in the migrant-sending regions and a resulting high supply of potential workers. This would mean that any migrant who is assisted by this charity to get a job would displace another potential migrant, who then wouldn\u2019t get the job. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence shared with us by Dr. Tutan Ahmed indicates that this is only true for low-skilled jobs, and that recruitment gets harder for mid-skilled jobs, many of which go unfilled. If this is the case, then this charity may be able to create additional migration \u2013 and thereby the large impact associated with migrating (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.bd3vzhbevjg0\"><u>section 4.2.2</u></a> for evidence) \u2013&nbsp; by following the basic theory of change outlined in the previous section. This uncertainty is reflected in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.dvqcz5lwaz2\"><u>section 7</u></a> where we model cost-effectiveness in two ways: assuming no additional migration and assuming that some migration&nbsp;<i>is</i> additional.</p><p><strong>In summary, if the charity wants to be more confident that it is creating additional migration&nbsp;</strong>(without an offsetting effect)<strong>, we recommend that it focuses more on finding candidates for more mid-skilled jobs</strong> (such as cooks, tailors, carpenters, truck drivers, car mechanics, etc.).</p><p><strong><u>3. Allowing poorer people to migrate</u></strong></p><p><strong>A charity in this space may also be able to create impact by changing who migrates, without increasing the overall quantity of migration.</strong> Generally, the poorer a worker (and their family) is, the more they benefit from migrating. However, the current high cost of migration and the poor information environment (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.xu4gjwwmcel0\"><u>sections 4.1</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.xu4gjwwmcel0\"><u>4.2</u></a>) mean that international guest work is often out of reach for the migrant-sending countries' poorer and more rural members. By reducing recruitment fees and improving access to information \u2013 as the main theory of change assumes \u2013 the charity may achieve this benefit automatically.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The charity may also try to actively recruit lower-income users in order to boost this path to impact.</strong> This may involve, for instance, conducting outreach activities in particularly poor regions of the target country, or by trying to target their online advertising at users with very low incomes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>4. Facilitating migration to novel, higher-income destinations</u></strong></p><p><strong>The highest-impact expansion option would likely be for the charity to send migrant workers to very high-income destinations, such as Western Europe, South Korea or Japan.</strong> Given the high typical wages in those countries the potential returns are very large. These migration pathways are currently not very well established, so much of this migration would likely be fully counterfactual.</p><p><strong>While the potential returns are high, the barriers for workers are also higher.</strong> Unlike countries in the Persian Gulf or Southeast Asia, these destinations typically look for at least mid-skilled workers. Additionally, given that only a small proportion of employees at the destination firms will typically be of the same migrant background, these migrants will typically be required to learn the local language. Language training alone is estimated to cost around $2000 and requires 6-12 months of full-time study, which not only creates a high opportunity cost but also increases the risks of losing money in case of migration failure. As such, if the charity wanted to expand in this direction, it may need to provide additional services, such as help finding high-quality language schools and offering low-cost loans (or other financing solutions) to make these upfront expenses possible.</p><p><strong>In contrast to existing destinations, additional work would be required to activate employer demand</strong>. Given that employers in those destination countries may have limited experience with advertising their jobs abroad or employing foreign workers, the charity would likely need to engage extensively with specific employers and support them in expanding their recruitment to the target LMICs.</p><p><strong>Although we are excited about the migration opportunities to these destinations, the evidence base is currently too limited for us to confidently recommend this option.</strong> Various pilot projects are underway to test models of facilitation migration to very high-income countries (by organizations such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lampforum.org/\"><u>LaMP</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://malengo.org/\"><u>Malengo</u></a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.joinimagine.com/\"><u>Imagine Foundation</u></a>), but few of these have been sustainably scaled up or rigorously studied and evaluated. We recommend that the charity founders stay in touch with organizations and researchers in this space and review their options for this form of expansion in several years, by which point the evidence base may have grown.</p><h1>4 &nbsp; Quality of evidence</h1><p><strong>Judging whether this charity idea is worth recommending requires a chain of evidence and reasoning.</strong> We explore these in the following subsections:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.1k79pn8axaqc\"><u>Section 4.1</u></a> examines the information aspect of this charity idea: whether potential migrants are currently well-informed or misinformed (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.4i7wkca7syzl\"><u>section 4.1.1</u></a>), and how good the current information channels are (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.lzlugn9az6hv\"><u>section 4.1.2</u></a>).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.xu4gjwwmcel0\"><u>Section 4.2</u></a> then explores the evidence that charities in this space can have a positive impact. First,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.1hvpaa7evdhd\"><u>section 4.2.1</u></a> focuses on the (avoidable) harms experienced by migrant workers; then,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.bd3vzhbevjg0\"><u>section 4.2.2</u></a> reviews the evidence on the potential financial benefits from temporary international labor migration; and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.tzybzpwhjja1\"><u>section 4.2.3</u></a> briefly reviews the evidence on non-financial considerations related to migrant workers\u2019 well-being. Lastly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.v48g79w7d19a\"><u>section 4.3</u></a> provides evidence that a charity can achieve this.</p><p><strong>Overall, international labor migration is an academically understudied field, with limited high-quality observational evidence and even less causal evidence of the impact of interventions.</strong> In fact, the renowned economist Lant Pritchett has called it \u201cdevelopment\u2019s missing agenda\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ6c9epqxlY&amp;pp=ygUecHJpdGNoZXR0IG1pZ3JhdGlvbiBibGluZCBzcG90\"><u>Harvard Center for International Development, 2018</u></a>). Even where labor migration has been explored, it has often focused on dealing with migration that is already happening or on ways of discouraging irregular migration \u2013 as opposed to increasing or improving voluntary, legal and orderly migration.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is much that we can learn from existing data, and given the large effects that international migration can have on people, there is arguably less need for rigorously conducted trials for us to make the argument in favor (or against) the idea.</p><h2>4.1 &nbsp; Evidence that people currently lack good-quality migration-related information&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>For this charity to have a counterfactual impact, it needs to (1) provide information to people that they don\u2019t already know, and (2) provide information in a way that is more accessible or useful than information provided by other sources.&nbsp;</strong>There will surely be huge differences across countries, with some populations having bigger knowledge gaps and worse access to information. However, given that our evidence review suggests that such gaps exist even in countries with high migration rates and in high-income contexts, we believe that it is likely that these gaps are widespread, with this charity likely being additional in many different locations.</p><h3><strong>4.1.1 &nbsp; Evidence that people are under- or mis-informed</strong></h3><p>Much of the existing evidence on knowledge gaps comes from South Asian countries, many of which have a strong culture of labor migration.&nbsp;<strong>Studies suggest that potential migrants are often misinformed about the basic aspects of working abroad, such as how much they can earn.</strong> As shown in Figure 4 below, Bangladeshi migrants often expect to be able to earn significantly more than they end up earning. These misaligned expectations can result in them being willing to pay unreasonably high fees to intermediaries with the hope of quickly recouping their losses. They are also the leading reason for migrants\u2019 disappointment at their destination and for returning home earlier than planned (<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/903161585816440273/pdf/Toward-Safer-and-More-Productive-Migration-for-South-Asia.pdf\"><u>Ahmed &amp; Bossavie, 2022</u></a>). The situation is similar for Nepalese and Pakistani migrants.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/vpefcvuba3b1n7dsj44d\"></p><p><strong>Figure 4</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>Wage levels expected before departure compared with wages actually earned overseas by temporary migrants from Bangladesh.</strong> (<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/903161585816440273/pdf/Toward-Safer-and-More-Productive-Migration-for-South-Asia.pdf\"><u>Ahmed &amp; Bossavie, 2022, p. 14</u></a>)</p><p><strong>Some of these realities, however, may be highly country-dependent.</strong> In the case of Tongans migrating to New Zealand,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/34228/1/555455335.pdf\"><u>McKenzie et al. (2007)</u></a> found a large underestimation of potential earnings, by about 40% on average. In the context of Nigerians intending to migrate to Europe,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/265445\"><u>Beber and Scacco (2022)</u></a> also find evidence of underestimated earnings.</p><p><strong>Potential migrants are also often under-informed about how to migrate safely.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bosssavie (2023</u></a>) cites research indicating that some 60% of Bangladeshi migrants were never exposed to information about how to migrate safely, and of those who say they have learned about safety, 58% say that they got this information from their friends (rather than via any formal channels).</p><h3><strong>4.1.2 &nbsp; Evidence of deficiencies in existing information channels&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>While the reasons for this lack of information or misinformation are complex,&nbsp;<strong>there are reasons to believe that current channels are often insufficient or ineffective in providing accurate and up-to-date information to potential migrants.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>In the South Asian region, networks of private agents and middlemen are the most common way for people to obtain information</strong> (conversation with Dr. Tutan Ahmed;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bosssavie, 2023</u></a>). While these agents have a profit motive to connect potential migrants with real job opportunities and services, it may also be in their interest to systematically misrepresent information, such as understating costs and risks and exaggerating potential returns. It may also not be economical for them to operate in rural areas, thereby leaving much of the population with limited access to information (<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bosssavie, 2023</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Intermediaries are a crucial part of the migration process.&nbsp;</strong>In many regions, essentially all migrant workers use intermediaries (e.g., 100% of the sample of Indian guest workers in Saudi Arabia, as observed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2023-12/guestworkerrct2023.pdf\"><u>Naidu and colleagues, 2023</u></a>). Inter- mediaries help aspiring migrants navigate complex immigration bureaucracies and address the many uncertainties prospective migrants face (<a href=\"https://www.mideq.org/en/resources-index-page/mediated-migration-literature-review-migration-intermediaries/\"><u>Jones &amp; Sha, 2020</u></a>). They conduct various activities to facilitate migration, including helping broker visas, arranging birth certificates and passports, booking transportation, guiding, finding jobs and accommodation, connecting migrants to healthcare and medical tests, etc. They may also arrange training and assist in candidate selection.</p><p><strong>The charity described in this report would try to reduce the need for in-person intermediaries.&nbsp;</strong>Instead, it would provide information for free in a digital format and scale up semi-automated ways of offering the above-described services at a low cost.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Governments sometimes step in to provide information to migrants and prepare them for working abroad.</strong> For instance, governments in the Philippines and Sri Lanka organize comprehensive pre-departure programs for all international migrant workers (<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/903161585816440273/pdf/Toward-Safer-and-More-Productive-Migration-for-South-Asia.pdf\"><u>Ahmed &amp; Bossavie, 2022</u></a>). In many other countries, however, such services are more limited. In Bangladesh, the government does provide some formal sources of information, but they are rather limited in their extent and quality (<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bosssavie, 2023</u></a>). In India, the government behaves more like a regulator of migration rather than a direct service provider, so its role is even more limited (conversation with Dr. Tutan Ahmed).</p><p><strong>In some countries, information sharing is also being done by local NGOs.&nbsp;</strong>For instance, in Bangladesh, District Employment and Manpower Offices collaborate with local NGOs to share information on safe migration across Bangladesh. However, these NGOs tend to have limited capacity to run their programs at scale and struggle to reach rural populations (<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bosssavie, 2023</u></a>). BRAC, Bangladesh\u2019s largest NGO, also provides extensive services to potential (as well as current and returning) migrants. Between 2006 and 2018, it provided 937,000 potential migrants with information on safe migration. However, to our knowledge, its programs also tend to be community-based, which \u2013 while being ideal for building trust and providing personalized support \u2013 likely limits the scale and ability to deliver fully up-to-date information.</p><p><strong>The above-discussed channels \u2013 private, government-provided, and community-based nonprofits \u2013 could be supplemented, enhanced, or replaced by a high-quality web-based platform delivered by an impact-maximizing nonprofit.</strong> Given the high smartphone penetration rates in many developing countries (e.g., 71% in India;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1229799/india-smartphone-penetration-rate/\"><u>Statista, 2023</u></a>), there is an opportunity to bring this information directly to users instantaneously and at no cost to them.</p><p><strong>What do existing web-based services offer?</strong> While it was not feasible for us to do a comprehensive assessment of the current websites and online services, we have conducted a quick review of the websites that come up when searching the web for information on how to work abroad from the perspective of a worker in India (the top country in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.rfw8hxeaanj\"><u>geographic assessment</u></a>).

One reason may be that mobile and internet penetration has only recently gotten meaningfully high in these regions, so such digital services are yet underdeveloped (Prof. Samuel Bazzi). Another reason may be related to organizations\u2019 business models: For-profit companies are not incentivized to provide information for free; nonprofit organizations may struggle with sustainability if they do not generate any revenue (Jason Wendle). This suggests that an appropriate model for this organization may be of a revenue-generating nonprofit: one that aims to maximize welfare (not profits) but can sustain itself by generating income and not being entirely dependent on donor money.

This is due to a combination of good-quality evidence on the problem and its potential solutions paired with a large scale of potential impact. Moreover, we believe this charity may naturally change who migrates (benefit (3)) by reducing the cost of migrating, and it may additionally be able to expand to focus on increasing the number of migrants (benefit (1)), as discussed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.z00deup9j44i\"><u>section 3.4</u></a>.</p><h3><strong>4.2.1 &nbsp; Evidence that migrants currently experience harms</strong></h3><p><strong>While the evidence is somewhat limited, we believe that there are good reasons to believe that this charity could improve the quality of migration and improve its returns for migrants and their families.</strong></p><p><strong>The first way this may be achieved is by lowering the costs associated with migrating.&nbsp;</strong>The largest fraction of these costs are due to fees paid to intermediaries and employment agents (see Figure 5). These fees can be extremely high, equaling years of at-home salaries and months of full-time salaries at the destination (Figure 6).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/graqfnolgn28gmzqix45\"></p><p><strong>Figure 5: Intermediation costs for Bangladeshi migrants in 2018/2019, split by component.</strong> Intermediary costs consistently make up the majority of migration-associated expenses (<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/903161585816440273/pdf/Toward-Safer-and-More-Productive-Migration-for-South-Asia.pdf\"><u>Ahmed &amp; Bosssavie, 2020, p. 51</u></a>)</p><p>The reasons for such high fees are complex but seem to primarily be the result of:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>The fact that the current situation relies on a time-intensive process whereby migrants receive a range of personalized services from intermediaries (such as assistance with finding job opportunities, handling visas, travel arrangement, insurance, etc.),</li><li>Asymmetry of information between potential migrants and intermediaries, allowing the well-informed intermediaries to extract excessive value from under-informed migrants, and</li><li>An oversupply of workers, which puts intermediaries in a position of power (<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bosssavie, 2023</u></a>).&nbsp;</li></ol><p>By creating an easy-to-use web platform that potential migrants can use directly and for free, many of these middlemen can be removed from the process, increasing efficiency and reducing costs (supported by our conversation with Dr. Tutan Ahmed).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/x097rluoezrut2mgpa5k\"></p><p><strong>Figure 6</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>The costs of migrating for selected pairs of countries</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.migrationdataportal.org/themes/migrant-recruitment-costs\"><u>Migration Data Portal, 2021</u></a>).</p><p><strong>There are reasons to believe reducing these fees is possible.</strong> As shown in Figure 6, these costs vary widely across migrant-sending countries. Filipinos, whose labor migration is managed by the government, pay about three times less than Indians, where the migration market is much less regulated. In the example of Bangladesh, a visa lottery that allowed some workers to migrate to Malaysia under a government-managed scheme lowered fees from the typical USD$3,000-$4,000 to around $400 (<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20220258\"><u>Mobarak et al., 2023</u></a>). This points to inefficiencies and overcharging in these countries that an impact-maximizing charity could tackle.</p><p><strong>Another way a charity could increase the quality of migration is by reducing the likelihood of migration failure and its associated costs.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/3ab0cffdc2e4621f8b5a70a0410213d5-0050062023/original/Bangladesh-case-study-FORMATTED.pdf\"><u>Bossavie (2023)</u></a> says: \u201cThe current lack of formal information sources about migration opportunities in Bangladesh [...] leads to frequent migration failures. One-third of migration attempts from Bangladesh currently end in failure.\u201d (pp. 15-16) On top of misinformation, failure may simply be the result of changing preferences or situational factors of the potential migrant (based on our conversation with Dr. Tutan Ahmed). In such cases, however, the typical practice in countries like India and Bangladesh is that the intermediaries keep the fees paid to them instead of returning them to the customer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Such financial losses can be substantial</strong>. The medium and average losses associated with failure to migrate from Bangladesh were $250 and $818, respectively (<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6574658k\"><u>Das et al., 2014</u></a>). In the context of West Bengal, data collected by Dr. Tutan Ahmed indicates an average loss of $580. Given average monthly household incomes of $250-$300, these are very large expenses, often putting families significantly in debt.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Again, an impact-maximizing \u2013 rather than a profit-maximizing \u2013 organization could likely significantly reduce these costs</strong>, either by not charging the user at all or by setting fees without any margins, and returning fees in cases of migration failure. By providing transparent information about the costs, returns, and risks associated with migration, the charity may also discourage from migrating those who wouldn\u2019t benefit from it (as was observed in the Safe Migration for Bangladeshi Workers pilot program run by BRAC in Bangladesh;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6574658k\"><u>Das et al., 2014</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Relatedly, extensive inefficiencies likely exist in information-poor environments regarding the choice of other migration-related services</strong> \u2013 such as language training or skill certification \u2013&nbsp;<strong>where uninformed customers may inadvertently use poor-quality, high-cost services</strong>. If a charity could develop a reliable recommendation system for third-party services, it could likely save users non-trivial sums of money. Two experimental studies support this contention:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w29588\"><u>Bazzi et al. (2021)</u></a> ran a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Indonesia, in which individuals interested in migrating abroad were given information about the quality of intermediaries. This helped participants get better pre-departure training and have better experiences abroad. The authors say: \u201cour results suggest that prospective international migrants in Indonesia face substantial information frictions when selecting placement services\u201d (p. 23) and \u201cquality disclosure interventions could be particularly effective in settings like ours where intermediaries are numerous and the market is fragmented.\u201d (p. 1)</li><li><a href=\"https://steg.cepr.org/publications/regulation-reputation-intermediaries-labor-abuses-and-international-migration\"><u>Fernando and Singh (2023)</u></a> performed an observational study examining the effects of publicly revealing the results of an intermediary rating program in Sri Lanka. They found that the nationwide disclosure program actually improved the market: It induced intermediaries to improve placement quality by better screening employment opportunities abroad. This suggests that, if the charity managed to achieve meaningful scale, such third-party rating mechanisms could not only improve migrants\u2019 choices but also improve the quality of third-party services that are being offered.</li></ul><p><strong>There are also non-financial ways in which this charity could increase migration quality. One of these is migrant safety.&nbsp;</strong>Temporary labor migrants can suffer from issues such as forced labor, having their passports withheld by employers, delayed wage payments, and other forms of abuse and discrimination (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-018-1876-5\"><u>Reza et al., 2019</u></a>). A charity focused on maximizing migrant welfare (as opposed to its own profits) could implement systems to collect information on such abuses and discourage future migrants from taking up jobs with problematic employers. One way to do this would be to allow current migrants to fill out surveys or upload video testimonials about their migration and job experience for future migrants to see; this is currently being trialed on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://overseas.ai/\"><u>platform</u></a> developed by Dr. Tutan Ahmed for migrants from India. While migrants from LMICs are often willing to undertake a significant risk of harm, it is highly likely that they would switch to safer alternatives if the charity provides them with such options (based on our conversation with LaMP).</p><p><strong>By improving access to information and decreasing the costs of migrating, the charity may achieve additional impact by changing who migrates</strong> (benefit (3) in Table 2 above). Migrants from lower-income families stand to earn more from the same job abroad, since their relative wage increase is higher. At present, however, migrant workers typically come from families with close connections to past migrants, and only those who can afford the high upfront fees can reap the benefits of working abroad.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3688065\"><u>Clemens (2020)</u></a> found that people preparing to migrate out of low-income countries typically have incomes 30% higher than the average. In Bangladesh, only 2% of the households in the bottom consumption quintile have one or more migrating family members, compared to over 15% in the top quintile (i.e., a sevenfold difference;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/903161585816440273/pdf/Toward-Safer-and-More-Productive-Migration-for-South-Asia.pdf\"><u>Ahmed &amp; Bosssavie, 2020</u></a>). In Nepal, where costs are lower, the effect of income is weaker, with the respective figures being 12% and 26% (i.e., a roughly twofold difference).&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4.2.2. &nbsp; Evidence that temporary international labor migration (compared to no migration) has a positive effect on earnings</strong></h3><p><strong>The evidence on the causal impacts of international labor migration is generally limited. However, we find sufficient reasons to believe they are substantial.</strong> The main benefits we consider in this section are the financial returns to migrants and their families and the associated well-being gains. The primary risks that we consider are those of financial loss and of being mistreated at the destination. There is a range of additional positive and negative considerations that we don\u2019t have space to address in this report. These include the effects on the economies of sending and receiving countries, concerns around \u201cbrain drain,\u201d effects of return migration, the value of information (to CE and the broader migration-research community), non-utilitarian considerations (such as agency, equality of opportunities, dignity etc.), and effects that orderly labor migration may have on the acceptability of international migration more broadly. Overall, we believe these are less important than the primary effects and more likely to be net positive than negative.</p><p><strong>Estimating the causal effects of migration is challenging since migration is difficult to randomize, and observational estimates suffer from severe selection effects.</strong> Past studies have employed methodologies such as matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, and panel data techniques (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20220258\"><u>Mobarak et al., 2023</u></a> for references).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here, we will only review randomized experiments and studies that exploited natural experiments</strong>, arguably the most robust non-experimental method. We are only aware of three such studies. One is an RCT and two studied the effects of visa lotteries (quasi-experimentally). This gives them a clear causal identification strategy, with the downside that they cannot isolate the effect of&nbsp;<i>migrating for work</i> per se but only the effect of&nbsp;<i>migrating for work under the visa RCT/visa-lottery program</i>. The winners of one of the programs also received government-provided intermediation services that losers weren\u2019t eligible for. Nevertheless, these are the best empirical estimates available.</p><p><strong>All three of these studies find large financial returns for the migrant and their close family members:</strong></p><ol><li><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article-abstract/8/4/913/2295949\"><u>McKenzie et al. (2010)</u></a> studied the effects of a visa lottery that allowed some Tongans to migrate for work to New Zealand. This program allowed 250 randomly selected individuals \u2013 and their nuclear families \u2013 to permanently relocate to New Zealand. The authors found that migration in this context led to a 263% gain in income (in the first year after migration and similarly afterward), and that the nuclear family benefitted similarly.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20220258\"><u>Mobarak et al. (2023)</u></a> studied the effects of a visa lottery that allowed some 30,000 Bangladeshi individuals (chosen at random from over a million applicants) to migrate to Malaysia for agricultural work, under a government-managed program. This program only allowed workers themselves to migrate, with their nuclear families staying back home. The study found large positive returns: The families of those who won the lottery and decided to migrate experienced a 109% increase in their household incomes (compared to those who lost). Both the migrants themselves and their families benefited, the latter via a large increase in income from remittances.</li><li><a href=\"https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2023-12/guestworkerrct2023.pdf\"><u>Naidu et al. (2023)</u></a> ran an RCT in which one group of participants was randomly offered the option to migrate for work from India to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They found that workers typically doubled their total net compensation (after subtracting migration-related expenses).</li></ol><p>Out of these three studies, the latter two are more relevant to the idea explored in this report, as they study the effects of temporary migration of workers unaccompanied by their family members, which is the predominant mode of international labor migration. Both of these found a rough doubling of household incomes \u2013 which can be transformative for families experiencing poverty.</p><h3><strong>4.2.3 &nbsp; Well-being effects of international labor migration</strong></h3><p>Financial returns are the primary motivation for people to migrate internationally under temporary work visas. However, they should not be the only consideration for organizations working in this space. Whether or not this form of migration is net beneficial for people\u2019s welfare will depend also on non-financial factors, the key one of which is the experienced well-being of migrants during their time abroad.</p><p><strong>Temporary migrant workers are exposed to a high risk of exploitation and harm, owing to the fact that their permit to stay is typically tied to their jobs and that they often need to work for several months just to repay the debt they took on in order to migrate.&nbsp;</strong>While these risks exist everywhere, the situation in the countries of the Persian Gulf \u2013 the top destination for many low-skilled migrant workers \u2013 is especially concerning. Numerous reports over the years have reported on the abuses these workers experience, including long working hours, poor housing conditions, confiscation of passports, limited food allowances, and insufficient workplace safety (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/changing-tide-gulfs-migrant-workers\"><u>Sherman, 2022</u></a>). They may also have to endure racism and xenophobia from the local population.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=0dpzEAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Toward+Safer+and+More+Productive+Migration+for+South+Asia&amp;ots=WoVnCjPbMf&amp;sig=ZMSeE6JALMOzUCu7UvAyaQLyxpU&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Toward%20Safer%20and%20More%20Productive%20Migration%20for%20South%20Asia&amp;f=false\"><u>Ahmed and Bossavie (2022)</u></a> report that about half of Nepali migrants in Qatar report violations of their rights, with the commonest issues being prolonged exposure to extreme heat, inability to change employers, and withholding of travel documents. Similar findings were also common in the literature review by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-018-1876-5\"><u>Reza et al. (2018)</u></a> on Asian migrant workers.</p><p><strong>Experimental evidence supports the concern that workers at destination suffer negative well-being effects.</strong> In the experiment with Indian construction workers by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2023-12/guestworkerrct2023.pdf\"><u>Naidu et al. (2023)</u></a> described in the previous section, the authors found that roughly 50% of participants in the treatment group did not take up the offer to go to the UAE and instead stayed in India, an observation which the authors explain by an expectation of disutility at destination (\u201cthe jobs in the UAE are particularly unattractive relative to jobs in India,\u201d p. 2). Those who did migrate<strong>&nbsp;</strong>reported significant falls in their well-being, driven by primarily by increases in physical pain, effort, and heat, and, to a smaller extent, by non-significant increases in loneliness, stress, and anger. Overall, though, the well-being decrease was modest, around 0.16 standard deviations (on a composite measure of well-being).</p><p><strong>It may, however, be somewhat misleading to look at the well-being of these migrants at the destination, without the broader context of their pre- and post-migration quality of life.</strong> In fact, many migrants come from families at risk of severe poverty and may be experiencing comparable risks to their well-being in their home countries.&nbsp;</p><p>One way to examine this question is to ask whether these migrants are experiencing worse conditions than they expected and whether third parties with better knowledge should discourage or try to eliminate it \u2013 what some authors call a \u201crepugnant transaction.\u201d This is what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/694615\"><u>Clemens (2018)</u></a> did in his analysis of data from a natural experiment of Indian construction works in the UAE, who either did or didn\u2019t get a quasi-randomly visa, depending on their application's timing.</p><p><strong>The author found \u201cweak if any\u201d evidence that this type of migration meets five different criteria for repugnance (coercion, regret, externality, equilibrium effects, and inequity)</strong>. Namely, he found that overseas work experience by one family member causes household members to seek out this type of work in the future; that living conditions are usually estimated relatively accurately by future migrants (suggesting limited space for regret); that many Indians actually earn more than expected, due to availability of off-the-books overtime work beyond that promised by their formal contracts; and that this kind of work doesn\u2019t cause \u201cremittance dependency\u201d by the household (as feared by prior authors) and instead helps increase new business investment at home. The author says that \u201cguest work in this setting typically causes Indian construction workers to earn multiple times what they otherwise could, be much more likely to hold a job at all, pay their debts, start new businesses, and help their family members to access some of these same opportunities\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/694615\"><u>Clemens, 2018, p. 26</u></a>).</p><p>He concludes that these findings are inconsistent with the idea that migrant workers suffer harm to such an extent that this type of migration should be discouraged.</p><p><strong>We also suspect gaps and biases in the literature on migrant workers\u2019 well-being</strong>. For instance, the literature on the well-being of female migrants often focuses on domestic workers and their risk of being mistreated (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00197939221147497\"><u>Blaydes, 2023</u></a>). However, anecdotal evidence (from our conversation with residents in Qatar) suggests that many female migrant workers \u2013 such as those working in retail or other customer-facing services \u2013 report increases in their well-being. For instance, Indian migrants experience much lower risk of sexual assault in Qatar than in India, allowing them to walk alone at night \u2013 something many used to find inconceivable at home.</p><p><strong>Our conclusion from this literature is threefold</strong>: Firstly, temporary migrant workers are definitely at risk of harm in their destination countries, and this needs to be carefully considered and monitored by any future charities working in this space.</p><p>Secondly, despite these risks, the migration experience is likely still highly beneficial to the long-term well-being of migrant workers and their families. Thirdly, the existence of these harms and abuses in certain current migration corridors (or by certain employers) creates an opportunity to improve the quality of worker migration: By creating greater transparency, feedback mechanisms, and reliable recommendations for safer job opportunities, a charity in this space could create significant improvements in migrants\u2019 quality of life.</p><h2>4.3 &nbsp; Evidence that a charity can do this</h2><p><strong>We believe that it is tractable for a charity to deliver the services outlined in this report.&nbsp;</strong>However, we do have some concerns about the complexity and tractability of certain steps along the theory of change. Please see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.um05qq4n4lg9\"><u>section 3.3</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.foge0ewo0wu9\"><u>section 8</u></a> for more details.</p><p><strong>In this section, we substantiate this reasoning by referring to two existing services,&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://overseas.ai/\"><strong><u>overseas.ai</u></strong></a><strong> and&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.duoflag.com/\"><strong><u>duoflag.com</u></strong></a><strong>, which feature some of the aspects of the platform this charity could develop.</strong> The former service is being developed by Dr. Tutan Ahmed and the latter by Beto de Castro Moreira, both of whom we spoke with about charity ideas in this space.</p><p><a href=\"https://overseas.ai/\"><strong><u>Overseas.ai</u></strong></a><strong> is an academic pilot project and not yet registered as a standalone organization.</strong> However, it has engaged in many of the activities we have considered, demonstrating their feasibility. These include:</p><ul><li>Gathering information on visas and job opportunities</li><li>Conducting field research to understand prospective migrants\u2019 needs</li><li>Developing a simple recommendation algorithm</li><li>Providing clients with personalized support to help them successfully migrate</li><li>Developing mechanisms for gathering feedback on the quality of employers and general experiences with migration</li><li>Various forms of advertising and outreach, including newspaper ads, social media, local-community outreach, and past-user referrals</li><li>Successfully helping individuals migrate abroad for guest work.</li></ul><p>Growing the user base via outreach has proved challenging since the organization doesn\u2019t have much brand recognition, and potential users aren\u2019t sure whether they can trust it. However, we believe that this is a tractable problem. We are encouraged, for instance, by the recent experience of the CE-incubated charity&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kayaguides.com/\"><u>Kaya Guides</u></a>, which is also developing a digital service in India (although for different ends, namely guided self-help for depression). Kaya Guides have been able to gain their first 900 users in one month \u2013 compared with similar organizations taking a year to recruit their first 1000 users \u2013 with retention rates severalfold higher than the industry average, all for a total recruitment budget of $105 (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CdELxtHgQjzCYPhtm/kaya-guides-marginal-funding-for-tech-enabled-mental-health\"><u>Abbott, 2023</u></a>). This demonstrates that outreach and user retention are tractable challenges for digital-service charities operating in countries like India, even with limited budgets and brand recognition.</p><p>One benefit of the idea explored in this report is that outreach targeting needn\u2019t be overly selective. While it needs to focus on individuals who may be interested in migrating, it doesn\u2019t need to target people over a specific threshold (in a way that a depression-treating service does): Given the very large potential returns on labor migration, most sections of the population \u2013 even those relatively well off \u2013 stand to benefit from it (although, as discussed earlier, poorer people stand to benefit more).</p><p><strong>The second example demonstrating tractability is&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.duoflag.com/\"><strong><u>duoflag.com</u></strong></a>. Duoflag is a website that helps individuals migrate for work, focusing primarily on skilled migrants, such as those interested in jobs in software development, tech product management, and sales. It currently features information on visa options in different destination countries and a job board of visa-sponsoring employers. A future potential feature is a \u201cmigration calculator\u201d that tells users where they can migrate to and how to do it, based on their existing skills and preferences. Duoflag has attracted users via online discussion forums like Quora where some people have asked questions about getting jobs abroad, and others have directed them to Duoflag. The Duoflag experience demonstrates that, with sufficient software development skills, it is possible to build a user-friendly website that lowers the information barriers present in this space and helps individuals get jobs abroad.</p><p>Both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://overseas.ai/\"><u>overseas.ai</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.duoflag.com/\"><u>duoflag.com</u></a> are small-scale pilot projects rather than nonprofits operating at the scale we envisage in this report. However, both of the founders are optimistic about the potential impact of such platforms, assuming that they can attract sufficient funding to finance their operations (we return to the topic of funding in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.e44kou6x6rk2\"><u>section 8.2</u></a>).</p><h1>5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Expert views</h1><p>We spoke with several experts about charity ideas in this space. Overall, they were supportive of additional efforts in this space and of the specific approach considered in this report. The conversations also highlighted the fact that the guest work market is complex and understudied in published resources, requiring organizations to invest resources in deeply understanding the local situation in order to design a service that users will seek out and rely on.</p><h3><strong>Prof. Mushfiq Mobarak, Yale University</strong></h3><p>We spoke with Professor Mobarak early on in this research. He initially pointed us in the direction of focusing on international labor migration as a topic and recommended that charities in this space focus on one of three areas:</p><ol><li>App- and technology-based solutions to improve the information provision environment</li><li>Better information on the safety of international migration</li><li>Providing skills that are necessary in the market foreign markets, such as language skills or other job-relevant skills.</li></ol><p>He noted that many of these services can be provided by private companies but that experience suggests this often results in low quality and high prices \u2013 which are possible due to market failures resulting from asymmetric information. There is space for nonprofits to have a significant impact if they can deliver these services well.</p><p>However, he also cautioned against information-only solutions, as other factors, such as asymmetry of power between migrants and intermediaries, may prevent people from acting on the information.</p><h3><strong>Jason Wendle, Labor Mobility Partnerships (LaMP) and the Global Development Incubator; Prerna Choudhury and Pall Kvaran, LaMP</strong></h3><p>In our conversation, we discussed several points:</p><ul><li>The Persian Gulf and SE Asia destinations may be quite saturated, so we may not be able to create much additional migration there. Work in this region should also focus on improving the treatment of migrants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>LaMP is currently focusing on creating more migration to Europe, North America, and Japan.&nbsp;</li><li>However, the LaMP has a portfolio that includes projects focused on improving the \u201cquality\u201d of migration. A lot can be done here: reducing costs, reducing the risks of harm, etc.</li><li>Jason cautioned against information-only interventions. Firstly, migrants aren\u2019t looking for information \u2013 they are looking for organizations that can help them migrate. Secondly, these are often very poor people who are willing to take significant risks to improve their livelihoods.</li><li>He was more optimistic about an organization that facilitates the migration process fairly and transparently. If a viable alternative to high-risk, high-cost migration is offered to people, they will take it.</li><li>LaMP is currently testing a similar app-based solution to facilitate agricultural migration from Mexico to the USA.</li><li>Starting a project focused on target countries in the Gulf and then trying to expand it to Europe or Japan is possible but not straightforward: The markets look different (less existing employer demand), the needs of employers in terms of workers skills are quite different, and the organizational experience may be of limited help since European employers wouldn\u2019t want to be modeling projects based on the Gulf.</li><li>Lastly, he said that many projects in this space have been struggling due to limited donor funding. He believes that, after an initial period of donor-funded growth, organizations should aim to transition to revenue-generating, self-sustaining models.</li></ul><h3><strong>Dr. Tutan Ahmed, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</strong></h3><p>Dr. Ahmed and his team have been running the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://overseas.ai\"><u>overseas.ai</u></a> app (discussed earlier) for the past 2.5 years. This platform shares multiple features with the charity idea explored in this report, so our conversation focused on Dr. Ahmed\u2019s experiences.</p><ul><li>The Indian labor migration market is \u201cfraught with illegal practices, misinformation, exorbitant fees, and a chain of middlemen that often resort to different malpractices.\u201d Overseas.ai is trying to cut out the intermediaries and directly provide prospective migrants with job opportunities and transparent information.</li><li>Dr. Ahmed and his team have mapped out the full migration journey and successfully helped a number of individuals migrate to the Gulf countries, demonstrating that this idea is feasible. However, understanding the local market and potential migrants\u2019 needs is a time-consuming process.</li><li>A key challenge has been attracting users to the platform and building user trust \u2013 people often call in and even come in person to the office to check that the organization is legitimate (though this may get better over time with better brand recognition).</li><li>However, user retention has been high: some 70% are still interested after engaging with the platform, and around 25% end up migrating.</li><li>He previously estimated that they would need to charge users $50-$70 to cover their costs. However, he now believes that a model free for the users would be preferable, and that costs should be shifted to employers if possible.</li><li>The team has started looking into the possibility of sending migrants to countries like Germany. It seems possible, but the process is much more difficult and costly for the migrants.</li></ul><h3><strong>Prof. Samuel Bazzi, University of California San Diego</strong></h3><p>Prof. Bazzi\u2019s area of expertise is in Indonesia, where he has been working for 15 years. Our conversation focused on the migrant situation in Indonesia, as well as whether a charity like the one explored in this report could be successful there.</p><ul><li>The typical destination countries are in the Gulf, but also Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.&nbsp;</li><li>There is limited room for increasing the amount of migration in these well-established migration corridors.</li><li>Increasing migration is much harder to do than improving quality. But both are meaningful and needed.</li><li>Intermediaries are the biggest blind spot of the research \u2013 not much has been published about how this big market works.</li><li>In Indonesia, the migration market is quite fragmented \u2013 much less centralized and regulated than, for example, in the Philippines. Intermediaries hold a lot of power and sometimes actively undermine the government\u2019s efforts to decrease costs and harms in the market.</li><li>The government has been trying to regulate the market better for a long time, but so far with limited success.</li><li>Prof. Bazzi thinks that bottom-up approaches (like the one we consider) make a lot of sense and may be more successful than government top-down solutions.</li><li>He hasn\u2019t seen many digital interventions like the one we are considering. This may be because internet and smartphone penetration rates were, until recently, quite low. But now may be a good time to implement digital solutions.</li><li>Prof. Bazzi would be keen to continue conversations about potential interventions in Indonesia. He also knows others working on this topic in the Philippines and Sri Lanka.</li></ul><h1>6 &nbsp; &nbsp; Geographic assessment</h1><p>In this section, we conduct a preliminary exploration of the geographic areas where this charity\u2019s work may be especially promising.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Given the range of activities this charity could undertake, different countries may look as more or less promising targets for this intervention.&nbsp;</strong>Our model assumes that the charity would focus on countries of origin with a well-established culture of labor migration. However, it could also aim to operate in countries where this type of migration is currently less common, with the primary aim of increasing its rates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Due to the digital nature of the charity idea, it may also be relatively easy for the charity to expand internationally.</strong> However, due to differences in culture, regulatory environments, and various contextual factors, we would still expect international expansion to require a significant investment of resources.</p><h2>6.1 Geographic prioritization</h2><p><strong>We have created a simple&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V3SlwKmFegc6I3xOf11g67b2pR59mSrG5Z4J0DALA0k/edit#gid=1141672719\"><strong><u>geographic weighted factor model</u></strong></a><strong> to identify promising target countries for this charity.&nbsp;</strong>The model is built on imperfect data, and its results depend on a series of subjective choices, so it should only be seen as a preliminary model that future users can build upon.</p><p>The model consists of variables we expect to indicate the potential impact and tractability of the intervention. Neglectedness considerations are not included and instead discussed qualitatively in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.j9lx2nmbkqat\"><u>section 6.2</u></a>.</p><p>The input variables were given weights based on a subjective assessment of how well they may predict intervention success. Note that we gave a relatively high value to indicators of the existing extent of labor migration \u2013 future users may wish to downgrade these weights if they want to focus on countries with low migration rates.</p><p><strong>Given the limitations of available data, this model is intended to be indicative only.</strong> We have limited confidence in the top 15 countries predicted by the model, displayed in Table 3 below, actually being the highest-priority countries to work in. The charity founders should combine this information with other qualitative and quantitative data sources when choosing their target country.</p><p><strong>The following variables were used:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Population (weight = 10%)</strong>: The country\u2019s population \u2013 the larger the country, the more potential for impact. This variable is log-transformed, so a country 10x larger gets one extra point.</li><li><strong>Average labor income (10%)</strong>: The potential benefit of migrating to a higher-income country is greater for residents of low-income countries. This variable is calculated as a product of the country\u2019s gross national income (GNI) per capita and its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_share\"><u>labor share of income</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Total number of emigrants (10%)</strong>: The number of emigrants a country has, used as a proxy for the culture of emigration in the given country. This variable is log-transformed. Note that we would have preferred using statistics on the number of&nbsp;<i>labor migrants</i> specifically, as opposed to all migrants, but weren\u2019t able to find such data.</li><li><strong>Remittances as % of GDP (10%):</strong> The size of remittances as a percentage of the economy is used as another proxy for the importance of international labor migration.</li><li><strong>Unemployment rate (5%):&nbsp;</strong>Countries with high unemployment rates \u2013 indicating an oversupply of workers \u2013 may benefit more from increased labor emigration.</li><li><strong>Underemployment rate (5%):&nbsp;</strong>Similarly, countries where underemployment is common may be promising targets for this charity. So-called time-related underemployment is defined as the percentage of people in employment who are not working full-time and would like to work more. Note that the definition of \u201cfull-time\u201d may vary across countries, so this indicator may be unreliable.</li><li><strong>Cost of migrating (20%):&nbsp;</strong>The costs of associated with migrating vary widely across migrant-sending countries. Countries where costs are high present an opportunity for a charity. This variable is constructed as a three-level indicator variables (high/medium/low), and most countries have missing data.</li><li><strong>Human rights violations (5%):</strong> Countries with extensive human rights violations may independently be good targets for a charity, as helping people migrate out of those countries will likely improve their quality of life.</li><li><strong>Tractability indicators:&nbsp;</strong>We used four indicators of tractability (i.e., ease of getting things done), standardized across most CE geographic assessment models:<ol><li><strong>Fragile States Index (5%)</strong>: An index developed by The Fund for Peace that aims to capture the level of states' vulnerability to conflict or collapse.</li><li><strong>Corruption Perceptions Index (5%)</strong>: An index developed by Transparency International, capturing the perceived level of corruption in countries worldwide.</li><li><strong>Rule of Law Index (5%)</strong>: An index developed by the World Justice Project intended to capture how countries adhere to the rule of law in practice.</li><li><strong>Freedom in the World Index (5%)</strong>: An index developed by Freedom House that measures the degree of civil liberties and political rights.</li></ol></li></ol><p>We would have liked to include several variables if we had more time/if we could find good-quality data on:</p><ol><li><strong>Better data on the cost of migrating and the cost associated with migration failure.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Aspects of the legal environment related to emigration</strong>: Different migrant-sending countries regulate labor migration in different ways, some of which may be relevant to the tractability of the charity\u2019s work (or the relative neglectedness of the issue). For instance, in the Philippines, foreign agencies are not allowed to directly recruit workers, and only accredited domestic agencies may act as intermediaries, which may limit the range of services the charity could offer.</li><li><strong>Availability of migration-related services</strong>: An important aspect of this charity idea is that of an enabler of existing services, such as recruiters, language-training providers, vocational-training institutions etc. If the supply of such services is limited in a country, the charity will only be able to provide limited value in this way.</li><li><strong>Language skills</strong>: International labor migration is easier (and likely more cost-effective) if the population already speak a language used at the destination. For instance, helping Nigerians migrate to the UK is easier than helping Nepalis migrate to Japan due to the reduced need for additional language training.</li></ol><p><strong>Table 3 below shows the top 15 countries from this model</strong>, along with some of the input variables (in their Z-scored form).</p><p><strong>The most promising countries in our assessment are a mixture of countries in South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and Latin America.</strong> Many of the top countries in South Asia, which has a known problem of high recruitment fees. The other countries tend to be LMICs with high remittance rates and/or high unemployment rates.</p><p><strong>Table 3: Top 10 countries in our geographic assessment, including a selection of input

overlapping with the charity idea we propose in this report.</strong> This includes private businesses, local and international NGOs, as well as local and national government organizations.

Most of these organizations have a relatively limited focus \u2013 for instance, supporting with job search or responsibly recruiting workers in a specific profession \u2013 instead of a providing a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d migration service similar to what we have outlined in this report.</p><p><strong>The organization whose work is closest to our charity idea is&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://justgood.work/\"><strong><u>Just Good Work</u></strong></a>, which is a mobile app that provides comprehensive information about deciding to migrate, migration safety, and various practical tips for migrant workers, such as how to find accommodation, receive healthcare, or switch jobs. It focuses on several existing migration corridors and provides information for migrants</p><ul><li>From India to the Middle East and the UK</li><li>From Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Indonesia to Malaysia</li><li>From Kenya and Uganda to the Middle East, and</li><li>From Eastern Europe to the UK.</li></ul><p>While it provides high-quality and easy-to-understand information (in both text and voice formats), it focuses more narrowly on making migrants safe and informed rather than on being a more versatile platform that also helps migrants get jobs or other migration-related services. As such, we see this organization as a potentially impactful partner to collaborate with rather than a \u201ccompetitor\u201d in this space.</p><p><strong>Table 4: Nonprofit organizations active in the space of improving the quality of international labor migration (non-exhaustive).</strong></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Organization</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Countries</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Information and services offered</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://justgood.work/\"><u>Just Good Work</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><ul><li>Origin: South &amp;

&nbsp; Cost-effectiveness analysis</h1><p><strong>We built a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iATEfLbJ0FoXJbElo4baXHv7r8ZzAYnF4SYlXRABSMk/edit?pli=1#gid=538715197\"><strong><u>spreadsheet model</u></strong></a><strong> to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of this charity.</strong> We model the effect of increasing the quality of international worker migration from India, Nepal, and Bangladesh to countries like Malaysia and Saudi Arabia \u2013 the current typical destination countries. The model can be altered to assume migration to other destinations; however, that wasn\u2019t our focus.</p><p><strong>The default model assumes that no migration is additional, i.e., that the charity only improves the \u201cquality\u201d of migration</strong> (by lowering fees and reducing the rates of migration failure). However, as discussed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.z00deup9j44i\"><u>section 3.4</u></a>, this may be an overly conservative assumption. As such, we created an additional model for one country (Nepal) where 13% of migrants are assumed to be additional. This subgroup, on top of benefiting from lower fees and lower rates of migration failure, is also modeled to reap the main benefit of labor migration, i.e., the higher wages at the destination.</p><p><strong>Lastly, we modeled the option whereby the charity charges the successful migrants a small fee \u2013 $50.</strong> In this case, the charity would operate as a revenue-generating organization/a social enterprise. While this slightly reduces the benefit to the users, the charity\u2019s costs decrease very substantially, thus improving cost-effectiveness.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Table 5 below provides a summary of the results of our models.</strong> Assuming that our rough bar for cost-effectiveness is around 10 DALYs per $1000, we can make several observations:</p><ul><li>In the quality-only models, the charity is modeled to pass this bar in Bangladesh, roughly meet the bar in Nepal but be only about half as cost-effective in India.</li><li>In the model where 13% of migrants from Nepal are counterfactually additional, the cost-effectiveness roughly quadruples.</li><li>If users who successfully migrate are charged $50, the charity would be very highly cost-effective in all three modeled countries.</li></ul><p><strong>If the charity wanted to fully cover its operating costs via users fees (once at scale), we estimate that it would have to charge $58, $66, and $55 per person in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, respectively.</strong></p><p><strong>Table 5: Summary of modeled cost-effectiveness of the charity.&nbsp;</strong>These results are based on best-guess point estimate inputs.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Country</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Quality only (no additional migration)</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>With counterfactually additional migration</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Quality only with a $50 fee to migrants</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>India</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$196/DALY</p><p>5.1 DALYs/$100</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>not modeled</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$49/DALY</p><p>20 DALYs/$1000</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Nepal</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$105/DALY</p><p>9.5 DALYs/$1000</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$26/DALY</p><p>38 DALYs/$1000</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$39/DALY</p><p>25 DALYs/$1000</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Bangladesh</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$78/DALY</p><p>13 DALYs/$100</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>not modeled</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$15.9/DALY</p><p>63 DALYs/$1000</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;The results in Table 5 are based on calculations that rely on best-guess point estimates of input variables. However,&nbsp;<strong>the models can also be run using uncertainty modeling</strong>. For these models, we inputted variables as distributions and used the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://usecarlo.com/\"><u>Carlo app</u></a> to produce a Monte Carlo simulation of the distribution of the resulting cost-effectiveness. Table 6 below shows the results of these simulations, and Figure 7 shows the distribution of cost-effectiveness for Nepal (as an arbitrary example). Note that the concept of \u201ccost-effectiveness\u201d is not meaningful when the costs approach zero or get negative \u2013 which can happen if the charity collects revenue from the migrants. As such, we didn\u2019t run these simulations for the fee-charging models.</p><p><strong>The expected-value results of these models are in good agreement with the results in Table 5</strong>, with the 90% confidence interval generally being about one order of magnitude wide. We do not have a strong preference between these models: On the one hand, taking uncertainty into account should produce more accurate results (as argued e.g. by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metacausal.com/givewells-uncertainty-problem/\"><u>Haber, 2022</u></a>). However, we have generally put more thought into our best-guess inputs than we have into our distribution inputs, and our confidence intervals may not be very well calibrated (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/how-we-plan-to-approach-uncertainty-in-our-cost\"><u>GiveWell\u2019s (2024)</u></a> reasoning for why uncertainty modeling may not be better than best-guess inputs.)</p><p><strong>Table 6: Summary of modeled cost-effectiveness of the charity, based on Monte Carlo simulations using inputs with uncertainty.&nbsp;</strong>The table shows the expected values and the 90% confidence intervals.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Country</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Quality only (no additional migration)</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#a53247;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>With counterfactually additional migration</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>India</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>4.1 (1.2 \u2013 11.2) DALYs/$1000</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>not modeled</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Nepal</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>8.2 (2.4 \u2013 18.2) DALYs/$1000</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>31 (10 \u2013 65) DALYs/$1000</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Bangladesh</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>10.4 (3.1 \u2013 28.0) DALYs/$1000</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>not modeled</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/invm2oej9ymlsrprxdra\"></p><p><strong>Figure 7: Distribution of modeled cost-effectiveness of the charity, in Nepal, assuming no additional migration.</strong></p><p>Section 7.1 and 7.2 below describe the main components of effects and costs used in our models and outline how the calculation was performed.</p><h2>7.1 &nbsp; Effects</h2><p><strong>In the models with no additional migration, we assumed two main effects (benefits) of the charity: decreased fees to intermediaries and reduced rates of loss of money due to migration failure.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For intermediary fees, we assume that:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>In India</strong>, the current typical fee is $1,156, and we could reduce it to $450.

These estimates are based on survey data from West Bengal.</li><li><strong>For Nepal</strong>, we make the same assumptions as for India.</li><li><strong>In Bangladesh</strong>, about 28% of potential migrants fail to migrate and, on average, lose $818.</li></ol><p>The estimates for Nepal are the least empirically supported, so we are the most uncertain about them.</p><p>In all three countries, we assumed that we could reduce these costs by about 85%. This is because the majority of these costs are associated with fees paid to intermediaries, even if the person fails to migrate. These are avoidable if the charity doesn\u2019t charge any fees to its users (or at least those who don\u2019t manage to migrate). However, some fees are less avoidable, such as if people pay for visas but then decide not to go ahead with migrating.</p><p><strong>Next, we modeled what impact this reduction in the cost of migration has on the (economic) consumption of the migrants and their families.</strong> We made several simplifying assumptions: (i) The migrant is a male member of a four-person family; (ii)&nbsp;their income is roughly at the 68th percentile of the country\u2019s income distribution (i.e. they are above-average earners; see the last paragraph in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.1hvpaa7evdhd\"><u>section 4.2.1</u></a>); (iii) the money saved on fees is consumed over the course of a year, equally by all family members; (iv) the people who lose money by failing to migrate take out loans to pay off this amount, and this loan reduces their and their families\u2019 consumption until it\u2019s repaid.</p><p><strong>These costs and benefits were then expressed in terms of&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>annual income doublings</strong></i><strong>, i.e., the number of years of doubled income.&nbsp;</strong>As an example, if a person\u2019s consumption doubles for one year, this counts as \u201cone\u201d; if the consumption of a four-person family doubles for two years, this counts as \u201ceight.\u201d The reasoning behind this measure is that, empirically, there is a roughly linear relationship between the&nbsp;<i>logarithm</i> of GDP per capita and subjective well-being. In other words, people\u2019s well-being tends to increase by the same increment whenever the GDP per capita doubles \u2013 see Figure 8 below for a cross-sectional, cross-country demonstration of this phenomenon. GDP per capita is closely correlated with consumption (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/median-daily-per-capita-expenditure-vs-gdp-per-capita\"><u>Our World in Data, n.d.</u></a>). Therefore, we expect a similar log-linear relationship between consumption and well-being.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/sz8d381ay9qf0auugqbn\"></p><p><strong>Figure 8: Relationship between GDP per capita and life satisfaction</strong> (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction\"><u>Ortiz-Ospina &amp; Roser, 2013</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Lastly, we converted consumption doublings to DALY equivalents</strong>. Specifically, we followed GiveWell's methodology of moral weights&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit#\"><u>(2020)</u></a>. In their framework, they assign a \u201cmoral value\u201d of 1 to the value of doubling one person's consumption for one year. Based on their team\u2019s inputs and empirical data collected by the NGO IDinsight, they assign a moral value of 2.30 to one year of healthy life. This implies that one income doubling is equivalent to 0.43 DALYs.<br><br><strong>The model with counterfactually additional migration additionally assumes the benefit of increased income of the migrant</strong> (compared to the income they would have earned at home). We model migration to two countries, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, the latter of which is also intended to represent other countries in the Persian Gulf region. 30% of migrants are assumed to travel to Malaysia and 70% to Saudi Arabia. We assume that, in both countries, workers would earn roughly minimum wage and be able to remit about 50% of their earnings. We assume that migrants would typically spend two years at the destination and that they and their families would consume the additional income in this period.</p><p><strong>Note that we have not modeled any other well-being effects on the migrant.&nbsp;</strong>As reviewed in section 4.2.3, low-skilled migrant workers in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (as well as other destinations) may experience a decrease in their subjective well-being, due to issues such as long working hours, high temperature, or other kinds of poor working conditions. However, since our primary model assumes no changes in the total number of people migrating, there is not&nbsp;<i>counterfactual</i> decrease in well-being. In fact, by improving transparency in the process, the charity may counterfactually increase workers\u2019 well-being. However, we were too uncertain about the possibility of these effects to include them in the model.</p><p><strong>The only model where the well-being considerations are relevant is the model that assumes a counterfactual increase in migration.</strong> In this case, it is possible that our model overestimates the benefit to the migrant, as the financial benefit would be partly offset by a decrease in subjective well-being.</p><h2>7.2 &nbsp; Costs</h2><p><strong>The model assumes several kinds of costs</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard CE-charity fixed costs</strong>, which include things like cofounder salaries, necessary travel, and visa costs.</li><li><strong>Marketing/outreach costs: We estimate that the charity will need to spend about $3.40 to acquire a user who will actually migrate.</strong></li><li><strong>Staff time spent directly supporting a migrant: We expect most users to require personalized support by our staff, delivered via a call, WhatsApp, or other means.</strong></li><li><strong>Telecommunications costs</strong> for support provided via telephone calls.</li><li><strong>Office &amp; hardware costs for workers of the call center.</strong></li><li><strong>Fees collected: For the model of the organization that charges its users a fee, this see is then subtracted from the charity costs (since it essentially reduces the need for donor funding).</strong></li></ul><p>One potentially important cost we didn\u2019t factor in is that of a software developer. Depending on this person\u2019s country of origin, level of skills, and whether they would be paid at a level competitive with the private sector (vs. a level more typical for a charity), this cost could vary widely, from an amount that would fit under the \u201cfixed-costs\u201d overhead to being an important separate item on the budget.</p><h2>7.3 &nbsp; Scaling</h2><p><strong>In line with CEAs for other charity ideas, this model assumes two phases: A linear scaling phase and a constant at-scale phase.</strong> The scaling phase is assumed to take three years for costs and eight years for effects. Both the charity\u2019s costs and effects are then modeled to remain constant until year 20, at which point they stop. Note that all of these are simplifying assumptions made for the purposes of modeling and comparability with models for other charities; they are not the most likely way we expect this charity to grow. We expect that, in reality, growth will likely follow an exponential curve, with initial users being hard to acquire and growth being initially slow while the service is being developed. If things go well, though, the charity could enter a rapid growth phase and quickly acquire more and more users.</p><p><strong>At scale, we assumed that the charity could reach some 55,000 website users per year and help around 5,570 users migrate.</strong> This corresponds to around 1% of the annual number of emigrant workers in each modeled country. Note that this value is rather arbitrary, but it is quite consequential for the charity\u2019s cost-effectiveness: In our model for Nepal with no additional migration and no fees, doubling the number of annual migrants improves cost-effectiveness by 55%, but halving it reduces cost-effectiveness by 42%. It is even more consequential for the model with a $50 fee: doubling the number improves cost-effectiveness by a factor of 26 whereas halving it lowers cost-effectiveness by a factor of 3. Clearly, scale will be an important predictor of not just the total amount of impact the charity can reach but also of its cost-effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Table 7: CEA considerations</strong></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"background-color:#801c31;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Reasons this intervention could be more cost-effective than modeled, all else equal.&nbsp;</strong></th><th style=\"background-color:#801c31;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Reasons this intervention could be less</strong></p><p><strong>cost-effective than modeled, all else equal.</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><ul><li>The intervention may cause additional, counter-factual migration</li><li>Better-informed people may migrate to higher-earning destinations than we modeled</li><li>The higher transparency could result in people getting better jobs (ones that pay better or that have better working conditions)</li><li>Mid-skilled migrants may be able to earn higher than minimum wage in the destination countries</li><li>The lowered prices should allow lower-earning people to migrate than otherwise would have</li><li>The higher transparency could improve the quality of third-party services</li><li>We assume that earnings from additional migration would be consumed immediately.

Secondly, this charity will essentially have users or clients in a similar way that private businesses do. As such, it will need to create a service that attracts people\u2019s attention, builds trust, and caters to people\u2019s needs. This is unlike many other CE-incubated charities that aim to improve people\u2019s lives without needing their active opt-in. Lastly, we expect a key aspect of the work to involve finding opportunities for automation so that the service can be as cost-effective and scalable as possible.</p><p><strong>We expect that the founders will \u2013 at least initially \u2013 need to spend considerable time in the destination country to form a deep understanding of the migration landscape there, the experience of past and future migrants, and the existing organizations that offer services to them.</strong> After this initial period, there may be less need for continued local presence, although it may be beneficial for at least one co-founder to spend considerable time locally, to provide guidance and support to the hired team of migration facilitators (/call center employees).</p><p><strong>Given the digital nature of this charity idea, we expect that much of the work could happen remotely.</strong> A major area of focus will need to be on developing a high-quality digital product. This involves designing a user-friendly front end of the platform and overseeing the building of the platform's backend (i.e., the algorithms powering its interactive features). While much of this work can be delegated to hired specialist staff, the founders will likely need to stay closely involved with the high-level design.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We expect a large part of the role to involve drafting and updating strategies for the organization and constantly prioritizing tasks based on new available data and where the organization can have the most impact at the margin.</strong> There are many possible features the digital platform could have, offering many different directions for this charity \u2013 unlike some other CE-incubated charities, which focus primarily on efficient scaling of a narrow set of services or products. Given that it may be difficult to measure the ultimate (and counterfactual) impact this organization is having, we expect there to be a risk of pursuing the wrong metrics of success. Keeping an \u201ceye on the target\u201d will likely be key to the organization\u2019s success.</p><p><strong>Given that the idea of this charity is one of an \u201cenabler\u201d of migration via third-party migration pathways, jobs, and (likely) third-party services, engaging with stakeholders will likely form an important part of the job.</strong> These may include local businesses and NGOs in the target country, as well as national and international organizations involved in labor migration.</p><p><strong>Lastly, if the charity wants to expand in the direction of creating new job opportunities for migrant workers, one of the founders may need to spend time engaging with potential employers in the destination countries.</strong> These may include the typical status quo destination countries, as well as the more novel destinations, such as countries in Europe.</p><h2>8.2 Key factors&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>This section summarizes our concerns (or lack thereof) about different aspects of a new charity putting this idea into practice.</strong></p><p><strong>Table 8: Implementation concerns</strong></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#801c31;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Factor</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#801c31;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>How concerning is this?</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Talent&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low Concern</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Access to information</td><td style=\"background-color:#fff2cc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Moderate Concern</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Access to relevant stakeholders</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low Concern</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Feedback loops</td><td style=\"background-color:#fff2cc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Moderate Concern</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Funding</td><td style=\"background-color:#fff2cc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low-Moderate Concern</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Scale of the problem</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low Concern</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Neglectedness</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low Concern</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Execution difficulty/Tractability</td><td style=\"background-color:#fce5cd;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Moderate-high Concern</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Risk of harm</td><td style=\"background-color:#fff2cc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Moderate Concern</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3><strong>Talent</strong></h3><p><strong>Table 9 below summarizes our views on the necessary and preferable skills of the charity founders.</strong> Overall, there are no specialist skills we see as \u201cmust haves\u201d for this charity; we believe that it can be led by a strong generalist with a keen interest in the topic. However, given the platform's digital nature, we expect several skills that would be beneficial to have in the founding team, namely product development, web development, market research, and marketing. We believe that many of these may be fulfillable by early hires; however, it would likely be beneficial if the founders possessed at least some of these skills, so as to reduce the need to multiple additional staff members early on.&nbsp;</p><p>Additional experiences that may be useful are work in organizational strategy design (such via management consulting experience). Lastly, given the limited evidence base and high value of additional information on labor migration, a keen interest in working with academic researchers would be a plus.</p><p><strong>Table 9: Founder requirements and nice to haves</strong></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#801c31;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Must have</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#801c31;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Preferable (offsets a 10% diff in incubatee strength)</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#801c31;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Preferable, all else equal</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Tech product development experience</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Market research experience</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Marketing experience</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Web development experience</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Personal experience with migrating on a work visa from an LMIC</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Organizational strategy/ consulting experience</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Keen interest in working with researchers</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3><strong>Access to information</strong></h3><p><strong>Two kinds of information are relevant to consider: Content for the platform and information on different aspects of labor migration.</strong></p><p><strong>We expect gathering information for the platform</strong> (e.g., on visa options, migration pathways, quality of employers, etc.)&nbsp;<strong>to be an important part of the charity\u2019s activities and one that may require a significant amount of effort</strong> (and, for instance, searching the internet in different languages). However, all of this information should be available to be found. We are therefore not concerned about this being a barrier for the charity.</p><p><strong>Finding good-quality information about migration for it to inform strategic decision-making may be more challenging.</strong> International migration is an understudied space, and it is often difficult to obtain high-quality data about international migrants since they (by definition) move around and cross country borders. Additionally, this charity would aim to solve problems of existing informal or semi-formal intermediary markets, on which no good data may exist in many migrant-sending regions. As such, the organization may need to rely on imperfect information or set up systems for its own information collection, such as running surveys.</p><h3><strong>Access to stakeholders</strong></h3><p><strong>There is high willingness by various actors to address the problems experienced by international guest workers.&nbsp;</strong>This includes country governments and various local and international NGOs. We therefore expect that it should be relatively easy to access those stakeholders (although we are uncertain in this view).</p><p><strong>We are uncertain about the willingness of private-sector stakeholders to cooperate</strong>, such as for the functionality featuring recommendations for third-party services. On the one hand, some businesses may welcome this. On on the other hand, businesses may oppose the efforts of an organization that is aiming to increase efficiency in the system, as that will inevitably reduce some players\u2019 profit margins.</p><h3><strong>Feedback loops</strong></h3><p><strong>The primary theory of change behind this charity is to improve the quality of international labor migration.&nbsp;</strong>These effects may be difficult to measure in a truly counterfactual way. The charity may need to set up careful data-collection systems \u2013 including users surveys and interviews \u2013 to make sure that it is actually achieving its desired impact.</p><p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>giving the digital nature of the platform, it will be relatively easy to collect extensive data on proximal outcomes of interest, such as website traffic, engagement, and the usage of various features or services.</strong> Additional data may be possible to collect by partnering with other websites and services and using cookies to track users\u2019 activity on third-party websites.</p><h3><strong>Funding</strong></h3><p><strong><u>Funding from funders in the CE network</u></strong></p><p><strong>We are not very concerned about this charity\u2019s ability to raise funds from funders in the CE network.</strong> We expect funders on the seed network to be about as interested in this idea as in ideas that focus on global health. In terms of mid-stage funding, we have some uncertainty owing to CE\u2019s relative lack of experience with topics like migration. However, our best guess is that funding may only be ~10% harder to attract than for ideas that focus on health.</p><p>We are also encouraged by the fact that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/\"><u>Open Philanthropy</u></a>, a major funder in the CE network, has long been interested in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/immigration-policy/\"><u>migration</u></a> and has made impactful grants in this space. Additionally, there is anecdotal evidence that certain funders going through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.impactfulgrantmaking.com/\"><u>CE\u2019s grantmaking program</u></a> are interested in focusing their portfolios on livelihood-improvement in LMICs. If these plans materialize, we believe there should be good opportunities for early and mid-stage funding for this charity.</p><p><strong><u>Broader funding sources</u></strong></p><p><strong>Attracting funding to initiatives in the space of international labor migration has been a challenge.</strong> Based on the experience of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lampforum.org/\"><u>LaMP</u></a>, voluntary labor migration often falls outside of funders\u2019 grantmaking areas. Therefore, extra work may be needed by this charity to convince grantmakers to allocate funding to this space.</p><p>One consideration that makes us less concerned about fundraising for this charity is that its running costs may be relatively low. Due to its primarily digital services and a lack of distribution of physical goods, it may be able to keep costs relatively low. The availability of funding may then be more of a factor determining which additional, more costly services the charity may offer, rather than whether or not it will be able to offer its basic information-providing services.</p><h3><strong>Scale of the problem</strong></h3><p><strong>We are not concerned about this organization struggling due to low scalability.</strong> In other words, the scale of the problem is very large, concerning millions or potentially tens of millions of migrants each year. The top country in our geographic assessment, India, sends over a million migrant workers per year, and Asia as a whole had 4.6 million new migrant workers in 2022 (<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1378038/india-number-of-work-emigrants/\"><u>Statista, n.d.</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Work/Migrant-workers-in-Asia-approach-pre-pandemic-levels\"><u>Nikkei Asia, 2023</u></a>). Moreover, we expect labor migration to continue growing in the coming years and decades.</p><h3><strong>Neglectedness</strong></h3><p><strong>Overall, we have low concerns about the neglectedness of this charity idea.&nbsp;</strong>The space of international labor migration seems generally neglected by nonprofits. And while governments in multiple countries have been attempting to address the issues experienced by migrants from their regions, they have largely been ineffective. There is some risk that high-quality for-profit organizations will fill part of this niche. However, given that it is usually beneficial for companies to maintain the asymmetry of information and power that is typical of this market, we do not think this development is likely.</p><h3><strong>Tractability</strong></h3><p><strong>Tractability is one of our biggest concerns for this charity.</strong> The theory of change is quite complex and requires that multiple activities be done alongside each other. We expect that the charity founders will need to spend considerable time understanding the realities of the local migration market in their target area to design a service that is useful and attractive to users. Then, they will need to work with web and app developers to design an appropriate tech solution and collaborate with employment agencies to be able to advertise their jobs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We imagine that the charity may have to spend considerable time with the initial batch of migrants</strong> \u2013 much more than we expect will be the case at scale. This is because (i) initial users will be difficult to recruit, (ii) the charity will first need to find ways to effectively support these migrants before finding efficient and more automated ways of doing so, (iii) minimizing any risks of harm to the initial clients will be crucial for the charity\u2019s subsequent growth.</p><p><strong>On the other hand, given the digital-first nature of the solution, we expect this charity to be able to scale up quickly if its initial phase goes well</strong>. We imagine that the charity\u2019s growth will likely be closer to exponential \u2013 similar to private-sector tech startups \u2013 rather than linear, as may be the case for charities delivering on-the-ground services.</p><h3><strong>Risk of harm</strong></h3><p><strong>International labor migration, especially when focused on migrants from low-income backgrounds, carries significant risks with it.</strong> There are numerous stories of workers being abused, exploited, and even dying while in the destination country (see e.g.,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/11/up-to-10000-asian-migrant-workers-die-in-the-gulf-every-year-claims-report\"><u>McQue (2022)</u></a> on the Gulf countries or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/28/foreign-care-workers-invited-to-uk-exploited-on-grand-scale-says-union\"><u>Booth (2023)</u></a> on risks even in countries like the UK). This risk will always be present, and it is impossible to reduce it to zero. The charity will have to develop careful mechanisms for minimizing such risks and for supporting migrants wherever such risks arise. Not only is this a moral consideration but also a practical one: A single high-profile incident of harm to a migrant that this charity helped could significantly harm the charity\u2019s reputation and slow down its growth.</p><p><strong>Another way that this charity may do harm is by reducing the revenues of people who currently act as intermediaries supporting migrants.</strong> While we believe that it is, on the whole, a good thing to reduce the size of this market, and with it the harms that it causes, it is worth acknowledging that some people\u2019s livelihoods will be negatively affected if this charity is successful.</p><h2>8.3 &nbsp; Remaining uncertainties</h2><p><strong>We have some remaining uncertainties about how much in-person (or otherwise personalized) support is needed</strong> and how much of this can vs cannot be automated. Given that many of the users of this platform will be low-skilled workers experiencing poverty, may not be highly literate, and may have various uncertainties and doubts about the migration process, they may require more extensive support and reassurance than we assumed to get to the point of successfully migrating. Current intermediaries may accompany migrants to visa-issuing offices, help review their paperwork, etc. The charity may need to do this as well (or possibly for some candidates and not others), and not all of it may be automatable or doable fully remotely. There may also be a need for responsive \u201cfirefighting\u201d, such as helping people who\u2019ve made a mistake, lost their visas, had their debit cards blocked, missed their flights, etc.</p><p><strong>Much of this report has focused on the migration situation in the South Asian region, as that is where many of the world\u2019s low-skilled international migrant workers come from and where most of the written evidence exists.&nbsp;</strong>However, a charity like this \u2013 one that offers a technological solution that enables people to migrate safely and cheaply \u2013 could be promising in other world regions (e.g., Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, or Latin America). We are generally unsure which of our conclusions apply to these other regions. If the charity founders wish to operate there, they will need to conduct careful country-specific preliminary research and outline a localized theory of change for their work.</p><h1>9 Conclusion</h1><p><strong>Overall, our view is that this charity idea is worth recommending to future nonprofit founders.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This intervention addresses the risks and harms experienced by temporary migrant workers, which have been documented to be widespread across migrant-sending countries.</strong> While governments, NGOs, and intergovernmental organizations have so far had limited success in making labor migration cheaper, safer, and less financially risky, we believe that recent advances in smartphone and internet penetration have created the conditions for novel technology-based interventions to provide scalable and financially sustainable solutions.</p><p><strong>Now is a great time for new charities in this space.&nbsp;</strong>International labor migration has been a relatively neglected issue by actors in international development.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>However, its potential to transform people\u2019s lives is huge. Moreover, given the demographic trends in developed and developing countries, the opportunities for labor migration will likely continue to grow. As such, a charity that finds an effective way of supporting this process could create a large-scale positive impact for years or decades to come.</p><h1>Appendix 1: Simplified theory of change</h1><p>The diagram presented in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.um05qq4n4lg9\"><u>section 3.3</u></a> is rather complex, showing both activities and paths to impact that we perceive as key and those that we see as optional or additional (on top of the basic model of the charity). Therefore, we also present here a simplified diagram, which only contains the key elements.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kbu4BsQFgdm8CNpa3/w9rw2lda55wnpohszlyt\"></p><p><strong>Figure A1: Simplified theory of chang</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Appendix 2: Revenue-generating models</h1><p><strong>In contrast with most CE-incubated charities that are fully donor-funded and don\u2019t charge their end users or partner organizations fees, this charity may benefit from having such revenue streams.&nbsp;</strong>There are a few options here, including charging the successful migrants, employers whose jobs get filled, or partnering with third-party organizations. We explore these options below.</p><p><strong>Firstly, the charity may choose to charge its users a small fee for the services it provides.&nbsp;</strong>There are multiple arguments in favor of this consideration:</p><ol><li><strong>A fee is unlikely to discourage users from the service.</strong> At the moment, migrants typically pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in order to migrate. Therefore, it is unlikely that a fee on the order of tens of dollars would discourage them. In fact, providing the service completely for free may make some users suspicious of it being fraudulent (based on a conversation with Dr. Tutan Ahmed).</li><li><strong>Migration creates large financial returns for the users, making it possible and easy for them to pay.</strong> This is in contrast with, e.g., health or education interventions, which don\u2019t immediately generate financial benefits to users.</li><li><strong>Charging a fee could increase cost-effectiveness.</strong> By shifting some expenses from \u201ccosts\u201d to \u201cdisbenefits\u201d, the ratio of benefits to costs can improve (users can try and see this using our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iATEfLbJ0FoXJbElo4baXHv7r8ZzAYnF4SYlXRABSMk/edit?pli=1#gid=1431659468\"><u>CEA model</u></a>). This may be relevant in some countries where a fully donor-funded model may not meet funders\u2019 cost-effectiveness bar (such as India, based on our models; see Table 5 in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lqUB6m91ei-ibD6HvpT-hM-t-vsBPZC3W8Hkuux3b4/edit#heading=h.dvqcz5lwaz2\"><u>section 7</u></a>).</li><li><strong>It could improve financial sustainability</strong>. Any diversification of income and lowering the reliance on donor funding will improve the charity\u2019s financial stability and sustainability.</li><li><strong>It could allow the charity to scale up faster</strong>. If the additional revenue came on top of donor funding, the extra funds could be reinvested to help speed up growth.</li></ol><p><strong>However, there are also arguments against this option:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>The users of this charity would typically be people experiencing some level of poverty, and it may be seen as unethical to charge them money if it can be avoided.</strong> These people already get charged by many other actors in the migration process. It may be preferable for the charity to distinguish itself from these other actors by being purely altruistic.</li><li><strong>This model could make fundraising more difficult.</strong> Some grantmakers may not wish to donate to revenue-generating organizations. We are very uncertain about whether this would actually be the case but would advise the charity co-founders to explore this consideration.</li><li><strong>There may be legal limitations \u2013 or complications \u2013 to operating as a revenue- generating organization.&nbsp;Depending on the jurisdiction in which the charity is registered, it may only be allowed to generate a small proportion of its income via revenue streams. Other legal arrangements may need to be considered, such as turning the organization into a for-profit, possibly one that is then fully owned by an umbrella non-profit organization. This would allow the main organization to generate unlimited revenue \u2013 even exceeding operating costs \u2013 but the umbrella organization would then have an obligation to reinvest any profits back into the organization. These options would need to be carefully explored before committing to them.</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Overall, we recommend that the charity begins operating without charging its users any fees, but consider this option once it has successfully established its operation.</strong></p><p><strong>The second option is for the charity to charge a fee to employers.</strong> Employers from the destination countries are typically keen to find workers, and are willing to pay organizations who help them find suitable candidates. We see few downsides to this revenue-generating stream. However, we have uncertainties about the necessary requirements for it, such as whether it is possible to collect this fee even if the charity isn\u2019t the primary organization posting the job but rather an organization that re-posts third-party job listings.</p><p><strong>Lastly, the charity may be able to charge partnering third-party private-sector organizations.&nbsp;</strong>For instance, if the charity runs a service that rates and recommends third-party service providers (e.g., language schools), it may be able to collect a commission for every successful referral it makes. We expect this to be a minor but non-negligible option for generating revenue. The main downside of this stream is the risk of the financial incentive distorting the recommendations the charity makes, i.e., incentivizing the charity to recommend the highest-paying companies rather than the highest-quality ones. However, this is a risk that the charity founders can be aware of and ensure to mitigate.</p><h1>References</h1><p>Abbott, R. (2003).

This can range from 1% to an egregious 20%. This guide aims to help minimise the amount of money lost in this process.</p><p>Note: This guide does not take into account tax deductibility which would likely be a superseding factor&nbsp;compared to transfer fee efficiency. Our experience stems from operating within the African landscape, particularly in transferring funds to various animal advocacy charities and projects across Africa, but we think this could also be highly applicable to other organisations working in low, middle income settings.</p><h1>Advice for Sending Money Efficiently</h1><h2>Use Wise</h2><p>My first and primary piece of advice in this guide is to sign up to and use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wise.com/\"><u>Wise</u></a>. Wise has the best exchange rates and the highest level of transparency I have come across, usually averaging out to around a fee of 0.7% for a one-way money exchange and transfer. In other words, donating $100 to a Mexican organisation would cost you ~$0.7 so they would end up receiving $99.3 instead of $100.</p><h2>Go through as few entities as possible</h2><p>I\u2019d recommend making as few transactions as possible and going through the least number of intermediaries. This is because often there is a fee associated with each step of the transaction. So if you can make a direct transaction, that is optimal.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you do a direct bank transfer, your transfer may be routed through additional intermediary banks each charging their own fee, or if donating through an intermediary third party donation website they may take their own fee, so it\u2019s worth checking if this is the case. This could be by asking the recipient or referring to the donation website.</p><h2>Send in the same currency as the recipient</h2><p>This is generally good practice because you\u2019ll know what exchange rate you\u2019re paying when you exchange the money to the same currency as the recipient. Otherwise, you will pay the exchange rate the banks set unknowingly, which can be unfavourable, especially if it takes place on the recipient\u2019s side.</p><p>I recommend asking if the receiver has a USD account (assuming you are sending in USD) or if it\u2019s possible for them to set one up, especially if you are making large or multiple transactions and then sending in USD.</p><p>If you are not sending in USD it may make sense to exchange to the currency the recipient is using, to avoid conversion on the recipient's end of the transaction</p><p>Fortunately, in Wise, this is relatively easy. You can open a new account in most currencies (see image below). Once you have this new account you can exchange money into this account from your existing USD (or primary currency) account at a good rate.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/t4iovEmwHerpWkhwp/citsmdvlg8w1fejvez5a\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/t4iovEmwHerpWkhwp/xz4hylox4oaaoynkqqyh\"></p><p><i>Opening a new account balance in a different currency is simple with Wise. Open \u2013&gt; Choose your currency \u2013&gt; Confirm</i></p><h2>Other Options</h2><p>Sometimes Wise will not work, for example as I am writing this you cannot send to Nigerian recipients. My current best solution for this is using WorldRemit, which does work, although the fees are high. Unfortunately, sometimes you will have to accept paying a high fee for the sake of expediency.</p><p>In general, I have ordered this list with the lowest fee options first and progressing to those with the highest fees. (Take this with a pinch of salt and please do your own research as this is anecdotal to my own experience)</p><h3>SendWave</h3><p>SendWave has fair rates and covers a fair amount of countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It is worth checking SendWave, if Wise does not have your country covered.&nbsp;</p><p>Caveat: I don\u2019t recommend using cash pickup unless it is your absolute last option. It can be potentially unsafe for the recipient.</p><h3>WorldRemit</h3><p>As I mentioned above, WorldRemit often has countries covered that Wise does not. It\u2019s worth checking, if neither SendWave nor Wise has you covered.</p><h3>Bank Transfer</h3><p>Often you are losing a fair bit of money on bank transfers.

We recognize that this was primarily our fault as we never clearly defined it, so we will try to make it a bit clearer here.</p><p>Meta organizations are those that operate one step removed from direct impact interventions. These can focus on the infrastructure, evaluation, and strategic guidance necessary for the broader field to maximize effectiveness and impact. They are essential in bridging gaps, identifying high-impact opportunities, and enabling other organizations to achieve or amplify their end-product impact.</p><p>Below we will list a couple of illustrative examples. Note that we only chose these examples because we think the organizations are well known, and thus more likely to give people an understanding of the type of work we want to fund. We are not saying that we intend to fund these organizations.</p><p>Clear Passes</p><ul><li>Charity evaluators like GiveWell: These organizations assess and recommend high-impact charities, ensuring donors can contribute effectively to causes with confidence in their impact.</li><li>Incubators like Charity Entrepreneurship: They support the creation and development of high-impact charities, providing resources, mentorship, and strategic advice to nascent organizations.</li><li>Cause prioritization research like Rethink Priorities: These entities conduct research to identify and prioritize the most pressing causes, guiding resources and efforts towards areas where they can achieve the greatest impact.</li><li>Field-building organizations like 80k: Initiatives aimed at promoting impactful careers, thereby increasing the number of individuals working in high-impact areas.</li></ul><p>Organizations whose primary impact comes from first-order interventions fall out of the scope of the funding circle.</p><h2>What we\u2019re looking for in an application</h2><p>Some general things we are looking for in an application that we would like to highlight:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>In our 1st round retrospective, we have the section&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sbiHDSTpAib5aZpzy/meta-charity-funders-summary-of-our-first-grant-round-and#The_most_common_reasons_for_rejection\"><u>\u201cThe most common reasons for rejection\u201d</u></a>, where we hope that we can make it easier for applicants to avoid the most common mistakes people make in their applications. We would especially like to highlight:<ul><li>Scope: Please read&nbsp;\"W<u>hat we mean by Meta\"</u> and think through if your project is within scope.</li><li>Theory of Change: A common reason for rejection in the last round was that \u201cThe theory of change was unclear, unfocused, or seemed implausible\u201d. You need to help us understand how your project ends up contributing to a better world. Please read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/nailing-the-basics-theories-of-change\"><u>Aidan Alexander\u2019s post on ToC\u2019s</u></a> to better understand how to make a good ToC. Highlighting the flaws/uncertainties in your own model and the information you are trying to gather by running this project is a big plus.</li></ul></li><li>Strong founders/Track record: We think one of the strongest indicators for future success is the people related to a project and previous achievements. In your application, please explain how and why you/your organization are well suited to run this project. Back up your claims with data to the extent you can, this includes historical data for this project, data for similar projects, or data that attests to the (relevant) skills of the team. If possible, also think through and highlight how your project excels compared to other similar projects.</li><li>Strategic alignment with field needs: Applications should demonstrate an understanding of the ecosystem and articulate a rationale for why their project is necessary at this time. Why this? Why now? Why has no one been doing this before and is it reasonable that you are applying for X FTEs to do it instead of doing an MVP first?</li><li>Price tag: Think through the amount of funding you are applying for. We as funders, try to put a price tag on what you intend to deliver. We are looking for the highest impact use of a marginal $, this means that price tag matters compared to what you are going to deliver. Conversely, if it seems you significantly underestimate the costs, you likely won\u2019t be able to deliver what you say you will if you get funded.</li></ul><h2>Transparency</h2><h3>Individual donors working together</h3><p>We want to stress that since this is a funding circle and not a grantmaking organization, all members are responsible for their own donations. This means that funding decisions are made personally by individual circle members and do not necessarily reflect the priorities of the funding circle in its entirety.&nbsp;</p><h3>Time committed by funders</h3><p>The funding circle is an activity the funders do on the side of their normal jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>In the week before applications close and the week afterwards, members expect to spend a cumulative ~100 hours doing an initial application review. This means that we will not have the time to thoroughly review each application in the first stage and we urge applicants to keep this in mind when writing the applications.</p><h3>Feedback</h3><p>Unfortunately, we can\u2019t commit to giving individual feedback to any applicants, as i) It is time-consuming and we are already working on a strained time budget. ii) We are not one, but ~10 actors, so any feedback from one actor might not be true for another, which means it's unclear whether the feedback is even true, or provides value for the applicant. Therefore, we will resort to including some more general feedback in our retrospective.</p><p><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Vilhelm Skoglund"}}, {"_id": "4wB29MsuFmLarfu7J", "title": "Is there a recap of relevant jobs in the nuclear risk sector/nuclear energy sector for EAs?

My current take is that, without significant political reforms which seem very unlikely while Xi is alive (although considerably more likely after his death,) it\u2019s very unlikely that China will be able to mount a meaningful challenge to AI firms in US and allies in the race for TAI. I don\u2019t think it requires democratic reforms are required to China to be competitive with the US and allies, but I do think rule of law reforms are likely to be required.</p><p>The first post is going to be me forecasting Chinese growth on the theory that, if China reaches rich country status, it\u2019s likely that it will be able to compete with the US and allies for leadership in AI. I\u2019ll write a second post looking at Chinese AI efforts in particular. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The outside view</strong></p><p>Most countries that become middle income countries, have, thus far, stayed at middle income level. Chinese per capita income is currently at almost exactly the world average level.</p><p>The only countries (and territories) in the last 70 years that have gone low income to high income countries in the last 70 years (without oil wealth) are South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore (which does have substantial oil wealth,) and Hong Kong, although it seems very likely that Malaysia will join that club in the near future.</p><p>The majority of countries have managed to emerge from low-income status to middle income status because you only need to get a few things right. If you can get your population to urbanize, have basic rule by law so that firms have basic protection from violence, and get a high enough savings rate to accumulate physical capital you can get to middle income status just using catch up growth.</p><p>Catch up growth is the reason conceptually why middle-income status \u2013 rather than getting to a given level of GDP per capita \u2013 is the correct misuse. When growing with catch up growth you can just growth by accumulating physical capital using standard technologies that have been already been developed, like the technology for light manufacturing or civil engineering. Past this point though countries get rich by being able to develop and use technologies close to or at the frontier.</p><p>China has successfully managed to accumulate capital to utilize catch-up technologies, like steelmaking and light manufacturing. It\u2019s quite successfully managed to urbanize it\u2019s population and now seems to have reached the Lewis turning point where young people who try to leave their villages to find work cities often don\u2019t find it and have to stay in their villages, in the much lower productivity jobs.</p><p>Democracy and rule of law rates give another outside view on Chinese growth prospects. Of the 53 rich countries and territories that aren\u2019t oil states or microstates, only 2 aren\u2019t democracies \u2013 Singapore and Hong Kong \u2013 and none lack rule by law and all have low levels of corruption.</p><p>China currently lacks democracy, has high levels of corruption (although roughly normal levels for a middle income country is my perception,) and sort of middling levels of rule by law.</p><p>An important part of countries getting to high income status is new firms forming and competing to deploy and create ~frontier technologies and process. This is harder to do than accumulating enough capital and having low enough levels of violence and corruption to be able to build decent housing, supply reliable electricity and water, and have large numbers of workers do semi-skilled manual labour at scale. Specifically this can all be done while elites earn large rents by establishing monopolies (or more generally accruing market power)&nbsp; that they exclude non-elites from.</p><p>The role that democracy plays in this story is that its much harder for elites to rig markets in their favor in democracies and earn money by extracting rents rather than by doing useful economic activity. On a large scale, democracies with enfranchisement don\u2019t have institutions like slavery or serfdom, which are extremely effective intuitions for elites to extract rents with. The parallel to this in contempory China is the Hukou system. The Hukou system prevents individuals with rural Hukou from accessing social services and to a degree jobs (for instance admission to elite Chinese universities is easier with urban Hukou)&nbsp; in urban areas, and so retards rural-urban migration as well as reducing the labour market power of workers with rural hukou in urban China.</p><p>Another one of these political economy type problems for long run economic growth is whether the way to get rich is by gaining access to state power or by creating new and useful products. In middle income countries it\u2019s often the latter \u2013 for instance the Carlos Slim Helu, the richest person in Mexico and for a brief period the world, was able to get rich by being able to get access to state granted monopolies is real estate and telecoms.</p><p>On the other hand, in rich democracies, the way to make lots of money is typically not to gain access to state power in some way. The way that billionaires make the their money in the US is typically by creating new companies.</p><p>This is bad for economic growth because it means that productive effort is going into zero-sum competition for access to state power rather than into creating new, useful, goods and services. If this gets sufficiently, as is the case is many low income nations with large mineral wealth, this can be completely disastrous for economic growth because you get wars over natural resources.</p><p>China is currently somewhere in the middle of these extremes. There are lots of people who get rich in China by creating new useful goods and services, but there are also lots of people who get rich by getting good state contracts, or by getting the local security forces to beat up and threaten your business rivals.</p><p>More perniciously for long run economic growth is actively preventing reallocation of&nbsp; labor and capital to higher productivity areas to prevent social unrest, and preventing business leaders from acclimating independent power bases by getting rich in new areas. This is particaurly pernious because it\u2019s not merely causing static inefficiencies that reduce long run growth prospects, it\u2019s leads to optimization pressure against growth. We see this in contempory China with state run firms not reducing output (and so not reducing their use of capital and labour) to prevent to social instability that would come with layoffs from state owned firms. We also see business leaders sanctioned for, essentially, being extremely successful. The arrest of Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba (a more conglomerate version of Amazon and one of the most successful Chinese firms) is the most famous example of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of these political economy arguments should be taken with a pinch of salt \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to do good causal inference on these types of questions, but the base rates alone&nbsp; shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. It\u2019s also not the case that China hasn\u2019t got the point where countries typically becoming more democratic and more governed by rule of law if they\u2019re going to get rich. Both Singapore and Hong Kong were governed by law as low and middle income countries, and Taiwan and South Korea had democratized at about half the per capita income level that China currently has.</p><p>Broadly China has got further away from democracy and rule of law ideals under Xi. Xi has consolidated his personal control over the CCP by removing the term limits for President and Party Chair from the CCPs constitution, and by moving policy making to working groups rather than using state or party organs that he has less personal control over. Opposition within the standing committee of the Politburo has been removed following the party Congress in 2023.</p><p>Formerly, there were two factions in the Politburo. Xi\u2019s faction was broadly more pro market and group around leaders whose parents had been senior members of the CCP, and the many of the group was associated with Shanghai. The other faction, of which former leader Hu was part of, is broadly more pro redistribution and associated with youth wing of the CCP. The late premier Li was the most senior member of this group during Xi\u2019s leadership. Following the Li\u2019s death and the 2023 party congress no one from this second faction was appointed to the standing committee. I think this is evidence for Xi increasing his personal control and for the end of the rule by party elites at least somewhat governed by rules that existed during the leaderships of Jiang and Hu.</p><p>The use of the corruption police has been another tool that Xi has used to entrench his personal power. The arrests of Bo and the other guy are the famous cases of this which were extremely norm breaking due to the seniority of Bo and the other guy and that their families were target following their arrests.</p><p>After Xi\u2019s death \u2013 and he is quite old \u2013 I think there\u2019s a reasonable chance that there are significant political reforms as there were after Mao. Following Mao, the latitude of debates over the political trajectory of China was extremely broad \u2013 it extended to serious calls for free speech and democracy. Deng ended up taking a middle path between the most extreme authoritarians and the most extreme liberals. I don\u2019t think that large political reforms can be ruled out following Xi\u2019s death. I expect there to be a large middle class and business community that will advocate for rule of law and potential some democratic reforms.&nbsp; There\u2019s also the wildcard factor of the roughly 115 million Protestants who have often suffered repression under the CCP and form a natural co-ordination mechanism. I don\u2019t really know how to model this.</p><p><strong>Headwinds in the Chinese economy</strong></p><p>There some clear ways in which China is running out easy sources of growth and will be forced to start growing by using and developing frontier technologies.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A relatively large percentage of the population has urbanized</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are reliable supplies of electricity and running water</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese firms are already good at making steel and concrete and do so in large quantities</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There\u2019s no regular violence or unpredictable, mass arrests</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relatively high literacy rates</p><p>These are relatively reliable growth sources for low and middle income countries that China has either exhausted or is getting close to exhausting.</p><p>There are also some more pernicious headwinds.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wages in China are rising above other countries that can do export orientated light manufacturing like Vietnam</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China has a very rapidly aging population</p><p>High wages relative to competitors is particularly bad because it threatens a core part of the Chinese growth model. Export oriented manufacturing is important not just because it\u2019s a large share of GDP but also because it provides a mechanism for technology transfer and acts as a disciplining force on Chinese firms and Chinese elites, forcing them to innovate rather to compete on international markets rather than simply collect rents.</p><p>There are many problems that come with an aging population but I don\u2019t want to write about them because it would involve me reading more papers and I don\u2019t want to.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Nathan_Barnard"}}, {"_id": "Y5gdQpCWWrNthxzay", "title": "The Pending Disaster Framing as it Relates to AI Risk", "postedAt": "2024-02-25T15:47:05.014Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This post tries to explain one particular frame that plays a significant role in why I prioritise AI safety as a cause area.

We also feel that the reasoning for this is robust to different ways that the future could pan out:<ul><li>This has already been discussed quite a bit elsewhere, but if you haven't seen this discussion, I can point you to section 6 of the<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook#tEdmXiQSkFW8Yz5Gf\">&nbsp;<u>Introduction to Effective Altruism handbook</u></a> (I also have a rough draft of my own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M3Yx7GzwykcLNzGbX/an-argument-for-focusing-on-making-ai-go-well\"><u>argument here</u></a>)</li></ul></li><li>On the other hand, if AI goes well, we should basically expect it to solve global poverty, something EA\u2019s current efforts - a tiny fraction of global efforts - likely couldn't achieve in a hundred years. Admittedly, if AI ends up going well, EA will also only deserve a small fraction of the credit from this, but it feels like we have the opportunity to play a far more decisive role here.</li><li>If AI will literally be a disaster for humanity, then something feels absurd about distributing bednets to make a marginal difference in terms of global efforts to resolve poverty while we're on the Titanic headed towards an iceberg:<ul><li>Maybe this is just irrational feeling? \"Feels absurd\" isn't a concrete argument. But I would expect this to be persuasive to most people and the main reason for people to reject this to be that they either don't think things are likely to be that bad or that they don't trust their own judgement.</li><li>I believe that \u201cfeels absurd\u201d is not just an emotion, but indirectly points to some non-obvious reasons why we might want to prioritise this issue. I observe below that the cost of a mistake is non-symmetric, that investing can provide option-value and that near-term crisis spending should generally be allocated faster than non-crisis spending.

Given how powerful current and upcoming AI systems are, time spent building skills in these areas wouldn't be a complete waste even if you updated to AI risks being overstated.

Resource allocation isn\u2019t just a single decision since we can adjust over time as new information comes in. This means that there is value in allocating resources towards preparatory work in case further investigation turns up facts unfavorable to us (similar to betting in poker just to stay in the game until the next card is revealed). When timelines are short, not investing is more likely to cost us option-value.</li><li>Additionally, if we were trying to split resources evenly between global poverty and a near-term x-risk, we\u2019d likely to want spend the resources faster for the x-risk given that the later the date of allocation is, the more likely we won\u2019t be able to actually allocate the resources according to the x-risk model:<ul><li>Of course, a funder pursuing such a strategy would have to have to be careful here to avoid the situation where they\u2019ve spent all of the resources allocated to x-risk early and so they\u2019d end up unfairly tapping into the resources reserved for global poverty, due to reckless spending rather than an update in the facts.</li><li>Even if the crisis isn't once-off, this generalises if such crises are actually rare (though many institutions may struggle to define crises in such a way as to ensure they are actually rare).&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Notice how asking this question brings up considerations that might not have come up if we'd just focused on asking about how we could have the greatest impact.&nbsp;</li><li>I suspect that many people who are worried about AI risk struggle to communicate why they are worried about this because their position is dependent on some of these more indirect considerations. They might be in the same position as me where they have certain beliefs about the frame in which these arguments should take place which feel so obvious to them, that they struggle to put it into words:<ul><li>Hopefully, identifying the frame helps with communication between people in different camps regardless of whether this causes more people to agree with me or not.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Counter-considerations</strong>:</p><ul><li>Some people argue that our chances of success are so small that maybe we should just focus on making the world as good as it is for whatever time we have:<ul><li>I think this felt more persuasive in the past, but we've seen a lot of traction, both in the emergence of a bunch of potentially promising alignment directions, but also in terms of the governance:<ul><li>For technical alignment, I'll highlight the rapid progress in interpretability and the rise of model internals techniques like contrast-consistent search.

I\u2019d suggest that cause areas having a bit of a learning curve is to be expected and this curve is likely to be rougher for an area like AI safety where we can\u2019t rely on repeatable experiments to determine how to make decisions.

Emlen in his book (Animal Weapons:The Evolution of Battle) examines evolution of animal weapons whilst comparing it  to evolution of modern day weapons.The author states that animal evolution resulted in the replacement of inefficient weapons forms with more efficient forms.The weapon selection favoured the animals that had minimal size and cost but the weapons did not impair their ability to move.</p>\n<p>2.Starting small</p>\n<p>The evolution of animal weapons came in many forms.There were both offensive weapons of attack and defensive weapons to protect themselves.The efficiency of weapons  could also be increased from division of labour.For example ,in the ants colony the ants have different bodies and weapons sizes and the performance of different tasks enabled them to function as a efficient whole.</p>\n<p>Hopi Hoekstra while studying genes in mice noted that mice that had new alleles survived better than the ancestral version of genes .This is because they adapted better to the surrounding environment and reduced the chances of owls preying on the them.</p>\n<p>Military forces in the USA adopted the Universal Camouflage Pattern(UCP ) to blend with the environment so that they could carry out subtle attacks on their enemy.The UCP failed in Afghanistan and they adopted Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern in 2010 due to the different terrain structure.This showcased that not all weapons can be used in every situation and varies with the need.</p>\n<p>3.Triggering the race</p>\n<p>Competition, economic defensibility and duels are considered crucial in order for an arms race to occur.Douglas evaluates sexual selection ( where by individuals of one sex compete for access to the other) to elaborate on competition in the animal kingdom.This is because the sexual selection differs from other forms of natural selection due to the fact that it is tailor made to push the traits to the extreme.</p>\n<p>The female Jacanas usually fight over territories the males are situated.The female Jacanas are usually more aggressive and have larger weapons compared to male Jacanas due to the fact that they are constantly fighting to secure territories.Some females may be able to push out rivals from a single male territory but the biggest and best females own enough island to house three to four males.</p>\n<p>Duel,is another key ingredients for arms race,that enables the parties to be able to know the best weapons or modifications necessary to win a war.The World War 1 enabled Lanchester to develop his square law for modern warfare.Lanchester first model of linear laws described the ancient warfare methods to determine strength of military forces.He was then able to contrast with models that had significance in the modern age.</p>\n<p>Economic defensibility requires an individual to look at the costs and benefits of defending a resource.\nIn sexual selection of Tungara frogs,the males broadcast their location with eerie incessant calls.The chance of failing to attract a female higher but they take risk at the odds of being eaten by predator.State usually weigh the costs and benefits associated with building the weapons and choose the cost effective weapons.</p>\n<p>The environment is dynamic and there is no reason to infer that the ingredients necessary for an arms race will last indefinitely.</p>\n<p>4.Running the course</p>\n<p>In biological arms race, as the weapons grew bigger there was also higher costs to the animals.\nIn an experiment conducted on beetles the author noted that the increase in beetle horns led to stunted <a href=\"http://eyes.It\">eyes.It</a> was also elaborated in other animals such as moose who needed crucial minerals for their antlers such as calcium and phosphorus that was not present in the forage borrowed the minerals from other bones in there bodies to build their antlers.</p>\n<p>The costs associated with development of weapons vary for individuals.There are mandatory funds that fulfill necessary obligations and discretionary funds to be used in other respects.\nIn animals weapons can be considered discretionary since animals require the rest of the body to be build but can live without weapons.The was reduction in the population of the moose due to the high costs that were associated with the developing of the antlers.</p>\n<p>In humans,each state has mandatory obligations to fulfil and the surplus pool can be used as discretionary funds to help build weapons.The size of the discretionary pool vary because not all countries have the same size of resources.</p>\n<p>Male fiddler crabs usually size up their rival males to determine whether they can be able to take on their opponent.This helps them to walk away from a fight if they do not have the power to defeat their rivals.Similarly, during the Pax Britanicca period the local conflict did not escalate to war due to the presence of British warships that were considered a supreme power.</p>\n<p>4.1 Taking the short route</p>\n<p>Some animals such as the Dimorphic dung beetle species use sneaky methods to defeat their rivals.The Dimorphic dung beetle dig tunnels next to a main tunnel that is guarded by another male beetle so that they can access the main tunnel without having to fight a stronger <a href=\"http://rival.In\">rival.In</a> modern warfare,there are countries that choose to attack indirectly to avoid any casualties associated with direct warfare.The Zero Day attack can be  deployed into database and the code were embedded to lurk until it is necessary to exploit the software.The software engineers are sometimes unaware of it and it can cause great causality.</p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>Humans manufacture weapons from material in the environment and the structure exist separately from individuals but for animal weapons the weapons are part and parcel of their bodies.The animals also have the ability to build structures such as building of fortresses by termites.The information to build the fortress by be genetically inherited or learned through careful apprenticeship and <a href=\"http://practice.In\">practice.In</a> humans,either by design or accident they are able to pass on information on building of weapons through documents to be able to build more weapons.</p>\n<p>The bombing of Hiroshima by the nuclear warhead led states to scramble to develop them.Originally,states were restricted by cost of building the nuclear warhead but as the race progressed the warhead became cheaper.Countries such as India in the 1970s was able to create nuclear warhead.The rise of territorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and Taliban also causes worry that they could be able to access the weapons of mass destruction.\nThe magnitude of weapons of mass destruction available cannot be compared to any  animal weapon <a href=\"http://evolution.It\">evolution.It</a> is unlikely for the human race to survive another arms race.</p>\n<p><a

Meanwhile, many people think you should cooperate in a near twin prisoners\u2019 dilemma, but that this is mostly a philosophical issue because near twin prisoners\u2019 dilemmas rarely, if ever, happen in real life.

Susan prefers smoking without cancer to not smoking without cancer, and she prefers smoking with cancer to not smoking with cancer. Should Susan smoke?</p></blockquote><p>Most people agree that Susan should smoke (and this is indeed what CDT recommends). However, <i>prima facie</i>, it seems like EDT would recommend <i>not </i>smoking since that strongly correlates with having cancer, and having cancer and smoking is dispreferred to not having cancer and not smoking.</p><p>This has been forcefully rebutted by e.g. <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/rational-decision-and-causality/A031649124A6F84581818025E60BA024\"><u>Eells (1982, \u00a76-8)</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/evidence-decision-and-causality/7077949D2CD42E99C08D4FBFE5321148\"><u>Ahmed (2014, \u00a74)</u></a>. In short, the choice to smoke is plausibly preceded by a desire (a \u201ctickle\u201d) to do so, and at that point, smoking does not provide additional evidence of cancer. (This is known as \u2018the tickle defense\u2019.)

What now?</h2><p>Even if one isn\u2019t convinced by the arguments against CDT, or the arguments <i>for </i>EDT, one should plausibly have some decision-theoretic uncertainty, i.e., not be completely certain in CDT. <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/MACTEW-2.pdf\"><u>MacAskill et al. (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;then makes the following argument: (i) we should deal with normative uncertainty by \u2018maximizing expected choiceworthiness\u2019; (ii) the stakes are much higher on EDT, due to the existence of correlated decision-makers; and so, (iii) even with a small credence in EDT, one should in practice follow the recommendations of EDT. MacAskill et al. call this the evidentialist\u2019s wager. (See the paper for more details.) This argument could be extended to other decision theories with particularly high stakes. For commentary on this argument taken to its extreme, see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTdv-hUS_gf-Mr4I_h5t5esJWs7bD6nQIPrEbPa5oPwHMv192ow046Xbpsject9ahGfkQK7Ch-cFwh0/pub#h.dvzqcx9nqmb0\"><u>the next section</u></a>.</p><h2>Is this a Pascal\u2019s&nbsp;mugging?</h2><p>In short: We don\u2019t think so. As we explain in the above subsection, neither of ECL\u2019s two core ingredients, \u201cthe world is large\u201d and \u201cnoncausal effects can be action-guiding,\u201d seem all that unlikely to be true.</p><p>In more words: There are a couple of cases in which one might think that ECL is a Pascal\u2019s mugging:</p><p>1) One has very high credence in causal decision theory, and only takes ECL seriously because of the <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/the-evidentialists-wager/\"><u>evidentialist\u2019s wager</u></a>. That is, one believes that one can only influence one\u2019s causal environment, but one acts as though one has acausal influence because there\u2019s a chance that acausal influence is real, and in those worlds, one has much more total influence.</p><p>We think Pascal\u2019s mugging-type objections to lines of reasoning in this reference class are valid, and we share a discomfort with wagering on philosophical worldviews that we think are absurd. However, we do not think very high credence in causal decision theory is justified, which is required for this particular objection to get off the ground.</p><p>2) One thinks one\u2019s acausal influence on other agents is small.</p><p>However, even if one\u2019s acausal influence over individual agents is small, it would still be true that one\u2019s total acausal influence is very large, without relying on wagers. A first reading of what it means to have a small acausal influence over an agent is: We definitely influence the agent\u2019s action, but only by a small amount. Under this reading, influences still add up to a large effect over many agents.</p><p>A second reading is: We have a small probability of acausally influencing a given agent. So, if they only have two choices, like in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, then we only have a small chance of \u201cchanging\u201d their decision. Under this reading, as long as our acausal influences over different agents are somewhat independent, then, given a very large number of agents, we should still have very high confidence that we are influencing a large number of agents. Oesterheld (<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\"><u>2017a, p. 20, fn. 14</u></a>) explains this second reading as follows: \u201cImagine drawing balls out of a box containing 1,000,000 balls. You are told that the probability of drawing a blue ball is only 1/1,000 and that the probabilities of different draws are independent. Given this information, you can tell with a high degree of certainty that there are quite a few blue balls in the box.\u201d</p><p>We think belief in small acausal influence only leads to a Pascal\u2019s mugging if you believe you have a low probability of influencing <i>all</i>&nbsp;agents&nbsp;and a high probability of influencing none of them (i.e., your acausal influences are fully correlated). (Apart from your acausal influence on exact copies, perhaps. But since they share your values, your influence on them doesn\u2019t have any action-relevance anyway.) However, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a likely view unless the belief is a consequence of being very confident in causal decision theory, which we\u2019ve argued against in the previous section.</p><h2>Should we be clueless about our acausal effects?</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/cluelessness\"><u>Complex cluelessness</u></a>&nbsp;is a complicated topic that we aren\u2019t experts on, so you should take what we say with a grain of salt. Nonetheless, here is our current view on the issue. In short: We think that cluelessness&nbsp;is a valid concern in general, but that it isn\u2019t of much greater concern&nbsp;to ECL than it is to other cause areas and interventions.</p><p>Details: The cluelessness&nbsp;objection to ECL might look something like, \u201cOkay, so if the world is large, then there will be lots of things going on in the world that we aren\u2019t aware of,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"12\" data-footnote-id=\"2jn15ghx2d5\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2jn15ghx2d5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2jn15ghx2d5\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and some of these things will be very weird to us. Perhaps we have acausal influence over some of these weird things that we don\u2019t understand and this acausal influence has chaotic effects that could be any magnitude of good or bad. Then, it\u2019s a mistake to not take this&nbsp;into account, because this could sign-flip the value of ECL.\u201d While this is a valid concern, it remains regardless of whether you purposefully participate in ECL or choose to ignore ECL. If you believe the world is large and that acausal influence is (or might be) real, our actions have these unpredictable&nbsp;effects&nbsp;either way, whether we are purposefully focusing on them or only focusing on our predictable,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"13\" data-footnote-id=\"wqy66lzyh4n\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwqy66lzyh4n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwqy66lzyh4n\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;causal effects, e.g. by working on improving farm animal welfare.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"14\" data-footnote-id=\"qcs5wvnt6kn\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqcs5wvnt6kn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqcs5wvnt6kn\">[14]</a></sup></span></p><p>There is another version of the cluelessness objection to ECL that goes like this: \u201cIf the world is large and I have these acausal effects, then I am clueless. In the world where I am clueless, I am paralyzed and don\u2019t know what to do. If the world is not large or I do not have any acausal effects, I am not clueless. I might as well wager on the scenario where I am not clueless and pretend the world is small and void of acausal effects.\u201d This objection does indeed seem specific to ECL&nbsp;and to not necessarily apply to, say, alignment work. The objection comes down to a wager on not having acausal effects. We are personally not very comfortable with this wager and suspect that following the principle to always assume a world where one is not clueless would result in having to make many more uncomfortable wagers.</p><h2>Does <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf\"><u>infinite ethics</u></a>&nbsp;mess with ECL?</h2><p>Infinite ethics seems even more complicated and confusing than acausal effects and complex cluelessness and we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time thinking about it. We will explain our current view on the issue but you should take it with a grain of salt. Our immediate response here is to say that impossibility results&nbsp;(see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CeeeLu9PoDzcaSfsC/on-infinite-ethics%23V__The_impossibility_of_what_we_want\"><u>Carlsmith, 2022, sec.

Therefore, it makes sense to inspect how ECL interacts with infinite ethics issues at least a little more closely. Example: If I gain one dollar, then, in an infinite universe with infinite copies of me, my value system gains infinite dollars, according to standard cardinal arithmetic. But if I were to gain two dollars instead, then, in the same infinite universe with infinite copies, standard cardinal arithmetic says this is no better than before\u2014my value system still gains infinite dollars. This is a bizarre conclusion, and it\u2019s problematic for ECL because it leads to different actions (e.g., defect to gain $1 vs. cooperate to gain $10) being evaluated as equally good.</p><p>No account of infinite ethics is fully satisfactory,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"16\" data-footnote-id=\"eiaggn4znad\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeiaggn4znad\"><sup><a href=\"#fneiaggn4znad\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but some of the (clusters of) accounts\u2014arguably the leading ones\u2014rectify the conclusion here and say I\u2019m better off in the second situation.

In contrast, ECL flows through direct correlation: \u201cIf I do this, I learn that you are more likely to also do this.\u201d For more, see <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2022/12/24/three-reasons-to-cooperate/\"><u>Christiano (2022)</u></a>\u2019s discussion of correlation versus reciprocity&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf%23page%3D89\"><u>Oesterheld, 2017</u></a>, section 6.1.</p><h2>Is ECL basically a multiverse-wide moral trade?</h2><p>If you define an agent\u2019s morality as what that agent values, then, yes (kind of). The major caveat is that we can only do things for our ECL cooperation partners in our own light cone. If they value having ice cream themselves, we can\u2019t help with that. The ECL mechanism\u2014direct correlation\u2014might also further constrain&nbsp;the space of possible trades.</p><p>In addition, we might not naturally describe many of the things other agents value (and that we want to cooperate with them on!) as moral values. For example, if there are agents out there who meet the conditions for trade and who really value there being lots of green triangles in our light cone because they think that\u2019s funny, then ECL compels us to trade with them by making green triangles. One would be stretching things to call this cooperation a moral trade.</p><p>(Note: We are not moral philosophers by training, and it\u2019s possible that some moral philosophers have a different definition of \u201cmoral trade\u201d in mind. The EA Forum Wiki\u2019s definition, which is the one we work with, reads: \u201cMoral trade is the process where individuals or groups with different moral views agree to take actions or exchange resources in order to bring about outcomes which are better from the perspective of everyone involved\u201d (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-trade\"><u>link</u></a>).)</p><h2>Okay, I\u2019ll grant that your toy setups work. But in the real world, we don\u2019t have two neat actions with one labeled \u201ccooperate.\u201d We have lots of different available actions and compromise points. How is that supposed to work?</h2><p>At a high level, we\u2019ll note that it is common practice in science and philosophy to draw conclusions about the real world from toy setups. There are people who object to this practice, for instance, those who claim that game theory tells us nothing about the real world, but our overall stance on the issue is \u201call models are wrong, some are useful.\u201d Our best guess is that the toy models we introduced in our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JGazpLa3Gvvter4JW/cooperating-with-aliens-and-distant-agis-an-ecl-explainer-1\">ECL&nbsp;explainer</a> are at least a little bit useful, and we expect more sophisticated models of acausal interactions to be more useful.</p><p>Nonetheless, the object-level question is still a good one. Uncertainty over what actions count as cooperations, and which cooperation point(s) to pick, is a real challenge to ECL. For instance, different agents\u2019 understanding of the \u201cdefault\u201d/\u201ddo nothing\u201d action might be quite different.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"20\" data-footnote-id=\"n6nh8b0hhxd\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn6nh8b0hhxd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn6nh8b0hhxd\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There is some work that tries to understand how agents might approach finding a cooperation point: see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04879\"><u>this paper</u></a>&nbsp;by Johannes Treutlein and <a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/asymmetric-ecl-with-evidence\"><u>this post</u></a>&nbsp;by Lukas Finnveden. On the other hand, we know of unpublished work that argues that the issue of different agents having different options from each other is severe enough to render ECL irrelevant.</p><p>We believe these issues only dampen the expected value of acting on ECL, by introducing uncertainty or constraining the set of agents we can cooperate with, instead of posing a fundamental problem to the framework. Do they dampen the expected value enough to make ECL irrelevant? Our current best guess is no. The most important reason for our view is that we are optimistic about the following:</p><ul><li>The following action is quite natural and hence salient to many different agents: commit to henceforth doing your best to benefit the aggregate values of the agents you do ECL with.</li><li>Commitment of this type is possible.</li><li>All agents are in a reasonably similar situation to each other when it comes to deciding whether to make this abstract commitment.</li></ul><p>If this is true, then it does not matter that our concrete available actions are extremely different from each other. We can still cooperate by acausally influencing other agents to make this commitment by making this commitment ourselves.</p><h2>You keep talking about \u201cagents\u201d for us to \u201cdo ECL\u201d with\u2026 Who exactly are these agents?</h2><p>The short answer is: Some subset of the naturally evolved civilizations and artificial superintelligences that exist throughout the multiverse. Which subset exactly, though, is complicated and not entirely clear. Fortunately, even if we can only do ECL with a narrow set of agents, it might still be the case that their values are roughly representative of a larger set of agents that it\u2019s easier to draw inferences about (e.g., their values might be representative of all civilizations that arose out of evolutionary processes, plus their digital descendants).</p><p>In the simplest model of how ECL might work, all agents who do ECL cooperate with all other agents who do ECL. If this is the case in reality, then one just needs to figure out what kind(s) of agents tend to do ECL in order to cooperate with these agents and thus participate in the ECL trading commons.</p><p>However, it seems plausible that not everyone who does ECL has acausal influence over everyone else who does ECL:</p><ul><li>For example, maybe there are several different clusters of decision-making processes. Agents might have acausal influence over other agents within their own cluster, but not over agents from other clusters.</li><li>Maybe some agents\u2019&nbsp;epistemic standpoints are too different. For example, if distant superintelligences already know everything about us and our actions, then perhaps from their perspective our actions are already fixed, and so there is nothing left for them to (acausally) influence. See Finnveden (<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/when-does-edt-seek-evidence-about\"><u>2023</u></a>)&nbsp;for more detail on when and why knowledge like this might destroy acausal influence.</li><li>Updatelessness&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://casparoesterheld.com/2016/11/21/thoughts-on-updatelessness/\"><u>Oesterheld, 2016</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g8HHKaWENEbqh2mgK/updatelessness-doesn-t-solve-most-problems-1%23What_is_Updatelessness_\"><u>Soto, 2024</u></a>) might help with this issue. We expect that anyone who wants to work on ECL will likely have to grapple somewhat with updatelessness or, alternatively, when to stop learning more about other civilizations.</li></ul><p>Consequently, agents who do ECL might only be able to cooperate with a subset of the other agents who do ECL. If this is the case, then one needs to figure out what kind(s) of agents tend to do ECL <i>and</i>&nbsp;are similar enough to oneself in terms of decision-making and information.</p><p>As a final complication, not everyone we have acausal influence over necessarily has acausal influence over us. If Alice acausally influences Bob, and Bob acausally influences Charlie, and Charlie acausally influences Alice, should Alice try to benefit Bob\u2019s values or Charlie\u2019s values? Working from one of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JGazpLa3Gvvter4JW/cooperating-with-aliens-and-distant-agis-an-ecl-explainer-1#Acausal_influence_on_agents_with_other_values\"><u>toy models</u></a>&nbsp;in our ECL explainer, we currently believe she should try to benefit Charlie\u2019s values. Finnveden (<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/when-does-edt-seek-evidence-about\"><u>2023</u></a>) makes a related argument.</p><p>In practice, we recommend punting figuring out these details to the future. Humans now should focus on actions that are cooperative with a broad set of agents\u2014i.e., actions that likely benefit the agents we can do ECL with without taking too much away from realizing our own values. At least, this is our best guess as to the present implications of ECL, given our present level of uncertainty. Examples of cooperative actions: making AGIs be cooperative (whether they be aligned or misaligned, and insofar as we build AGI at all); taking a more pluralistic stance towards morality than we otherwise would.</p><h2>Is ECL action-relevant? Time-sensitive?</h2><p>We believe ECL is <strong>action-relevant</strong>. We&nbsp;refer readers to Lukas Finnveden\u2019s&nbsp;recent \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WYsLjeJzh7tZqe6Lo/implications-of-evidential-cooperation-in-large-worlds\"><u>Implications of evidential cooperation in large worlds</u></a>\u201d. We currently think the most important implication is that we should weight making (aligned or unaligned) AI systems cooperative and preserving our decision theoretical attitudes into the future more heavily.&nbsp;The most straightforward way to do so would be to ensure earth-originating AI systems engage in ECL.</p><p>Note that having our AI systems engage in ECL this is not simply punting ECL into the future: In our opinion, working on increasing the chance that future AI systems engage in ECL is itself a cooperative action. Doing so puts us in the reference class of \u201ccivilizations that (genuinely) try to act cooperatively in the ECL sense\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"21\" data-footnote-id=\"26amuh7vdd8\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref26amuh7vdd8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn26amuh7vdd8\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This increases our expectation that other civilisations benefit us similarly, for example, by also increasing the chance that their AGI acts cooperatively towards&nbsp;our value system.</p><p>The argument for <strong>time-sensitivity</strong>&nbsp;is that we might be able to increase the chance of future AI systems doing ECL in worlds where we cannot do so later, either because we build a misaligned AGI, or because the humans who end up in charge of an intent aligned AGI do not want their AGI to consider ECL, or because we manage to align an AI system\u2019s values with ours but without guarding against grave epistemic errors from the distributional shift to thinking about ECL.&nbsp;This is most plausible on worldviews where views on decision theory, acausal influence, etc., are not convergent, i.e. it is not the case that future civilisations will arrive at the same conclusions about ECL regardless of what we do. We might also have to lock in some commitments early to reap the full benefits from ECL, e.g. commit to doing ECL earlier rather than later because our acausal influence might decrease over time\u2014the argument here is similar to the argument for updatelessness.</p><p>That said, there are also potential downsides to working on making AI engage in ECL. In particular, it might trade off with the probability of alignment success. It\u2019s also contested for other reasons. Discussing the case for and against trying to increase the likelihood of future AI systems engaging in ECL is beyond the scope of this post.</p><h2>How big a deal are the implications of ECL? How much does it change the impact of my actions?</h2><p>This certainly deserves more investigation and its own detailed report. Unfortunately, we do not have anything like that yet. But here are a couple of things to note:</p><ul><li>Lukas Finnveden (<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/how-ecl-changes-the-value-of-interventions\"><u>2023</u></a>) estimates that ECL <i>increases</i>&nbsp;the case for working on AI systems that benefit other value systems by 1.5x\u201310x.<ul><li>Note that this estimate does not include an estimate of the total value of this kind of work. Additionally, there is no comparison here to alignment work.</li></ul></li><li>Paul Christiano says (paraphrased from two emails; all direct quotes but rearranged and in bullet point form for readability):<ul><li>\u201cI think that ECL or similar arguments may give us strong reasons to be generous to some other agents and value systems, especially other agents who do ECL (or something like that). I think this lines up with some more common-sensical criterion, like: it's better to be nice to people who would have been nice to you if your situations had been reversed. I think that these may be large considerations.</li><li>If I had to guess, I think that figuring out what ECL recommends and then building an appropriate kind of AI might be 20%&nbsp;as good as building an aligned AI in expectation (with a reasonable chance of being close to 0% or 100%, but 20% as a wild guess of an average). &nbsp;[Later addendum by Paul: 20% seems too low.]</li><li>There are other ways the ECL stuff can add value on top of alignment.</li><li>It's unclear if it's tractable without just being able to align our AI (and this would be harder to get buy-in from the broader world). But we haven't studied it much and there are some obvious approaches that might work, so maybe I'd wildly guess that it's 20% as tractable as alignment. [Later addendum by Paul: 20% seems too low]</li><li>So, [if I had to make up a number right now,] I'd guess that \"Figuring out what ECL recommends, how seriously we take that recommendation, and whether it's tractable to work on\" is 5-10% of the value of alignment.&nbsp;[...] By \"tractable to work on\" I meant actually getting it implemented. [...T]o clarify what the ratio [5-10%] means: I was imagining that an angel comes down and tells us all the ECL-relevant answers, and comparing that to how good it would be if an angel comes down and tells us all the alignment-relevant answers.</li></ul></li><li>Caspar Oesterheld, author of <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\"><u>ECL\u2019s seminal paper</u></a>, estimates that him acting&nbsp;on ECL is roughly as valuable for his values as him not acting on ECL and multiplying his resources (and, by necessary extension, the resources of agents with his values that he has strong acausal influence over) by 1.5 to 5 times. (From conversation.)<ul><li>In other words, Caspar thinks you should be indifferent between:</li><li>A universe in which \u201cyour reference class\u201d (i.e. agents that find themselves in a similar decision situation as you, but don\u2019t necessarily share your values) acts on ECL, and</li><li>A universe in which your reference class doesn't act on ECL, but agents in your reference class that share your values get their resources 1.5\u20135x\u2019ed.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>We are grateful to Caspar Oesterheld, Sylvester Kollin, Daniel Kokotajlo, Akash Wasil, Anthony DiGiovanni, Emery Cooper, and Tristan Cook for helpful feedback on an earlier version of this post.

Another complication is that the other agent\u2019s understanding and our understanding of \u201cdo nothing\u201d might be quite different. For example, maybe they have the option to pay $1 and us getting $10 (cooperate), to keep $1 and give us $1 at no cost to them (meaning both of us have $1 in the end), and to keep $1 without affecting our payoff. We might think the default \u201cdo nothing, don\u2019t cooperate\u201d action is for them to keep $1 and give us $1 at no cost. They might think the default \u201cdo nothing, don\u2019t cooperate\u201d action is for them to keep $1. This means we might be considering the decision from different starting positions, which might lead us to have very different ideas of what actions are equivalent to each other.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"21\" data-footnote-id=\"26amuh7vdd8\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn26amuh7vdd8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"26amuh7vdd8\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref26amuh7vdd8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;The \u201cgenuinely\u201d bit is needed because if we only superficially tried to get our advanced AI systems to do ECL, then, according to evidential decision theory, this is evidence that other civilizations like us will also only superficially try to do ECL.</p><p>Separately, it\u2019s not as black-and-white as there being one reference class for civilizations that tried to do ECL.

Putting this together with the previous discussion, we arrive at the following key claim:</p><p>We plausibly want to adopt the following policy: <strong>Whenever we can benefit the values of relevant other agents in the multiverse\u2014to a first approximation, agents that also engage in ECL</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"ifd0wepqo9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefifd0wepqo9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnifd0wepqo9\">[5]</a></sup></span><strong>\u2014more efficiently than we can benefit our own values, we should do so.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"g6zw9efxw9h\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg6zw9efxw9h\"><sup><a href=\"#fng6zw9efxw9h\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is because everyone adopting this policy would make us better off. Hence, if we acausally influence many agents to adopt this policy and enough of these agents would otherwise do something worse from our perspective, then we are better off.</p><p>The main practical implication: <strong>it may be important to build AGI systems to be cooperative</strong> <strong>towards other value systems </strong>(insofar as we build AGI at all),<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"kvmzrpz3yx\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkvmzrpz3yx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkvmzrpz3yx\">[7]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;whether they are aligned or misaligned</strong>. Another way of framing this is that we want future earth-originating AI systems to be <i>good citizens of acausal society</i>. Doing so plausibly benefits many agents with values different from ours. So, even if we can\u2019t tell exactly who else is engaging in ECL, or what their individual&nbsp;values are, this intervention has a good chance of benefiting them. Other agents engaging in acausal cooperation might do the same, or take another action that they expect to be broadly good for values different to theirs, and so some of these agents will aid our values.</p><p>A toy model to quantitatively illustrate when cooperation is beneficial:</p><ul><li>Let\u2019s say there are 1,000,000 agents.</li><li>10,000 (i.e., 1%) of these agents (including you) have the exact same values as you (e.g. utopia maximization), while 990,000 of the agents have values that are neutral from your perspective (e.g., paperclip maximization).</li><li>Each agent faces the same decision and has exactly two choices:</li><li>They can either generate an amount of what they value that\u2019s equivalent to $1.

This section is concerned with the question: <strong>If we act cooperatively towards other agents, are they actually more likely to reciprocate?</strong></p><p>We have already argued the basic case for considering acausal influence in our \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JGazpLa3Gvvter4JW/cooperating-with-aliens-and-distant-agis-an-ecl-explainer-1#The_twin_prisoners__dilemma\"><u>Twin prisoners\u2019 dilemma</u></a>\u201d section. The basic argument for thinking we can acausally influence agents with other values to benefit us is simple: We are faced with the decision of either trying to benefit other agents, or causally optimizing for our own values. Meanwhile, other agents face the same decision, and make decisions similarly to us. Because of this, our decision acausally influences them towards doing the same thing as us&nbsp;(i.e., benefiting other values, or causally optimizing for one\u2019s own). Hence, if we try to benefit them, they will try to benefit us.</p><p>This argument has a few gaps:</p><ul><li>Why do we expect these agents to make decisions in a similar way to us?</li><li>In reality, there are no actions neatly labeled \u201cbenefit others\u201d or \u201coptimize for yourself.\u201d We just have a bunch of options for things we could do and other agents might have very different options. If I write an ECL explainer arguing that we should be more cooperative, and an agent in another part of the universe changes their AI training run to include more diverse perspectives on morality, this might be mutually beneficial, but it\u2019s unclear to what extent we can be described as \u201ctwo similar agents taking the same decision in similar situations.\u201d</li><li>Even if we try to benefit some agent, how do we know we are acausally influencing that agent to try to benefit exactly us? What if we benefit one agent who ends up benefiting a third agent?</li></ul><p>To sketch an argument for why other agents might make decisions about ECL in a similar way to us: We think it\u2019s likely that agents reason in ways that are somewhat convergent. Through a realist lens\u2014i.e., assuming there is a unique way of reasoning that is objectively rational\u2014one would expect reasoning to converge to what is \u201ccorrect\u201d. From an antirealist perspective, we expect some convergence to what \u201cwins\u201d\u2014i.e., successful agents tend to reason in similarly effective ways.&nbsp;We expect reasoning that outputs \u201ccooperate\u201d in the twin prisoners\u2019 dilemma, and which generalizes from there, to occur at some frequency. We further expect that some agents who reason in this way will think about the implications&nbsp;and discover something in the ballpark of ECL. This leads us to believe that we are able to acausally influence some agents\u2019 ECL-inspired actions through our own ECL-inspired actions. Note that this line of reasoning is contested. A <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRNu6BnNX-heFoPkjTyWC4oWqiPzB7YtNIp_yVlrEMQj-IjWqTAC5BLaDciLf9HK7Xqaa9wF4bsdTw5/pub#h.jv34cm1gwxg\"><u>later section</u></a>&nbsp;will touch on the potential fragility of acausal influence. (For adjacent work, see <a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/are-our-actions-evidence-for-ai-decisions\"><u>Finnveden, 2023</u></a>.)</p><p>To address the latter two concerns (firstly, that different agents face different situations with no \u201ccooperate\u201d label; secondly, that there\u2019s no guarantee other agents will benefit us specifically), we will look at a toy example in which agents face different decisions from each other, and cannot mutually benefit each other. We have three agents, A, B, and C:</p><ul><li>Agent A can get $1 by doing nothing, or increase agent B\u2019s payoff by $4 by clapping her hands.</li><li>Agent B can get $1 by doing nothing, or increase agent C\u2019s payoff by $5 by whirring her antenna.</li><li>Agent C can get $2 by doing nothing, or increase agent A\u2019s payoff by $7 by stamping her wheel.</li></ul><p>The agents have common knowledge of the situation and of having very similar decision-making processes to each other. (For instance, maybe they each know that all three of them are copies of GPT-N that received a nearly identical prompt, with the only difference in the prompt being&nbsp;the part where they are told which of the three agents they are.)</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JGazpLa3Gvvter4JW/kb5s7rdxwc6iphlnl12h\"></p><p>What should agent A do to maximize her payoff in this situation? We propose that she should reason as follows: \u201cInstead of framing my decision as picking between doing nothing and clapping my hands, I can frame my decision as keeping money or giving money. I would do the same reframing if I were in the other agents\u2019 position, so they are probably also framing their decision as keeping or giving money. I now find myself in the same position as agent C:</p><ul><li>Me not doing anything is keeping money, which is equivalent to agent C keeping money by not doing anything. Let\u2019s call this action defecting.</li><li>Me clapping my hands is giving money, which is equivalent to C giving money by stamping her wheel. Let\u2019s call this action cooperating.</li><li>I stand in the same relationship to C as C does to B. I know that C makes decisions similarly to me, and that C knows that they make decisions similarly to B.</li><li>Hence, if I cooperate, C is likely to also cooperate. If I defect, C is likely to defect.</li><li>Since I gain only $1 if I and C defect, and $7 if I and C cooperate, I should cooperate.\u201d</li></ul><p>The first thing we can see is that even in a situation where we cannot mutually affect each other\u2019s payoffs, we can still acausally influence another agent towards trying to benefit us by trying to benefit some <i>third</i>&nbsp;agent ourselves. There can be cyclic arrangements like this with many more than three agents\u2014the logic remains the same. We do not need to worry about finding the exact agent who can benefit&nbsp;us: If we generally benefit agents&nbsp;that are like us, we are more likely to be benefitted in turn. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\"><u>Oesterheld, 2017</u></a>, section 2.9.)</p><p>Secondly, acausal influence is not limited to situations where we have the exact same set of actions available as another agent. As in the three-agent example, we can apply the concept of reframing our decision to something more abstract such that many other agents can be said to face the same abstract decision as us. In particular, we can think of ourselves as facing one big abstract decision: <strong>Do we want to commit ourselves to acting cooperatively towards other agents who do ECL?</strong>&nbsp;If other agents frame things similarly, we and they find ourselves in similar situations. And <strong>if we both make such a commitment, it does not matter that the specifics of our downstream decisions look different. </strong>Therefore, even if the actions available to us humans are very different from the actions available to those we want to acausally cooperate with, we still have reason to believe that deciding to act cooperatively towards them&nbsp;will acausally influence them to act in kind. (For more on this, see <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\"><u>Oesterheld, 2017</u></a>, section 2.8.2. Oesterheld argues that agents who acausally cooperate should optimize for a compromise utility function.

This section is concerned with the following question: If we and the other agents cooperate, do we actually gain in expectation?</i></p><p>To answer this, we need to assess three important ingredients. Firstly, how much do we gain from one agent with other values benefitting us compared to our causal opportunity cost when we benefit them? This is the <i><strong>size of the potential gains</strong></i>&nbsp;from cooperation. In the initial prisoner\u2019s dilemma we presented, the gains from cooperation would be represented in the payoff matrix. There are a few overlapping reasons for potentially high gains:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"26\" data-footnote-id=\"x59nkgw81s\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx59nkgw81s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx59nkgw81s\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<i>diminishing marginal returns within but not across light cones, comparative advantage</i>, <i>and combinability</i>. These reasons mirror the reasons for why causal cooperation among humans is beneficial; we will not expand on them here. See the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/everett-branches-inter-light-cone-trade-and-other-alien#3__Size_of_potential_gains_from_cooperation_across_light_cones\"><u>appendix</u></a>&nbsp;for more.</p><p>Secondly, <i><strong>competence at cooperating</strong></i>. That is, how successful do we expect agents to be at benefiting each other? It is no use influencing others towards aiding you if they are incompetent at doing so. An important obstacle here is <i>knowing what other agents value</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"27\" data-footnote-id=\"6f040exsyqa\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6f040exsyqa\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6f040exsyqa\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;To figure out how good the average agent is at knowing how to benefit others, we can think about how good <i>we</i>&nbsp;are at this, and extrapolate. While it seems near-impossible for current humans to reason out the exact values of some alien civilization, we can make fairly confident broad guesses such as \u201cagents who think about ECL tend to value having more rather than fewer resources, so they would prefer more opportunities for trade.\u201d On this account, some ECL researchers strongly favor making future AI systems more cooperative. We think that much better educated guesses could be made in the future, after:</p><ul><li>gaining information, for example by encountering aliens in our light cone and extrapolating from them;</li><li>becoming smarter, for example by developing advanced artificial intelligence; or</li><li>by simply thinking more about known considerations\u2014for example, we could think about which kinds of values evolution or gradient descent select for, or what types of agents will tend to have lots of resources and an interest in ECL-like trade.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"28\" data-footnote-id=\"pt088rurydk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpt088rurydk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpt088rurydk\">[28]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Overall, we expect that agents will be fairly competent at cooperating.</p><p>The third ingredient: <i><strong>the right kind of acausal influence</strong></i>. For ECL to recommend cooperation, it must be the case that our cooperation acausally influences agents to benefit us more than it influences agents to take actions that are <i>worse</i>&nbsp;for us. By and large, the acausal costs (benefits) of our actions will come from us acausally influencing agents with our (different) values to cooperate instead of defect. Note that we have <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JGazpLa3Gvvter4JW/cooperating-with-aliens-and-distant-agis-an-ecl-explainer-1#Our_situation_as_a_generalized_twin_prisoners__dilemma_type_situation\"><u>already established</u></a>&nbsp;that the absolute level of acausal influence we have over other agents does not matter if the population of agents is sufficiently large, so we can exclusively focus on the ratio of our respective acausal influences.</p><p>The size of this ratio is highly contested. We don\u2019t take a stance in this document on what range of ratios is plausible. The personal view of one of the authors, Chi, is that we have enough acausal influence over agents with different values that the ratio is above the critical ratio. (Below which doing ECL would not be worth it.) This seems like a worthwhile topic of investigation and a large source of uncertainty about whether ECL is action-relevant. For more details, see the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/everett-branches-inter-light-cone-trade-and-other-alien#4_2_Harm_through_opportunity_cost\"><u>appendix</u></a>.</p><h1>Putting it all together</h1><p>We have discussed the idea of acausal influence, and from there, how we might want to engage in multiverse-wide cooperation with aliens and distant AGIs.&nbsp;To conclude with something poetic, we excerpt from Richard Ngo\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5Szy3gfchXkRBEmF5/a-sketch-of-acausal-trade-in-practice\"><u>reflection</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>We\u2019ve seen a [lot] of trends in the evolution of human values\u2014e.g. they\u2019ve become more individualistic, more cosmopolitan, and so on, over time. Imagine that trends like these are actually strong enough that, in the future, after studying psychology and sociology and other related topics very deeply, we realize that there were only ever a handful of realistic outcomes for what society\u2019s values would look like once it spread to an intergalactic scale. As a toy example, imagine that the only two plausible attractors were:</i></p><ul><li><i>A society which prioritized individual happiness above all else\u2014which meant that the people in it were often very solitary and disengaged from others around them.</i></li><li><i>A society which prioritized meaningful relationships above all else\u2014which meant that people often underwent significant suffering for the sake of love.</i></li></ul><p><i>Imagine now that you\u2019re running one of those societies. And you think to yourself: right now I\u2019m only optimizing for people being happy, but I could easily optimize for people being happy and having meaningful relationships, in a way which wouldn\u2019t reduce their happiness much. I\u2019m not going to do it, because I care much more about happiness. But if I encountered the leader of a world that cared only about relationships, and they offered me a deal where we both spent 10% of our time optimizing for the others\u2019 values, then that\u2019d be a great deal for both of us.</i></p></blockquote><h1>How to get involved</h1><h2>Short-term research fellowships</h2><p>There are a few different research programs that might be open towards ECL-inspired work, either conceptual or technical.

(Mostly for ML or conceptual research, but perhaps also for other projects, e.g., posts like this one or running events.)&nbsp;Get in touch with me&nbsp;(linhchismail [] gmail [] com)&nbsp;if you are potentially interested. I might also be able to connect you to others in ECL, recommend programs, or find other ways of helping you. If you do reach out, it would be helpful if your email includes one or two&nbsp;concrete questions, curiosities, objections, research angles, or details on the kinds of work or other opportunities you\u2019d be open to. I probably won\u2019t have much more useful to say than what is written here if you just say you are interested in ECL and wonder how to get involved.

Total acausal influence&nbsp;vs. relevant acausal influence</h1><p>Our ECL explainer touches on an argument for thinking that you can only leverage a small fraction of your total acausal influence over other agents. The argument, in more detail, goes as follows:</p><p>We can only leverage our acausal influence by <i>thinking</i>&nbsp;about acausal influence and concluding what conclusions it favors. Otherwise, we just do whatever we would have done in the absence of considering acausal influence. Even if it is in fact the case that, for example, my donating money out of kindness acausally&nbsp;influences others to do the same, I cannot make use of this fact (about my donating acausal influencing others to the same) without being aware of acausal influence and reasoning about how my donating will acausally&nbsp;influence others to do the same.</p><p>We established, in our explainer, that your acausal influence on another agent\u2019s decision comes from the <i>similarity</i>&nbsp;between your decision-making and their decision-making. However, as soon as you base your decision on acausal reasoning, your decision-making diverges from that of agents who don\u2019t consider acausal reasoning. In particular, even if it is the case that most of your decision-making is the same, the part of your decision-making that involves acausal reasoning can plausibly only influence the part of the other agent\u2019s decision-making that involves acausal reasoning. <strong>This means that one is limited to only acausally&nbsp;cooperating with other agents who take acausal influence seriously.</strong>&nbsp;More broadly, one\u2019s total acausal influence on another agent\u2019s decision might be different from one\u2019s <i>relevant</i>&nbsp;acausal influence on them\u2014that is, the part one can strategically use to further one\u2019s goals/values.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/mkaesfop0kbqhe8r6y2e\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/fwjcvgboef4eslol8zdy 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/i83qgj1lgusugeahmm0s 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/a96qgnu5dfbq6aanqtfq 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/rtfvqhblaovnqhysk1id 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/kocx8na4t6cn1ipru7e5 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/cvb99xsrbjry5blopm8q 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/fa3xbw6iorpct0ghzvd0 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/reqz4yh6mf12idqj24na 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/kitprpbxqx88perfvy1w 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/idzy6mh63xzytkxc302n 1480w\"></figure><h1>2.

There are a few reasons to think that there are gains to be had from mutual cooperation (assuming perfect cooperation between two agents) compared to everyone just optimizing for their own values. These are: <i>diminishing marginal returns within but not across light cones</i>, <i>comparative advantage</i>, and <i>combinability</i>. (Note that these reasons/categories overlap somewhat.)</p><h2>3.1 Diminishing marginal returns (in utility) within vs. across light cones</h2><p>By their nature, some values imply lower marginal utility from having more resources invested into them in their \u201chome\u201d light cone compared to in another light cone.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgg52blv64u\"><sup><a href=\"#fngg52blv64u\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For example, if some agent values preservation\u2014preservation of culture, say, or biodiversity\u2014then most of what they care about within their light cone might already be preserved without them spending all their resources.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz0hyucv1pui\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz0hyucv1pui\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Another example: suffering reduction. An agent who cares about suffering reduction might manage to eradicate most suffering in their light cone and still have resources to spare.</p><p>It seems plausible that the first unit of resource in each light cone invested towards these kinds of values helps a lot, with the second unit helping less, and so on. For instance, there is probably low-hanging fruit&nbsp;for significantly reducing suffering or preserving most species, but reducing suffering all the way to zero, or preserving every last species, are likely difficult tasks. If agents with these kinds of values exist in the universe/multiverse, then everyone can gain from cooperating with them, and they also gain from cooperation. Everyone can invest a little of their resources towards these kinds of values (to pick the low-hanging fruit), and in exchange, agents with these values put some\u2014perhaps most\u2014of their resources towards benefitting other values.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/oonneo9chwyrg0ciy9q7\"></p><h2>3.2 Comparative advantage</h2><p>One has a comparative advantage at producing A instead of B, compared to some other agent, if the amount of resources one needs to produce A, relative to B, is smaller than the amount of resources the other agent needs to produce A, relative to B. Suppose that I value A, and another agent values B, but I have a comparative advantage over them at producing B (and they have a comparative advantage over me at producing A). In this case, we are both better off if we each optimize for the other agent\u2019s values instead of our own. There are a few reasons to expect comparative advantages in the multiverse context:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn7ftf13ly8p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn7ftf13ly8p\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Different physical conditions</strong>.

Different agents might have different numbers and different types of neighbors (aka aliens) in their respective light cones. These factors determine some of the opportunities\u2014i.e., possible cooperative actions\u2014available to any given ECL participant (, especially so if their neighbors are not ECL participants.) For example, an agent in a densely populated and conflict-prone locale is probably well placed to promote peace or preserve cultural diversity.

Many other differences could create comparative advantages. For example, location in time. An agent at the cusp of developing AGI has very different opportunities than an agent close to the heat death of their universe. Even among agents who face similar physical and temporal conditions, there might still be important differences. For instance, the relative ease of building an intent aligned AGI versus building an AGI that engages in ECL.</p><p>Contrary to the above, there is an argument against comparative advantages contributing much to gains from trade. Namely, agents might systematically have a comparative advantage at realizing their own values because their environment shaped their values. This being said, we still expect comparative advantages to be a significant reason for gains from cooperation.</p><h2>3.3 Combinability</h2><p>Many values might be easily <i>combinable</i>&nbsp;such that jointly optimizing for them is more efficient than optimizing for them separately. Let\u2019s say, for example, that I can either spend $1 to generate 1 unit of value for me, or $1 to generate 1 unit of value for another agent. Our values are combinable if I can instead spend $1 to generate something where our combined valuation is &gt;1 unit, for example by generating 0.75 units of value for both of us.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhm0nsv7klda\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhm0nsv7klda\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/wdbaphqlvc1odxhadfg2\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/jhmsijnxggs4fue0qgly 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/yle0qdfpt1z40cpswyr0 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/whwdasv8kkjkrp3g9zrd 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/uloqmgnpmni2ezaeqoeo 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/dg0ijs7mcjvjxfrebgoo 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/plfd9venozacebuhvfz2 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/puxkayrwzynfiq57whgd 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/oeyyahzuiwipnpaseqoq 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/hyqwnjco70gvfjmlwn3f 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/lb0tcrdpixaznhqs1ial 1518w\"></figure><p>Combining values works particularly well if we have <strong>partially overlapping or partially opposed values</strong>. In the multiversal context, where direct competition is unlikely, the practical implication is that we can focus more on promoting shared values instead of advocating for values that are more likely contested, such as the precise trade-off between happiness and suffering.</p><p><strong>Non-overlapping values</strong>&nbsp;can also be combinable.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Let\u2019s say that I only value minds that experience athletic achievement, and some other agent only values minds that experience friendship. We are each neutral about a mind that does not experience athletic achievement or friendship, respectively. If together we create two minds that experience both achievement and friendship at the same time, for example, minds that experience winning a team sport with their closest friends, then we plausibly create more [experience of athletic achievement + experience of friendship] per resource invested than if we each created&nbsp;a mind fully optimized for the one type of experience we care about. In this way, both agents benefit from cooperating.</p><p>There are values that we <strong>cannot combine</strong>&nbsp;to make their pursuit more efficient.

(We cover this issue of partners potentially not knowing how to benefit each other in our main post, here. Our tentative bottom line is that agents will be fairly competent at cooperating.) We don\u2019t have a conclusive view as to the exact magnitude&nbsp;of these potential gains. This could be a worthwhile research direction: a better idea of the magnitude of cooperation gains would help us figure out how much to prioritize ECL.</p><h1>4. Acausally influencing agents to harm us</h1><p>(This appendix section follows on from the \u201cRight kind of acausal influence\u201d paragraph within the \u201cNet gains from cooperation\u201d section&nbsp;of our explainer post.)</p><h2>4.1 Direct harm</h2><p>If we cooperate, how many agents with different values from us do we acausally&nbsp;influence toward harming us, as compared to benefitting us (the intended effect)?</p><p>There are two chief ways in which we could have this unintended effect of influencing agents to harm us if we cooperate. Firstly, our acausal influence on them (i.e., whatever action we take, they take the opposite action). Secondly, we could acausally&nbsp;influence agents towards cooperating with other agents who have opposite values to us.</p><p>The first scenario seems quite implausible, and so we expect negative acausal influence to be rare. For a more in-depth discussion, see <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\"><u>Oesterheld (2017a, section 2.6.2)</u></a>.</p><p>For the second scenario, one might, at first glance, ask oneself the following general question, and to expect its answer to fully address the concern: Is it generally good, or generally bad, if more acausal cooperation happens in the world, from the perspective of our values? The problem with this question, however, is that <i>even if the answer is \u201cgenerally bad,\u201d</i>&nbsp;this does not necessarily mean we should not take part in acausal cooperation.&nbsp;The naive argument against cooperating in the \u201cgenerally bad\u201d scenario goes as follows: \u201cI think more acausal cooperation happening in the world is bad from the perspective of my values. Therefore, I should not acausally&nbsp;cooperate, since doing so should acausally&nbsp;influence other agents to not cooperate.\u201d</p><p>The problem is that we probably don\u2019t generally influence other agents to not cooperate if we don\u2019t cooperate, because the situation is not symmetric. For some value systems, more acausal cooperation happening in the world is generally good. So, if our policy is \u201cengage in acausal cooperation if more acausal cooperation happening in the world is generally good, from the perspective of our values; otherwise, don\u2019t,\u201d then agents whose decision-making is very similar to ours will employ a similar policy. In considering the question of whether more acausal cooperation happening in the world is generally good, we acausally&nbsp;influence those other agents to also consider the question. However, this would not lead to everyone acausally&nbsp;cooperating less (or more). Instead, those for whose values acausal cooperation is good, engage in cooperation. Those for whose values acausal cooperation is bad, do not engage in cooperation.</p><p>Now, imagine again that acausal cooperation is bad for our values. Presumably, this is the case because it is bad for us if certain other agents, for example those with opposite values to us, participate in acausal cooperation and hence better realize their values (which are opposed to ours). However, if they have opposite values to us, it cannot be the case that cooperation is bad for us <i>and</i>&nbsp;bad for them. Hence, they would continue engaging in acausal cooperation even while we refrain. Therefore, we would end up in a situation where we incur the same cost\u2014agents with opposite values from us cooperating and thus getting more of their values realized across the multiverse\u2014and get none of the benefit from cooperating ourselves.</p><p>Hence, we must consider the question, \u201cIs it generally good if more acausal cooperation happens, or generally bad?\u201d, from a perspective that is <i>not</i>&nbsp;partial to our particular values. We need to evaluate the question from some other standpoint\u2014for example, our best guess for the distribution of values across the multiverse. Aside from the fact that it would be quite surprising if acausal cooperation turns out to be bad from that standpoint, choosing to <i>not</i>&nbsp;engage in cooperation if it really is net bad&nbsp;would be<i>&nbsp;in and of itself cooperative</i>, because this choice benefits the aggregate of agents in the world.</p><p>The above logic leads us to not be very concerned about direct harm through acausal influence.</p><h2>4.2 Harm through opportunity cost</h2><p>Lastly, we turn towards the <strong>acausal opportunity cost</strong>&nbsp;of us trying to benefit agents with other values. In our main post\u2019s toy model, the acausal cost of us cooperating was that we influenced agents with the same values as us to <i>also</i>&nbsp;act cooperatively instead of causally optimizing for their own (and hence our own) values. More generally, we need to consider the following:</p><ul><li>How high is the (opportunity) cost each agent with our values pays if they cooperate, relative to the benefit they gain when an agent with different values cooperates?</li><li>This is addressed in the \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/everett-branches-inter-light-cone-trade-and-other-alien#3__Size_of_potential_gains_from_cooperation_across_light_cones\"><u>Size of potential gains</u></a>\u201d section of this appendix.</li><li>How strong is our acausal influence over agents with our values versus agents with different values?</li><li>We address this below.</li></ul><p>Note: for simplicity, we will continue assuming that agents either have exactly our values or values that&nbsp;are neutral from our perspective.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp6o5xibcnkf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp6o5xibcnkf\">[15]</a></sup></span></p><p>There are two closely related reasons for why our acausal influence on agents with our values might be much higher than on agents with different values, so as to render ECL action-irrelevant. Firstly, you might think that acausal influence&nbsp;is fragile, such that the only agents you have influence over are close copies of yourself.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxntjv1uer8f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxntjv1uer8f\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;People with this opinion might think that acausal influence drops off sharply going from \u201cexact copies\u201d to \u201cagents who endorse the same decision theory but who are in slightly different situations\u201d or \u201cagents who endorse the same decision theory but are in different moods that bias their reasoning one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Secondly, you might think that while you do have acausal influence over agents who are quite different from you, you systematically have much higher acausal influence over agents who share your values. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9prioPT5vFi3uA8Pi/everett-branches-inter-light-cone-trade-and-other-alien#1__Total_acausal_influence_vs__relevant_acausal_influence\">Relevant acausal influence</a>&nbsp;flows through similarity in the way decisions are made, and an agent\u2019s decision-making might be heavily shaped by factors that also shape their values. (Alternatively, values and decision-making might directly heavily shape each other.) Typically, this view is paired with a fragile conception of acausal influence (i.e., the first reason).</p><p>On the other hand, some people think it\u2019s sufficient for two agents to follow the same formal decision theory to establish significant acausal influence. If this is the case, observing that humans with different values seem to share views on decision theory would be enough to establish significant acausal influence on agents with different values. See for example Oesterheld (<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\"><u>2017a, section 2.6.1</u></a>). Typically, this view is paired with thinking that acausal influence is fairly commonplace. As discussed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RsJ9cW3UeFUtyHnz5b9F3mnUa8avZANGezpNAQY9LY8/edit%23heading%3Dh.jaz7567wlojj\"><u>in our main post</u></a>, one reason to think this is that the different details in two agents\u2019 situations might not matter given that they both face the same abstract decision: whether to commit to a policy of cooperation.</p><p>How high the ratio of acausal influences can be for ECL to still be action-relevant\u2014i.e., to still recommend \u201ccooperate\u201d\u2014depends on how many agents with our values vs. other values there are, and how much agents can benefit those with other values (compared to how much they can benefit themselves). To illustrate: In our main post\u2019s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RsJ9cW3UeFUtyHnz5b9F3mnUa8avZANGezpNAQY9LY8/edit%23heading%3Dh.cneav79pvvzh\"><u>model</u></a>, our acausal influence over agents who share our values is twice as strong as that over our agents with different values, and the economic value produced by cooperating is three times higher than that produced by defecting. Therefore, cooperation results in a ~1.5x higher payoff than defection. (The numbers in our model are just toy numbers to illustrate how different parameters influence what we should do! They do not reflect real guesses.)</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnoedcjh7khsp\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefoedcjh7khsp\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/413/1/L91/1747653\"><u>Vardanyan, Trotta and Silk (2011)</u></a>&nbsp;find, with 99% probability, that the full universe is at least 251 times larger than the observable universe, and also find, with 95% probability, that the full universe is at least 1000 times larger than the observable universe.

In this post, I've picked out my favorites. If you're thinking about reading his work, this list could be a good place to start. Note that this is based on what I personally find interesting; it is not a definitive guide. These are listed in no particular order.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/dissolving-confusion-about-consciousness/\"><u>Dissolving Confusion about Consciousness</u></a></h1><p>Consciousness is a \u201ccluster in thingspace\u201d comprising physical systems that we consider to be similar in some way. It is a label for systems, not an essence within systems. Also, like defining \u201ctables\u201d, defining \u201cconsciousness\u201d may be similarly arbitrary and fuzzy.</p><h1><a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/eliminativist-approach-consciousness/\"><u>The Eliminativist Approach to Consciousness</u></a></h1><p>Instead of thinking in terms of \u201cconscious\u201d and \u201cunconscious\u201d we should directly focus on how physical systems work. Aspects of systems are not merely indicators of pain, but are part of the cluster of things that we call \u201cpain\u201d (attribute the label \u201cpain\u201d). Tomasik also draws parallels between eliminativism and panpsychism and highlights that there is a shared implication of both theories that there is no clear separation of consciousness with physical reality, which may further suggest that we should put more weight to ideas that less complex systems can suffer.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/interpret-physical-system-mind/\"><u>How to Interpret a Physical System as a Mind</u></a></h1><p>Uses the concept of a \u201csentience classifier\u201d to describe how we might interpret physical systems as minds. Distinct theories offer different approaches to building the classifier. Classification then involves \u201cidentifying the traits of the physical system in question\u201d (taking in the data and searching for relevant features) as a first step and \u201cmapping from those traits to high-level emotions and valences\u201d (labeling the data) as a second step. Our brains might already be vaguely implementing the sentience classifier - albeit with more messiness, complexity, and components and processes particular to the brain.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/the-many-fallacies-of-dualism/\"><u>The Many Fallacies of Dualism</u></a></h1><p>This article touches on a common theme underlying Tomasik\u2019s approach to topics like consciousness, free will, moral (anti)realism, and mathematical (anti)realism: rejecting dualism in favor of a simpler physicalist monism.</p><h1><a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/publications/importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/\"><u>The Importance of Wild Animal Suffering</u></a></h1><p>A good introduction to the topic. Discusses the extensive suffering experienced by wild animals due to natural causes like disease, predation, and environmental hardships, which may outweigh moments of happiness. Vast numbers and short, brutal lives of wild animals make their suffering a significant ethical issue.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/why-vegans-should-care-about-suffering-in-nature/\"><u>Why Vegans Should Care about Suffering in Nature</u></a></h1><p>A shorter introduction to the topic.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/the-horror-of-suffering/\"><u>The Horror of Suffering</u></a></h1><p>A vivid reflection on the horror of suffering. Suffering is not merely an abstract concept but a dire reality that demands urgent moral attention. There is a long history of intuitions that prioritize the reduction of suffering.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/one-trillion-fish/\"><u>One Trillion Fish</u></a></h1><p>Short piece on the direct harms caused by large-scale fishing (though note that when taking into account population changes and wild-animal suffering, the sign of this is less clear). Suggests humane slaughter of fish as an intervention that side-steps the uncertainty of net impact of fishing on wild-animal suffering.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/vegetarianism-and-wild-animals/\"><u>How Does Vegetarianism Impact Wild-Animal Suffering?</u></a></h1><p>Note that there are likely more comprehensive analyses now. That animal suffering is increased in some ways because of a vegetarian/vegan diet is counterintuitive but important to recognize. You might still want to be vegetarian/vegan and not eat meat as it might help with becoming more motivated to reduce suffering.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/how-rainforest-beef-production-affects-wild-animal-suffering/\"><u>How Rainforest Beef Production Affects Wild-Animal Suffering</u></a></h1><p>Creating cattle pastures prevents the suffering of counterfactual rainforest animals (in particular invertebrates).</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/habitat-loss-not-preservation-generally-reduces-wild-animal-suffering/\"><u>Habitat Loss, Not Preservation, Generally Reduces Wild-Animal Suffering</u></a></h1><p>Reducing plant growth/net primary productivity reduces wild-animal suffering - challenging the inclusion of environmentalism in the animal welfare/rights &amp; vegan/vegetarianism memeplexes.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/\"><u>Is There Suffering in Fundamental Physics?</u></a></h1><p>Many theories of consciousness imply some weight on the possibility of suffering in fundamental physics. This especially follows from eliminativism, and of course, theories of consciousness that are explicitly panpsychist. The numerosity of fundamental physical operations may present a wager.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/why-your-laptop-may-be-marginally-sentient/\"><u>Why Your Laptop May Be Marginally Sentient</u></a></h1><p>Similar article. Laptops too.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/bacteria-plants-and-graded-sentience/\"><u>Bacteria, Plants, and Graded Sentience</u></a></h1><p>Another similar article that considers the possibility of suffering in systems that are not intuitively capable of suffering. Personally, suffering in microorganisms&nbsp;<i>feels</i> more real than suffering in physics (I suspect&nbsp;<a href=\"https://timothytfchan.github.io/posts/common-sense-sentience-is-dubious/\"><u>feeling might be all we have to go by</u></a> and we might not have a better solution to understand consciousness).</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/fuzzy-nested-minds-problematize-utilitarian-aggregation/\"><u>Fuzzy, Nested Minds Problematize Utilitarian Aggregation</u></a></h1><p>Different ways of counting physical systems as individual minds results in very different numbers and some complications. I possibly-seriously, possibly-jokingly think this implies a moral wager on systems ~half the size of a finite, discrete universe, in such a universe (the most numerous class of systems according to a \u201csum over all systems\u201d approach).&nbsp;</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/simulation-argument-dampens-future-fanaticism/\"><u>How the Simulation Argument Dampens Future Fanaticism</u></a></h1><p>I think this is an original argument of Tomasik\u2019s. This looks at how having simulated copies of yourself changes the relative expected value of long-term vs. near-term interventions. Essentially, as Tomasik puts it, if \u201cthere's a non-trivial chance that most of the copies of ourselves are instantiated in relatively short-lived simulations run by superintelligent civilizations \u2026 when we act to help others in the short run, our good deeds are duplicated many times over.\u201d The gap in the order of magnitude (OOMs) of expected value between long-term and near-term interventions is narrowed but still significant.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/strategic-considerations-moral-antinatalists/\"><u>Strategic Considerations for Moral Antinatalists</u></a></h1><p>Antinatalists who are morally-motivated may want to shift focus towards opportunities that have a larger impact on suffering reduction (i.e. wild-animal suffering and the suffering of far-future digital minds).</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/omelas-and-space-colonization/\"><u>Omelas and Space Colonization</u></a></h1><p>A good short piece tempering excessive optimism about the value of the future. I like it because it acknowledges the existence of those who may be suffering in the far future.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/two-envelopes-problem-for-brain-size-and-moral-uncertainty/\"><u>Two-Envelopes Problem for Uncertainty about Brain-Size Valuation and Other Moral Questions</u></a></h1><p>An introduction to a problem with making comparisons between the dis(value) of experiences in small and large brains. I\u2019m still often confused about this.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/near-miss/\"><u>Astronomical suffering from slightly misaligned artificial intelligence</u></a></h1><p>Mentions the risk of SignFlip, where an AI maximizes the opposite of its intended utility function.

Alex suggests incremental reforms to the FDA, which I strongly support, but these don\u2019t go far enough. The FDA\u2019s failures merit a <a href=\"https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/contra-scott-on-abolishing-the-fda\"><u>complete overhaul</u></a>: Remove efficacy requirements and keep only basic safety testing and ingredient verification. Any drug that doesn\u2019t go through efficacy trials gets a big red warning label, but is otherwise legal.</p><p>Before getting into Alex\u2019s points let me quickly make the positive case for my position.</p><p>The FDA is punished for errors of commission: drugs they approve which turn out not to work or to be harmful. They don\u2019t take responsibility for errors of omission: drugs they could have approved earlier but delayed, or drugs that would have been developed but were abandoned due to the cost of approval. This asymmetry predictably leads to overcaution.</p><p>Every week the Covid-19 vaccines were delayed, for example, <a href=\"https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/how-many-people-are-in-the-invisible-graveyard\"><u>cost </u><i><u>at least </u></i><u>four thousand lives</u></a>. Pfizer <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/history/comirnaty.html\"><u>sent their final Phase 3 data to the FDA on November 20th</u></a> but was not approved until 3 weeks later on December 11th. There were successful Phase I/II human trials and successful primate-challenge trials 5 months earlier in July. Billions of doses of the vaccine were ordered by September. Every week, thousands of people died while the FDA waited for more information even after we were confident that the vaccine would not hurt anybody and was likely to prevent death. The extra information that the FDA waited months to get was not worth the tens of thousands of lives it cost. Scaling back the FDA\u2019s mandatory authority to safety and ingredient testing would correct for this deadly bias.</p><p>This isn\u2019t as radical as it may sound. The FDA didn\u2019t have efficacy requirements until 1962. Today, off-label prescriptions already operate without efficacy requirements. Doctors can prescribe a drug even if it has not gone through FDA-approved efficacy trials for the malady they are trying to cure. These off-label prescriptions <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/11/fda-deregulation-increases-safety-and-innovation-and-reduces-prices.html\"><u>are effective</u></a>, and already make up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-label_use#Frequency_of_off-label_use\"><u>~20% of all prescriptions</u></a> written in the US. Removing mandatory efficacy trials for all drugs is equivalent to expanding this already common practice.</p><p>Now, let\u2019s get to Alex\u2019s objections. Most of <a href=\"https://atelfo.substack.com/p/but-does-surgery-really-work-well\"><u>his post</u></a> was focused on <a href=\"https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/surgery-works-well-without-the-fda\"><u>my analogy between pharmaceuticals and surgery</u></a>. There are compelling data and arguments on both sides and his post shifted my confidence in the validity and conclusions of the analogy downwards, but in the interest of not overinvesting in one particular analogy I\u2019ll leave that debate where it stands and focus more on Alex\u2019s general arguments in favor of the FDA.</p><h3>Patent medicines and snake oil</h3><p>Alex notes that we can look to the past, before the FDA was created, to get an idea of what the pharmaceutical market might look like with less FDA oversight.</p><blockquote><p>Maxwell argues that in the absence of government oversight, market forces would prevent companies from pushing ineffective or harmful drugs simply to make a profit. Except that there are precedents for exactly this scenario occurring. Until they were stamped out by regulators in the early 20th century, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_medicine\"><u>patent medicine</u></a> hucksters sold ineffective, and sometimes literally poisonous, nostrums to desperate patients. We still use \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil\"><u>snake oil</u></a>\u201d today as shorthand from a scam product.</p></blockquote><p>There is no denying that medicine has improved massively over the past 150 years alongside expanding regulatory oversight, but this relationship is not causal. The vast majority of gains in the quality of medical care are due to innovations like antibiotics, genome sequencing, and robotic surgery. A tough and discerning FDA in the 1870s which allows only the best available treatments to be marketed would not have improved medical quality much because the best available treatments at the time were <a href=\"https://melnickmedicalmuseum.com/2013/03/27/19ctreatment/\"><u>still bad</u></a>. And even the most lackadaisical and laissez-faire FDA today would not make us forget vaccines or antibiotics or to wash our hands before surgery. The strength of regulatory oversight explains little of the differences in medical quality over the past century.</p><p>The main problem with 19th century medicine is not that hucksters sold fake treatments, its that real treatments did not exist and no one knew how to make them. Learning how to make new treatments is still the largest source of gains today. If we can cure cancer, double lifespan, or develop <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MTabarrok/status/1754352269095493672\"><u>these 8 vaccines</u></a>, this innovation will far outstrip any gains from sorting through the medicines we already have.</p><p>If we further consider that the FDA\u2019s filtration is paid for by <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/11/fda-deregulation-increases-safety-and-innovation-and-reduces-prices.html\"><u>a tax</u></a> on <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/give-innovation-a-chance.html\"><u>innovation</u></a>, the tradeoff looks worse. The <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/6f256d17-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/6f256d17-en#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9CEroom's%20Law%E2%80%9D%20(,the%20productivity%20of%20biopharmaceutical%20R%26D.\"><u>ever-growing cost of regulatory approval</u></a> drains hundreds of billions from the research that we rely on for progress.</p><h3>Chesterton\u2019s fence</h3><p>In a related point, Alex points out that the FDA has been built incrementally over time, with each new piece a reaction to fill a gap revealed by a scandal. This means that the institutional design of the FDA encodes a lot of information which we ignore at our own risk.</p><blockquote><p>The FDA did not spring into existence fully formed, its powers were granted and expanded over time in response to specific safety scandals and societal pressure (I cover these events in some detail in act 3 of <a href=\"https://atelfo.github.io/2023/12/23/biopharma-from-janssen-to-today.html\"><u>my long post on the history of the pharmaceutical industry</u></a>, thalidomide being the most notable). Anyone proposing we eliminate the FDA should keep in mind that we\u2019ve already tried an unregulated pharmaceutical industry, and we decided that we didn\u2019t much like it, thank you very much.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with Alex\u2019s description of how the FDA came to be, but this description is exactly why I am confident that the FDA is far too cautious. The FDA <i>is </i>built out of reactions to safety scandals and societal pressure, but the scandal per-life-lost is much higher for errors of commission than errors of omission. The FDA ought to be optimizing to save lives, but instead it\u2019s shaped in reaction to scandal and pressure so it is willing to send millions to the invisible graveyard in exchange for avoiding a few dozen deaths of malpractice.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00609-x\"><u>FDA shut down Strep A vaccine research for thirty years</u></a>, for example, based on an uncontrolled study with 21 participants that showed a scandalous risk, ignoring previous successful trials with tens of thousands of participants and a human challenge trial with no serious adverse safety events. Strep A kills five hundred thousand people a year globally.</p><p>We know why Chesterton\u2019s fence is there and we know why it\u2019s too high.</p><h3>Does the FDA actually help innovation?</h3><p>At the end of the essay, Alex steelmans the case for how drug regulators may help progress and innovation in pharmaceuticals.</p><blockquote><p>The existence of the FDA is a forcing function which incentivises drug companies to generate data that shows that their drugs have a positive risk-benefit profile. Information on what works and doesn\u2019t work is fed back into the development process for future drugs, improving the quality of future drug development decisions</p><p>(as a corollary to #1) Because drug companies make money if their products are demonstrated to work, they are incentivised to pursue scientific research in a truth-seeking manner. Over time, market forces conspire to eliminate companies that do bad science and reward those who make discoveries that benefit humanity. By creating a mechanism for the market to reward good science, academic science (as a source of talent and ideas for biotech) is also indirectly incentivised to produce higher quality work</p><p>By creating a regulatory pathway which encodes some value judgements on what type of technologies are worth developing and in what manner, regulators can help funnel talent, money, research, and economic activity (incl. entrepreneurship) down channels that are ultimately beneficial for society</p><p>A defined regulatory pathway with established value generating milestones (IND, phase I, phase II, phase III\u2026) makes investing in biotech more predictable and attractive</p></blockquote><p>The first three points are closely related. Drug regulation creates incentives for drug companies to produce useful data and research. This data and research has big positive externalities, so its good to provide incentives for them. However, the FDA provides this incentive by making all drug development more expensive, but making failed drug development even <i>more </i>expensive. Because the FDA provides these incentives with a stick instead of a carrot, the net effect on the output of the industry is negative.</p><p>The FDA\u2019s growing power does correlate with higher <i>levels</i> of medical quality over time, but the rate of growth is negatively correlated with FDA oversight. There are many possible reasons for this but it is suggestive that the period before FDA efficacy requirements <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?time=1913..latest&amp;country=~USA\"><u>1900-1962</u></a> saw much faster medical progress than the subsequent 60 years.</p><p>Imagine we applied the FDA\u2019s incentive strategy to some other public good like carbon removal. Before you can start your carbon removal machine, you have to go through a multi-year, multi-million dollar testing gauntlet to verify exactly how much carbon the machine removes and whether it is more or less effective than planting trees. This process would produce some useful data, and it would make inefficient machines less rewarding relative to machines which pass the tests, but it won\u2019t incentivize entry into the field on net. It would be much better to subsidize the public good industry for producing something we want, or have a government agency directly run the tests rather than taxing all public goods producers, but the good ones a little less.</p><p>New medical treatments have massive positive externalities so we want to sort through and differentially reward them without decreasing the overall output of the industry. Instead of raising the cost of entry for all drugs with extra punishments for ineffective ones, we should lower barriers and provide extra rewards to the most effective and safe drugs. One easy way to accomplish this is to remove efficacy requirements, lowering development costs for all drugs, and retrospectively reward the drugs whose early results hold up best in voluntary efficacy trials, post-market surveillance, or government funded trials.</p><p>Many parts of clinical research are public goods. Instead of taxing the private rewards that pharmaceutical companies get from this research and returning only a portion of the tax to the public-good-producing industry, we could spend much more on producing research directly. Doubling the NIH budget and running a bunch of clinical trials is a far cheaper and more effective way to incentivize the research, data, and talent that Alex and I both want than the FDA\u2019s current strategy.</p><p>Alex\u2019s fourth point about a defined regulatory pathway seems outside of the clash of our debate. The regulatory structure I am proposing is certainly not less defined or predictable than the current one, so it doesn\u2019t seem like a relevant metric by which to compare them.</p><p>Alex and I agree on more about the FDA than either of us and the median person you\u2019d find on the street would. Still, we have our disagreements. Fundamentally, I think our disagreements stem from differing weights on the importance of innovation vs selection in medical progress and on the importance of errors of omission vs commission in the FDA\u2019s decision making. I would much rather live in a world with lots of medical innovation and poor selection than the other way around, and I view commission bias as fundamental and pervasive in all of the FDA\u2019s decisions.</p><p>To correct for this bias I propose a major, but not a radical, reform to the FDA. Return to the FDA of 1960. Expand the standards we already apply to a large proportion of prescriptions: Remove efficacy requirements for approval. If there are still market distortions which favor ineffective drugs, fix them with subsidies rather than regulatory hurdles so that we don\u2019t siphon resources from the innovative engines which are responsible for the vast majority of medical progress.</p><h3>Addendum</h3><p>Supplements</p><p>Alex also highlights the modern day supplement industry as a cautionary tale for pharmaceutical deregulation. An <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-trustworthy-are-supplements\"><u>investigation from Scott Alexander</u></a>, which Alex cites, finds that even niche nootropic supplements by-and-large contain what they claim to. Still, most supplements aren\u2019t really good treatments for anything.</p><p>I put this section in the addendum because I think supplements are a separate issue from what most discussion of the FDA centers on. Usually, the FDA is framed as a correction to misalignments between the interests of consumers and pharmaceutical companies. People want effective medicine but pharmaceutical companies can give them sugar and sawdust for cheap and it is difficult for patients to find out.</p><p>The main problem with supplements, though, is that people don\u2019t want effective treatments. It\u2019s not that consumers ask for one thing and get another, it\u2019s that they get what they want but we think what they want is bad for them. More like gambling or alcohol than snake oil. Whether and when this kind of paternalism is justified is a complicated philosophical debate which is worth further investigations but I thought was orthogonal to our other points about the FDA.</p>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "sCX3AMizT6XmeKCkt", "title": "Private Immigration Sponsorship: A High-Impact and Personal EA Opportunity", "postedAt": "2024-02-24T14:31:42.415Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The Biden administration has been following the example of Canada's private refugee sponsorship program and launched several programs in which Americans can apply to sponsor refugees from a select list of countries to move to the United States.

There are also secondary benefits, like allowing refugees to send remittances back home to their needy families, or to bring their family members to the U.S. as well.</p><p>I sponsored a friend under the Cuban humanitarian parole sponsorship program, and while it has been a very rewarding experience on a personal level, I would not necessarily recommend it as the highest-impact option. The reason is that the CHNV program operates under a strict quota system, and the number of applications far exceeds this quota. Therefore, for every person who gets through, there's another person who didn't get to immigrate as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>I could make the argument that helping a young person is good because he'll get to experience more years in the U.S. than a typical beneficiary. I could also argue that helping a Cuban instead of someone from another nationality has an advantage because Cubans have a much easier pathway to permanent residence. That's because of the Cuban Adjustment Act (the other three nationalities only get parole for 2 years, after that they would have to try to find some other way of staying in the U.S.). On the other hand, while the economic situation in Cuba is dire, it is probably even worse to be living in Haiti.</p><p>But I think the highest-impact opportunities are ones where demand is unlikely to reach the quota, like Welcome Corps.</p><p>I'm not going to try to summarize all of the details of eligibility and how to become a sponsor in this post, for that you can just read the website of welcome.us, a nonprofit that helps connect sponsors with beneficiaries and has learning resources about how to become a sponsor.</p><p>What I will say is that what excites me the most about private refugee sponsorship is it combines two important qualities as an opportunity to do good. One is that I think it's very high-impact; moving someone from one of the worst countries in the world to live to one of the best is life-changing. But the other is it's a very personal way of doing good. Not only do you get to meet the people you're helping, you get to help them adjust to life in the U.S. and support them until they're able to support themselves.

It is characterized by an inadequate availability of nutritious food. According to the United Nations, 828 million people were facing food insecurity in 2021, indicating an increase of 46 million from 2020. Specifically, in West Africa in 2021, 247.4 million individuals were affected by this plight, equating to a prevalence of 60% within the population. This insecurity is intensified by various shocks and issues such as conflicts, climate change, poverty, and health crises. The goal of Zero Hunger, the second of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations member states for 2030, seems increasingly unattainable, making the issue of food security even more urgent.</p><h1>Multifaceted challenges of food security</h1><p>The causes and impacts of food insecurity in French West Africa (FWA) are complex and multifactorial.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Climatically, West Africa faces significant vulnerabilities, heightening the risks of drought and flooding, which in turn adversely affect agricultural productivity. Post-harvest losses due to inadequate infrastructure further diminish food availability and escalate costs. Deficiencies in transport and storage infrastructure are also major obstacles to evenly distributed food availability.</p><p>Economically, food insecurity hampers growth, trapping communities in cycles of poverty. Individuals lacking sufficient caloric or nutritional intake have lower energy levels, fall ill more frequently, and thus struggle to earn income, perpetuating their impoverished and food-insecure state. This cycle is further extended as they give birth to children who also face poor health and poverty.</p><p>Health-wise, food insecurity often leads to malnutrition, characterized by nutritional deficiencies, and more recently, to a growing trend of obesity, with long-term consequences on physical and mental health.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>These challenges underscore the urgency of implementing sustainable solutions to enhance food security in the region.</p><h1>Current solutions being explored</h1><p>To address these challenges, governments, international institutions, and NGOs are considering various strategies.</p><p>Enhancing agricultural productivity through the use of inputs, expanding cultivable land, and adopting new technologies are priorities in public policy, despite environmental and health concerns associated with excessive input use. Strengthening agricultural infrastructure is vital to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access. Crop diversification is encouraged to decrease reliance on a few staple crops and promote a more balanced diet. Sustainable agriculture is increasingly advocated by NGOs and international institutions as an environmentally friendly, socially equitable, and economically viable production method, incorporating practices like agroforestry and permaculture.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Among these strategies, increasing the production of legumes for human consumption is currently a minor focus, even though their numerous beneficial characteristics make them a highly relevant solution.</p><h1>Potential of plant-based proteins in addressing food security challenges</h1><p>Plant proteins, particularly legumes, emerge as a promising solution to the multifaceted food security challenges in French West Africa. Their cultivation presents significant potential to address current and future challenges such as climate change, poverty, conflicts and political instability, health risks, and the transformations accompanying economic and demographic growth, including westernization of lifestyles, and increasing tertiary sector employment and urbanization. To meet food needs while considering these challenges, plant proteins are appealing due to the following characteristics:</p><ol><li><strong>Environmental sustainability and agronomic benefits</strong>: plant proteins, particularly legumes, require fewer water and land resources compared to animal protein sources. They are also resistant to climatic variations, such as temperature fluctuations, and emit very low levels of greenhouse gases per kilogram of protein. This resource-efficiency is especially advantageous in the context of climate change and population growth, where water and soil management are critical. Additionally, legume cultivation contributes to soil fertilization by fixing nitrogen, reducing the need for external inputs. This is beneficial for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing the resilience of the agricultural production model in French West Africa, especially in reducing dependence on inputs mainly imported from Russia.</li><li><strong>Economic advantages</strong>: promoting the local cultivation of legumes stimulates rural economies and creates jobs, thereby supporting local communities. Legumes are a financially accessible protein source (as food insecurity is more an issue of access to food than quantity available) and require minimal investment and infrastructure for production, storage, and transportation.</li><li><strong>Public health benefits</strong>: plant proteins do not contain saturated fats and are significantly richer in fibers and essential nutrients (such as B vitamins, iron, and minerals) compared to animal proteins. Incorporating them into diets can help combat malnutrition, improve essential nutrient intake, and reduce the risks of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&nbsp;<br>Moreover, plant proteins do not carry the risk of developing zoonoses or causing foodborne infections, which are significant public health concerns.</li></ol><p>Despite their numerous benefits, it is important to acknowledge that legumes, unlike other animal protein sources, do not provide essential nutrients such as vitamin B12 and vitamin A. They also offer a lower zinc content. These nutritional shortcomings can be addressed through supplementation policies, akin to iodine supplementation in France.</p><p>Why, then, if legumes possess such advantageous qualities, are they not more extensively cultivated? It appears that dietary habits, which include minimal consumption of legumes, are a primary impediment to their expanded development.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, the production and consumption of plant-based proteins hold significant potential for enhancing food security and resilience in Francophone West Africa. However, this requires an integrated approach, engaging governments, civil society actors, and the private sector to shift dietary habits and stimulate production. By implementing targeted public policies and measures to raise awareness about dietary practices, the region can aspire to a future where plant-based proteins play a vital role in building sustainable food systems, thereby contributing to the well-being of its populations and the overall development of the area. With this progression, the region could serve as a model for other parts of the world transitioning to drier climates due to climate change.</p><h1>A few sources</h1><p>CICR. (2017).

Audiences love narratives about <a href=\"https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300248548/minds-make-societies/\">threats</a>, especially when linked to fancy new technologies. However, most commentators don\u2019t want to go full <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41SUp-TRVlg\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> and claim that super-intelligent AI will kill us all. So they settle for what they think is a more reasonable position, one that aligns better with the prevailing sensibility and worldview of the liberal commentariat: AI will greatly exacerbate the problem of <i>online disinformation</i>, which - as every educated person knows - is one of the great scourges of our time.</p><p>For example, in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2024 <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/\"><i>Global Risks Report</i></a><i> </i>surveying 1500 experts and policy makers<i>, </i>they list \u201cmisinformation and disinformation\u201d as the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/01/global-risks-report-2024/\"><i>top</i> global risk</a> over the next two years:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2701f6ef-596d-4bc0-a999-1d8a024315e0_606x824.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/mwvk89ehymcgglcerjk0\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/ugy6o0yoypbnumoskzwi 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/dplzxvt7zprh5edojl0i 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/t2flqln1qirvbxffiikn 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/mwvk89ehymcgglcerjk0 1456w\"></a></p><p>In defence of this assessment, a <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/01/global-risks-report-2024/\">post</a> on the World Economic Forum\u2019s website notes:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe growing concern about misinformation and disinformation is in large part driven by the potential for AI, in the hands of bad actors, to flood global information systems with false narratives.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>This idea gets spelled out in different ways, but most conversations focus on the following threats:</p><ul><li>Deepfakes (realistic but fake images, videos, and audio generated by AI) will either trick people into believing falsehoods or cause them to distrust all recordings on the grounds they might be deepfakes.</li><li>Propagandists will use generative AI to create hyper-persuasive arguments for false views (e.g. \u201cthe election was stolen\u201d).</li><li>AI will enable automated disinformation campaigns.

Online disinformation does not lie at the root of modern political problems</strong></h2><p>Since 2016, a highly influential narrative posits that disinformation - especially online<i> </i>disinformation transmitted via social media - is a root cause of many political problems in Western democracies, including widespread support for right-wing populist movements, falling trust in institutions, rejection of public health advice, and so on. The narrative shifts around a bit, as does the emphasis on different villains (Russian disinformation campaigns, fake news, Cambridge Analytica, \u201cThe Algorithm\u201d, online conspiracy theories, filter bubbles, etc.). Nevertheless, the core narrative that online disinformation is driving many political problems is constantly affirmed by experts, social scientists, policy makers, journalists, Netflix documentaries, and more.</p><p>When many people think about AI-based disinformation, I think this narrative is swirling around in their consciousness. They think something like: \u201cOnline disinformation is ruining democracies. AI will exacerbate the problem of online disinformation. Therefore AI-based disinformation is really bad.\u201d Given this, the first step on the way to thinking clearly about AI-based disinformation is to recognise that <a href=\"https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/the-fake-news-about-fake-news/\">this narrative is wrong</a>. Online disinformation <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305121988928\">does not</a> lie at the root of the problems that the liberal establishment in Western countries is most worried about.</p><p>First, despite a moral panic over social media, fake news, and online conspiracy theories, there is <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.34.3.220\">no systematic evidence</a> that false claims or misperceptions are more prevalent now than in the past. In fact, evidence suggests that rates of things like conspiracy theorising have <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0270429\">not increased</a> and that in some areas democratic citizens are <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/misinformation-myth\">better informed</a>.</p><p>Second, in Western democracies, exposure to online disinformation (even on very liberal definitions) is quite <a href=\"https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-fighting-misinformation-or-fighting-for-information/\">low on average</a>. If people bother to follow the news at all - and many don\u2019t - the overwhelming majority tune into mainstream media.</p><p>Third, the minority of very active social media users that do engage with lots of extremist, conspiratorial, or deceptive online content is <a href=\"https://iai.tv/articles/misinformation-is-the-symptom-not-the-disease-daniel-walliams-auid-2690\">not a cross-section of the population</a><strong>. </strong>They are people with very <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25617-0\">specific traits</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/partisan-polarization-is-the-primary-psychological-motivation-behind-political-fake-news-sharing-on-twitter/3F7D2098CD87AE5501F7AD4A7FA83602\">identities</a><strong> - </strong>for example, highly conspiratorial mentalities, extremist political attitudes, and so on - and the media they consume mostly just seems to affirm and reinforce their pre-existing identities and worldviews.</p><p>This is a general pattern. Online disinformation is relatively rare and largely <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221150412#bibr76-20563051221150412\">preaches to the choir</a>. Ultimately, the reason why certain people accept it and often seek it out is because they distrust and often despise establishment institutions, elites, or their political enemies. The reasons for such feelings are complex, but exposure to online disinformation seems to play a relatively <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/31/ai-will-change-american-elections-but-not-in-the-obvious-way\">minor role</a>.</p><p>This does not mean democratic citizens are well-informed or make good political decisions. Nevertheless, the idea that voters are only ignorant, misinformed, and make bad political decisions because they have been duped by sinister elites, interest groups, propaganda campaigns, and online conspiracy theorists is one of the great myths of our time. As Dietram Scheufele and colleagues <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2022-15515-005.html\">note</a>, the idea that false and misleading content online</p><blockquote><p>\u201cdistorts attitudes and behaviors of a citizenry that would otherwise hold issue and policy stances that are consistent with the best available scientific evidence\u2026 [has] limited foundations in the social scientific literature.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>There are many causes of false or simplistic political beliefs and narratives: ignorance, human nature, pre-scientific intuitions, lazy and biased reasoning, and so on. The worldview of highly-educated, cosmopolitan, liberal scientists and journalists is not the default state that people get pushed away from by exposure to disinformation. Demagogues, populism, conspiracy theories, and highly biased, distortive ideologies and worldviews are as old as the human species.</p><p>Of course, the fact that the post-2016 alarmism about online disinformation is misguided obviously does not prove that current alarmism about AI-based disinformation is misguided. Nevertheless, many of the reasons why the former worries are greatly exaggerated carry over to concerns about AI-based disinformation. To begin with: persuasion - including political persuasion - is extremely hard.</p><h2><strong>2. Political persuasion is </strong><i><strong>extremely</strong></i><strong> hard</strong></h2><p>It\u2019s really, really difficult to change people\u2019s minds. It\u2019s even more difficult to change their minds in ways that lead to changes in behaviour. Most of us intuitively recognise this when arguing at the pub, but then forget it when thinking about persuasion in the abstract. At that point we lapse into thinking that people - <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14614448231153379\"><i>other</i></a><i> </i>people, that is - are gullible and hence will believe whatever they come across on the internet. As Hugo Mercier demonstrates conclusively in his book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178707/not-born-yesterday\"><i>Not Born Yesterday</i></a>, this widespread belief in human gullibility is completely mistaken.</p><p>Even when it comes to extremely well-funded, well-organised, and targeted <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/minimal-persuasive-effects-of-campaign-contact-in-general-elections-evidence-from-49-field-experiments/753665A313C4AB433DBF7110299B7433\">political</a> and <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA17674\">advertising</a> campaigns, they routinely have minimal effects. That doesn\u2019t mean <i>all</i> such campaigns have <i>no</i> effects, but it does show that persuasion - real, consequential, long-lasting persuasion of large numbers of people - is exceptionally hard<i> </i>in ways that many people fail to appreciate when they think about topics like online disinformation.</p><p>There are several things that make persuasion hard. First, people are <a href=\"http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010_clement-et-al_epistemic-vigilance.pdf\">strongly disposed</a> to reject information at odds with their pre-existing beliefs, intuitions, and general worldviews. This is partly rational: if someone tells you something that you judge to be very implausible, you <i>should </i>assign it less weight. Nevertheless, people appear to be <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0052\">overly dismissive</a> of other people\u2019s opinions.</p><p>Second, persuasion typically depends on <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/bad-beliefs-9780192895325\">trust</a>, which is fragile and difficult to achieve. To accept what someone tells us, we must believe that they are knowledgeable and honest. Otherwise we will dismiss what they say. As I return to below (#3), this means influencers must achieve a reputation for trustworthiness among their target audience, which is hard, and much more difficult than merely creating and publishing content.</p><p>Third, unlike in <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo181475008.html\">experiments</a> where participants are randomly exposed to persuasive messages, we generally choose which information to consume and ignore. We therefore typically seek out content that aligns with our pre-existing beliefs and preferences and ignore or tune out information that doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Fourth, even when people do change their view about something, this is often short-lived. Suppose I trust Bob, and he posts a news story on Twitter that the Pope endorsed Donald Trump for president. I think, \u201cWow, that\u2019s odd. The Pope endorsed Trump for president.\u201d That looks like successful persuasion, but in reality I will quickly abandon this belief if it\u2019s not confirmed by the BBC, at which point I will also abandon any trust I had in Bob. This is one of many reasons why persuasive effects <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122069119\">decay quickly with time</a>.</p><p>Finally, even when people do change their mind, they very <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352250X23001604\">rarely change</a> more basic attitudes and behaviours, such as their general worldview or the political party they support. In general, people are often set in their ways when it comes to politics. It is difficult to change beliefs. It is <i>really, really </i>difficult to change consequential behaviours such as voting intentions, which are very stable. People rarely appreciate this when thinking about AI-based disinformation, however.</p><p>Here is an anecdote that illustrates this. Over Christmas, I was talking to someone about politics. She said something like the following: \u201cExperts are really worried about the effects of artificial intelligence on elections this year.\u201d She had recently read an article about this in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/19/ai-generated-disinformation-us-elections\">the Guardian</a>. I told her I think those worries are greatly exaggerated. She seemed sceptical, so I asked her: \u201cAre you worried that <i>you </i>will be duped into voting for the Conservatives [a political party she hates] because of AI-based disinformation?\u201d She thought about it and then smiled: \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>In response to these considerations, you might reason as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Ok, political persuasion is hard, but AI-based disinformation might be <i>extremely</i> effective at persuasion. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t need to change most people\u2019s vote to have devastating effects on democracies. It can just change <i>some</i> people\u2019s vote - elections are often decided on small margins - or it might change the <i>beliefs</i> of people with stable voting intentions (e.g., convincing Republicans that the 2020 election was stolen) in ways that have negative consequences.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe. But I think this still greatly overestimates how easy persuasion is, and it runs up against points #3 and #4.</p><h2><strong>3. The Media Environment is Highly Competitive and Demand-driven</strong></h2><p>In Western democratic societies, the media environment is highly competitive. People have a limited budget of attention. They must be selective in which information they seek out. In practice, that means being selective about which sources to pay attention to and which to ignore. This selection is based on many different things. How trustworthy is the source? Do they have a good reputation? Do they produce content that I find entertaining or useful? Do their messages cohere with my general worldview? And so on.</p><p>Content producers - media companies, internet personalities, professional opinion givers, online conspiracy theorists, etc. - must therefore compete to win people\u2019s attention and trust. This competition is harsh. Anyone who has ever tried to publish their views knows it is <i>extremely </i>difficult to reach an audience with them. To a first approximation, the overwhelming majority of content on platforms like Twitter, Substack, Facebook, or TikTok gets basically no engagement. On <a href=\"https://tubestats.org/\">Youtube</a>, for example, the median video has zero likes, zero comments, and forty views.</p><p>Such competition has several related implications when thinking about AI-based disinformation. First, media is <a href=\"https://lionelpage.substack.com/p/the-marketplace-of-rationalisations\">demand-driven</a>, and the media landscape when it comes to politics is already highly specialised for satisfying audience preferences. That means it is <i>exceptionally </i>hard to outcompete existing content producers, especially established, well-funded media institutions (e.g. the BBC, Channel 4 News, the NYT, etc.) that have built up reputations over many years and overwhelmingly possess the largest audiences (see #1). In the context of thinking about AI-based disinformation, then, the question is not whether AI can <i>generate </i>sophisticated, targeted disinformation but whether it can outcompete other, established content producers to win a trusting audience.</p><p>Second, to succeed in such markets, content producers must achieve a good reputation (in the eyes of their target audience). One of many things that makes this really hard is that it is strongly in the interests of your competitors to destroy your reputation. In addition to legal accountability for lies and fabrications, this is one thing that keeps lots of media <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-media-very-rarely-lies\">honest</a>, at least when it comes to reporting on narrow matters of fact. (They still select, omit, frame, package, and contextualise such facts in <a href=\"https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/misinformation-researchers-are-wrong\">highly misleading ways</a>). If you mess up and get things wrong, competitors therefore have very strong incentives to point this out in order to discredit you. So in thinking about AI-based disinformation, the question is whether sources that use such technologies to produce and transmit disinformation can maintain a trustworthy reputation in environments where it\u2019s strongly in the interests of other content producers to discredit them. Maybe they can, but I think this is a much greater hurdle to cross than most people acknowledge in thinking about AI-based disinformation.</p><p>Finally, disinformation itself is overwhelmingly <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/marketplace-of-rationalizations/41FB096344BD344908C7C992D0C0C0DC\">demand-driven</a>. As noted above (#1), the overwhelming majority of citizens get their political information from establishment sources (if they bother to get such information at all). It is only a minority of the population that distrusts and dislikes the establishment that engages with explicitly anti-establishment content and narratives online. On the one hand, content producers that cater to this minority of the population don\u2019t have to worry about being discredited by establishment sources because their audience doesn\u2019t trust establishment sources. Nevertheless, as Felix Simon, Sacha Altay, and Hugo Mercier <a href=\"https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/misinformation-reloaded-fears-about-the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-misinformation-are-overblown/\">point out</a>, this audience of very active social media users is already well-served by an informational ecosystem tailored to producing anti-establishment content, and there is little reason to believe that AI-based disinformation will increase the size of this audience. Moreover, even if producers using AI-based disinformation do outcompete existing content producers in this space, the content overwhelmingly preaches to the choir anyway (again, see #1), so it is unlikely to have big effects.</p><h2>4. The establishment will have access to more powerful forms of AI than counter-establishment sources.</h2><p>When people worry about misinformation and disinformation, they worry about messages that contradict \u201cestablishment\u201d narratives - that is, the consensus views of scientists and experts, public health authorities, government-approved data and statistics agencies, mainstream media fact-checkers, Davos elites, and so on. How worried should we be that AI-based disinformation will fuel counter-establishment content?</p><p>Here is a final reason for scepticism that this is a major threat: in Western democracies, the establishment - governments, international organisations (e.g., the EU), mainstream media, corporations legally accountable to governments, and so on - will inevitably have much greater access to more powerful, effective artificial intelligence than counter-establishment sources. That\u2019s what makes them the establishment, after all. For example, this is why it\u2019s very hard to get GPT-4 to produce arguments against<i> </i>vaccines but not in favour of them, or why it rejects requests to defend Trump\u2019s claim that the 2020 US presidential election was stolen but will happily debunk it:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1562f21c-a099-4e15-84a0-5285be9ec187_862x552.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/jueoo8jgkldvgxuszvgp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/p2dzno20uyyq3dffi41n 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/rsuqjkiku1h7tzsb03rr 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/z6mfsnpabrfujabzscuk 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/jueoo8jgkldvgxuszvgp 1456w\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65d07517-d702-46b7-8786-f97aceb720ac_856x518.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/enqrohuzvkdorlcsbjws\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/fuk5r2405ronb2tg9get 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/d4o9jqxvowjp9c8k5q91 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/agkro7tnmqylhzjms7h4 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QBsCLkiEMpNmjPmzN/enqrohuzvkdorlcsbjws 1456w\"></a></p><p>This has an obvious consequence, which can be stated like this: <i>Anything that anti-establishment propagandists can do with AI, the establishment can do better</i>. This means the establishment will be able to outcompete its anti-establishment rivals and attackers when it comes to the use of AI in generating and transmitting persuasive, targeted arguments. It also means the establishment will have access to more effective AI-based technologies when it comes to detecting and combatting anti-establishment narratives online and elswhere.</p><p>If anything, this suggests the main thing to worry about when it comes to AI and our informational ecosystem is the exact opposite of what people generally worry about. As Scott Alexander <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/mostly-skeptical-thoughts-on-the\">puts it</a> in the context of focusing specifically on \u201cpropaganda bots\u201d (i.e., automated disinformation systems),</p><blockquote><p>So the establishment has a big propagandabot advantage even before the social media censors ban disinfo-bots... So there\u2019s a strong argument (which I\u2019ve never seen anyone make) that the biggest threat from propaganda bots isn\u2019t the spread of disinformation, but a force multiplier for locking in establishment narratives and drowning out dissent.</p></blockquote><p>This is an important worry, but it is a <i>radically</i> <i>different </i>worry to the one that people and organisations like the World Economic Forum typically have in mind when it comes to the topic of AI-based disinformation.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In summary, I think concerns about the effects of AI-based disinformation on Western democracies are probably greatly overstated. When people think about this topic, they ignore many details of how people, democracies, and media actually work. That doesn\u2019t mean there is <i>nothing </i>to worry about or that nobody should be working on addressing relevant problems. When considered collectively, though, I think the four points raised in this essay are enough to pour a big and much-needed bucket of scepticism over the popular alarmism surrounding this topic.</p>", "user": {"username": "Dan Williams"}}, {"_id": "6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko", "title": "Nuclear war tail risk has been exaggerated?", "postedAt": "2024-02-25T09:14:36.964Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The views expressed here are my own, not those of Alliance to Feed the Earth in Disasters (<a href=\"https://allfed.info/\"><u>ALLFED</u></a>), for which I work as a contractor.</p><h1>Summary</h1><ul><li>I calculated a nearterm annual risk of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/human-extinction\"><u>human extinction</u></a>&nbsp;from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/nuclear-warfare-1\"><u>nuclear war</u></a>&nbsp;of 5.93*10^-12 (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#Extinction_risk_from_nuclear_war\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>I consider&nbsp;grantmakers and donors interested in decreasing extinction risk had better&nbsp;focus on artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/artificial-intelligence\"><u>AI</u></a>) instead of nuclear war (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#Grantmakers_and_donors_interested_in_decreasing_extinction_risk_had_better_focus_on_artificial_intelligence_instead_of_nuclear_war\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>I would say the case for sometimes prioritising nuclear extinction risk over AI extinction risk is much weaker than the case for sometimes prioritising <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/natural-existential-risk\"><u>natural extinction risk</u></a>&nbsp;over nuclear extinction risk (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#The_case_for_sometimes_prioritising_nuclear_extinction_risk_over_AI_extinction_risk_is_much_weaker_than_the_case_for_sometimes_prioritising_natural_extinction_risk_over_nuclear_extinction_risk\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>I get a sense the extinction risk from nuclear war was massively overestimated in The Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/635693acf15a3e2a14a56a4a/t/64f0a7838ccbf43b6b5ee40c/1693493128111/XPT.pdf\"><u>XPT</u></a>) (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#Extinction_risk_from_nuclear_war_was_massively_overestimated_in_The_Existential_Risk_Persuasion_Tournament\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>I have the impression Toby Ord greatly overestimated tail risk in <a href=\"https://theprecipice.com/\"><u>The Precipice</u></a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#Toby_Ord_greatly_overestimated_tail_risk_in_The_Precipice\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>I believe interventions to decrease deaths from nuclear war should be assessed based on standard <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/cost-benefit-analysis\"><u>cost-benefit analysis</u></a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#Interventions_to_decrease_deaths_from_nuclear_war_should_be_assessed_based_on_standard_cost_benefit_analysis\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>I think increasing calorie production via new food sectors is less cost-effective to save lives than measures targeting distribution (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#Increasing_calorie_production_via_new_food_sectors_is_less_cost_effective_to_save_lives_than_measures_targeting_distribution\"><u>more</u></a>).</li></ul><h1>Extinction risk from nuclear war</h1><p>I calculated a nearterm annual risk of human extinction from nuclear war of 5.93*10^-12 (= (6.36*10^-14*5.53*10^-10)^0.5) from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean\"><u>geometric mean</u></a>&nbsp;between<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"cu1vyrnyv0j\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcu1vyrnyv0j\"><sup><a href=\"#fncu1vyrnyv0j\">[1]</a></sup></span>:</p><ul><li>My prior of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TwpoedzMpmy7k7NKH/can-a-war-cause-human-extinction-once-again-not-on-priors\"><u>6.36*10^-14</u></a>&nbsp;for the annual probability of a war causing human extinction.</li><li>My <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/inside-vs-outside-view\"><u>inside view</u></a>&nbsp;estimate of 5.53*10^-10 for the nearterm annual probability of human extinction from nuclear war.</li></ul><p>By nearterm annual risk, I mean that in a randomly selected year from 2025 to 2050.

I would agree further research on this is really valuable.</p><p>Additionally, I appreciate one should be sceptical whenever a model outputs a risk as low as the ones I mentioned at the start of this section. For example, a model predicting a 1 in a trillion chance of the global real gross domestic product (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_gross_domestic_product\"><u>real GDP</u></a>) decreasing from 2008 to 2009 would certainly not be capturing most of the actual risk of recession then, which would come from that model being (massively) wrong. On the other hand, one should be careful not to overgeneralise this type of reasoning, and conclude that any model outputting a small probability must be wrong by many orders of magnitude (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude\"><u>OOMs</u></a>).

The alternative may well be less cost-effective, and supporting interventions to decrease nuclear risk could be a pathway towards influencing more pressing areas.</li></ul><p>I arrived at a nearterm annual extinction risk from AI of 0.001 % as follows. I think looking into how species have gone extinct in the past is the best <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting\"><u>reference class</u></a>&nbsp;to estimate <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-risk\"><u>AI risk</u></a>. Jacob Steinhardt did an <a href=\"https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/base-rates-of-catastrophes/\"><u>analysis</u></a>&nbsp;which has some relevant insights:</p><blockquote><p>Thus, in general most species extinctions are caused by:</p><ul><li>A second species which the original species has not had a chance to adapt to.

However, the 1st point alludes to what seems to me to be the greatest risk from AI,<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16200.pdf\">&nbsp;<u>natural selection favouring AIs over humans</u></a>. Since 1 M years <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_extinction_rate%23Lifespan_estimates\"><u>is</u></a>&nbsp;the typical lifespan of a mammal species, my prior extinction risk from AI in a random year this century is 10^-6 (= 1/10^6). Further accounting for inside view considerations, I guess the extinction risk from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/artificial-intelligence\"><u>AI</u></a>&nbsp;in a random year from 2025 to 2050 is 0.001 %.

So I get a sense the extinction risk from nuclear war was massively overestimated in XPT. Do you agree? If yes, should one put little trust in other estimates of extinction risk from XPT? I think&nbsp;so. Still, I believe the XPT was quite valuable given the wealth of information shared in the report explaining the rationale for the forecasts (see Appendix 7).</p><p>One could argue the large gap between XPT\u2019s estimates and mine points to me not having sufficiently updated my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/independent-impressions\"><u>independent impression</u></a>. I agree <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/epistemic-deference\"><u>epistemic deference</u></a>&nbsp;is valuable in general, but it is unclear to me whether I should be deferring more:</p><ul><li>I am familiar with what informed XPT\u2019s nuclear extinction risk predictions, having read the respective sections \u201cSources of agreement, disagreement and uncertainty\u201d, \u201cArguments given for low-end forecasts\u201d, and \u201cArguments given for higher-end forecasts\u201d (pp. 298 to 303).</li><li>Some participants in the XPT seemed to believe in a much lower nuclear extinction risk than the medians I presented (emphasis mine):<ul><li>\u201cMost forecasters&nbsp;whose probabilities were near the median factored in a range of possible risks, including world wars, nuclear winters, and even artificial-intelligence-driven NERs [nuclear extinction risks], but concluded that<strong>&nbsp;even under worst case scenarios, the</strong> <strong>extinction of humanity (give or take 5000 people) would be near impossible</strong>...even if an NER [nuclear existential risk] had set humanity on a path that made eventual extinction a foregone conclusion, existing resources on earth would allow at least 5000 survivors to hang on for seventy-eight years\u201d.</li><li>\u201cFor many, the thought of getting to <strong>less than 5000 humans alive</strong>&nbsp;was <strong>simply too far fetched</strong>&nbsp;an outcome and they couldn't be persuaded otherwise in what they saw as credible scenarios\u201d.</li><li>\u201c[T]he set of circumstances required for this to happen are quite low, though obviously not impossible. These circumstances are that there will be a nuclear conflict between 2 nations both capable and willing to fire at everyone everywhere between the two of them: 'very bad case scenarios' where India and Pakistan, or the US and Russia, or China and anyone else, fired everything they had at just each other, or even at each other and each other's close allies, would likely not cause extinction\u2026<strong>it requires some of the big nuclear powers to decide to try to take literally everyone down with them, and that they actually succeed</strong>\u201d.</li><li>\u201cSo we think that the probabilities in this question are dominated by scenarios of total nuclear war before 2050 which cause civilizational and climate collapse to the point where long-term survival becomes impossible to save for very well-prepared shelters. But even pessimistic scenarios seem unlikely to lead to a collapse that is fast enough to reduce the global population to below 5000 by 2100\u201d.</li><li>\u201c<strong>There aren't compelling arguments on the higher end</strong>&nbsp;for this question again due to the fact that this is a very high bar to achieve\u201d.</li><li>\u201cThe team predicts that there will be pockets of people who survive in various regions of the world. Their survival may be at Neolithic standards, but there will be tribes of people who band together and restart mankind.

Nonetheless, my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#Extinction_risk_from_nuclear_war\"><u>estimates</u></a>&nbsp;imply the annual probability of a nuclear war causing (globally) insufficient calorie production is 0.0553 % (= 0.0131*0.0422). This suggests food distribution rather than production will be the bottleneck to decrease famine deaths in the vast majority of circumstances, as is the case today<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"37\" data-footnote-id=\"ln4x34e4eo\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefln4x34e4eo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnln4x34e4eo\">[37]</a></sup></span>. So I think increasing calorie production via new (or massively scaled up) food sectors, like <a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/alvarado2019%2520Greenhouses%2520ramp%2520up.pdf\"><u>greenhouse crop production</u></a>, <a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/rapid_repurposing.pdf\"><u>lignocellulosic sugar</u></a>, <a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Methane%2520SCP.pdf\"><u>methane single cell protein</u></a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Nuclear%2520Winter%2520Seaweed.pdf\"><u>seaweed</u></a>, is less cost-effective to save lives than measures targeting distribution, like ones aiming to ensure the continuation of international food trade.</p><p>One of the anonymous reviewers commented the aforementioned new food sectors \u201care definitely helpful for loss of international trade scenarios\u201d. I suspect the reviewer has something like the following in mind:</p><ul><li>From Fig. 5b of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0\"><u>Xia 2022</u></a>, the minimum&nbsp;soot&nbsp;injected into the stratosphere for insufficient calorie consumption is 10 Tg<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"38\" data-footnote-id=\"mv3qitig9y\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmv3qitig9y\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmv3qitig9y\">[38]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;given no international food trade, consumption of all edible livestock feed, and no household food waste.</li><li>In contrast, I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6KNSCxsTAh7wCoHko/nuclear-war-tail-risk-has-been-exaggerated#Extinction_risk_from_nuclear_war\"><u>estimated</u></a>&nbsp;a minimum soot injected into the stratosphere for insufficient calorie production of 84.2 Tg, supposing the net effect on calorie production of all the adaptation measures is similar to assuming equitable food distribution, consumption of all edible livestock feed, and no household food waste.</li></ul><p>I think the reviewer may be concluding from the above that, given no international food trade, calorie consumption would be much lower, and therefore increasing food production via new food sectors would become much more important relative to distribution. I agree with the former, but not the latter. Loss of international food trade is more of a problem of food distribution than production. If this increased thanks to new food sectors, but could not be distributed to low-income food-deficit countries (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/lifdc/en/\"><u>LIFDCs</u></a>) due to loss of trade, there would still be many famine deaths there. Many LIFDCs are in tropical regions too, where there is a smaller decrease in crop yields during a nuclear winter (see Fig. 4 of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0\"><u>Xia 2022</u></a>).</p><p>Furthermore, greater loss of trade and supply chain disruptions will be associated with greater loss of population and infrastructure, which in turn will arguably make solutions relying on new food sectors less likely to be successful relative to ones leveraging existing sectors. Examples of the latter include decreasing animal and biofuel production which relies on edible crops, expanding crop area, and using more cold-tolerant crops.</p><p>My point about distribution rather than production being a bottleneck loses strength as the severity of the nuclear winter increases. For an injection of soot into the stratosphere of 150 Tg, the calorie consumption given equitable food distribution, consumption of all edible livestock feed, and no household food waste would be 1.08 k kcal/person/d (see Fig. 5a of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0\"><u>Xia 2022</u></a>), which is just 56.5 % (= 1.08*10^3/(1.91*10^3)) of the minimum caloric requirement. Producing more calories would be crucial in this case. Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0\"><u>Xia 2022</u></a>\u2019s 150 Tg scenario involves 4.4 k nuclear detonations (see Table 1). The disruptions to international food trade caused by these would be so extensive that it would be especially useful for countries to have local resilience, such as by producing their own food.</p><p>Finally, there is a risk that focussing on new food sectors <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/counterfactual-reasoning\"><u>counterfactually</u></a>&nbsp;increases the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/farmed-animal-welfare\"><u>suffering of farmed animals</u></a>&nbsp;without decreasing starvation (not to mention the meat-eater <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gktZ8zuzyh7HEgjfc/famine-deaths-due-to-the-climatic-effects-of-nuclear-war%23Nearterm_perspective1\"><u>problem</u></a>). Some countries may not need to consume all edible livestock feed to mitigate starvation, in which case increasing production from new food sectors could allow for greater consumption of farmed animals with bad lives.

The views that we express in this article are our views, and we are not speaking for the fund.</p><h1>Personal/Project background</h1><p>Before delving into our project we\u2019ll provide a quick background of our profiles and how we got to starting this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Koen</strong><br>During my Masters in Maritime/Offshore engineering (building floating things) I got interested in animal welfare. Due to engagement with my EA university group (EA Delft) and by attending EAG(x)Rotterdam I became interested and motivated to use my career to work on animal welfare. I hoped to apply my maritime engineering background in a meaningful way, which led me to consider aquatic animal welfare.&nbsp;I attended EAGLondon in 2023 with the goal of finding career opportunities and surprisingly this worked! I talked to many with backgrounds in animal welfare (AW) and engineering and in one of my 1on1\u2019s I met someone who would later connect me with Ren.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ren&nbsp;</strong><br>As a researcher, Ren has been working at Animal Ask for the past couple of years conducting research to support the animal advocacy movement. However, Ren still feels really sad about the scale of suffering endured by animals, and this was the motivation to launch a side project.</p><h1>Why work on Mediterranean fish welfare?</h1><p>This project originated out of a desire to work on alleviating extreme-suffering. More background on the arguments to focus on extreme-suffering is discussed in Ren\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xtcgsLA2G8bn8vj99/reminding-myself-just-how-awful-pain-can-get-plus-an\"><u>earlier&nbsp;</u></a><u>forum post</u>. When the welfare of nonhuman animals is not taken into account during slaughter, extreme-suffering is likely to occur. Also, from Ren's existing work at Animal Ask, they knew that stunning before slaughter is often quite well-understood and tractable.</p><p>Therefore, Ren&nbsp;<strong>produced a systematic spreadsheet of every farmed animal industry in developed countries</strong> (i.e., those countries where Ren felt safe and comfortable working). This spreadsheet included information on a) the number of animals killed, and b) whether those animals were already being stunned before slaughter. Three industries emerged as sources of large-scale, intense suffering:</p><p>1. Farmed shrimp in the United States,</p><p>2. Farmed shrimp in Australia, and</p><p>3. Sea bass and sea bream in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Ren actually looked at farmed shrimp initially, and work on these projects may continue in the future, but there are some technical reasons why work on these projects needs to wait for a year or so. Therefore, Ren decided to pursue the project on sea bass and sea bream farmed in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Annually an estimated 51-167 billion farmed fish are slaughtered after a life in confinement. Slaughter methods often do not take fish wellbeing into account at all. In Europe, 419 million Sea Bass and Sea Bream are slaughtered each year. Currently, almost all Sea Bass and Sea Bream are killed by live chilling (immersion in ice/ice slurry slurry), followed by gill cutting. With this slaughter method the Sea Bass and Sea Bream can remain conscious for between 5 and 40 minutes.&nbsp; During this period,&nbsp;<strong>the fish show </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/jn_owQv-YOk?si=yFTn3LpDTlwM6sE1&amp;t=173\"><strong>signs of immense suffering</strong></a>, including&nbsp;<u>vigorous attempts to escape</u>.</p><p>Equipment exists that stun fish so that they will no longer have to endure this extreme suffering. Companies have developed electrical stunning systems (ESS) that either electrify the fish out of water or when still submerged. Supporting or pushing the industry to implement these techniques could be tractable for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Improved quality of flesh:</strong> Research is indicating that properly stunned fish endure less stress at the end of their life. In the current situation the fishes struggle for life leads to acid build up in muscle tissue, potentially leading to a worse flesh quality and shorter shelf life for the final product.</li><li><strong>Ease of operation:</strong> When installing a combination of a fish pump and stunning device operations can lead to easier handling of fish.</li><li><strong>Funding:</strong> It can be possible to apply for funding from existing European Union funds aimed at working on animal health and welfare in aquaculture.</li></ul><p>Another reason for pursuing this intervention was that working on farmed fish in the Mediterranean could make influential countries more supportive of welfare reform during upcoming fish welfare negotiations at the EU.&nbsp; At the start of our project it was expected that new animal welfare regulations were going to be announced, as promised by the EU after the \u201cend the cage age\u201d initiative. If the most influential countries in the EU each had a proof of concept installed on one of their farms this could make them more receptive to stunning regulations for farmed fish.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our initial research, which consisted of meeting with one animal welfare group in the Mediterranean we also concluded that the work on this topic was limited.</p><p>Some related fun fish facts:</p><ul><li>Some Sea Bream change sex, male to female, at 2-3 years old. They can also have offspring with other types of fish, a type of hybridization. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6123679/\">source</a></li><li>Electric eels and other electric fish actually stun their prey before eating them\u2014how nice of them! Also, 'Electrophorus electricus' is a pretty cool name, if you ask me.</li></ul><h1>Project plans and initial work</h1><p><strong>Before we obtained our funding we started drafting a project plan and theory of change</strong>. Our initial project plans were focused on obtaining proof of concepts for ESS in three influential countries. Our reasoning for this was that having a company operating in your country using ESS would allow for a better discussion around the topic and could create more support for adopting new regulations. Having received funds for our \u201cminimal funding\u201d &nbsp;scenario (more on this later) we changed our plans to only focusing on the initial steps of our theory of change; obtaining information by networking and studying available literature. If after six months an internal evaluation showed that our theory of change was still valid we would continue our work by and apply for additional funding.</p><p>We identified two crucial considerations that are essential to achieving our impact and that could later on &nbsp;help us evaluate if we should be continuing our work:</p><ul><li><strong>Blending into the industry</strong>; A large part of our impact will be achieved through obtaining connections that are willing to work with us and provide us with information that is not accessible by literature reviews. The strategy for this was to frame ourselves as an industry friendly group that is mostly focused on helping farmers achieve a better product through the use of electrical stunning. If we are unable to obtain these contacts gathering information and advocacy is going to be difficult.</li><li><strong>Added value of starting a new organization; </strong>Given that there are existing efforts addressing this subject, a critical assessment of the added value our organization brings is crucial. Should our evaluations during the project reveal that our strategies are less effective than anticipated, or that other established groups are better positioned to achieve the desired outcomes, we should consider ceasing our operations.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/bs66aqrmr9tvtsfqnlcd\"><figcaption>Theory of change</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Obtaining funding</strong><br>After deciding to advance with the project we drafted a funding application. We based our funding request on a minimum, comfortable and maximum scenario that would cover our travel expenses and a salary based on 0.5 FTE. End of July 2023 we submitted our request to the EA Animal Welfare Fund. We proposed three funding scenarios in our application:</p><ul><li><strong>Minimal Funding:</strong> $30,000 USD, covering the bare essentials to initiate our project.</li><li><strong>Comfortable Funding:</strong> $50,000 USD, allowing for a more flexible and effective project execution.</li><li><strong>Maximal Funding:</strong> $150,000 USD, funding for a full three years of research and advocacy.</li></ul><p>The budget breakdown was as follows:</p><ul><li>Salary for Ren (0.5 FTE) - 30%</li><li>Salary for Koen (0.5 FTE) - 40%</li><li>Travel - 15%</li><li>Admin/Legal - 5%</li><li>Buffer - 10%</li></ul><p>Communication with the fund informed us that our \u201cproof of concept\u201d plan might not be as useful as hoped. Discussion with the fund led us to focus more on gathering available information and perspectives.&nbsp;<strong>For</strong> <strong>this we obtained funding to cover half a year of expenses + salary totaling $18,000 USD.</strong> The limited amount of funding led to Ren giving up their share of the salary, as they had a steady income at Animal Ask.&nbsp; We obtained our funding confirmation early September allowing us to officially start our work.&nbsp;<strong>Our experiences with applying for funding were very positive.</strong> Communication went smoothly and they were willing to discuss our plans and fine tune them to be more impactful.<strong> Due to our traveling expenses being less than expected we plan to return a share of the money to the EA animal welfare fund.</strong></p><h1>Initial work</h1><p>Once our goals and strategy were devised we started our first work which consisted of&nbsp;talking to animal welfare organizations in the Mediterranean, manufacturers of stunning equipment and others with relevant information/expertise. During this stage&nbsp;<strong>we also combined available literature into a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/o2ERcHHFBmbBn9Miu/slaughter-of-farmed-seabass-and-seabream-in-europe\"><strong><u>review</u></strong></a>. The initial two columns of the theory of change were expanded into the following questions:</p><ul><li>How likely is the industry to implement stunning themselves?</li><li>How would offering the industry more help (money + technical expertise) change things?</li><li>What views do fish farmers have on stunning equipment?</li><li>How much would it cost to implement stunners?</li><li>What funding is available for purchasing stunners from outside of the animal advocacy movement?</li></ul><p>Our main methods for answering these questions were conducting desk research and interviewing/visiting relevant stakeholders.&nbsp; The first actual work consisted of setting up online meetings with all organizations relevant to electrical stunning in Mediterranean aquaculture, including the AW orgs from Greece (<a href=\"https://hellenicanimalwelfare.org/\">Hellanic Animal Welfare Federation</a>), Spain (<a href=\"https://observatoriodebienestaranimal.org/\">Animal Welfare Observatory</a>), Italy (<a href=\"https://www.essereanimali.org/\">Esseri Animali</a>), France (<a href=\"https://welfarm.fr/\">Welfarm</a>) and T\u00fcrkiye (<a href=\"https://futureforfish.org/\">Future for Fish</a>) and manufacturers of stunning equipment.&nbsp;<strong>Setting up meetings took up a larger share of our work than expected.</strong> We started out by meeting the already established animal welfare organizations. These meetings were incredibly valuable and provided information that we would later use to plan our farmer outreach.&nbsp;</p><p>During the first stages of information gathering we observed that <strong>a surprisingly high amount of work to support stunning before slaughter of Sea Bass and Sea Bream in the Mediterranean was being done.</strong> At the start of the project we were aware of one company that was using ESS onboard a vessel and that work from animal welfare groups on this topic was very limited. During our meetings with the AW organizations we learned of more examples and of efforts focused on promoting ESS.&nbsp; Most surprising was that in November a Turkish organization,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureforfish.org/\"><u>Future for Fish</u></a>, was hosting a conference on ESS in Mediterranean aquaculture. Meetings with the manufacturers also indicated great efforts to promote their equipment to farmers. Recently a Spanish farming group even announced that they are <a href=\"https://www.ipacuicultura.com/noticia.php?id=69246\">tendering a project</a> to develop a new stunning device that is to be used for Sea Bass and Sea Bream.</p><p><strong>There was also lots of information available in the scholarly literature.</strong> For example, we found several papers that had reviewed the physical characteristics of fish farms in the Mediterranean (e.g. distance from coast), which helped to answer some of our research questions.</p><h1>Farmer outreach</h1><p>A large part of our research was planned to consist of interviews with fish farmers from multiple countries. AW groups informed us that animal focused outreach did not prove effective when reaching out to farmers. This led us to adopt a farmer friendly framing. As a new, unknown group we had&nbsp; the possibility to create a new entity that could be more appealing to farmers.&nbsp;<strong>With the help of&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://veganhacktivists.org/\"><strong><u>Vegan Hacktivists&nbsp;</u></strong></a><strong>and&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://veganlinguists.org/\"><strong><u>Vegan Linguists</u></strong></a><strong> we created a website</strong> that would make us look farmer friendly under the name Piscivita<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref70e3zrutc4w\"><sup><a href=\"#fn70e3zrutc4w\">[1]</a></sup></span>. We reached out to around 60 fish farmers in Greece, Italy and T\u00fcrkiye.&nbsp; The first round of emails we sent out to farmers used the following framing:</p><p>\u201c<i>I am a researcher for Piscivita, an organization aimed at providing advice and support for fish farmers. We are currently researching how electrical stunning equipment could benefit fish producers. We plan to develop recommendations that we will provide to policymakers and other stakeholders at the national and European level. We want to ensure that farmers' needs are taken into account and that is why we could use your help.</i>\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>After this we asked whether it would be possible to visit their farm to try to understand their operations and what problems they might face when deciding to introduce ESS into their operations. Emails were translated to the recipient's language.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This approach did not work</strong>. From our ~60 emails we only received one reply stating that their facilities were currently being upgraded and would not have time to let us visit. A different group advised us to try to get in through an introduction from a contact the farmer already knows. We were able to obtain some contact information through a stunning manufacturer we were in contact with. However, this also did not prove to be successful.&nbsp;</p><p>After our first failed attempt we tried again. This time we told the farmers that we were a consultancy agency focused on the economic benefits of ESS, such as increased shelf life and easier operations. Our new outreach was focused on the types of services that we could offer to fish farmers, such as;</p><ul><li><strong>Identifying the right equipment for their specific needs:</strong> evaluating the size of their farm and processing practices to recommend the most ESS for their operation.</li><li><strong>Simplifying the procurement process:</strong> &nbsp;connecting farmers with reliable manufacturers and negotiate favorable price lists to ensure they receive the best value for your investment.</li><li><strong>Providing help with installation and training of staff:</strong> ensuring the smooth integration of the equipment into your farm operations, providing expert guidance and training for your staff.</li><li><strong>Exploring financing options:</strong> assisting in securing financing to support the acquisition of electric shock equipment. We told them we could collaborate with various organizations that provide financial support to aquaculture businesses that can help them navigate through the application process.</li></ul><p><strong>This also did not work. We did not receive any replies.</strong> Our main hypothesis for why this did not work is that an email with this framing ends up being one of the many sales-type emails that a company receives. There might be other ways in which this does work, we are definitely no experts in marketing, but if anyone else tries this it might be worth it to hire an expert in marketing or copy writing.</p><p>We also learned that other organizations also had a hard time getting in contact with fish farmers. One group that was successful managed to get in contact with multiple farmers by working together with an academic advisor. A different method to come in contact with farmers could be trying to get into working groups with academics and industry representatives, this was not tried for this project.</p><p>To still try and obtain relevant information we planned a trip to T\u00fcrkiye that would start with the ESS conference hosted by Future for Fish in Izmir. Since Ren lives in Australia we decided that it would be easier if Max, a colleague of Ren from Animal Ask, would join the trip. At this conference we hoped to talk to fish farmers to arrange visits on their farms. <strong>The conference itself was very impressive</strong>; government officials, academics, industry and NGOs were present and discussed how ESS could be beneficial for aquaculture and fish welfare. <strong>When we started our project we did not expect that such a conference, with a focus on fish welfare, would be possible. </strong>Speaking to farmers during the conference proved difficult due to the language barrier and difficulty finding interpreters. After the conference we stayed in the Izmir region and kept trying to reach out to farmers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We also made sure to enjoy our trip and tried some Turkish coffee and petted some of the stray cats.</strong> One of these cats gave me fleas so I will no longer engage in petting stray cats (perhaps a more effective strategy is to love them from a distance!).</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:72.68%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/xe4i8skga5f4e8guw784\"><figcaption>A group of cats in Ephesus</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:34.71%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/zvcnypoevmpg0cyl9v02\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/nvohkcndp6wznsgixttj 230w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/yhyqqg1mswusqlrmx9p3 460w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/dka86e5fmfr30qk8lwvo 690w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/zfahek9mfvbtub0vxpb8 920w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/xtkkiap1bkfyvinkh2lq 1150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/gxlyz6svwvwhv4tdhjdk 1380w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/catzztwu90xtidngatql 1610w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/mnkusjcaabsmtlmn6oku 1840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/qhsay8j23nrpsrbcqmpz 2070w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/ty8hswljnc3ljfjuakg3 2252w\"><figcaption>A Turkish Coffee (and some weird blue drink)</figcaption></figure><p>We also did two trips aimed at obtaining visual data from fish farms.<strong> We were able to approach many on-shore production facilities</strong>, but upon arrival, we were unable to get any closer. Most farms seemed to have strict check-in gates to enter the premises. We did however get an ok view of the onshore facilities and managed to get some good views of the construction of offshore net cages and the ships used in the harvesting process. Despite not obtaining much new information it was valuable to actually see everything happening in person. It also allowed us to obtain some copyright free pictures/video. Due to the actual net cages being far from shore and in obscure locations it was difficult to get a good view of, only the ones near coastal roads were accessible. Good binoculars or a drone would have helped us get a better view of the farms and ships that were operating in the field.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:73.01%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/c12dfn0uipgeclohjiez\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/gfw7uqkbu7m8waz2ukqq 410w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/cpsf2gxjz2e0dwxyudrd 820w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/dcunbdl8lfyxzyncuug8 1230w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/wviqj4urduyzwoy9z2kc 1640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/eqe4iqlvknwqnbbmmex3 2050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/gvwv5zdch2ycm13ccjon 2460w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/i9dqy75f3xgdabpgcp69 2870w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/uhwvjlrwniqq6exjlxl4 3280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/m0lnwvgluxxlw82howch 3690w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/ako3oglahfwmoxjicdqd 4032w\"><figcaption>Transfer of ice slurry crates probably filled with SBSB from ship to truck</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:72.59%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z59wybc56FCAysrAe/c6tjigqzo7dk2dmcnsid\"><figcaption>Harvesting operations</figcaption></figure><p>Returning from T\u00fcrkiye we continued working on our research. We kept trying to reach out to farmers and we managed to get some of our questions answered through the help of an EA contact we met in T\u00fcrkiye. Also, we realized that&nbsp;<strong>some of our questions could be answered using publicly available aerial imagery and spatial data</strong>. This was a perk of Ren being a data nerd. There is lots of spatial (GIS) data available on the internet with a little bit of digging, such as the coordinates of many farms; aerial imagery of the entire coastline of Spain, Greece, and Italy; and so on. This was imperfect, but it enabled us to collect some data on the physical characteristics of farms (e.g. size, number of pens, distance from coast, wave energy).&nbsp;</p><h1>Wrapping up the project</h1><p>Having a better overview of the industry and the work being conducted by various groups we decided to not apply for further funding. &nbsp;Our main reasons for this are:</p><ul><li>More work is being done in the area than we initially expected. In T\u00fcrkiye, Italy and Spain groups are actively working on aquaculture. Greece has no groups focused on improving fish welfare however, Charity Entrepreneurship is possibly starting a charity focused on advocating for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_ed10c994f0ce4364b85d5c72bad1d6e6.pdf\"><u>fish welfare improvements Greece</u></a>. We do emphasize that this was a risk that we were aware of from the beginning, and one focus of our pilot project was making an informed decision about this crucial consideration.</li><li>Our farmer friendly approach did not work as expected. We assumed that&nbsp; being able to approach farmers with a message that was not focused around animal welfare could give us an advantage compared to already established animal welfare groups.&nbsp;</li><li>Our original big plans were based on influencing policy in the European Union. When the EU dropped/delayed their animal welfare plans the expected impact of our plan to do more outreach decreased.</li></ul><p>Based on the earlier mentioned crucial considerations&nbsp;<strong> we decided that the impact of continuing work according to the original plan would not be as valuable as funding already existing groups or trying out new strategies.</strong></p><p>We decided that we would try to publish our findings as a <a href=\"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.1338/v1\">research article</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/i4vihmhtki7pbKLxq/how-to-publish-research-in-peer-reviewed-journals\"><u>A recent post by Ren</u></a> goes more into the considerations around this. Along with this we also wrote a funding recommendation that we will provide to the animal welfare fund with an overview of possible new interventions and existing organizations that are working towards stunning in Mediterranean Aquaculture.</p><h1>Other takeaways from starting a project</h1><ul><li>Working alongside Ren, who has experience in the EA and AW communities, proved to be immensely beneficial for me, Koen, in various aspects. Collaborating with someone who is already established and recognized in these fields significantly boosted my entry into a career related to EA. Ren's credentials were not only helpful in securing funding and other non-technical aspects of starting a project, but they also facilitated valuable networking opportunities. Without this partnership, I doubt I would have had the confidence to independently initiate a project, especially one aimed at securing funds for a cause area with limited resources. Additionally, dealing with cases involving extreme suffering was often challenging. Adapting to this aspect of the work was made easier by having someone to discuss this with, and Ren's willingness to share their insights and experiences was incredibly supportive.&nbsp;</li><li>We were surprised by the amount of resources and help available. As mentioned we were helped by the <a href=\"https://veganhacktivists.org/\">Vegan Hacktivists</a> and <a href=\"https://veganlinguists.org/\">Vegan Linguists</a> for our website, all other interactions with people form the AW or EA world were very positive and everyone was really supportive and willing to help.</li><li>Outreach was more difficult than expected; hiring someone with more experience, such as a copywriter, could be useful for future projects.</li><li>Working on this remotely was difficult at times. Being able to work from the EA Netherlands office and the EA gather town was valuable in increasing productivity and made working more fun.</li><li>Overall, despite the fact that the project \"failed\", we see the overall experience as a positive one. Most new charities fail - that is part of the game. <strong>The important thing is to figure out as quickly as possible whether your idea is a good one, and we believe that we succeeded in doing so.</strong></li><li>We found that there is a lot of value to simply giving a project our best shot - in our case, this was flying to T\u00fcrkiye, attending a conference, driving around and looking at farms, digging for relevant data on the internet, and so on. <strong>Perseverance, when advised by a clear theory of change, is 90% of the journey.</strong></li></ul><h1>Resources for launching a new charity</h1><p>1.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Launch-High-Impact-Nonprofit-Joey-Savoie/dp/B09NGTB8YR\"><i>How to Launch a High-Impact Nonprofit&nbsp;</i>by Charity Entrepreneurship</a> - this is an absolute, 100%, certified banger. We believe that everybody in the EA movement could benefit from reading this book, and this is doubly true for people who are launching their own project or charity.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lean_Startup\">2.&nbsp;<i>The Lean Startup</i> by Eric Ries</a> - this expands on some of the philosophies used by the Charity Entrepreneurship book, though from a for-profit perspective rather than an impact perspective.</p><p>3. Ask around! We were humbled by the amount of support that we received from other organizations in the EA movement, including existing fish welfare organizations, Vegan Hacktivists, Vegan Linguists, the funders, and so on. Most people in the movement seem happy to chat via email or a video call - we all have the same goal. These contacts were concretely useful and saved us a&nbsp;<i>lot</i> of time, for which we are immensely grateful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Acknowledgement: Thanks to everyone who aided us during this project and Jan Wehner for providing feedback on this post.</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn70e3zrutc4w\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref70e3zrutc4w\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Other great contenders for our name were: &nbsp;the Prescipisces, Happier fish institute, What we owe the fish and The fish you can save.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "KvPelt"}}, {"_id": "B99Wk4n6yvJFrzL6w", "title": "Marginal Revolution University's courses and series", "postedAt": "2024-03-01T18:25:25.206Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8yDsenRQhNF4HEDwu/link-posting-is-an-act-of-community-service\">linkpost</a> for the online <a href=\"https://mru.org/learn\">courses and series</a> of the Marginal Revolution University<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"c4vftxmfigr\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc4vftxmfigr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc4vftxmfigr\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(MRU):</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/development-economics\">Development Economics</a> by Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen (course). \"Economic growth, geography, trade, property rights, foreign aid, politics, poverty, migration, education, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/economic-history-soviet-union\">Economic History of the Soviet Union</a> by Guinevere Liberty Nell (course). \"Marxist Utopianism, The New Economic Policy in crisis, Stalin's rise, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/economics-media\">Economics of the Media</a> by Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen (course). \"Basic economics of the media, media bias, media and government, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/economists-wild\">Economists in the Wild</a> (series). \"A video series that profiles economists and their adventures with real-world research\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/everyday-economics\">Everyday Economics</a> by Alex Tabarrok, Don Boudreaux, Ian Bremmer and Tyler Cowen (series). \"How do the \u201cbig ideas\u201d from economics relate to everyday topics?\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/great-economists-classical-economics-and-its-forerunners\">Great Economists: Classical Economics and Its Forerunners</a> by Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen (course). \"Isaac Gervaise, Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Hayek, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/international-finance\">International Finance</a> by Alex Tabarrok, Don Boudreaux, Ian Bremmer and Tyler Cowen (course). \"Exchange rates, currency issues, Euro Crisis, international trade, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/international-trade\">International Trade</a> by Alex Tabarrok, Don Boudreaux, Ian Bremmer and Tyler Cowen (course). \"Comparative advantage, increasing returns to scale, factor endowments, arbitrage across borders, tariffs, NAFTA, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/mastering-econometrics-joshua-angrist\">Mastering Econometrics with Joshua Angrist</a> (course). \"Ceteris paribus, selection bias, randomized trials, regression, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, diff-in-diff, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/mexicos-economy-current-prospects-and-history\">Mexico's Economy: Current Prospects and History</a> by Robin Grier (course). \"Growth, independence, development strategies, reforms, Peso Crisis, NAFTA, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/money-skills\">Money Skills</a> by Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen (course). \"Investing, career, efficient market hypothesis, compound returns, renting vs. buying, behavioral finance, and more\".</li><li><a href=\"https://mru.org/nobel-conversations\">Nobel Conversations</a> (series). \"An interview series featuring Nobel laureates Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens.

for how the strategic decision-making of EA community building (CB) could be improved, and get feedback from the community. More than anything I wish to expand my knowledge about meta EA strategy, build connections, and engage with the community. I am open to feedback, especially from those who think I might be concentrating on the wrong aspects, or who offer insights not directly related to this specific issue but pertinent to community building as a whole. Such perspectives would broaden my understanding of this and other related matters.</p><p>Note*</p><p>This piece might not be perfect and could have several incomplete claims or ideas. I'm open to expanding on them if there's interest. Please feel free to highlight any issues or unclear points. I decided to share this now because I have surpassed my self-imposed deadline and I believe in the value of receiving feedback on imperfect work.</p><h1>Executive Summary</h1><p>Based on my experiences with EA community building and mentoring through the CEA Organisational Support Programme, this piece aims to share practical ways to improve community building in the EA movement. It pinpoints the issue of inconsistent understanding and practices within the community and suggests two solutions: launching a Fellowship for community builders and starting a Podcast to share insights. These ideas are meant to unify our knowledge base, welcome diverse thoughts, and enhance the support system for community builders. The need for these initiatives is backed by my work with university groups and discussions with fellow mentors, highlighting the collective push for evidence-backed, effective community engagement.</p><p><strong>Caveat</strong>: While I believe there are ways to enhance the epistemic health of EA groups overall, this post primarily addresses marginal groups, especially university groups. These groups often struggle with weaker epistemic norms due to frequent leadership changes, alongside new groups that are excited about EA's ideas but lack a deep understanding of the arguments supporting those ideas.</p><p><strong>Premise 1</strong>: The success of meta EA CB currently relies on many group organisers being naturally capable CBers, correctly understanding the meta strategy and implementing the Operational best practice without having received any particular training or knowledge on how to perform their role, leading to widely varying experiences and epistemic strength among members of different EA groups.</p><ul><li><strong>Meta</strong>: The guiding principles/strategy of what CB hopes to achieve</li><li><strong>Operational</strong>: Best practice and tactical implementation on how to achieve meta-strategies</li></ul><p><strong>Premise 2</strong>: Community Building involves teachable skills, or best practices, which can be utilised to help many organisers address predictable issues across different cultures and countries.</p><p><strong>Premise 3</strong>: Providing a framework for scalable opportunities can enhance meta Community Building (CB).</p><p><strong>Solutions</strong>: Two potential proposals I have thought of which have some historical precedence in the EA space are:</p><ol><li>Community-Building Fellowship</li><li>Community-Building focused Podcast akin to 80K Hours\u2019</li></ol><h1>Introduction:</h1><h2>Where I am coming from</h2><p>Whilst I recognise that my experience in Community Building is not exhaustive, I have been a part of several different communities, ranging from Effective Altruism to sports teams as a player and coach, union branches, and working as a high school teacher. Throughout all of these different groups, I have felt various levels of a culture of \u2018Belonging\u2019 similar to what Owen Eastwood speaks to in his book of the same name. Culture is defined by Eastwood as \u201cthe environment and the outcome of how we feel when interacting with a group or setting\u201d. Belonging is subsequently a feeling that is then generated by the culture of the group that we interact with. I am glad to say that the closest natural sense of belonging that I have had in a community has been in the Effective Altruism community.&nbsp;</p><p>This came from two places. Firstly, my brother was already in EA and had invited me along over a significant period. However, mostly, it was because, like many who are exposed to the group, I was met with intellectual curiosity and encouraged to explore weird and interesting ideas about how to help others. This exercise, more than anything, is why I continue to be involved with Effective Altruism; I feel that many of the values EA engenders reflect my values.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I have observed, through my readings on the EA Forum, a variety of beliefs and interpretations regarding these values and their implementation within the community. This diversity of understanding appears to be more pronounced on the peripheries of EA and in the realm of Community Building. In these areas, individuals with a limited grasp of the subject matter often engage in recruitment efforts, a process that can resemble the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect\"><u>Dunning-Kruger Effect</u></a>. In such instances, community builders with less epistemic humility may inadvertently compromise the epistemic integrity of EA. Furthermore, these individuals are less likely to receive direct guidance from organisations like CEA. This is partly due to the limited overall benefit their groups might offer and the substantial resources required under the current 1-1 mentorship system to adequately train these organisers before actively supporting their outreach initiatives.</p><h2>Problems with Inconsistent Community Norms and Epistemics</h2><p>Effective Altruism (EA) advocates for the Scout Mindset, a value of open-mindedness and a commitment to truth-seeking. However, its practical application within many EA groups appears to be a subject of concern. There seems to be a gap between promoting the Scout Mindset and possessing the skills or comfort level to apply it effectively, particularly when it comes to acknowledging and expressing uncertainties. This issue is highlighted by numerous posts on the EA Forum, where individuals have expressed concerns about the epistemic strength of their local EA community or the EA community at large. The significant level of engagement these posts have received underscores the relevance and urgency of these claims, suggesting a need for deeper introspection and action within the EA community regarding the implementation of the Scout Mindset.</p><p>One former EA group organiser from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/euzDpFvbLqPdwCnXF/university-ea-groups-need-fixing\"><u>EA Columbia</u></a> describes EA as ostensibly open but, in practice, seemingly operating under predetermined conclusions. The author suggests that dissent, in coming to a different conclusion, seems to be dismissed as a lack of understanding of the evidence or applying flawed methodologies rather than a valid perspective. This attitude highlights the difference between the external alignment of Scout Mindset values that EA espouses vs the lack of internal alignment of individual organisers or groups. This can lead to weak epistemics and groupthink dynamics, where agreement with certain positions is driven more by social conformity within the group's hierarchy than by a deep understanding of the arguments. With a Karma score of 362 and over 100 comments at the time of writing, many in the EA community seem to resonate with Dave\u2019s concerns. Many of these comments highlight shared similar concerns or experiences, although it is good to note that several comments contest personally sharing the experiences discussed.&nbsp;</p><p>Another post explores how some have become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MjTB4MvtedbLjgyja/leaning-into-ea-disillusionment#3__Some_factors_driving_EA_disillusionment\"><u>disillusioned with EA</u></a>. It agrees with the argument that there is incongruence in the internal vs external alignment of Scout Mindset exists, but highlights that those with thoughtful critiques are more likely to leave the community as these critiques go unaddressed, either through lack of pursuit of them and remain silent, or through growing demand for higher quality answers. The author focuses primarily on core EA beliefs and claims around what works best being far less reliable/concrete than what their experience, and those of others they talk to, have witnessed. The author implicitly asks community builders, as community builders are the ones most likely to engage newer community members, to improve their reasoning transparency to minimise the halo effect that some may experience when initially getting involved with EA. While I haven\u2019t noticed this as an issue in my personal experience, it seems as though their concerns again resonate with many in the community, receiving 412 Karma with over 60 comments.</p><h2>Primary Contributing Factors [CB Practices]&nbsp;</h2><p>I think inconsistency in the strength of EA norms and epistemics across different groups can be explained by insufficient support in two places: 1) a lack of specificity about what EA CB is aiming to achieve and how this can be tracked, and 2) lack of practical support for group organisers to use available guidance and resources.&nbsp;</p><h3>A lack of specificity about what EA CB is aiming to achieve and how this can be tracked</h3><p>Largely fueled by a combination of group organisers lacking CB that\u2019s driven to recruit new members as its highest (one of its highest?) priority. The number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/cea-grew-a-lot-in-the-past-year\"><u>Highly Engaged EAs</u></a> (HEAs) a group can produce is a primary success metric used in much of the rhetoric and advice given by CEA for effective CB, HEA is a placeholder signifying in-depth engagement or personal transformation. The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) suggests that the success of EA groups should be measured by the number of Highly Engaged EAs, or \u201cDeep Engagement\u201d on the CEA&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/groups-a-model-of-an-ea-group\"><u>Community Models&nbsp;</u></a>page. CEA makes a great effort at this in their Community Models Page in the Groups Resource Center, however, I feel like there is an undervaluation of gathering qualitative data on the internal change process and understanding engaged members as continued engagement does not, in and of itself, signal epistemic strength. University groups especially are going through constant change as people graduate and/or find EA in their second or third year. As a result, there's a tendency to rely on more easily measurable metrics like sign-ups or event attendance. This reliance, as cautioned by Goodhart\u2019s law, risks making these superficial metrics the primary goal. This is not to say that this issue is not known by CEA, but rather it continues as a problem without a clear solution. One other acronym that I have been told better aligns with modern directions for thinking about deep engagement with EA is TATSIS (Talented, Altruistic, Truth-seeking Individuals taking Significant action) but this again is relatively ambiguous.</p><p>The EA Forum post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2YASg3FojAemJwXZ9/community-builders-spend-too-much-time-community-building\"><u>'Community Builders Spend Too Much Time Community Building'</u></a> highlights how this outreach-centric approach can limit the most engaged members, the Community Builders, from developing skills pertinent to other EA projects or cause areas. This is an even larger counterfactual loss of impact if you consider the 80/20 rule, that 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people, with the Community Builders being the most engaged and likely to fit into the 20% doing 80% of the work/impact of their group. But, in my view, the larger cost of this approach lies not only in neglecting the advancement of knowledge in areas such as AI but also in the missed opportunities for developing more nuanced community-building skills, such as reading and testing out suggestions from Michael Notel\u2019s Forum Post \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZPNNnEu2HGNSNmifo/we-all-teach-here-s-how-to-do-it-better\"><u>We all teach, here is how to do it better</u></a>\u201d or Severin Seehrich\u2019s Lesswrong post \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/S9nFYEPY9dTnThrWt/community-building-lessons-from-ten-years-of-facilitation\"><u>Community Building: Lessons from ten years of facilitation experience</u></a>\u201d. Focusing on quantitative metrics can eclipse the qualitative growth of the community, hindering the development of skills essential for fostering high-quality engagement and deeper understanding within the EA movement. This was also tackled in a recent post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PhuWzoDC7pgwzEsye/things-newer-university-group-organisers-should-know-about\"><u>Things newer (university) groups organisers should know about</u></a> in the section \u2018On developing group members\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>This discussion on whether CB should be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2TdXocyDF9PxWewwY/should-the-ea-community-be-cause-first-or-member-first\"><u>Cause or Member focused</u></a> highlights a critical dichotomy within the EA community. By prioritizing high epistemic standards in member-focused CB, we empower members to make informed decisions about cause areas independently. This approach respects the intellectual capabilities of community members, allowing them to navigate the landscape of causes based on sound reasoning and personal conviction. In contrast, the practice of cause-focused CB risks undermining the epistemic health of our community in the long run. While it might accelerate alignment with certain cause areas deemed important by some, it does so at the potential cost of intellectual diversity and critical thinking.</p><p>However, I'm not entirely convinced that those engaging in 'cause first' community building are merely pushing their agendas without offering a balanced perspective. It's not that these community builders lack reasoning or fail to believe in the importance of their causes. Rather, my concern lies with the possibility that they may not sufficiently foster the development of critical reasoning among those they aim to engage. This approach can inadvertently prioritize recruitment over nurturing a deep, reasoned commitment to the cause.</p><p>In my mind, EA Community Building and Cause Area field building serve fundamentally different purposes. EA CB focuses on imparting knowledge and autonomy, enabling individuals to determine their best contributions to the world. Here, maintaining epistemic health is paramount. On the other hand, Cause-specific field building is more about expanding the capacity to work within specific areas\u2014recruitment and support for career opportunities take precedence. While both approaches have their merits, the latter's emphasis on recruitment risks sidelining the crucial aspect of why individuals choose to work in those areas, relying instead on aligning them with the philosophical beliefs or findings of the movement.</p><p>This distinction raises concerns about cause-specific field building's primary focus. If it leans too heavily on recruitment without fostering an understanding of the underlying reasons for working within a cause, we risk creating a community that operates on alignment rather than informed choice. Such a scenario could detract from the foundational principles of EA, where the ability to critically assess and choose causes based on reasoned judgment is key. In essence, while motivating people to 'just do something' is valuable, it must not come at the expense of the core belief that underpins EA: empowering individuals with the knowledge and reasoning to make informed decisions about their contributions to making the world a better place.</p><p>This issue appears structural due to the unclear stance of meta EA CB. The implicit emphasis on members over causes raises transparency concerns. While acknowledging ambiguity, my worry stems from the central aspect of Community Building lacking openness. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2TdXocyDF9PxWewwY/should-the-ea-community-be-cause-first-or-member-first?commentId=crMnSSgtuRKKWyCRu\"><u>comment</u></a> on Cause or Member-focused CB hints at a \"member-first\" approach within CEA's work, highlighting the need for clarity and transparency in Effective Altruism Community Building. Without clear communication on the wide variety of different stances that EA CB can take there is a lot of room for misalignment or misimplementation of the nuanced discussions that take place inside of EA and Community Building as a whole. By taking a more deliberate approach it, intuitively, feels like there is a greater opportunity to connect people together. One potential post that explores these thoughts more explicitly is \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rzT8m4RMFKvciuh9f/p/XweBntieePnzQyLtK\"><u>Rowing and Steering the Effective Altruism Community\u201d</u> which</a>, similarly to the Cause or Member-focused post, highlights the distinct CB efforts on a strategic vs tactical level. Where the strategic (steering) focus is on what the purpose of EA is, and the tactical (rowing) focus is on how to generate growth in power and influence. Using some of the language from the post, I would suggest that I highlight the Community's failure to steer. \u201c<strong>Community failures</strong> concerning culture, (epistemic) norms, homogeneity of worldviews or demographics, whether the movement should be large or narrow, etc.\u201d Lastly, the post,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xomFCNXwNBeXtLq53/bad-omens-in-current-community-building\"><u>Bad Omens in Current Community Building</u></a>, which self-identifies as attempting to provide some \u2018steering\u2019 on the issue of recruitment at the expense of epistemic strength continues to suggest this is an issue felt strongly by the EA community. The post received a Karma score of 568 on 346 votes and over 130 comments (at the time of writing).</p><h3>Lack of practical support for group organisers to use available guidance and resources.&nbsp;</h3><p>What resources currently exist?</p><ul><li>CEA run 1-1 Mentoring/Coaching<ul><li>Organisational Support Programme</li><li>University Group Accelerator Programme</li></ul></li><li>Freely Accessible Resources<ul><li>EA Forum</li><li>Groups Resource Hub</li><li>Groups Slack</li><li>EA Groups Newsletter</li></ul></li><li>Tangentially related to community-building skills/support<ul><li>Effective Thesis</li><li>80K Hours website + Podcast</li></ul></li></ul><p>I'd like to extend my appreciation for the substantial efforts of CEA in deploying resources effectively to support university groups around the globe. The role of mentors, with their expertise in Community Building, is undeniably pivotal in this process. It\u2019s understandable that, given the large number of potential mentees, mentors might face certain challenges. This situation, while natural in large-scale mentorship programs, could lead to variations in the mentorship experience.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the process for standardising the approach among mentors doesn\u2019t appear to be very stringent. This observation is not a criticism but an acknowledgment of the complexity and diversity of the mentorship landscape. Such flexibility can have advantages, allowing for a more personalised mentorship approach. However, it also suggests an opportunity for further refinement, perhaps by exploring balanced standardisation methods that respect the individuality of mentor-mentee relationships while ensuring a consistent level of guidance and support.</p><p>In light of this, along with anecdotal reports that some mentors are engaging with a significant number of mentees \u2013 at times up to 15, accounting for nearly half of their working hours \u2013 it becomes important to consider the efficiency and effectiveness of the current system. While the dedication shown by these mentors is commendable, there may be potential to streamline the process in a way that maximises the impact of their time and effort. Such an approach would not only support the mentors in their roles but also enhance the overall quality and impact of the mentorship provided.</p><h1>Solutions:</h1><p>Owen Eastwood, the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56264403\"><u>Belonging</u></a>, emphasises the importance of connecting people ritually and establishing standards for the vision and values of Community Building. While Eastwood primarily operates in diverse fields, notably within sports teams, he underscores that a successful group or organisation hinges on a sense of Belonging, clear communication and personalisation of values, things that are reflected in Michael\u2019s post linked earlier. In my view, Effective Altruism excels in articulating and embodying these values in interactions with highly engaged individuals, such as at a retreat or conference. However, this success has not been fully extended to broader outreach, where most Community Builders operate. The current approach offers limited options, such as occasional meetings for those not near a core centre or, in worst cases, leaves individuals stumbling in the dark. Resources are heavily concentrated on promoting 1-1 (in-person or virtual) interactions supporting top colleges/cities globally. While recognizing the merit in targeting high academic achievers, it remains unclear whether this focus on a select demographic outweighs the potential loss of impact that a more nuanced and inclusive development approach could bring.</p><h2>EA CB Fellowship:</h2><p>A potential solution to enhance community building (CB) within Effective Altruism (EA) could be the establishment of a fellowship program specifically for CB. This program would aim to define essential skills, present arguments for and against various approaches, and offer career guidance for those interested in this sector. Given the existence of fellowships for other EA cause areas, this initiative could elevate CB to a similar level of importance and recognition. It\u2019s a timely proposition, as there's a strong argument for emphasising CB at this stage. My understanding is that there was an attempt to create something akin to this with the pilot running this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.notion.site/Syllabus-CB-Fast-track-9bdbbaabcdbd4e3fb3ce02246fe7e254\"><u>syllabus</u></a>. I have been told that it was initially scrapped as a project as it was not getting the results that it desired, however, I have no information on the details of the project, its metrics for success, or the level of achievement. Interestingly, many of the posts I have linked can be found in the syllabus.</p><h2>EA CB Focused Podcast:</h2><p>Another solution might be to launch a podcast similar to the 80K Podcast, focusing on CB. Podcasts are increasingly popular and accessible, fitting easily into people\u2019s daily routines. This medium could disseminate advice and insights from CB leaders, standardising knowledge and skills in the field while avoiding the creation of a uniform CB culture. This approach could enhance the quality of engagement in the community and address recent concerns about community health. Examples of how these have been useful include the 80K Hours episode with Benjamin Todd, Benjamin Todd on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ben-todd-on-what-effective-altruism-most-needs/\"><u>what the effective altruism community most needs (&amp; how to analyse replaceability)</u></a> and the After Hours podcast episode with Kuhan Jeyapragasan on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2rAUOFjHj9Va43lV57dgy5\"><u>effective altruism university groups</u></a>. There are many more episodes that would be helpful for Community Builders, but don\u2019t necessarily deal with the EA Community or the act of Community Building as a whole.</p><p>Having served as a mentor for the CEA program, I\u2019ve observed a tendency towards a one-size-fits-all approach in CB, with minor adaptations for different groups worldwide. I wish to make it clear that I do not believe that there is any issue with this approach, on the contrary, it is quite reassuring that the issues that group organisers, usually university, have a predictable framework of issues from which to build a comprehensive response. A more deliberately crafted framework allows for consistency yet encourages adaptation and iteration. This could provide a clearer understanding of each group's impact and facilitate improvements over time. By adopting a general rule in the face of uncertainty and continuously refining our approach as new information becomes available, we can increase the chance of a more effective and responsive strategy in community building.</p><h2>Impact:</h2><p>I'm aiming to significantly enhance the pool of high-quality community builders within the EA community, tackling the critical shortage of resources and mentors available to support our growing number of community builders. Despite the trend that those organizers most in need often receive the least support, my strategy is designed to broaden the support network through our fellowship program, thus elevating the foundational level of support while still maintaining the upper echelons of excellence. This approach is based on a theory of change acknowledging the existing demand for community-building support and the demonstrated benefits of such support, as evidenced by initiatives like the OSP by CEA, 80K's coaching, and various virtual programs and podcasts. My objective is to enhance the impact of both top-performing and smaller groups while mitigating the risks associated with potential mismanagement. While further evidence is necessary to wholly validate this approach, the potential benefits of optimizing mentor time and providing scalable resources make this initiative worth pursuing in my view.</p><p>It's crucial for the Effective Altruism (EA) community to thoughtfully consider and engage with the concerns that may arise within its broader groups. Addressing these matters attentively can help us avoid potential challenges, such as unintentionally impacting the community's reputation, which in turn could influence engagement levels and the rich diversity of contributions we value so highly. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistent community norms and mentorship processes will bolster our outreach efforts, ensuring we continue to attract a wide array of perspectives. This diversity enriches our community, upholding the high epistemic standards central to EA's philosophy. By embracing strategic, inclusive, and well-structured community-building efforts, we can support EA's growth and its ongoing mission to drive meaningful change. This approach not only preserves our core values but also strengthens our collective capacity to make a significant impact.</p><h1>Uncertainties:</h1><p>One of the key uncertainties in my understanding of Effective Altruism\u2019s (EA) community-building practices is the actual impact of prioritising recruitment and numerical metrics over deeper engagement. To address this uncertainty, there is a crucial need for more empirical data from community engagement studies. Such data could provide invaluable insights into how this approach affects the community's depth of engagement, personal transformation, and overall health. My lack of empirical evidence presents a gap in my knowledge, making it challenging to assess the effectiveness of current strategies and to make informed decisions about potential improvements.</p><p>When proposing solutions like a fellowship program for community building and a podcast akin to the 80K Podcast, I base these on the observed success of similar initiatives in other fields. For instance, I base the continued implementation of other EA fellowships and virtual programmes on the belief that they have a significant impact in helping participants pursue impact and careers in their respective fields, but I don\u2019t have specific data on how successful these efforts have been. It's crucial to also consider counterarguments, such as the risk of oversaturating the EA space with too many specialised programs or the potential for podcasts to disseminate a uniform culture, which could stifle diversity in thought and approach.</p><p>Additionally, in advocating for a more nuanced framework in community building, I draw from my experiences with the Organisational Support Programme. While these experiences are valuable, I acknowledge the need to juxtapose them with a wider range of perspectives from the EA community. It's important to consider whether these issues are universally recognized within the community or if they might be interpreted differently by others. This is why I turn to you, the EA Community, to begin this journey and help fill the gaps in my knowledge and experience.</p><p>I have also made claims about various EA Forum posts and using metrics such as Karma and comment engagment to highlight the level of concern the community has about this issue. It is worth noting that these posts could be representative of the same voices who are consistently sharing concern of these issues rather than every vote representing a different person. It is also difficutl to tell whether the support for these posts is representative of this being an existing issue, or merely reflects the communities sensitivity to not wanting this to become an issue by highlighting it as a concern.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The discussion suggests an assumption that the issues raised are indeed significant problems within the fringe Effective Altruism community's epistemic status. However, this assumption may require further scrutiny and validation. The evidence presented so far primarily stems from the personal experiences and posts of individual group organisers, and despite the posts engagement on the EA Forum it may not be enough to generalise about the value alignment and epistemic quality of EA community building as a whole. This point is critical to my argument; if these issues aren't as widespread as assumed, the proposed solutions might not be addressing the core problems, or it may not be a problem at all and instead a shared concern for this being a potential issue. To gain a clearer understanding and personally apply the Scout Mindset in these assertions, further research is needed, including:</p><ol><li><strong>Gathering personal experiences&nbsp;</strong>as a group organiser, both locally and within the broader EA community, such as at EAG(x) events.</li><li><strong>Examining the discussions and feedback</strong> from others who have either organised groups or participated in university clubs, particularly on platforms like the EA Forum (comment below)</li><li><strong>Consulting with immediate contacts</strong>, such as OSP mentors and the CEA Groups Team, to gather their perspectives and experiences.</li><li><strong>Consider conducting a comprehensive survey</strong> of community members involved in university groups, including members, organisers, and other stakeholders like funders. This research could help validate or challenge my current assumptions and should be approached with a Scout Mindset, ready to update beliefs based on the strength and relevance of the evidence gathered. This survey could also be a valuable first step in assessing the generalizability of the issues I\u2019ve raised and help determine whether the proposed solutions are appropriately targeted. It\u2019s important to consider that even if the evidence suggests that these issues are more isolated or specific to groups with certain characteristics, it doesn't necessarily render the proposed solutions irrelevant but may require a more tailored approach.</li></ol><p>In conclusion, while my suggestions aim to foster a more effective and responsive strategy in EA community building, incorporating a diverse range of experiences and data, along with a consideration of different viewpoints, will enrich our understanding and approach to these complex issues.</p>", "user": {"username": "Sgt.Chuckles"}}, {"_id": "ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC", "title": "UPDATE: Critical Failures in the World Happiness Report's Model of National Satisfaction", "postedAt": "2024-02-24T04:54:15.013Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>There has been a substantial update since this was first posted. The lead authors of the World Happiness Report have now reached out to me directly.

Its six-variable model of &nbsp; &nbsp; satisfaction is reproduced in textbooks and has been published in the same form by the United Nations since 2012. However, almost no justification is given for why these six variables are used. In response, I attempted to do the only thing I thought was responsible -- do an exhaustive search over 5,000 variables in international datasets, and see empirically what <i>actually</i> predicts satisfaction. I've consulted with life satisfaction specialists both in economics departments and major think tanks, and none thought this had been done before.</p><p>The variables that are selected by this more rigorous method are dramatically different from those of the WHR, and the resulting model is substantially more accurate both in and out of sample. In particular, the WHR leaves out entire categories of variables on subjects as varied, and as basic, as education, discrimination, and political power. Perhaps most dramatically, the way the WHR presents the data appears to suggest that GDP explains 40% of model variation. I find that, with my measurably more accurate model, it in fact predicts 2.5%.&nbsp;</p><p>The graph below ranks the model variables by contribution, which is the amount of the total satisfaction of a country they are estimated to predict. For interpretation, 1.5 points of satisfaction on the 11-point scale is equivalent to the grief felt at the death of a life partner, meaning these numbers may be numerically small, but they are enormously significant behaviorally.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/wmmgrgjqbg46goiqy0c6\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/ez9niypfgizs2xsqeg3r 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/sydygz27ktldndhppoq7 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/wx7d9h795a9nwmqcqqtz 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/djyto5ijpmndxu1tlrpu 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/l42ykeeaqseh68nifq6j 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/qsk1pizzh9td5xzdxwjx 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/osfp2nfwh9e0q0uetuzu 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/gtupkb4jie0i7splb5xi 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/kt1rkmuamgahtrmohcou 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggzGwXLzc8MBfERTC/tuz5pbbpqj4brxawa3vw 900w\">All variables included here were chosen by a penalized regression out of a total of 1,058 viable candidates, after 5,500 variables were examined.

Source: EAAW 2023</i></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Ayubu Nnko, </strong>the founder of EAAW, has done cage-free work since 2018 and helped open up the cage-free movement in Tanzania. EAAW translated the <a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/new-cage-free-fulfillment-report\"><u>Cage-Free Fulfillment</u></a> report by Open Wing Alliance and the <a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/cagefreeequity/\"><u>International Cage free equity index</u></a> produced by <a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/\"><u>Mercy for Animals</u></a> in Kiswahili and shared it with poultry farmers and media houses in Tanzania for publication. EAAW has also participated in cage-free campaigns globally, regionally, and locally, leading media campaigns in Africa involving local restaurant chains and examining international brands in Tanzania. EAAW has undertaken journalist training on the cage-free movement and engaged poultry farmers through farm visits and discussions about free-range poultry farming.</p><p><i>What are your successes, milestones, and features in cage free work?</i></p><blockquote><p>Public sensitization and engagement has so far been our greatest strength as EAAW. We have done this through the following ways:</p><ul><li>Social media campaigns: We have reached 148,707 people through social media and 48,015 through our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@educationforafricananimalw5487/videos\"><u>YouTube</u></a> channel. Besides, we have featured in sixteen print media publications, four live and recorded television programs (ITV, CAPITAL TV, TVE and TBC), three live and recorded radio stations broadcasted different messages on the cage-free movement, (Capital Radio, TBC FM and Safina FM) and 98 calls and 175 SMS where different questions on cage-free vs caged farming were answered.</li><li>Producing and designing animated videos: We have produced 13 animated videos (locally translated into Swahili), 15 comics, 12 ordinary videos and eight banners, all of which are freely available on our YouTube channel.&nbsp;</li><li>Radio and print media outreach: Beyond social media, our work has also been featured in ten newspapers and eight electronic media platforms in Tanzania. As a result, we successfully organised and implemented the first journalists training workshop in Tanzania earlier this year.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Beyond media work, we have also conducted door-to-door campaigns, where we have sensitized farmers to ditch battery cages and adopt cage-free farming. We have also reached advanced talks with two major poultry farms in Tanzania, who have promised to transition to cage-free free farming this year.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What are the things that surprised you (positively or negatively) in the course of your work?</i></p><blockquote><p>We were positively surprised and amused by how enthusiastic the journalists were during the cage-free media workshop we held in January 2023. Many journalists strongly supported our cause and promised to support us. This led to the formation of the cage-free journalists alliance in Tanzania.</p></blockquote><p><i>What are some aspects of your work that have not worked out as well as you\u2019d hoped?</i></p><blockquote><p>It has been difficult to negotiate with companies locally to accept and publish cage-free policies. This also includes international companies with a local presence in Tanzania. They are simply not willing to listen to us, nor make a public cage-free commitment.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What have you found challenging or encouraging in the course of your work?</i></p><blockquote><p>It is encouraging to see increasing public awareness of cage-free in different parts of Africa. I am also very happy each time a company in Africa makes a cage-free commitment; it shows our work is not in vain. Lastly, I am also happy to see newer animal welfare organisations coming up, and many of them are ready to bring the cage-free movement to the next level in the region. Nonetheless, a big challenge is that funding is limited which means that there are very few groups that are funded to carry out this work effectively.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What are some of the important takeaways or lessons you\u2019ve learnt from doing this work?</i></p><blockquote><p>I have derived many lessons from doing this work, but the most important is:</p><ul><li>Patience: It takes time for corporations to understand and to make a commitment. Not only that, transitions take time, even more so in Africa.&nbsp;</li><li>Research and data<strong>:</strong> The importance of working from an informed perspective can never be understated. We need more data and information to help us work effectively and save millions of hens from cruelty and suffering.&nbsp;</li><li>Flexibility<strong>:</strong> Some techniques can backfire and this means one cannot be too rigid during implementation. One needs to be flexible in changing campaign tools and techniques.&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><p><i>What would you recommend to others working in this space in African countries e.g. skills, resources, connections that have helped you?</i></p><blockquote><p>It's very important to attend workshops, conferences, presentations, and different training and mentorship programs. All this helps with being equipped with knowledge and new techniques which then helps in finding efficient ways to improve and progress the cage-free movement.</p></blockquote><p><i>What do you wish you had known before doing cage-free work?</i></p><blockquote><p>I wish we had known how informed farmers were about their farming techniques and what cage-free information we needed to gather. In this case, I wish I had the opportunity to conduct frequent surveys and studies to get real-time data on the best strategies of implementing cage-free work in Tanzania.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h1><strong>Animal Welfare League: Ghana</strong></h1><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:950.297px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/v1lhw5tkwbhcjvsc3bqr\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/h3b1mfku7dgtjeukjnkz 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/pyityapsx0724rvgkdha 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/yk6nfiuzpr8ohes2nwje 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/nz8qdzpovdo6b5hjvo2g 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/jftihuhdn7tue1jdaqty 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/g9zqzvkf33q3izzcr4la 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/nhk1dievrfar9f1in3ml 2500w\"><figcaption><i>Animal Welfare League team members during their first cage-free workshop in Accra, Ghana</i></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Daniel Abiliba</strong>, the founder of Animal Welfare League, started AWL in early 2021, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. A passionate animal welfare advocate, veterinary doctor and a recent graduate from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, he was determined to make a difference for the animals in Ghana. He began doing cage-free work in early 2022 when his organisation was accepted as a member of the Open Wing Alliance.&nbsp;</p><p><i>How did you start doing cage-free work?</i></p><blockquote><p>We first began our work by identifying three vital stakeholders for the success of our cage-free programme; consumers, farmers, and corporations. Our key activities then involved reaching out to these three groups of people.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Consumers: We reached out to consumers through social media campaigns (employing graphic designs that depict the suffering of birds in cages) and community outreach programs. Specifically targeting the Ghanaian population, we launched a social media campaign last year on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook against the use of battery cages and patronage of poultry products originating from caged farms.</li><li>Farmers: We work with farmers through various farmer associations across Ghana, using veterinary services directorate of Ghana, regional veterinary officers, and other resource persons to organise educational workshops on cage-free farming. We use pre- and post-survey forms, individual interviews, and an open forum to understand farmers' concerns in the region.</li><li>Corporations: We emailed staff members at corporations, seeking preliminary in-person meetings. At these preliminary meetings, we emphasised hen welfare and how they, as a corporation, could play a vital role in improving the welfare of hens.</li></ul></blockquote><p><i>What are your successes and milestones in cage free work?</i></p><blockquote><p>On 1st March 2023, we had a successful workshop with poultry farmers in the capital of Ghana, Accra on the theme \u201cImproving poultry welfare and productivity in Ghana\u201d which emphasised the creation of a network of farmers in the region who will be trained in higher welfare cage-free production. After the workshop, 76.7% of participating farmers embraced the cage-free farming system with 21 farmers signing on to our national cage-free farms' directory. Two farmers indicated that they would transition from using battery cages to a cage-free production system. We estimate that this measure will prevent at least 50,000 laying hens from the cruelty of being housed in cages.</p><p>We also collated the email addresses of over 15 corporations and had preliminary meetings with six companies. After two in-person meetings with two hotels in Ghana, they expressed an interest in adopting a cage-free policy. We remain optimistic that we will get a minimum of 3 corporations signing a cage-free policy before the end of 2023.</p></blockquote><p><i>What are the things that surprised you (positively or negatively) in the course of your work?</i></p><blockquote><p>One surprising thing was the fact that farmers were willing to transition from battery cages to cage-free farming methods throughout our workshops. However, most corporations we have targeted do not check their emails or have inactive emails, making it very hard to reach them.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What are some aspects of your work that have not worked out as well as you\u2019d hoped?</i></p><blockquote><p>Using emails as our initial corporate outreach method did not provide the results we had expected as most of the companies we contacted did not respond. We have established that having in-person meetings with them works much better.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What have you found challenging or encouraging in the course of your work?</i></p><blockquote><p>Navigating corporate dialogues with companies that expressed interest in adopting better animal welfare policies but have not yet decided on commitment timelines. We found the warm reception of the cage-free message from most farmers and the Ghanaian people encouraging as we believe they are an ally in achieving better welfare standards.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What are some of the important takeaways or lessons you\u2019ve learnt from doing this work?</i></p><blockquote><p>After several attempts to reach some corporations via email and failing over and over again, we realised it was much easier to gain an audience by showing up at their reception, stating our purpose, and seeking an audience with the appropriate staff should they be available or book an appointment if they weren\u2019t.</p><p>We have also learned that mapping out key stakeholders in our campaigns and engaging them individually, in a holistic manner produces the best results.</p><p>In gathering resources and information for this project, we realised a lack thereof in Africa. Through this and other mediums, we will publish our resources to ease the replication and modification of similar works in Africa.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What would you recommend to others working in this space in African countries e.g. skills, resources, connections that have helped you?</i></p><blockquote><p>We recommend they understand the concerns of stakeholders involved in cage-free farming.</p><p>Use the essential resource materials provided by OWA and reach out to other organisations that have extensive work and experience to learn from their successes and weaknesses. We also recommend understanding and drawing up the theory of change of their programs at the planning stage. This gives an idea of the gaps that exist in your country and what activities you can focus on to achieve the ultimate goal of no cruelty to farmed animals.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What could help your cage-free work now?</i></p><blockquote><p>After several workshops and meetings with farmers and corporations, we firmly believe a model cage-free farm is of immense importance as it will provide practical training in best practices in cage-free management, serve as a model farm for cage-free producers to visit and as a research and development center for the region. It will also benefit farmers, auditors, veterinarians and other industry stakeholders across Africa.</p></blockquote><h1><strong>Sibanye Trust: Zimbabwe</strong></h1><p><img style=\"width:950.297px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/ojyxsedhlhpa7on5v4wg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/lyjhqimndsqufx48ey7w 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/bbos6s87vu4srosm4ofo 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/rziyx402u5qhdobatvbj 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/nhjvlwwghwpdaz5fiaju 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/fcyd8fdhrskcngtv72aj 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/qzjabmj6wjqklrpkwaj9 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tSqg7ZzzuGD3Nzcn6/lniko0akajckenohghjq 2500w\"></p><p><strong>Alfred Sihwa </strong>founded Sibanye Trust in 2018 after realising the gap that existed for non-human animal representation, especially farmed and companion animals. He founded Sibanye Trust to advocate for animal freedom including the adoption of plant-based diets as one of the solutions towards climate change and animal suffering.</p><p><i>How did you start doing cage-free work?</i></p><blockquote><p>We began cage-free work in Zimbabwe in 2018 when we joined the Open Wing Alliance coalition. There was already widespread suffering of birds in captivity, prompting a search for better ways to ensure animal welfare, in particular layer hen welfare. Through technical and financial support from OWA, we started collaborating with animal advocates, policy makers, and farmers to promote cage-free practices to improve the lives of animals in the agricultural industry.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What are some of your successes and milestones in cage-free work?</i></p><blockquote><p>Our biggest milestone has been the level of increased awareness about cage-free. We have made significant efforts to educate farmers, consumers, and other stakeholders about the concept and advantages of cage-free systems in Zimbabwe. Through cage-free corporate meetings, training workshops, and farmers and media campaigns, we have disseminated information about the benefits of cage-free systems, including improved animal welfare and egg quality.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the core activities we do as part of our cage\u2013free work include:</p><ul><li>Policy review. We advocate for the revision of laws, rules, guidelines, and industry standards on laying hen housing, care, transportation, and slaughter in Zimbabwe. We believe that our policy review work will aid the efficacy of current policies in protecting the well-being of laying hens and suggesting areas for improvement.&nbsp;</li><li>Cage-free corporate campaigning. We have organised cage-free corporate meetings, or conversations with well-established hotels, lodges, and restaurants to discuss animal welfare and food safety concerns related to battery-cage production to persuade these corporations to commit to using and promoting cage-free eggs in their operations.</li><li>Open market cage-free campaigns. We organise public campaigns to educate consumers, merchants, and companies on the advantages of cage-free egg production - which includes increased animal welfare, lower environmental impact, and enhanced food safety - recognising that a large number of eggs are sold through open air markets.&nbsp;</li><li>Training. Lastly, we regularly run training programs to advocate for cage-free egg production by giving information, skills, and resources to egg industry stakeholders. Farmers are educated about the advantages, best practices, and practical elements of moving to cage-free egg production through farmer training.</li></ul></blockquote><p><i>What are some things that did not work out as well as you had hoped?</i></p><blockquote><p>A big barrier to the implementation of cage-free systems in Zimbabwe is the resistance by farmers to transition from battery cages to cage-free systems. One of the major drawbacks is that battery cage systems have existed for a long time as the industry-leading system with regard to egg production and many farmers have pushed and invested in this system after much financial struggle. This means that some farmers have not fully realised their return on investment from these battery cages and are somewhat reluctant to transition to cage-free systems based solely on further investment in these systems which also require a reasonably high initial investment.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What have you found challenging or encouraging in the course of your work?</i></p><blockquote><p>A major challenge to implementing cage-free systems is limited infrastructure and resources. Implementing cage-free systems requires appropriate infrastructure, like proper housing structures, equipment, and facilities, to provide suitable environments for hens. Zimbabwe faces the challenge in terms of the availability and affordability of such infrastructure and resources. The economic setting of the country further exacerbates this challenge in that the Zimbabwe dollar to foreign currency (e.g., US$) exchange rate is ever-increasing which is a major challenge for farmers to purchase equipment from other countries. Setting up cage-free systems requires initial investments in construction, equipment, and technology, which may be a barrier for many farmers, especially small-scale producers, who may have just invested in battery cages.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What would you recommend to others working in this space in African countries e.g. skills, resources, connections that have helped you?</i></p><blockquote><p>Implementing cage-free work requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including farmers, animal advocates, consumers, and policymakers. This collaborative approach helps in problem-solving, encouraging communication, engagement, and cooperation among different parties for the common goal of improving animal welfare and promoting sustainable farming practices. Though Sibanye is seeking to create environments that will make collaborative efforts possible, we face many hindrances in these initiatives. For one, policymakers are not forthcoming towards collaborative work and this may be attributed to a lack of motivation by government workers in light of the economic situation in the country. Farmers are also resisting the uptake of cage-free systems because they want to maximize profits using battery cages and thus ensure a return on investment. This makes it difficult to foster collaborative work and this is one challenge that advocates need to focus on to improve the welfare of chickens.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><i>What do you wish you had known before doing cage-free work?</i></p><blockquote><p>Cage-free work is so complex in that it involves multiple stakeholders. It has sociocultural, and economic implications. Politicians play a huge role behind the scenes. The discussions are like games that take back and forth and require consistency and perseverance. The campaigns involve consumers who are not informed and businesses who pretend not to know. Governments use farming as a political mileage tool and threaten undercover investigations. I wish I had known all this before but we are aware now and I understand how we can navigate these issues to achieve the best results for chickens.</p></blockquote><p><i>What could help your cage-free work now?&nbsp;</i></p><blockquote><p>Our cage-free work can improve a lot if we get more personalised training that will improve institutional campaigns. It is possible when consumers raise concerns, the business community will listen. Also, bringing in a bit of Pan Africanism into the campaigns to acknowledge other issues like poverty and knowledge gaps so that organisations do not lose validity and be rendered by consumers and communities as anti-development. More literature that is relevant to the African situation needs to be made available. This means that there is a need for more funding for the production of publications that bring to light the plethora of issues and concerns relating to cage-free system utilization in developing countries, to be specific, Africa.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "AnimalAdvocacyAfrica"}}, {"_id": "rLq5jhdWK8Ba5PqZt", "title": "Noah\u2019s Arc: From AR Desks to AI Reactors", "postedAt": "2024-03-01T13:59:26.272Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rLq5jhdWK8Ba5PqZt/zzxxbhq65sdx3qp88kj1\"></figure><p>Hello everyone,</p><p>My name is Noah, and this is my introduction to the Effective Altruism forum! I have so much to share, but I will begin with a bit about me.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>My parents are both highly-educated and wonderful people who nurtured my curiosity and empathy from a very young age, and to them I owe everything! During middle school I created a non-profit to provide aid to the victims of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, and I worked with the school to fundraise by selling candy during lunch. I went on to volunteer in many forms, from summer camps in Wyoming to STEM workshops in San Jose, but my most impactful work has always been cooking and serving dinner to the families of critically-ill children at the Ronald McDonald House.</p><p>In high school I started tinkering with computers and working part-time to hire mentors and freelancers to coach me through personal projects. I went on to attend the University of Colorado Boulder, and in 2021 I graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Space. I was among the most passionate and progressive participants in courses including Normative Ethics, Bioethics, and IT Ethics &amp; Policy, and that paved the way for my pursuit of AI safety! With a growing foundation of hands-on humanitarian work, an aptitude for tech, and a passion for helping others, my mission is simple:</p><blockquote><p>Balance the urgent pursuit of life-empowering technology with a longtermist approach to existential risk reduction</p></blockquote><p>My dream is to usher humanity towards only the most equitable and liberatory futures in which every human is empowered to blossom to their fullest potential. My current portfolio consists of AR and AI tools that prioritize accessibility, cost-efficiency, and power. While useful in their own right, I developed them to augment my own workflows and sharpen my skills in preparation for bigger and harder problems. Safely harnessing the power of AI might be the most important problem that we could ever hope to solve, and I'm particularly well-poised to help facilitate the development of aligned AI by leveraging my ML-focused full-stack experience with my passion and aptitude for AI safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Full-Stack Development</h3><p>Following graduation, I worked as a sole founder to build three products:</p><ul><li><strong>GistHub</strong>: Generative AI 10x faster and 10x cheaper than anywhere else</li><li><strong>Feedback</strong>: A platform for interfacing with and between ML tools with zero code</li><li>HoloDesk: A wearable-free AR desk with a transparent display built into the surface</li></ul><p>To learn more, you can visit my website at <a href=\"https://gisthub.ai\">gisthub.ai</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rLq5jhdWK8Ba5PqZt/wiyh6ptvorkxx2mkrjda\"><figcaption>GistHub: Industrial-scale txt2img synthesis</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>LLM Orchestration</h3><p>During the summer of 2023, and hot on the heels of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291\">Voyager</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924\">ChatDev</a> papers, I began performing cutting-edge independent LLM research where I yielded a 30x cost reduction with zero performance impact compared to Voyager\u2019s GPT-4-based approach to LLM-powered embodied agents. I demonstrated that replacing Voyager\u2019s GPT-4-powered coding agent with a GPT-3.5-turbo-powered ChatDev-style wing of conversational coding agents was significantly better, faster, and cheaper. I went on to show that such a system could perform extremely well even without leaning on an extensive secondary API for performing actions, or the immense knowledge base of Minecraft that is baked into the models. During and since that time, I gained extensive experience with tools/techniques like vector databases, RAG, query expansion, and much more.</p><h3>AI Safety</h3><p>I have written extensively about human-AI interaction and its many forms, and I plan on sharing many of those ideas on this forum, but I won't go into too much detail in this post. In short, I can say that <strong>we must not conflate AI safety with the development and regulation of non-jailbreakable models</strong>. The free market alone will produce all kinds of intentionally-harmful models, and our only hope is to continuously ensure humanity's robustness against all adversaries, artificially-intelligent or otherwise. I look forward to a world in which our most powerful models are used to survey, stress-test, and red/blue-team as much of our attack surface as possible.</p><p>Scaling up such a technique to national and global levels yields AI reactors whose structure and security resemble nuclear reactors, within which the dominant resource is problem-solving power itself, and where AI engineers throttle AI at its point of criticality to produce valuable insights while leveraging various practical and physical containment mechanisms to avoid runaway scenarios.</p><h3>Technical AI Safety</h3><p>I'm currently conducting independent research on the use of AI to automate the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities in feature-rich simulations of embodied agents. I aim to demonstrate the ways in which adversarial AI can exploit human-level systems, and how we can automate that search process via simulation. There are several variables of interest, namely <strong>AI architecture </strong>and <strong>exploitation complexity</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>AI architecture</strong> is divided into two main categories: LLMs and neural networks. The LLM architectures are further divided by different models and orchestrations, and the neural net architectures are trained via PPO using a combination of parameter sweeps and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12931\">LLM-designed reward functions</a>.</li><li><strong>Exploitation complexity</strong> is also divided between two main categories: goal complexity and supervision level. Goal complexity maps to a goal set that ranges from covertly performing simple illicit activities to inducing total structural collapse. Supervision level maps to a set of embodied and disembodied virtual supervisors/enforcers.</li></ul><p>I'm incredibly excited about this work and I can't wait to share it, the space is ripe for innovation and there are opportunities for further research at every turn. I would love to pursue this research full-time, but that isn't financially feasible for me right now. I'm very interested in opportunities for funding such as the Long Term Future Fund, Open Philanthropy's Career Development Funding, Lightspeed Grants, and Manifund, and I would love to talk to anyone that has experience funding or getting funding for independent research related to AI safety!</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Whew! As a token of my gratitude for getting this far, here\u2019s a sneak peek of a little \u201ctrapped evil AI\u201d desktop toy that I prototyped one weekend. Now, while the subjugation of any conscious entity is no laughing matter, this little guy is among the simplest of state machines, so even if we assume a panpsychist universe his experience should differ minimally from that of his little bench. With that being said, the torment this little guy faces while doomed to endlessly hit terrible drives is quite amusing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rLq5jhdWK8Ba5PqZt/rphplvtqnmd0o6etqyhp\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you all for reading, I truly appreciate it.

Today, a lot of money is spent on access projects without little to no monitoring or accountability. A lot of money is wasted on equipment that is bound to break or not work properly due to poor power quality. The good news is we can do better. I think the first step is low-cost, longitudinal monitoring, so that we can see what works and measure our progress toward appropriate, reliable power.</p><h1><strong>How big is this problem, really?</strong></h1><p>According to a 1997 WHO report, which continues to be cited \u2014 there doesn\u2019t seem to be more recent data on this \u2014 70% of medical equipment in Sub-Saharan Africa is broken or unused. There are many reasons for this, including user error/inadequate training, but one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/44407/9789241564045_eng.pdf\"><u>2010 World Bank report</u></a> cites a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/17434440.4.6.759\"><u>2007 study</u></a> of 33 hospitals in 10 developing countries, which found inadequate power supply to be the most common cause of medical device failure.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2uNd4bGxRwRAHe9h2/yxl3fqe5kqjhrnqlkrvo\"></p><p>This is voltage data collected at 27 healthcare facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, collected by <i>n</i>Line as part of <a href=\"https://nline.io/docs/iew23drc.pdf\">this study</a> (Miles et al, 2023).&nbsp; All these healthcare facilities are electrified, but there\u2019s a lot of variety in what kinds of services each is able to provide. Most require diesel generators as backup for when the power is out, or when the voltage from their main power source is too volatile and they need to power sensitive equipment. One facility runs on diesel generator alone, 24/7, which costs tens of thousands of dollars per year (the Catholic church foots the energy bill at this particular facility).</p><p>There\u2019s not been enough research yet into the effects of poor power quality on medical equipment, but anecdotally, poor voltage quality \u2014 whether spikes, sags, or chronically low voltage \u2014 causes equipment failures and degraded ability to deliver medical services. Autoclaves, oxygenators, x-ray machines and infant incubators are just some of the equipment that technicians in the DRC reported as malfunctioning or rendered inoperable by poor voltage. Frequent outages, even short ones, also lead to costly inefficiencies when they, for instance, interrupt lab tests and samples have to be taken over again.</p><p>Bad power quality is a symptom of issues within the grid and these issues also lead to higher energy cost and technical loss (energy that is generated by burning fuel but dissipated in the lines and equipment without ever reaching customers to be paid for and perform useful work).&nbsp; If these issues aren\u2019t addressed, the grid will remain \u201csick\u201d \u2014 prone to reliability issues, frequently requiring equipment maintenance and repairs, unable to support demand growth, and highly inefficient.</p><h1><strong>Why doesn\u2019t a solution exist yet?</strong></h1><p>You might be asking,&nbsp;<i>Are there good reasons why markets or governments aren\u2019t already making progress on this problem?</i></p><p>On the monitoring side, the technology to enable large-scale, affordable power sensing hasn\u2019t existed for very long. \u201cUniversal\u201d SIMs are a recent development \u2014 these are SIMs that work in many different countries and contexts and have enabled the development of remote sensing hardware that doesn\u2019t require a new SIM for every new country you might like to sense in.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://nline.io/\"><i>n</i>Line</a> and <a href=\"http://a2ei.org/\">A2EI</a> are two companies that develop and deploy power sensors. Both use universal SIM cards to send data over the cellular network to the cloud. (Disclaimer: I previously worked for <i>n</i>Line and I'm a big fan of what they do.)</p><p>Some of the obvious consumers of data like these are regulators. These are the government bodies whose job it is to hold the utilities to account, but they are often under-provisioned and don\u2019t actually have the levers to effect change. On top of this, Western aid organizations like the World Bank hold the purse strings, and market forces don\u2019t really work on the World Bank; they are used to doing things their way, and their way is often based on outdated assumptions or assumptions that were never right to begin with.</p><p>To make matters even worse, government-run utilities often don\u2019t have any incentive to improve power, or even deliver power. Often, the utility actually&nbsp;<i>loses</i> money with every kWh they deliver. Utilities in LMICs are used to operating with certain kinds of data and very little in the way of \u201csmart infrastructure.\u201d They take spot measurements, infrequently. And in many cases, they are rightfully distrustful of Western tech companies\u2019 promises. Incorporating new technologies is disruptive \u2014 it bears risks, and they have very little incentive to take those risks.</p><h1><strong>What can a new philanthropist do?</strong></h1><p>In no particular order, here are some ideas and general directions:</p><ul><li>Start companies! We need technology that supports grid operation under the resource constraints that exist in LMICs. We need new companies focused on optimizing infrastructure upgrades to be targeted and cost-effective, and informed heavily by measurement.</li><li>Maybe it makes sense to come at this from the other direction as well: work on developing technology to mitigate the effects of poor power, e.g., cheaper, better voltage stabilizers that actually work in these contexts, or equipment that can tolerate voltage fluctuations and persistently low voltage. This would be a band-aid, but perhaps still worth working on.</li><li>Go work for the World Bank and change the way they do things.</li><li>Strengthen and arm regulatory bodies to do their jobs more effectively.</li><li>Innovative financing solutions like results-based financing (e.g. for mini- and micro-grid projects, financing for utility operators should be tied to power delivered \u2014 like SEforAll\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.seforall.org/UEF-mini-grids\"><u>UEF</u></a>, which disburses grant payments based on number of connections, and only after the connections have been verified by an independent evaluator).</li><li>More studies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.deveng.2015.12.001\"><u>Electrification for \u201cUnder Grid\u201d households in Rural Kenya</u></a> from researchers at UC Berkeley, which found compelling evidence that connection costs are too high for households and businesses within 200 meters of a transformer (we call these \u201cunder grid,\u201d as opposed to \u201coff grid\u201d) and suggested financing solutions to take advantage of economies of scale.</li><li>Things I haven\u2019t thought of yet!
