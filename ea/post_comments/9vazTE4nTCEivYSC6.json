And for your service as the LTFF chair!</p><p>I feel confused about the difficulty of fund manager hiring. One source of confusion comes from the importance of expertise (/doing-good-direct-work), as you touch on in the post:</p><blockquote><p>Historically, we've had trouble hiring fund managers, especially in technical AI alignment, largely for the reasons mentioned above (people generally want to focus on their work). I think there's an extent to which I've contributed to our difficulty in hiring, in that I'm not sold that people doing good direct work&nbsp;<i>should</i> be taking on additional responsibilities as fund managers (so haven\u2019t been great at convincing people to join)</p></blockquote><p>In addition to the high opportunity cost of time for expert fund managers, I would have guessed that small differences between the EV of marginal grants pushes in the direction of expertise being less important. But then I don\u2019t understand why hiring fund managers would be unusually challenging. Wouldn\u2019t deemphasizing expertise increase the pool of eligible fund managers, thereby making hiring easier?</p><p>(Perhaps I\u2018m confusing relative and absolute difficulty \u2014 expertise being less important would make hiring relatively easier, but it\u2019s still absolutely tough?)</p><p>The second source of confusion comes reconciling the difficulty of finding fund managers with the fact that FTXFF and Manifund seemed to find part-time grantmakers quite easily. I don\u2019t know how many regrantors and grant-recommenders FTXFF ended up with, but the last rumour I heard was between 100 and 200. Manifund are currently on 16 and seem keen to expand. I would\u2019ve thought that there is some intersection between regrantors with the top, say, 30% of grantmaking records by your light, those satisfying other hiring criteria you might have, and those currently willing to work with LTFF.</p><p>Is the difference in the scale of grants LTFF fund managers make vs regrantors?

In my experience fund managers have very little time for the work (they\u2019re both in part-time roles, and often extremely busy people), and little support (there\u2019s relatively little training / infrastructure / guidance), but a fair amount of power. This has a few downsides:</p><ol><li><strong>Insular funding:</strong> Fund managers lean heavily on personal networks and defer to other people\u2019s impressions of applicants, which means known applicants are much more likely to be funded. This meant LTFF had an easy time funding EAs/rationalists, but was much less likely to catch promising, non-EA candidates who weren't already known to us. (This is already a common dynamic in EA orgs, but felt particularly severe because of our time constraints.)&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Less ambitious funding: </strong>Similarly, it's particularly time-intensive to evaluate new organizations with substantial budgets, or novel theories of change. This meant that we were more likely to fund individuals, and had a harder time making large grants to new ambitious orgs. (We were also more likely to lean on OP\u2019s evaluation of the person or org.)</li></ol><p>I left the LTFF because of capacity issues related to being on the EV board post FTX collapse, but I didn't return because I ended up feeling pretty skeptical of a funding dynamic that moved money primarily within existing social circles with relatively little supervision, especially post FTX. I think full-time fund managers &amp; more structure and support could help with this. In the past, I think we\u2019ve been recruiting from too narrow of a pool \u2014 I think there are a fair number of people who could do this job well (and that the quality of work they can do improves if they have more time and more support), and moving in that direction could be good for the fund. (Though I haven't actually done the hiring for these roles, so I could be wrong.)</p><p>Really excited about EAF/LTFF potentially being more independent from OP &amp; having more full-time staff.

We have tried out having more junior managers on the fund with mixed success. The EAIF currently has \"assistant fund managers\" which I think was a good experiment for us to run, and I think it's generally gone well.<br><br>My impression is that SoGive gave out something like $300k and had 26 applicants so it doesn't seem super comparable to me to the LTFF (I think last year we had ~1000 applications), and I'd guess that your methods don't scale particularly well to the kind of grantmaking the LTFF does (but I could be wrong).<br><br>I also somewhat disagree with Asya re our transparency, I think that we are falling short of where I'd like us to be, but if you compare us to other grantmaking programs that have existed for more than 1 year I think we look pretty good transparency wise (e.g. Longview, Effective Giving, Open Phil) though plausibly they don't need to be as transparent as they are raising less from the public.</p>", "parentCommentId": "jDzEK6AaatG9ogCkM", "user": {"username": "calebp"}}, {"_id": "dAQoHt3huhmfBmiFx", "postedAt": "2023-08-03T22:01:47.664Z", "postId": "9vazTE4nTCEivYSC6", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the high opportunity cost of time for expert fund managers, I would have guessed that small differences between the EV of marginal grants pushes in the direction of expertise being less important.
