Your responses to the stock arguments seem pretty compelling. Looking forward to seeing your positive proposal.</p>\n<p>I wonder what you think of the idea that consistency is an externally imposed constraint on preferences akin to every other moral requirement. So from a totally self involved standpoint there might be no way to reason yourself into really striving for consistency, in the same way that for someone who didn't already care about suffering, there might be no way to reason themself into caring about it. Instead it's just this constraint we impose on people so they can function in a society. If you don't care about suffering, we do various things to punish you until you do -- and specifically we do stuff until you actually care about suffering for its own sake, not just pretend you do when that stops you from being punished. Similarly we enforce consistency as a constraint on preferences/moral views because of broader societal benefits of existing in a group of people who are like that (eg we can actually reason together).</p>\n<p>Related to this, I feel like the antirealist might reply to the point about not having a strong enough brute preference for consistency to outweigh real stakes in terms of pleasure and suffering in a basically deontological way. Well-socialized people don't just have preferences of some particular strength for outcomes of various moral value; they internalize moral rules for action that just rule out certain behaviors even if they lead to better states (of course maybe this just means that aspect of socialization is bad). In the same way, it's not like I have a preference of whatever strength for worlds where I'm consistent, and then I weigh that preference against the value of the stuff I have to trade it off against. I just internalize an epistemic rule governing my moral attitudes and I abide by it.</p>\n<p>None of this is actually an argument that people who don't currently care about consistency should start doing so. But I think you could spin a vindicatory story, from the point of view of someone who has internalized consistency as a norm, of the value of doing so. And that story would look a lot like the story you'd tell about the value of internalizing norms against lying, etc., even when doing so might maximize utility.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "9GRc4PrWe3kQrHJa2", "postedAt": "2023-02-17T00:25:39.972Z", "postId": "K9GdCuiz5tanoiDKN", "htmlBody": "<p>What an interesting and fun post! Your analysis goes many directions and I appreciate your investigation of normative, descriptive, and prescriptive ethics.</p>\n<p>The repugnant conclusion worries me. As a thought experiment, it seems to contain an uncharitable interpretation of principles of utilitarianism.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You increase total and average utility to measure increases in individual utility across an existing and constant population.</strong>  However, those measures, total and average, are not adequate to handle the intuition people associate with them. Therefore, they should not be used for deciding changes in utility across a population of changing size or one containing drastic differences in individual utility. For example, there's no value in increasing total utility by adding additional people, but it will drive total utility up, even if individual utility is low.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You pursue egalitarianism to <em>raise</em> everyone's utility up to the same level.</strong> Egalitarian is not an aspiration to lower some people's well-being while raising other's well-being. Likewise, egalitarianism is not pursuit of equality of utility at any utility level. Therefore, egalitarianism does not imply an overriding interest in equalizing everyone's utility. For example, there's no value in lowering other's utility to match those with less.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You measure utility accumulated by existent people in the present or the future to know utility for all individuals in a population and that utility is only relevant to the time period during when those people exist.</strong> Those individuals have to exist in order for the measures to apply. Therefore, utilitarianism can be practiced in contexts of arbitrary changes in population, with a caveat: consequences for others of specific changes to population, someone's birth or death, are relevant to utilitarian calculations. <strong>TIP:</strong> the repugnant conclusion thought experiment only allows one kind of population change: increase. You could ask yourself whether the thought experiment says anything about the real world or requirements of living in it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Utility is defined with respect to purposes (needs, reasons, wants) that establish a reference point of accumulation of utility suitable for some purpose.</strong> That reference point is always at a finite level of accumulation. Therefore, to assume that utility should be maximized to an unbounded extent is an error, and speaks to a problem with some arguments for transitivity.  <strong>NOTE:</strong> by definition, if there is no finite amount of accumulated utility  past which you have an unnecessary amount for your purposes, then it is not utility for you.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The repugnant conclusion does not condemn utilitarianism to disuse, but points 1-4 seem to me to be the principles to treat charitably in showing that utilitarianism leads to inconsistency. I don't believe that current formulations of the repugnant conclusion are charitable to those principles and the intuitions behind them.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Noah Scales"}}, {"_id": "pMqPnqzwNvfRAw3N3", "postedAt": "2023-02-17T05:31:40.206Z", "postId": "K9GdCuiz5tanoiDKN", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Finally, at T<sub>3</sub>, I learn that in fact, the pregnancy hasn\u2019t yet occurred, so I pay to avoid becoming pregnant at all.<a href=\"#fn3g7sr1is6lz\"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p></blockquote><p>Do you also avoid most of the cost of the operation?

say, by a desire to become more coherent in order to avoid money-pumps and develop a better \"active posture\" guide for action / decision theory.</p><p>But one reason that people care so much about curve-fitting (when, as you note, those individual selfish motives seem kinda weak) is that curve-fitting is a very important societal project. &nbsp;In order to create societies where many people (with conflicting desires, values, etc) can live together harmoniously/prosperously, we need to have some objective-ish standards (morality, criminal law, norms, etc) that are simple and universal enough that people can actually use them to make decisions and assign status and enforce punishments for violations.</p><p>So, there is a middle ground between trying to create the simplest possible curve (like total hedonic utilitarianism) in an attempt to capture realist moral truth with scientific elegance, versus drawing a ridiculously overfitted curve because \"whatever\". &nbsp;In practice, the degree of curve-fitting / \"overfitting\" to do is determined by:</p><ul><li>Society is curve-fitting to the \"data points\" of the moral intuitions of many people in society, not a single individual. &nbsp;Fortunately, humans are sorta similar, so most people can be mostly satisfied by enforcing that everyone follow the \"average\" of everyone's different intutions. &nbsp;This prohibits the most severe kinds of overfitting.</li><li>Societal rules also have to be somewhat coherent and universal in order to work -- everyone might simultaneously believe that \"stealing other people's stuff is fun\" and \"it sucks when people steal my stuff\", but those desires are in conflict so society will have to come up with some unsatisfying compromise like \"stealing is never okay for anyone\" or \"stealing is always okay for everyone\" or \"only the king can steal other people's stuff, and nobody else can steal\" or etc, otherwise people will constantly get into fights. &nbsp;This universality / coherence requirement also prohibits extreme, self-serving types of overfitting.</li><li>Otherwise, the rules should be overfit as much as possible to try to capture as many details of the average human moral intuition as possible, so that people can live as comfortably and happily as possible with the rules.</li><li>But! &nbsp;The rules can't be too complex, because then people couldn't remember them or apply them in normal life. &nbsp;This also constrains the amount of overfitting that can be done.</li></ul><p>Of course, as an ethical anti-realist, you don't have to participate in the societal project of trying to create the moral theory which will result in the most coherent, satisfied, prosperous society or whatever! &nbsp;You can just say \"screw society's rules\" and decide to be total hedonic utilitarian if you want, because you like scientific-style parsimony! &nbsp;But in practice, human psychology and society has been deeply shaped by this project of creating societally optimal curves for morality / laws / norms. &nbsp;So, you probably were raised in a culture that imbued you with a desire to have a moral system that is some intermediate level of overfitted. &nbsp;So that's where the feeling that we should quest for a moral law of intermediate overfittedness comes from.<br><br>Hopefully this was helpful or at least thought-provoking. &nbsp;I'd be happy to talk more about this if you are interested:<br>- how this intersects with the examples of slavery, factory farming, and other moral circle expansions<br>- how we might be able to overfit harder and thus better satisfy human preferences if we got better at remembering the rules by writing them down in law or applying them automatically or something<br>- how the situation might change if the diversity of values/desires/etc in society went up or down, making the average of everyone's intuition more or less satisfying to the typical person<br>- analagous situations (under capitalism, we use money as an imperfect curve-fit-style representation of who owes favors to whom -- but the requirements for universality and coherency force some weird deviations from the ordinary/intuitive way that favors are reckoned)<br>- why individual people might develop preferences for relatively more or less overfit ethics<br><br>Anyways, &nbsp;I really loved your post and it
