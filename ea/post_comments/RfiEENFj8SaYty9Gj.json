The latter could include giving talks or organizing discussions about specific EA cause areas (rather than 'EA in general') in local universities, churches, civic groups, political activist groups, etc. For example, in terms of impact, giving one talk about global public health issues at a local mega-church that has a couple of thousand people -- many of whom are already donating to (ineffective) charities -- might be more effective than running a local EA group for a dozen people for a year.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "nYN3ioKfkhT2izBgL", "postedAt": "2023-06-05T20:33:34.872Z", "postId": "RfiEENFj8SaYty9Gj", "htmlBody": "<p>Strong upvote for a thought provoking read, thanks David.</p><p>I'm not entirely sold on the argument as stated, in part due to a different experience with city group attendance - a guess (with no data to support) would say my local group has &lt;25% of attendees attend only one event in a given year, compared to EA London's 75%; and impact - we've had a significant number of regular attendees switch to EA aligned careers in ways that seem less likely had there not been a strong community.</p><p>I agree with a weaker form of the argument, that \"National EA groups shouldn\u2019t <i>(primarily)</i> focus on city groups\" and as a result of reading this will likely think more about how to add value for non group-members in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I strongly agree that community builders thinking/operating on a National level should think about ways to engage with and support EA aligned people who are not part of regularly convening groups (for preference, geography, or other reasons).</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "TJPHutton"}}, {"_id": "a7GyLuLaefKykMHg8", "postedAt": "2023-06-06T04:42:45.129Z", "postId": "RfiEENFj8SaYty9Gj", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you David, upvoted.

It\u2019s not clear we have reason to think many/most groups are emphasising community to the (net) detriment of impact. The fact that a majority of group members cite their group as being among the most important factors for their ability to have a personal impact suggests they are generally having a positive impact on EAs\u2019 impact.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We often use neglectedness when choosing cause areas, leading to support of unseen majorities - people in poorer parts of the world, animals and future beings. But when it comes to movement building there is less thought paid to those who aren\u2019t visible. A lot of strategies I have seen are about increasing attendance or engagement at events rather than providing value to people who may not be as interested in attending lots of events each year but still want to consider career changes.</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s my impression that, for many years, EA groups were neglected due to the illegibility of their impact. Their impact is mostly indirect through getting EAs involved, increasing their connection and engagement with EA, keeping them engaged and directing them to other paths of impact. It's possible to make the case that many other activities have a more direct relation to impact. And yet, per the above, very few activities seem to be as commonly cited as important by as many EAs as do EA groups (and this despite many EAs not having the chance to be a member of an EA group).&nbsp;</p><p>In more recent years, fortunately, there's been an increase in the resources assigned to groups and a significant increase in the number of EAs who are members of groups.
