Learn more, there is a spacing error in the paragraph, which bizarrely cuts the paragraph in two for no reason. [Edit: this is not a lone error, I've found another on p.142, there may well be others, I haven't gone through exhaustively]</li>\n<li>I'd be interested how the relevant cause areas were agreed upon? There's a heavy emphasis on Artificial Intelligence and the Long-Run Future (three articles on AI); and some areas of interest to EAers get very little or no mention at all (e.g. Mental Health and Happiness, re Michael Plant [EDIT: there is some mention of this, but there's still at least a good question here about how cause areas are decided]). Perhaps there's also a lack of concentration on cause areas versus career paths (and the Gov. article is great but extremely America heavy, which is not helpful for non-Americans). I suspect there is more to be said as to how this is decided, but it would be useful to understand this.</li>\n<li>The recommendation of different books at the end is interesting- given the heavy emphasis on the long term-future throughout, it seems to me that the recommended books diverge from that (Doing Good Better and the Most Good You Can Do aren't hugely about that from my memory?) Would it have been better to recommend SuperIntelligence; or the Global Catastrophic Risks volume which came out a while back; or something else, if the Long-Term Future dominates the attention elsewhere?</li>\n<li>One worry I have is that it does a lot to suggest possibel directions for EAers, and little to deal with objections EAers might face. The original handbook seems to have slightly more on that (e.g. the Estimation article from Katja; Holden's article on White's in shining armour); and there are other ones which regularly arise e.g. the collectivist/coordination ideas that Hilary Greaves has been talking about (no individual can ever make a difference); or objections which focus on the overriding significance of virtue/the total cluelessness of us all. It might be that these are dealt with in some other way (I'm not clear how) or that this is simply not that important (which I question, but am uncertain), and so would be appreciative for your thoughts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Mainly, though I liked it, so my critical points aren't to be understood as a total rejection of the piece!

But now that I see others are concerned, I will echo my concerns too and magnify them here -- I don't feel like this handbook represents EA as I understand it.</p>\n<p>By page count, AI is 45.7% of the entire causes sections. And as Catherine Low pointed out, in both the animal and the global poverty articles (which I didn't count toward the page count), more than half the article was dedicated to why we might not choose this cause area, with much of that space also focused on far-future of humanity. I'd find it hard for anyone to read this and not take away that the community consensus is that AI risk is clearly the most important thing to focus on.</p>\n<p>I feel like I get it. I recognize that CEA and 80K have a right to have strong opinions about cause prioritization. I also recognize that they've worked hard to become such a strong central pillar of EA as they have. I also recognize that a lot of people that CEA and 80K are familiar with agree with them. But now I can't personally help but feel like CEA is using their position of relative strength to essentially dominate the conversation and claim it is the community consensus.</p>\n<p>I agree the definition of &quot;EA&quot; here is itself the area of concern. It's very easy for any of us to call &quot;EA&quot; as we see it and naturally make claims about the preferences of the community. But this would be very clearly circular. I'd be tempted to defer to the EA Survey. \nAI was only the top cause of <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1e5/ea_survey_2017_series_cause_area_preferences/\">16% of the EA Survey</a>. Even among those employed full-time in a non-profit (maybe a proxy for full-time EAs), it was the top priority of 11.26%, compared to 44.22% for poverty and 6.46% for animal welfare.\n But naturally I'd be biased toward using these results, and I'm definitely sympathetic to the idea that EA should be considered more narrowly, or we should weight the opinions of people working on it full-time more heavily. So I'm unsure. Even my opinions here are circular, by my own admission.</p>\n<p>But I think if we're going to be claiming in a community space to talk about the community, we should be more thoughtful about who's opinions we're including and excluding. It seems pretty inexpensive to re-weigh the handbook to emphasize AI risk just as much without being as clearly jarring about it (e.g., dedicating three chapters instead of one or slanting so clearly toward AI risk throughout the &quot;reasons not to prioritize this cause&quot; sections).</p>\n<p>Based on this, and the general sentiment, I'd echo Scott Weather's comment on the Facebook group that it\u2019s pretty disingenuous to represent CEA\u2019s views as the views of the entire community writ large, however you want to define that.

Whilst I don\u2019t agree with all of the comments, I\u2019m sorry for the mistakes I made. Since some of the comments above make similar comments, I\u2019ll try to give general replies in some main-thread comments. I\u2019ll also be reaching out to some of the people in the thread above to try to work out the best way forward.</p>\n<p>My understanding is that the main worry that people have is about calling it the Effective Altruism Handbook vs. CEA\u2019s Guide to Effective Altruism or similar. For the reasons given in my reply to Scott above, I think that calling it the EA Handbook is not a significant change from before: unless we ask Ryan to take down the old handbook, then whatever happens, there will be a CEA-selected resource called the EA Handbook. For reasons given above and below, I think that the new version of the Handbook is better than the old. I think that there is some value in explicitly replacing the old version for this reason, and since \u201cEA Handbook\u201d is a cleaner name. However, I do also get people\u2019s worries about this being taken to represent the EA community as a whole. For that reason, I will make sure that the title page and introduction make clear that this is a project of CEA, and I will make clear in the introduction that others in the community would have selected different essays.</p>\n<p>My preferred approach would then be to engage with people who have expressed concern, and see if there are changes we can make that alleviate their concerns (such as those we already plan to make based on Scott\u2019s comment). If it appears that we can alleviate most of those concerns whilst retaining the value of the Handbook from from CEA\u2019s perspective, it might be best to call it the Centre for Effective Altruism\u2019s EA Handbook. Otherwise, we would rebrand. I\u2019d be interested to hear in comments whether there are specific changes (articles to add/take away/design things) that would reassure you about this being called the EA Handbook.</p>\n<p>In this comment I\u2019ll reply to some of the more object-level criticisms. I want to apologize for how this seemed to others, but also give a clearer sense of our intentions. I think that it might seem that CEA has tried merely to push AI safety as the only thing to work on. We don\u2019t think that, and that wasn\u2019t our intention. Obviously, poorly realized intentions are still a problem, but I want to reassure people about CEA\u2019s approach to these issues. </p>\n<p>First, re there not being enough discussion of portfolios/comparative advantage, this is mentioned in two of the articles (\u201cProspecting for Gold\u201d and \u201cWhat Does (and Doesn't) AI Mean for Effective Altruism?\u201d). However, I think that we could have emphasised this more, and I will see if it\u2019s possible to include a full article on coordination and comparative advantage.</p>\n<p>Second, I\u2019d like to apologise for the way the animal and global health articles came across. Those articles were commissioned at the same time as the long-term future article, and they share a common structure: What\u2019s the case for this cause? What are some common concerns about that cause? Why might you choose not to support this cause? The intention was to show how many assumptions underlie a decision to focus on any cause, and to map out some of the debate between the different cause areas, rather than to illicitly push the long-term future. It looks like this didn\u2019t come across, sorry. We didn\u2019t initially commission sub-cause profiles on government, AI and biosecurity, which explains why those more specific articles follow a different structure (mostly talks given at EA Global).</p>\n<p>Third, I want to explain some of the reasoning behind including several articles on AI. AI risk is a more unusual area, which is more susceptible to misinterpretation than global health or animal welfare. Partly for this reason, we thought that it was sensible to include several articles on this topic, with the intention that this would provide more needed background and convey more of the nuance of the idea. I will talk with some of the commenters above to discuss if it makes sense to do some sort of merge so that AI dominates the contents page less.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "cd7gwkN3MwYBRRGRc", "user": {"username": "Maxdalton"}}, {"_id": "HT6JcEhoadDCmHS2f", "postedAt": "2018-05-04T18:00:51.883Z", "postId": "MQWAsdm8MSzYNkD9X", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't think my experience matches this split.

Obviously this wouldn't carry EA forward with what the CEA thinks is maximum fidelity, but it's clear many think the CEA is trying to spread the EA message with infidelity, while acting as though they're the only actor in the movement others can trust to carry that message. It looks not only hypocritical but undermines faith in the CEA.</p>\n<p>Altering the handbook so it's more of a compromise between multiple actors in EA will redeem the reputation of the CEA. Without that, the CEA can't carry EA forward with the fidelity at all, because the rest of the movement wouldn't cooperate with them. In the meantime, the CEA and everyone else can hammer out what we think is the most good here on the EA Forum. If broader conclusions are drawn which line up with the CEA's evaluation based on a consensus the CEA had behind their perspective the best arguments, that can be included in the next edition of the EA Handbook. Again, from the CEA's perspective, that might seem like deliberately compromising the fidelity of EA in the short-term to appease others. But again, from the perspective of the CEA's current critics, why they're criticizing the 2nd edition of the EA Handbook is because they perceive themselves as protecting the fidelity of EA <em>from the Centre for Effective Altruism</em>. This could solve other contentious issues in EA, such as consideration of both s-risks <em>and</em> x-risks from AI. The EA Handbook could be published as close to identically as possible in multiple languages, which would prevent the CEA from selling EA one way in English, the EAF selling it another way in German, and creating more trust issues which would down the road just become sources of conflict, not unlike the criticism the EA Handbook, 2nd edition, is receiving now.  Ultimately, this would be the CEA making a relatively short-term compromise to ensure the long-term fidelity of EA by demonstrating themselves as delegate and representative agency the EA community can still have confidence in.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "N7qv5xD4JjvJXTEeL", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "iwXKQpC4e85Pxbw4D", "postedAt": "2018-05-04T19:57:48.767Z", "postId": "MQWAsdm8MSzYNkD9X", "htmlBody": "<p>What current EA priorities are according to the CEA is at odds with what many others think EA's current priorities are.

So the idea that this handbook will increase the movement's intellectual quality is based on definitions of quality and representation for EA many effective altruists don't share. I think this and future editions of the EA Handbook should be regarded as the community as drafts from the CEA until they carry out a project of getting as broad and substantial a swathe of feedback from important community actors as they can. This doesn't have to be a program of populist democracy where each self-identified effective altruist gets a vote. But the CEA could run the EA Handbook by EA organizations which are just as crucial to effective altruism as the CEA which don't have the phrase 'effective altruism' in their name, like ACE, Givewell, or any other organizations which are cause-specific but are community pillars nonetheless. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Tg2CBsmjMJgE7WWpt", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "bhKSjv3NDTsTv9MhJ", "postedAt": "2018-05-04T21:19:57.066Z", "postId": "MQWAsdm8MSzYNkD9X", "htmlBody": "<p>Reading the book as Epub in iBooks, in enumerations there are often certain sentences that have a bigger font size than the normal text (for instance in the section &quot;A Proposed Adjustment to the Astronomical Waste Argument&quot;).
