I do believe there are few organizations working on drug reform across the board, but it does seem plausible to say that (a) legalizing marijuana is an effective first step to broader drug reform and (b) marijuana legalization is not neglected, as there is enough force behind it to have successfully won ballot measures across the United States as well as support from many leading national politicians.

You seem to be speaking with a US-centric approach. Even if it's true medical policies are, to some extent, driven by commercial interests this is nevertheless (1) still not totally true in the US and (2) much less true outside it (e.g. the UK).
