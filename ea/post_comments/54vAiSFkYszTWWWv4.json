In this comment I\u2019m not speaking for anyone but myself.]</p><p>This post contains many suggestions for ways EA could be different.<strong> The fundamental reason that these things haven't happened, and probably won't happen, is that no-one who would be able to make them happen has decided to make them happen. I personally think this is because these proposals aren't very good.</strong> And so:</p><ul><li>people in EA roles where they could adopt these suggestions choose not to</li><li>and people who are capable/motivated enough that they could start new projects to execute on these ideas (including e.g. making competitors to core EA orgs) end up deciding not to.</li></ul><p>And so I wish that posts like this were clearer about their theory of change (henceforth abbreviated ToC). You've laid out a long list of ways that you wish EA orgs behaved differently. You've also made the (IMO broadly correct) point that a lot of EA organizations are led and influenced by a pretty tightly knit group of people who consider themselves allies; I'll refer to this group as \"core org EAs\" for brevity. But I don't understand how you hope to cause EA orgs to change in these ways.</p><ul><li>Maybe your ToC is that core org EAs read your post (and similar posts) and are intellectually persuaded by your suggestions, and adopt them.<ul><li>If that's your goal, I think you should try harder to understand why core org EAs currently don't agree with your suggestions, and try to address their cruxes. For this ToC, \"upvotes on the EA Forum\" is a useless metric--all you should care about is persuading a few people who have already thought about this all a lot. I don't think that your post here is very well optimized for this ToC.<ul><li>(Note that this doesn\u2019t mean that they think your suggestions aren\u2019t net positive, but these people are extremely busy and have to choose to pursue only a tiny fraction of the good-seeming things (which are the best-seeming-to-them things) so demonstrating that something is net positive isn't nearly enough.)</li></ul></li><li>Also, if this is the ToC, I think your tone should be one of politely suggesting ways that someone might be able to do better work by their own lights. IMO, if some EA funder wants to fund an EA org to do things a particular way, you have no particular right to demand that they do things differently, you just have the ability to try to persuade them (and it\u2019s their prerogative whether to listen).</li><li>For what it's worth, I am very skeptical that this ToC will work. I personally think that this post is very unpersuasive, and I'd be very surprised if I changed my mind to agree with it in the next year, because I think the arguments it makes are weak (and I've been thinking about these arguments for years, so it would be a bit surprising if there was a big update from thinking about them more.)</li></ul></li><li>Maybe your ToC is that other EAs read your post and are persuaded by your suggestions, and then pressure the core org EAs to adopt some of your suggestions even though they disagree with them.<ul><li>If so, you need to think about which ways EAs can actually apply pressure to the core org EAs. For example, as someone who prioritizes short-AI-timelines longtermist work over global health and development, I am not very incentivized to care about whether random GWWC members will stop associating with EA if EA orgs don't change in some particular way. In contrast, if you convinced all the longtermist EAs that they should be very skeptical of working on longtermism until there was a redteaming process like the one you described, I'd feel seriously incentivized to work on that redteaming process. Right now, the people I want to hire mostly don't agree with you that the redteaming process you named would be very informative; I encourage you to try to persuade them otherwise.</li><li>Also, I think you should just generally be scared that this strategy won't work? You want core org EAs to change a bunch of things in a bunch of really specific ways, and I don't think that you're actually going to be able to apply pressure very accurately (for similar reasons that it's hard for leaders of the environmentalist movement to cause very specific regulations to get passed).</li><li>(Note that I don't think you should engage in uncooperative behavior (e.g. trying to set things up specifically so that EA orgs will experience damage unless they do a particular thing). I think it's totally fair game to try to persuade people of things that are true because you think that that will cause those people to do better things by their own lights; I think it's not fair game to try to persuade people of things because you want to force someone's hand by damaging them. Happy to try to explain more about what I mean here if necessary; for what it's worth I don't think that this post advocates being uncooperative.)</li></ul></li><li>Perhaps you think that the core org EAs think of themselves as having a duty to defer to self-identified EAs, and so if you can just persuade a majority of self-identified EAs, the core org EAs will dutifully adopt all the suggestions those self-identified EAs want.<ul><li>I don\u2019t think this is realistic\u2013I don\u2019t think that core EA orgs mostly think of themselves as executing on the community\u2019s wishes, I think they (as they IMO should) think of themselves as trying to do as much good as possible (subject to the constraint of being honest and reliable etc).</li><li>I am somewhat sympathetic to the perspective that EA orgs have implied that they do think of themselves as trying to represent the will of the community, rather than just viewing the community as a vehicle via which they might accomplish some of their altruistic goals. Inasmuch as this is true, I think it\u2019s bad behavior from these orgs. I personally try to be clear about this when I\u2019m talking to people.</li></ul></li><li>Maybe your ToC is that you're going to start up a new set of EA orgs/projects yourself, and compete with current EA orgs on the marketplace of ideas for funding, talent, etc? (Or perhaps you hope that some reader of this post will be inspired to do this?)<ul><li>I think it would be great if you did this and succeeded. I think you will fail, but inasmuch as I'm wrong it would be great if you proved me wrong, and I'd respect you for actively trying much more than I respect you for complaining that other people disagree with you.</li><li>If you wrote a post trying to persuade EA donors that they should, instead of other options, donate to an org that you started that will do many of the research projects you suggested here, I would think that it was cool and admirable that you\u2019d done that.</li><li>For many of these suggestions, you wouldn\u2019t even need to start orgs. E.g. you could organize/fundraise for research into \u201cthe circumstances under which individual subjective Bayesian reasoning actually outperforms other modes of thought, by what criteria, and how this varies by subject/domain\u201d.</li><li>I\u2019ll generically note that if you want to make a project happen, coming up with the idea for the project is usually a tiny fraction of the effort required. Also, very few projects have been made to happen by someone having the idea for them and writing it up, and then some other person stumbling across that writeup and deciding to do the project.</li></ul></li><li>Maybe you don\u2019t have any hope that anything will change, but you heuristically believe that it\u2019s good anyway to write up lists of ways that you think other people are behaving suboptimally. For example, I have some sympathy for people who write op-eds complaining about ways that their government is making poor choices, even if they don\u2019t have a detailed theory of change.<ul><li>I think this is a fine thing to do, when you don\u2019t have more productive ways to channel your energy. In the case of this post in particular, I feel like there are many more promising theories of change available, and I think I want to urge people who agree with it to pursue those.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall my main complaint about this post is that it feels like it\u2019s fundamentally taking an unproductive stance\u2013I feel like it\u2019s sort of acting as if its goal is to persuade core EAs, but actually it\u2019s just using that as an excuse to ineffectually complain or socially pressure; if it were trying to persuade, more attention would be paid to tradeoffs and cruxes. People sympathetic to the perspective in this post should either seriously attempt to persuade, or they should resort to doing things themselves instead of complaining when others don\u2019t do those things.&nbsp;</p><p>(Another caveat on this comment: there are probably some suggestions made in this post that I would overall agree should be prioritized if I spent more time thinking about them.)</p><p>(In general, I love competition. For example, when I was on the EAIF I explicitly told some grantees that I thought that their goal should be to outcompete CEA, and I\u2019ve told at least one person that I\u2019d love it if they started an org that directly competes with my org.)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Buck"}}, {"_id": "zmj7nexsixfgytXCK", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T23:19:00.131Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>As always, I\u2019d say we should view things on a spectrum, and criticism of centralisation should be viewed as advocacy for <em>less centralisation</em> rather than rejecting centralisation entirely.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "XwEcEyZshMCBJsk9k", "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "QawS8DrtT63hmwEkm", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T23:22:16.292Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>I disagree because I would only count something as neocolonialism if there was a strong argument that it was doing net harm to the local population in the interest of the \u2018colonisers\u2019.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "6i5jWrT5ZZ7nLHdM4", "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "ccXr9XPaKbraBXACJ", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T23:22:48.451Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>If 100% of these suggestions were implemented I would expect in 5 years' time EA to look significantly worse (less effective, helping less people/animals and possibly having more FTX type scandals).</p><p>If the best 10% were implemented I could imagine that being an improvement.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "milkyway"}}, {"_id": "GJvMr9XwmPP7wEEZx", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T23:23:22.582Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>We sort of seem to be doing the opposite to me - see for example some of the logic behind <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fvqMf5hCEFdCGizbG/what-ai-safety-materials-do-ml-researchers-find-compelling\">this post</a> and some of the comments on it (though I like the post and think it's useful).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "4QTh2sMbJvpbh9aey", "user": {"username": "Guy Raveh"}}, {"_id": "dXh9v3TGc3zioteL3", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T23:23:41.507Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>I think the point regarding epidemics, and how EA excessively focuses on the individual aspects of good epistemics rather than the group aspect, is a really good point which I have surprisingly never heard before.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "nBfYWfikCQfXyfzNB", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T23:25:40.984Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>if these critiques are all correct then I think it's surprising that EA is as successful as it is</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In what ways is EA very successful?

We could set up an X-Risk journal with some editors and reviewers who are a) dedicated to pluralism and b) will publish things that are methodologically sound irrespective of result. Alternatively, a sort of open peer review system where pre-prints are published publically, with reviewers comments and then responses to these as well. &nbsp;However, for major decisions we could rely on reports written and invetigated by a number of people. Open Phil have done this to an extent, but having broader panels etc. to do these reports may be much more useful. &nbsp;Certainly its something to try.</p><p>I do think its really difficult though, but I think the current EA status quo is not working.

This is certainly the case for the climate change space, where you won't be incorporated into UN decision making and IPCC reports unless your peer reviewed.</p><p>Finally, I think your points about the 'agreed upon methods' sort of thing is really good, and this is something I'm trying to work on in XRisk.

That seems like a big ask to me, particularly given that he does not think they are good ideas. It would be like asking an evolutionary biologist to \"lay out in depth\" their reasons for rejecting all the arguments in <i>Of Pandas and People</i>. Or, for a personal example, I went to the AAAS conference right before COVID hit, and got to enjoy the spectacle of a climate change denier getting up and asking in front of the ballroom whether the geoengineering scientist who'd been speaking whether scientists had considered the possibility that the Earth is warming up because it's getting closer to the sun. His response was \"YES WE'VE CONSIDERED IT.\"</p><p>If that question asker went home, wrote a whole book full of reasons why the Earth might be moving closer to the sun, posted it online, and it got a bunch of upvotes, I don't think that means that suddenly the scientist needs to consider all of the arguments more closely, revisit the issue, or that rejecting the ideas gives one an obligation to explain all of one's reasons.</p><p>One way you could address this problem is by choosing one specific argument from this post that you find most compelling, and seeing if you can invite Buck into a debate on that topic, or to explain his thinking on it. I often find that to be productive of good conversation. But your comment read to me as an attempt to both mischaracterize the tone of Buck's comment and and call into question the degree to which he's thought about these issues. If you are accusing him of not actually having given these ideas as much thought as he claims, I think you should come right out and say it.</p>", "parentCommentId": "s5zpXq8AKHuhF4Ghm", "user": {"username": "AllAmericanBreakfast"}}, {"_id": "ecD68aBjawFastt7F", "postedAt": "2023-01-18T02:17:02.013Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>Do you think that group bargaining/voting in EA would be a good thing for funding/prioritization?<br><br>I personally like the current approach that has individual EAs and orgs make their own decisions on what is the best thing to do in the world.<br><br>For example, I would be unlikely to fund an organization that the majority of EAs in a vote believed should be funded, but I personally believed to be net harmful.

I think it's critical to look at EA activity in the broader context of other actors working in the same cause area.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffzzqbbfhez\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfzzqbbfhez\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I suggest that much of EA's value in spaces where it is a low-percentage funder is in taking a distinctive approach that zeroes in on the blind spots of bigger fish.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefanhgq4690w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnanhgq4690w\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In other words, an approach that maximizes diversity of perspective within EA may not maximize the effective diversity of perspective<i> in the cause area as a whole</i>. Also, the important question is not necessarily how good EA's epistemic&nbsp;tools would work in a&nbsp;vacuum with no one else in a given space.&nbsp;</p><p>In spaces where EA is a niche player, I am concerned that movements in the direction of&nbsp;<i>looking like other actors&nbsp;</i>may well be counterproductive. In addition to GH&amp;D, I believe that EA remains a relatively small player in animal advocacy and even in fields like pandemic prevention compared to the total amount of resources in those areas.&nbsp;</p><p>2. I feel that the proposal is holding EA up to a much higher standard at certain points than comparable movements. World Vision doesn't (to my knowledge) host a message board where everyone goes to discuss various decisions its leadership has made. I doubt the Gates Foundation devotes a percentage of its spend on hiring opposition researchers. And most major charitable funders don't crowdsource major funding decisions. Other than certain meta spending (which raises some conflict-of-interest flags for me), I don't see anything that justifies making demands of EA unless one is simultaneously making demands of similar outfits.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that a large portion of the authors' critique is about learning from others outside EA, I think that the lack of many of their proposed reforms in many similarly-sized, mature charitable movements is a significant data point. Although I believe in more process, consultation, and \"bureaucracy\" than I think the median EA does, I think there has to be a recognition that these things incur significant costs as well.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Portions of this reform package sound to my ears like the dismantling of EA and its replacement with a new movement, Democratic Altruism (\"DA\"). It seems unlikely that much of classic EA would be left after at least radical democratization -- there are likely to be a flood of incoming people, many with prior commitments, attracted by the ability to vote on how to spend $500MM of Uncle (Open) Phil's money every year. Whoever controls the voter registration function would ultimately control the money.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I think DA is a very interesting idea, and if I had a magic wand to slice off a tiny slice of each Western charitable spend and route it to a DA movement, I think that would more likely than not be net positive. I'm just not clear on why EA should feel obliged to be the ashes from which DA arises -- or why EA's funders should feel obliged to fund DA while all the other big-money interests get to keep their handpicked people making their funding-allocation decisions.</p><p>4. As I noted in a comment <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/?commentId=jou2FrGr9bsfDiAB5\">elsewhere </a>on this thread, I don't think the community has much leverage over its funders. Unfortunately, it is much easier to come up with interesting ideas than people who want to and can fund them. Especially Grade-A funders -- the proposal suggests a rejection, or at least minimization, of various classes of less-desirable donors.&nbsp;</p><p>As a recent <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zh6pZTZisqWq7AgnD/on-being-compromised\">post</a> here reminds us, \"[o]nly the young and the saints are uncompromised.\" There's rarely a realistic, easy way to get large sums of money for one's cause without becoming compromised to some extent in the process. There's the traditional way of cultivating an army of small/mid-size donors, but that takes many years, and you end up spending lots of resources and energy on care and feeding of the donors instead of&nbsp;on getting stuff done. I suspect most movements will spend a lot of time waiting to launch, and seeking funding, if they will only take Grade-A donor money. That's a massive tradeoff -- I really value my bednets! -- and it's not one I am personally desirous of making.</p><p><strong>One final, more broadly conciliatory&nbsp;point</strong>: EA can be too focused on what happens under the EA brand name and can seem relatively less interested in empowering people to do good effectively outside the brand. It doesn't have a monopoly on either effectiveness or altruism, and I've questioned (without getting much in the way of upvotes) whether it makes sense to have a unified EA movement at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>I like the idea of providing different options for people where they can do good as effectively as possible in light of their unique skills, passions, and interests. For some people, that's going to be classic GiveWell-style EA (my own likely best fit), for others it is going to be something like the current meta, for yet others it's going to be something like what is in this proposal, and there are doubtless many other potential flavors I haven't thought about. Some people in the community are happy with the status quo; some people are not. The ideal might be to have spaces where everyone would be locally happy and effective, rather than try to preserve or reform the entire ecosystem into something one personally likes (but isn't conducive to others).</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfzzqbbfhez\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffzzqbbfhez\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;For example, in Global Health &amp; Development, you have a number of NGOs [e.g., World Vision at $1.2B is several times EA's entire spend on GH&amp;D; see generally <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/lists/top-charities/?sh=76f8d6735f50\">here </a>for a list of big US charities] plus the truly big fish like the Gates Foundation [$6.7B, although not all GH&amp;D] and various governments.

While the social sciences are often ignored in the EA community one notable exception to that is (orthodox) economics. I find it ironic that one of the few fields where EA's are willing to look outside their own insular culture, is in itself extremely insular. Other social studies like philosophy, political science, history, sociology, gender studies all make a lot of attempts to integrate themselves with all the other social sciences. This makes it so that learning about one discipline <i>also</i> teaches you about the other disciplines. Economists meanwhile have a tendency to see their discipline as better than the others <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=198333\">starting papers with things like</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Economics is not only a social science, it is a genuine science. Like the physical sciences, economics uses a methodology that produces refutable implications and tests these implications using solid statistical techniques.</p></blockquote><p>In the paper <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.29.1.89\">\"The Superiority of Economists\" by Fourcade et al</a>, economists were found to be the only group that thought interdisciplinary research was worse than research from a singular field. Furthermore they looked at top papers from political science, economics and sociology. They found that political science and sociology cited economics papers many times more than the other way around:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/dgc9oel7zwvycjtity45.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/sxpeflzizo7tfcjp0mli.png 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926042/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/xlkaju0e4eip9cdvifrr.png 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/ansusgkej2civrkrpfbv.png 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/hlben6eqif5cozinplcx.png 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/gdnn1ehg1yd7xtt5f2ot.png 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/kvk5lozmdh86t6rpeyvk.png 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/ncwczjttigqwzh3packi.png 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/xkndpnc8vbiofykda93h.png 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/a2vnjt5tafofbpnqb6us.png 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672926041/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/yv3axltoxdnspdk93dr0.png 844w\"></figure><p>This lack of citing other social sciences was later confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20181508\">Angrist et al</a>:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672939714/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/rxsv1idroqbcv5ocd2ny.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672939714/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/wwlawpxodcxsezzr1av8.png 159w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672939715/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/ygo8ljthydybinfepo4m.png 239w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672939715/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/ak6yuscpx5ecgot5m175.png 319w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672939715/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/fknkjvtynspamscawvnc.png 399w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672939714/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/nysfcjy4r3kybloaxsln.png 479w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672939714/mirroredImages/aq3hSpcGeFtq7sMwX/wehf1slc7l9jtk7izkbt.png 559w\"><br>Given the complex interdisciplinary nature of societal issues, studying the basics of economics might make you overconfident that you can solve societal problems.</p><p>Take for example supply and demand.

You assign each of your beliefs a numerical probability of being true and attempt to mentally apply Bayes\u2019 theorem, increasing or decreasing the probability in question in response to new evidence. This is sometimes called \u201cBayesian epistemology\u201d in EA, but to avoid confusing it with the broader approach to formal epistemology with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_epistemology#Problem_of_priors\">same name</a> we will stick with IBT.</p></blockquote><p>This seems pretty strange characterization. Even though I participated at multiple CFAR events, do teach various 'rationality techniques' and know decent amount of &nbsp;stuff about Bayesian inference, I think this is misleading/confused.</p><p>What's called in rationalist circles \"Bayesian epistemology\" is basically what's the common understanding of the term:<br>- you don't hold beliefs to be true or false, but have credences in them<br>- normatively, you should update the credences based on evidence. normatively, the proper rule for that is the Bayes rule; this is intractable in practice, so you do various types of approximations<br>- you should strive for coherent beliefs if you don't want to be Dutch-booked<br><br>It's important to understand that in this frame, it is a <strong>normative</strong> theory. Bayes theorem in this perspective is not some sort of \"minor aid for doing some sort of likelihood calculation\" but a formal foundation for large part of epistemology.<br><br>The view that you believe different things to different degrees, and these credences basically <i>are</i> &nbsp;Bayesian probabilities and are normatively governed by the same theory isn't an 'EA' or 'rationalist' thing but a standard Bayesian take. (cf <a href=\"http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/GaussianModel/JaynesProbabilityTheory.pdf\">Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, E. T. Jaynes</a>)&nbsp;<br><br>Part of what Eliezer's approach to 'applied rationality' aimed for is taking Bayesian epistemology seriously and applying this frame to improve <i>everyday</i> reasoning.<br><br>But this is <strong>almost</strong> <strong>never done </strong>by converting your implicit probability distributions to numerical credences , doing the explicit numerical math, and blindly trusting the result!</p><p>What's done instead is<br>-noticing that your brain already internally used credences and probabilities all the time. you can easily access your \"internal\" (/S1/...) probabilities in an intuitive way by asking yourself questions like \"how surprised you would be to see [a pink car today| &nbsp;Donald Trump reelection | SpaceX rocket landing in your backyard]\" (the idea that brains do this is pretty mainstream eg <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.09.039\">Confidence as Bayesian Probability: From Neural Origins to Behavior, Meyniel et.al.</a>)<br>- noticing you brain often clearly does something a bit similar to what Bayesians suggests as the normative idea &nbsp;- e.g. if two SpaceX rockets already landed in your backyard today, you would be way less surprised by the third one<br>- noticing there is often a disconnect between this intuitive / internal / informal calculation, and the explicit, verbal reasoning (cf <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alief_(mental_state)\">alief/belief</a>)<br>- ...and using all of that to improve both the \"implicit\" and \"explicit\" reasoning!<br><br>The actual 'techniques' derived from this are often implicit. For example, one actual technique is: Imagine you are an alien who landed in one world of two. They differ in the respect that in one a proposition is true, in the other, the opposite is true. You ask yourself how the world would look like in the different worlds, and then look at the actual world.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, consider this proposition: \"democratic vote is the optimal way how to make decision making in organizations\": &nbsp;How would the world where this is true look like? There are parts of the world with intense competition between organizations, e.g. companies in highly competitive industries, optimizing hard and measurable things. In the world where the proposition is true, I'd expect a lot of voting in these companies. We don't see that, which decreases my credence in the proposition.<br><br>It is relatively easy to see how this both connected to Bayes and not asking people to do any explicit odd multiplications.</p><blockquote><p>There is nothing wrong with quantitative thinking, and much of the power of EA grows from its dedication to the numerical. However, this is often taken to the extreme, where people try to think almost exclusively along numerical lines, causing them to neglect important qualitative factors or else attempt to replace them with doubtful or even meaningless numbers because \u201csomething is better than nothing\u201d. These numbers are often subjective \u201cbest guesses\u201d with little empirical basis.<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1#fn-G9cEcNwwDByz6nEDu-27\"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p></blockquote><p><br>While some people make the error of trying to replace complex implicit calculations by the over-simplified spreadsheets with explicit numbers, this paragraph seems to conflate multiple things together as \"numerical\" or \"quantitative\".<br><br>Assuming &nbsp;fairly standard standard cognitive science and neuroscience, at some level all thinking is \"numerical\", including thinking which feels intuitive or qualitative. People usually express such thinking in words like \"I strongly feel\" or \"I'm pretty confident\"<br><br>What's a classical rationalist move in such cases is to try to make the implicit explicit. E.g., if you are fairly confident, at what odds would you be willing to bet on it?<br><br>When done correctly, the ability and willingness to do that mostly exposes what's already there. People already act based on the implicit credences and likelihoods, even if they don't try to express them as probability distributions, and you don't have access to them. &nbsp;<br><br>E.g., when some famous experts recommended 'herd immunity' strategy to deal with covid, using strong and confident words, such recommendation actually were s<i>ubjective \u201cbest guess\u201d with little empirical basis</i>. Same is actually true for many expert opinions on policy topics!<br><br>Rationalist habit of reporting credences and predictions using numbers ... basically exposes many things to possibility of being proved wrong, and exposes many <i>personal best guesses</i> for what they are.</p><p>Yes, for someone who isn't used to this at all this may create fake aura of 'certainty', because use of numbers often signals 'this is more clear' and use of words signals 'this is more slippery' in common communication. But this is just a communication protocol.<br><br>Yes, as I wrote before, some people may make the mistake &nbsp;of trying to convert some basic things to numbers and replace their brains with spreadsheets with Bayes formulas in the next step, but it does not seem common at least in my social neighborhood.</p><blockquote><p>For instance, Bayesian estimates are heavily influenced by one\u2019s initial figure (one\u2019s \u201cprior\u201d), which, especially when dealing with complex, poorly-defined, and highly uncertain and speculative phenomena, can become subjective (based on unspecified values, worldviews, and assumptions) to the point of arbitrary.<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1#fn-G9cEcNwwDByz6nEDu-28\"><sup>[28]</sup></a> This is particularly true in existential risk studies where one may not have good evidence to update on.</p></blockquote><p>I would be curious how the authors imagine the non-Bayesian thinking not depending on any priors internally works.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We assume that, with enough updating in response to evidence, our estimates will eventually converge on an accurate figure. However, this is dependent on several conditions, notably well-formulated questions, representative sampling of (accurate) evidence, and a rigorous and consistent method of translating real-world observations into conditional likelihoods.<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1#fn-G9cEcNwwDByz6nEDu-29\"><sup>[29]</sup></a> This process is very difficult even when performed as part of careful and rigorous scientific study; attempting to do it all in your head, using rough-guess or even purely intuitional priors and likelihoods, is likely to lead to more confidence than accuracy.</p></blockquote><p>This seems confused (the \"common response\" mentioned below applies here exactly). How do you imagine, for example, a group of people looking at a tree, manages to agree on seeing a tree? The process of converting raw sensory data to the tree-hypothesis is <i>way more complicated</i> &nbsp;than a typical careful and rigorous scientific study, and also <i>way more reliable</i> than a typical published scientific study.&nbsp;<br><br>Again: correctly understood, the applied rationalist idea <i>is not</i> &nbsp;to replace our mind's natural ways of recognizing a tree by a process where you would assign numbers to statements like \"green in upper left part of visual field\" and do explicit Bayesian calculation in S2 way, but just to be ...less wrong.</p><blockquote><p>This is further complicated by the fact that probabilities are typically distributions rather than point values \u2013 often very messy distributions that we don\u2019t have nice neat formulae for. Thus, \u201cupdating\u201d properly would involve manipulating big and/or ugly matrices in your head. Perhaps this is possible for some people.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A common response to these arguments is that Bayesianism is \u201chow the mind really works\u201d, and that the brain already assigns probabilities to hypotheses and updates them similarly or identically to Bayes\u2019 rule. There are good <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/are-brains-bayesian/\">reasons</a> to believe that this may be true. However, the fact that we may intuitively and subconsciously work along Bayesian lines does not mean that our attempts to consciously \u201cdo the maths\u201d will work.</p></blockquote><p>I think the \"common response\" is partially misunderstood here? The common response does not imply you can consciously explicitly multiply the large matrices or do the exact &nbsp;Bayesian inferences, any more than someone a catching a ball would be consciously and explicitly solving the equations of motion.<br><br>The correct ideas here are:<br>- you can often make some parts or results of the implicit subconscious calculations explicit and numeric (cf forecasting, betting, ...)<br>- the implicit reasoning is often biased and influenced by wishes and wants<br>- explicitly stating things or betting on things sometimes exposes the problems<br>- explicit reasoning can be good for that<br>- explicit reasoning is also good for understanding what the normatively good move is in simple or idealized cases<br>- on the other hand, explicit reasoning alone is computationally underpowered for almost anything beyond very simple models. (compare how many FLOPs is your brain using, vs. how fast you can explicitly multiply numbers)<br>- what you usually need to do is use both, and watch for flaws<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In addition, there seems to have been little empirical study of whether Individual Bayesian Updating actually outperforms other modes of thought, never mind how this varies by domain. It seems risky to put so much confidence in a relatively unproven technique.</p></blockquote><p>Personally I don't know anyone who would propose people should do the \"Individual Bayesian Thinking\" mode of thoughts in the way you describe, and I don't see much reason to make a study on this. &nbsp;Also while a lot people in EA orgs subscribe to basically Bayesian epistemology, I don't know anyone who would try to live by the \"IBT\", so you should probably be less worried about the risks from the use of it.</p><blockquote><p>The process of Individual Bayesian Updating can thus be critiqued on scientific grounds,&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So, to me, this is characteristic - and, frankly, annoying - about the whole text. I don't think you have properly engaged with Bayesian epistemology, state of art applied rationality practice, or relevant cognitive science. \"critiqued on scientific grounds\" sounds serious and authoritative ... but where is the science?<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>but there is also another issue with it and hyper-quantitative thinking more generally: motivated reasoning. With no hard qualitative boundaries and little constraining empirical data, <strong>the combination of expected value calculations and Individual Bayesian Thinking in EA allows one to justify and/or rationalise essentially anything</strong> <strong>by generating suitable numbers</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><br>This is both sad and funny. One of the good things about rationalist habits and techniques is, stating explicit numbers often allows one to spot and correct motivated reasoning. &nbsp;In relation to existential risk and similar domains, often the hope is that by practicing this in domains with good feedback and bets which are possible to empirically evaluate, you get better at thinking clearly... and this will at least partially &nbsp;generalize to epistemically more challenging domains.<br><br>Yes, you can overdo it, or do stupid or straw versions of this. Yes, it is not perfect.<br><br>But what's the alternative? Honestly, in my view, in many areas of expertise the alternative is to state views, claims and predictions in sufficiently slippery and non-quantitative way that it is very difficult to clearly disprove them.<br><br>Take for example your text and claims about <i>diversity</i>. I think given the way you are using it, it seems anyone trying to refute the advise on empirical grounds would have really hard time, and you would be always able to write some story why some dimension of diversity is not important, or why some other piece of research states something else. (It seems a common occurrence in humanities that some confused ideas basically never die, unless they lose support on the level of 'sociology of science'.)<br><br>Bottom line:&nbsp;<br>- these 8 paragraphs did not convince me about any mistake people at e.g. FHI may be making<br>- suggestion \"Bayes\u2019 theorem should be applied where it works\" is pretty funny; I guess Bayesians wholeheartedly agree with this!<br>- suggestions like \"studies of circumstances under which individual subjective Bayesian reasoning actually outperforms other modes of thought\" seems irrelevant given the lack of understanding of actual 'rationality techniques'<br>- we have real world evidence that getting better at some of the traditional \"rationalist\" skills makes you better at least at some measurable things, e.g. forecasting<br><br>I suspect ... that even what I see as a wrong model of 'erros of EA' maybe points &nbsp;to some interesting evidence.

However, drugs like alcohol, pot, and chocolate would plausibly get no ASI sympathy. Would the threat of intelligent, benevolent ASI that take away interest in popular drugs (e.g ,through bodily control of us) be enough to halt AI development? Such a genuine threat might defeat the billionaire-aligned incentives behind AI development.</p>\n<p>By the way, would EA's enjoy installing sewage and drinking water systems in small US towns 20-30 years from now?

However, like other commentators I feel that if these proposals were implemented, EA would just become the same as many other left wing social movements, and, as far as I can tell, would basically become the same as standard forms of left wing environmentalism which are already a live option for people with this type of outlook, and get far more resources than EA ever has. I also think many of the proposals here have been rejected for good reason, and that some of the key arguments are &nbsp;weak.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>You begin by citing the Cowen quote that \"EAs couldn't see the existential risk to FTX even though they focus on existential risk\". I think this is one of the more daft points made by &nbsp;a serious person on the FTX crash. Although the words 'existential risk' are the same here, they have completely different meanings, one being about the extinction of all humanity or things roughly as bad as that, and the other being about risks to a particular organisation. The problem with FTX is that there wasn't enough attention to existential risks to FTX and the implications this would have for EA. &nbsp;In contrast, EAs have put umpteen person hours into assessing existential risks to humanity and the epistemic standards used to do that are completely different to those used to assess FTX.&nbsp;</li><li>You cite research purporting to show that diversity of some form is good for collective epistemics and general performance. I haven't read the book that you cite, but I have looked into some of this literature, and as one might expect for a topic that is so politically charged, a lot of the literature is not good, and some of the literature actually points in the opposite direction, even though it is career suicide to criticise diversity, and there are likely personal costs even for me discussing counter-arguments here. &nbsp;For example, this <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289616303282\">paper</a> suggests that group performance is mainly determined by the individual intelligence of the group members not by things like gender diversity. This <a href=\"https://ideas.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Milliken-Martins-1996.pdf\">paper</a> lists various costs of team diversity that are bad for collective dynamics. You say that diversity \"essentially along all dimensions\" is good for epistemics. This is the sort of claim that sounds good, but also seems to be clearly false. I seldom see people who make this argument suggest that we need more Trump supporters, religious fundamentalists, homophobes or people without formal education in order to improve our performance as a community. These are all huge chunks of the national/global community but also massively underrepresented in EA. There are lots of communities that are much more diverse than EA but which also seem to have far worse epistemics than EA. Examples include Catholicism, Trumpism, environmentalism, support of Bolsonaro/Modi etc.</li><li>Relatedly, I think value alignment is very important. I have worked in organisations with a mix of EA and non EA people and it definitely made things much harder than if everyone were aligned, holding other things equal. On one level, it is not surprising that a movement trying to achieve something would agree not just at a very abstract level, but also about many concrete things about the world. If I think that stopping AI progress is good and you think it is bad, it is going to be much harder (though not impossible, per moral trade) for us to achieve things in the world. Same for speeding up progress in virus synthesis. The 80,000 Hours articles on goal directed groups are very good on this.&nbsp;</li><li>I don't agree that EA is hostile to criticism. In fact it seems unusually open to criticism, and rational discussion of ideas rather than dismissing them on the basis of vibe/mood affiliation/political amenability. Aside from the controversial Cremer and Kemp case (who didn't publish pseudonymously) what are the major critiques that have been presented pseudonymously or have caused serious personal consequences for the critics? By your definition, I think my critique of GiveWell counts as deep, but I have been &nbsp;rewarded for this because people thought the arguments were good. To stress, mine and Hauke's claim was that <i>most of the money EA has spent</i> has been highly suboptimal.&nbsp;</li><li>You say \"For instance, (intellectual) ability is implicitly assumed within much of EA to be a single variable[32], which is simply higher or lower for different people.\" This isn't just an assumption of EA, but a central finding of psychological science that things that are usually classed as intellectual abilities are strongly correlated - the g factor. eg maths ability is correlated with social science ability, and english literature ability etc.&nbsp;</li><li>I just don't think it is true that we align well with the interests of tech billionaires. We've managed to persuade two billionaires of EA and one believed in EA before he became a billionaire. The vast majority of billionaires evidently don't buy it and go off and do their own thing, mainly donating to things that sound good in their country, to climate change, or not donating at all. Longtermist EAs would like lots more money to spent on AI alignment, slowing down AI progress, on slowing down progress in virology or increasing spending on counter-measures, and on preventing major wars. I don't see how any of these things promise to benefit tech founders as a particular constituency in any meaningful way. That being said, I agree that there is a problem with rich people becoming spokespeople for the community or overly determining what gets done and we need far better systems to protect against that in future. eg FTX suddenly deciding to do all this political stuff was a big break from previous wisdom and wasn't questioned enough.&nbsp;</li><li>On &nbsp;a personal note, I get that I am a non-expert in climate, and so am wide open to criticism as an interloper (though I have published a paper on climate change). But then it is also true that getting climate people to think in EA terms is very difficult. Also, the view I recently outlined is basically in line with all climate economics. In that sense the view I hold and I think is widely held in longtermist EA is in line with one expert consensus. Indeed, it is striking that this is the one group that actually tries to quantify the aggregate costs of climate change. I also don't think there are any areas where I disagree with the line taken by the IPCC which is supposed to express the expert consensus on climate. The view that 4\u00baC is going to kill everyone is one held by some activists and a small number of scientists. Either way we need to explain why we are ignoring all the climate economists and listening to Rockstrom/Lenton instead. On planetary boundaries, as far as I know, I am the only EA to have criticised planetary boundaries, and I don't dismiss it in passing, but in fact at considerable length. The reviewer I had for that section is a prof and strongly agreed with me.</li><li>Differential tech progress has been subject to peer review. The Bostrom articles on it are peer reviewed.&nbsp;</li><li>The implications of &nbsp;democratising EA are mindboggling. Suppose that Open Phil's spending decisions are made democratically by EAs. This would put EAs in charge of ~$10bn. We'd then need to decide who counts as an EA. Because so much money would be on the table, lots of people who we wouldn't class as EAs would want a say, and it would be undemocratic to exclude them (I assume). So, the 'EA franchise' would expand to anyone who wants a say (?) I don't know where the money would end up after all this, but it's fair to say that money spent on reducing engineered pandemics, AI and farm animal welfare would fall from the current pitiful sum to close to zero.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;You say that worker self-management has been proven to be better for mission-oriented work than top-down rule. This is clearly false. There is a tiny pocket of worker cooperatives (eg in the Basque region) who have been fairly successful. But almost all companies are run oligarchially in a top-down fashion by boards or leadership groups.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Overall, we need to learn hard lessons from the FTX debacle. But thus far, the collapse has mainly been used to argue for things that are completely unrelated to FTX, and mainly to an advance an agenda that has been disfavoured in EA so far, and with good reason. For Cowen, this was neoliberal progress, here it is left wing environmentalism.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "yeEzLiSXkf66Eutr6", "postedAt": "2023-01-18T18:53:30.455Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for the reply Jan.

Contribution to climate change is vastly skewed in terms of wealth: the richest 10% of the world population was responsible for 52% of cumulative carbon emissions based on all of the goods and services they consumed through the 1990\u20132015 period, while the poorest 50% accounted only for 7% (Gore, Reference Gore2020; Oswald et al., Reference Oswald, Owen, Steinberger, Yannick, Owen and Steinberger2020).</p>\n<p>A just distribution of the global carbon budget (a conceptual tool used to guide policy) (Matthews et al., Reference Matthews, Tokarska, Nicholls, Rogelj, Canadell, Friedlingstein, Thomas, Fr\u00f6licher, Forster, Gillett, Ilyina, Jackson, Jones, Koven, Knutti, MacDougall, Meinshausen, Mengis, S\u00e9f\u00e9rian and Zickfeld2020) would require the richest 1% to reduce their current emissions by at least a factor of 30, while per capita emissions of the poorest 50% could increase by around three times their current levels on average (UNEP, 2020). Rich countries' current and promised action does not adequately respond to the climate crisis in general, and, in particular, does not take responsibility for the disparity of emissions and impacts (Zimm &amp; Nakicenovic, Reference Zimm and Nakicenovic2020). For instance, commitments based on Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement are insufficient for achieving net-zero reduction targets (United Nations Environment Programme, 2020).\"</p>\n<p>Whether 1.5 is really in reach anymore is debatable.

(Though these people don't necessarily get along or agree on things--for example, I think William MacAskill is a well-intentioned guy but I disagree with him a bunch on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j8afBEAa7Xb2R9AZN/thoughts-on-whether-we-re-living-at-the-most-influential\">important questions about the future</a> and various short-term strategy things.)&nbsp;</p><blockquote><ul><li>If the authors of this post are asking for community opinion on which changes are good after giving concerns, the top (for a while at least) comment being criticising this for a lack of theory of change suggests a low regard of the EA leadership to the opinions of the EA community overall (regardless of agreement to any specific element of the original post)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Not speaking for anyone else here, but it's totally true that I have a pretty low regard for the quality of the average EA Forum comment/post, and don't think of the EA Forum as a place where I go to hear good ideas about ways EA could be different (though occasionally people post good content here).</p><blockquote><ul><li>Unless I am very high up and in the core EA group, I am unlikely to be listened to</li></ul></blockquote><p>For whatever it's worth, in my experience, people who show up in EA and start making high-quality contributions quickly get a reputation among people I know for having useful things to say, even if they don't have any social connection.</p><p>I gave a talk yesterday where someone I don't know made some objections to an argument I made, and I provisionally changed my mind about that argument based on their objections.</p><blockquote><ul><li>While EA is open to criticism in theory, it is not open to changing based on criticism as the leadership has already reasoned about this as much as they are going to</li></ul></blockquote><p>I think \"criticism\" is too broad a category here. I think it's helpful to provide novel arguments or evidence. I also think it's helpful to provide overall high-level arguments where no part of the argument is novel, but it's convenient to have all the pieces in one place (e.g. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gTaDDJFDzqe7jnTWG/some-thoughts-on-public-discourse\">Katja Grace on slowing down AI</a>).

Here is my real response:</p><p><br>In terms of whether it is \"fair game\" or not: consider some junior EA who made a comment to you, \"I would prefer an EA forum without your critical writing on it\". This has basically zero implications for you. No one is going to take them seriously, unless they provide receipts and point out what they disliked. But this isn't the case in reverse. So I think if you are someone seen to be a \"powerful EA\", or someone whose opinion is taken pretty seriously, you should take significant care when making statements like this, because some people might update simply based on your views. I haven't engaged with much of weeatquince's work, but EA is a sufficiently small enough community that these kinds of opinions can probably a harmful impact on someone's involvement in EA-I don't think the disclaimers around \"I no longer do grantmaking for the EAIF\" are particularly reassuring on this front. For example, I imagine if Holden came and made a comment in response to someone \"I find your posts unhelpful, distracting, and unpleasant. I would prefer an EA forum without your critical writing on it\", this could lead to information cascades and reputational repercussions that don't accurately reflect weeatquince's actual quality of work. You are not Holden, but it would be reasonable for you to expect your opinions to have sway in the EA community.</p><p>FWIW, your comment will negatively update people towards posting under their main accounts, and I think a forum environment where people feel even more inclined to make alt accounts because they are worried about reputational repercussions from someone like you coming along with a comment like \"I would prefer an EA Forum without your critical writing on it\" <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4WxHNBf5LeM9gQneT/you-should-write-on-the-ea-forum#Be_kind__don_t_make_the_Forum_more_intimidating_\">is intimidating </a>and not ideal for community engagement.

If EA became more structurally similar to e.g. some environmentalist movements in some ways, e.g. democratic decision-making, would that actually be a bad thing in itself? What about standard-practice transparency measures? To what extent would you prefer EA to be suboptimal in exchange for retaining aspects that would otherwise make it distinctive?<br>&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, we\u2019re honestly a little unsure how you reached the conclusion that our reforms would lead EA to be \u201cbasically the same as standard forms of left-wing environmentalism\u201d, and would be interested in you spelling this out a bit. We assume there are aspects of EA you value beyond what we have criticised, such as an obsessive focus on impact, our commitment to cause-prioritisation, and our willingness to quantify (which is often a good thing, as we say in the post), etc., all of which are frequently lacking in left-wing environmentalism.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>But why, as you say, was so little attention paid to the risk FTX posed? One of the points we make in the post is that the artificial separation of individual \u201crisks\u201d like this is frequently counterproductive. A simple back-casting or systems-mapping exercise (foresight/systems-theoretical techniques) would easily have revealed EA\u2019s significant exposure and vulnerability (disaster risk concepts) to a potential FTX crash. The overall level of x-risk is presumably tied to how much research it gets, and the FTX crash clearly reduced the amount of research that will get done on x-risk any time soon.&nbsp;<br><br>These things are related, and must be treated as such.&nbsp;<br><br>Complex patterns of causation like this are just the kind of thing we are advocating for exploring, and something you have confidently dismissed in the recent past, e.g. in the comments on your recent climate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv/climate-change-and-longtermism-new-book-length-report\"><u>post</u></a>.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We agree that the literature does not all point in one direction; we cited the two sources we cited because they act as recent summaries of the state of the literature as a whole, which includes findings in favour of the positive impacts of e.g. gender and age diversity.<br><br>We concede that \u201cessentially all dimensions\u201d was an overstatement: sloppy writing on our part, of which we are sure there is more of in the manifesto, for which we apologise. Thank you for highlighting this.&nbsp;<br><br>On another note, equating \u201ccriticising diversity\u201d in any form with \u201ccareer suicide\u201d seems like something of an overstatement.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We agree that there is a balance to be struck, and state this in the post. The issue is that EA uses seemingly neutral terms to hide orthodoxy, is far too far towards one end of the value-alignment spectrum, and actively excludes many valuable people and projects because they do not conform to said orthodoxy.<br><br>This is particularly visible in existential risk, where EA almost exclusively funds TUA-aligned projects despite the TUA\u2019s surprisingly poor academic foundations (inappropriate usage of forecasting techniques, implicit commitment to outdated or poorly-supported theoretical frameworks, phil-of-sci considerations about methodological pluralism, etc.) as well as the generally perplexed and unenthusiastic reception it gets in non-EA Existential Risk Studies.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Unfortunately, you are not in the best position to judge whether EA is hostile to criticism. You are a highly orthodoxy-friendly researcher (this is not a criticism of you or your work, by the way!) at a core EA organisation with significant name-recognition and personal influence, and your critiques are naturally going to be more acceptable.<br><br>We concede that we may have neglected the role of the seniority of the author in the definition of \u201cdeep\u201d critique: it surely plays a significant role, if only due to the hierarchy/deference factors we describe. On examples of chilled works, the very point we are making is the presence of the chilling effect: critiques are not published *because* of the chilling effect, so of course there are few examples to point to.<br><br>If you want one example in addition to Democratising Risk, consider our post? The comments also hold several examples of people who did not speak up on particular issues because they feared losing access to EA funding and spaces.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We are not arguing that general intelligence is completely nonexistent, but that the conception commonplace within EA is highly oversimplified: to say that factors in intelligence are correlated does not mean that everything can be boiled down to a single number. There are robust critiques of the&nbsp;<i>g</i> concept that are growing over time (e.g.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0669-9_6\"><u>here</u></a>) as well as factors that are typically neglected (see the Emotional Intelligence paper we cited). Hence, calling monodimensional intelligence a \u201ccentral finding of psychological science\u201d, implying it to be some kind of consensus position, is somewhat courageous,<br><br>In fact, this could be argued to represent the sort of ideologically-agreeable overconfidence we warn of with respect to EAs discussing subjects in which they have no expertise.<br><br>Our post also mentions other issues with intelligence based-deference: how being smart doesn\u2019t mean that someone should be deferred to on all topics, etc.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We are not arguing that every aspect of EA thought is determined by the preferences of EA donors, so the fact that e.g. preventing wars does not disproportionately appeal to the ultra-wealthy is orthogonal.<br><br>We concede that we may have neglected cultural factors: in addition to the \u201chard\u201d money/power factors, there is also the \u201csofter\u201d fact that much of EA culture comes from upper-middle-class Bay Area tech culture, which indirectly causes EA to support things that are popular within that community, which naturally align with the interests of tech companies.*<br><br>We are glad that you agree on the spokesperson point: we were very concerned to see e.g. 80kH giving uncritical positive coverage to the crypto industry given the many harms it was already know to be doing prior to the FTX crash, and it is encouraging to hear signals that this sort of thing may be less common going forward.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We agree that getting climate people to think in EA terms can be difficult sometimes, but that is not necessarily a flaw on their part: they may just have different axioms to us. In other cases, we agree that there are serious problems (which we have also struggled with at times) but it is worth reminding ourselves that, as we note in the post, we too can be rather resistant to the inputs of domain-experts. Some of us, in particular, considered leaving EA at one point because it was so (at times, frustratingly) difficult to get other EAs to listen to us when we talked about our own areas of expertise. We\u2019re not perfect either is all we\u2019re saying.&nbsp;<br><br>Whilst we agree with you that we shouldn\u2019t only take Rockstrom etc. as \u201cthe experts\u201d, and do applaud your analysis that existential catastrophe from climate change is unlikely, we don\u2019t believe your analysis is particularly well-suited to the extremes we would expect for GCR/x-risk scenarios. It is precisely when such models fall down, when civilisational resilience is less than anticipated, when cascades like in RIchards et al. 2021 occur etc., that the catastrophes we are worried about are most likely to happen. X-risk studies relatively low probability unprecedented scenarios that are captured badly by economic models etc. (as with TAI being captured badly by the markets), and we feel your analysis demands certain levels of likelihood and confidence from climate x-risk that is (rightfully, we think) not demanded of e.g. AI or biorisk.&nbsp;<br><br>We should expect IPCC consensus not to capture x-risk concerns, because (hopefully) the probabilities are low enough for it not to be something they majorly consider, and, as Climate Endgame points out, there has thus far not been lots of x-risk research on climate change.&nbsp;<br><br>Otherwise, there have been notable criticisms of much of the climate economics field, especially its more optimistic end (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14747731.2020.1807856\"><u>this</u></a> paper), but we concur that it is not something that needs to be debated here.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We did not say that differential technological development had not been subjected to peer review, we said that it has not been subjected to \u201csignificant amounts of rigorous peer review and academic discussion\u201d, which is true; apologies if it implied something else. This may not be true forever: we are very excited about the discussion of the current Sandbrink et al 2022 pre-print, for instance. All we were noting here is that important concepts in EA are often in their academic infancy (as you might expect from a movement with new-ish concepts) and thus often haven\u2019t been put to the level of academic scrutiny that is often made out internally.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>You assume incorrectly, and apologies if this is also an issue with our communication. We never advocated for opening up the vote to anyone who asked, so fears in this vein are fortunately unsupported. We agree that defining \u201cwho gets a vote\u201d is a major crux here, but we suggest that it is a question that we should try to answer rather than using it as justification for dismissing the entire concept of democratisation. In fact, it seems like something that might be suitable for consensus-building tools, e.g. pol.is.<br><br>Committing to and fulfilling the Giving Pledge for a certain length of time, working at an EA org, doing community-building work, donating a certain amount/fraction of your income, active participation at an EAG, as well as many others that EAs could think of if we put some serious thought into the problem as a community, are all factors that could be combined to define some sort of boundary.<br><br>Given a somewhat costly signal of alignment it becomes unlikely that someone would go \u201cdeep cover\u201d in EA in order to have a very small chance of being randomly selected to become one among multiple people in a sortition assembly deliberating on broad strategic questions about the allocation of a certain proportion of one EA-related fund or another.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We are puzzled as to how you took \u201ccollaborative, mission-oriented work\u201d to refer exclusively to for-profit corporations. Naturally, e.g. Walmart could never function as a cooperative, because Walmart\u2019s business model relies on its ability to exploit and underpay its workers, which would not be possible if those workers ran the organisation. There are indeed corporations (most famously Mondragon) that function of co-operative lines, as well as the Free Open-Source Software movement, Wikipedia, and many other examples.<br><br>Of most obvious relevance, however, is social movements like EA. If one wants a movement to reliably and collaboratively push for certain types of socially beneficial changes in certain ways and avoid becoming a self-perpetuating bureaucracy, it should be run collaboratively by those pushing for those changes in those certain ways and avoid cultivating a managerial elite \u2013 cf. the Iron Law of Institutions we mentioned, and more substantively the history of social movements; essentially every Leninist political party springs to mind.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>As we say in the post, this was overwhelmingly written before the FTX crash, and the problems we describe existed long before it. The FTX case merely provides an excellent example of some of the things we were concerned about, and for many people shattered the perhaps idealistic view of EA that stopped so many of the problems we describe from being highlighted earlier.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we are not sure why you are so keen to repeatedly apply the term \u201cleft wing environmentalism\u201d. Few of us identify with this label, and the vast majority of our claims are unrelated to it.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>* We actually touch on it a little: the mention of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Californian_Ideology\"><u>Californian Ideology</u></a>, which we recommend everyone in EA reads.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ozRznMufinRxvnMYk", "user": {"username": "ConcernedEAs"}}, {"_id": "xwBiLwAPNwzT9grzM", "postedAt": "2023-01-21T22:42:07.775Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>As was said elsewhere, I think Holden\u2019s is an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\">example</a>.

According to the 2020 EA survey, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ThdR8FzcfA8wckTJi/ea-survey-2020-demographics\">EA is 71% male and 76% white</a>. I couldn\u2019t quickly find the actual distribution of EA income, but eyeballing some graphs <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nb6tQ5MRRpXydJQFq/ea-survey-2020-series-donation-data#Donation_and_income_for_recent_years\">here</a> and using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_middle_class\">$100,000 household income as a threshold</a> (say $60,000 individual income) and $600k household upper bound (upper class is roughly the 1% top earners), I would estimate around one third of EAs would be upper middle class now. But I think your point was that they came from an upper-middle-class background, which I have not seen data on. I would still doubt it would be more than half of EAs, so let\u2019s be generous and use that. Using your list above of analytic philosophy, mathematics, computer science, or economics, that is about <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Em7kSysc3STrH9HhQ/ea-survey-2017-series-demographics-ii\">53% of EAs</a> (2017 data, so probably lower now). If these characteristics were all independent, that would indicate the product of about 14% of EAs would have all these characteristics. Now there is likely positive correlation between these characteristics, but I believe by definition that with the numbers above, it can't the exceed the 50% upper middle class, even if all of those happen to be male, white, and those majors.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "XnvJYf9ofX38itbfg", "user": {"username": "Denkenberger"}}, {"_id": "ajjZGcygb8iLedhe2", "postedAt": "2023-01-22T13:21:27.685Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree that is the other way out of the puzzle.

EA is tainted with centrist stink that looks at problems which are \"controversial\" in mass media and therefore *must* be actually controversial (ex. Palestine-Israel). Getting more people involved in \"doing good\" seems like an obvious answer yet most EA solutions seem to be power-flattering answers that want you to make a lot of money and donate it to EA, while making 0 effort to convince your friends or society.</p><p>As someone with a statistics degree, EA falls for the same \"data wonk\" trap a lot of wonks fall into - difficulty to quantify leads you to focusing on quantifiable areas, which are usually correlated with power and the status quo. EA is a very young movement yet they lack the historical knowledge to realize people were once very sure the best thing to do with mentally unwell people was lock them in an asylum for their lives. (The critique calls these last two paragraphs \u201cEA orthodoxy\u201d.)</p><p>I'm going to skim through the critique and add stuff where I think it matters.</p><p>I've avoided participating in EA because I'm not at a point where I'm doing significant philanthropy, and the heavy vibe of all the posts in the community is you need a bundle of keywords to participate. Words like epistemology, prior, Bayesian (I know this one, but seemingly not in the way people use it), utilitarian, objectively. I have a 4 year degree and can't participate, so we know that around 90% of the world population cannot participate in EA forums. I feared getting torn to shreds for making the point which should be obvious- how do we know what 3 generations from now will want, let alone 3 million? I am especially unconvinced that intelligence in the universe is an automatic good; nor do I believe that 10^1000 intelligent minds is inherently better than 10^10.</p><p>Anyone who hasn't seen bitcoin specifically and 99.9% of all crypto as a full stop ponzi scheme does not deserve the descriptor \"rational\". SBF should've been viewed as a useful con artist's mark; EA should've been happy to take his money but assumed it was going to collapse. There are dozens of very rational takedowns of crypto out there.</p><p>100% this: \"At the very least, critics have learned to watch their tone at all costs, and provide a constant stream of unnecessary caveats and reassurances in order to not be labelled \u201cemotional\u201d or \u201coverconfident\u201d.\" Centrists hate emotion, and if you're emotional you have already lost the argument. I have a strong emotional response to people being locked in cages for stealing baby formula, and because of that I am a loser in the eyes of EA. (Does emotion not guide deworming initiatives? Or are EAs just happy to make a number go up? I can't tell)</p><p>\"When Stuart Russell argues that AI could pose an existential threat to humanity, he is held up as someone worth listening to \u2013\u201dHe wrote the book on AI, you know!\u201d However, if someone of comparable standing in Climatology or Earth-Systems Science, e.g. Tim Lenton or Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, says the same for their field, they are ignored, or even pilloried.[39] Moderate statements from the IPCC are used to argue that climate change is \u201cnot an existential risk\u201d, but given significant expert disagreement among experts on e.g. deep learning capabilities, it seems very unlikely that a consensus-based \u201cIntergovernmental Panel on Artificial Intelligence\u201d would take a stance anything like as extreme as that of most prominent EAs. This seems like a straightforward example of confirmation bias to us. \"</p><p>EAs care a lot about pandemic risk. They were proven right with COVID. What they are still unable to reckon with is the inability of the science to affect mass change. 5% of the world(?) has had COVID, we have no idea if that will lower those people's life expediencies or QALYs but doctors say it probably will, it has conservatively caused $10 trillion in damage and killed ~7 million people, and ruined most people's entire 2020 if not continues to ruin their lives on a day to day basis. And yet most of the western world has done very little to contain the disease, regardless of political affiliation or economic status. People called COVID a \"baby pandemic\" or \"baby catastrophe\", a trial run for how humanity will deal with a much harder threat. We completely failed.</p><p>Let's say you had a billion dollars to address \"pandemic risk\" in the world. Could you actually meaningfully reduce pandemic risk? I'm not sure you can - the reasons for this are heavily aligned with leftist thought, so of course the centrists in EA have no vocabulary to deal with it. (Things to consider are capitalism, white supremacy, the rich at Davos have rigorous covid mitigation in place and therefor do not care that the poor at Walmart do not, the rich control the mass media and their wealth depends on people continuing to shop...)</p><p>On twitter I follow the likes of health reporter Helen Branswell, and she retweets mainstream scientists from ex. Stanford, MIT, Harvard; and most health reporters, experts, and scientists cannot fathom the voluntary preventable mass death and disabling event that COVID continues to be. They were told, like many EA practitioners, that \"politics\" is bad, and we just need \"data and science\", and fail to realize that even showing up to work is political, not saying \"the government is a death cult\" is political, not saying \"the hospital I work at is forcing nurses to work 12 hour shifts with crappy COVID mitigation, to save the lives of patients who don't believe they have COVID yet are infecting the same nurses, and these nurses deserve fair hazard pay for these horrible conditions\" is political. If you worked remote for UPMC (largest hospital network in PA, US), you were offered a COVID vaccine before the contractor nurses and janitors who actually walked into COVID hospitals every day. This is a class issue, like it or not, and dumping a billion dollars into it won't solve class.</p><p>One thing that's been nipping at me that I haven't seen anyone in EA say - fraud is not inherently bad. I would happily defraud a billionaire who made their fortune grinding up human babies. It seems like EA distanced themselves so thoroughly from SBF because it made the movement look bad and fraudulent, not that the actions were themselves bad. In SBF's case, I don't agree with defrauding regular people. But if some moronic 10 millionaire lost 5 of those millions by putting money into something that reeked of a ponzi scheme with no actual value, I'm not losing sleep over that. You could even argue it's a net good if say, 50% of that ended up donated to EA, and that millionaire wouldn't have donated it otherwise. I'm not sure if I will get banned for saying this, which is asinine in a movement which will readily praise you letting literal living humans today starve so that we can maybe grow more brains in a jar in 10 million years. If you ban me you're literally admitting that stealing money is worse than letting someone die.</p><p>Most centrists believe whatever elites have defined as \"crime\" is bad, which makes them fit right into the status quo. Centrists don't question why nobody is prosecuted for clean water act violations or wealthy tax fraud. Every shoplifting prosecution should give you pause: \"objectively\" the damage of elite crimes is far worse. https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/the-punishment-bureaucracy</p><p>I like the callout of \"theories of change\" and \"Funding bodies should within 6 months publish lists of sources they will not accept money from, regardless of legality\". Poisonous funders are, IMO: any recreational drug (drugs are fine but drug companies are not), fast food and hard-to-define junk food, advertising, policing/prosecution/jailing/surveillence/support thereof (Palantir and ICE), 99.9% of crypto (when a good crypto comes out, we'll know), fossil fuels, cars, probably a supermajority of animal products companies (and I'm not vegetarian).</p><p>[1] https://twitter.com/sarahtaber_bww/status/1617194799261487108</p><p>[2] https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Seglegs"}}, {"_id": "cc89waCTMK6Ptt6Bw", "postedAt": "2023-01-22T20:51:29.609Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you!

In contrast, if the climate scientist's organization built its headquarters in a flood plain and didn't buy insurance, the resulting flood which destroyed the HQ would reduce my confidence in their ability to assess climate x-risk because they have shown themselves incompetent at least once in at assessing climate risks chose to them.</p><p>In contrast, EA (and the FF in particular) asserts/ed expertise in x-risk more generally.

Boiled down, I think the point that Cowen makes stripped of the rhetoric is just that EAs did a bad job on the governance and management of risks involved in working with SBF and FTX, which is very obvious and everyone already agrees with.

Your argument implies that value alignment on non-TUA things would be good. Correspondingly, if what you call 'TUA' (which I think is a bit of a silly label - how is it techno-utopian to think we're all going to be killed by technology?) is actually good, then value alignment on it seems good.&nbsp;</li><li>You argued in your post that people often have to publish pseudonymously for fear of censure or loss of funding and the examples you have given are (1) your own post, and (2) a forum post on conflicts of interest. It's somewhat self-fulfilling to publish something pseudonymously and then use that as an argument that people have to publish things pseudonymously. &nbsp;I don't think it was rational for you to publish the post pseudonymously - I don't think you will face censure if you present rational arguments, and you will have to tell people what you actually think about the world eventually anyway. (btw I'm not a researcher at a core EA org any more.)<ol><li>I don't think the seniority argument works here. A couple of examples spring to mind here. Leopold Aschenbrenner wrote a critique of EA views on economic growth, for which we was richly rewarded despite being a teenager (or whatever). The recent post about AI timelines and interest rates got a lot of support, even though it criticises a lot of EA research on timelines.

But at least the single number of the g factor conveys a lot of information about how intelligent people are and explains about 40-50% of the variation in individual performance on <i>any</i> given cognitive task, a large correlation for psychological science! This widely cited <a href=\"https://sci-hub.wf/10.1037/a0017286\">recent review</a> states \"There is new research on the psychometric structure of intelligence.

There is still little empirical support for an account of intelligence differences that does not include g.\"<ol><li>&nbsp;\"In fact, this could be argued to represent the sort of ideologically-agreeable overconfidence we warn of with respect to EAs discussing subjects in which they have no expertise.\" I don't think this gambit is open to you - your post is so wide ranging that I think it unlikely that you all have expertise in all the topics covered in the post, ten authors notwithstanding.&nbsp;</li><li>Of course, there are more things to life and to performance at work than intelligence.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>As I mentioned in my first comment, it's not true that the things that EAs are interested in are especially popular among tech types, nor are they aligned with the interests of tech types. The vast majority of tech philanthropists are not EA, and EA cause areas just don't help tech people at least relative to everyone else in the world. In fact, I suspect a majority view is that most EAs would like progress in virology and AI to be slowed down if not stopped. This is actively bad for the interests of people invested in AI companies and biotech. \"the fact that e.g. preventing wars does not disproportionately appeal to the ultra-wealthy is orthogonal.\" One of the headings in your article is \"We align suspiciously well with the interests of tech billionaires (and ourselves)\". I don't see how anything you have said here is a good defence against my criticism of that claim.</li><li>There's a few things to separate here. One worry is that EAs/me are neglecting the expert consensus on the aggregate costs of climate change: this is emphatically not true. The only models that actually try and quantify the costs of climate change <i>all</i> suggest that income per person will be higher in 2100 despite climate change. From memory, the most pessimistic study, which is a massive outlier (Burke et al), projects a median case of a ~750% increase &nbsp;in income per person by 2100, with a lower 5% probability of a ~400% increase, on a 5\u00baC scenario.&nbsp;<ol><li>A lot of what you say in your response and in your article seems inconsistent - you make a &nbsp;point of saying that EAs ignore the experts but then dismiss the experts when that happens to be &nbsp;inconsistent with your preferred opinions. Examples:<ol><li>Defending postcolonialism in global development&nbsp;</li><li>Your explanation of why Walmart makes money vs mainstream economics.</li><li>Your dismissal of all climate economics and the IPCC</li><li>'Standpoint theory' vs &nbsp;analytical philosophy</li><li>Your dismissal of Bayesianism, which doesn't seem to be aware of any of the main arguments for Bayesianism.&nbsp;</li><li>Your dismissal of the g factor, which doesn't seem to be aware of the literature in psychology.&nbsp;</li><li>The claim that we need to take on board Kuhnian philosophy of science (Kuhn believed that there has been zero improvement in scientific knowledge over the last 500 years)</li><li>Your defence of critical realism&nbsp;</li><li>Similarly, Cremer (life science and psychology) and Kemp (international relations) take Ord, MacAskill and Bostrom to task for straying out of their epistemic lane and having poor epistemics, but then go on in the same paper to offer casual ~1 page refutations of (amongst other things) total utlitarianism, longtermism and expected utility theory.</li></ol></li><li>Your discussion of why climate change is a serious catastrophic risk kind of illustrates the point. \"For instance, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119\">recent work</a> on catastrophic climate risk highlights the key role of cascading effects like societal collapses and resource conflicts. With as many as <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950\">half of climate tipping points in play</a> at <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/\">2.7\u00b0C - 3.4\u00b0C of warming</a> and several at as low as 1.5\u00b0C, large areas of the Earth are likely to face prolonged lethal heat conditions, with innumerable knock-on effects. These could include increased interstate conflict, a far greater number of omnicidal actors, food-system strain or failure <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-02957-w\">triggering societal collapses</a>, and long-term degradation of the biosphere carrying unforeseen long-term damage e.g. through keystone species loss.\"&nbsp;<ol><li>Bressler et al (2021) model the effects of ~3\u00baC on mortality and find that it increases the global mortality rate by 1%, on some very pessimistic assumptions about socioeconomic development and adaptation. It's kind of true but a bit misleading to say that this 'could' &nbsp;lead to interstate conflict or omnicidal actors. Maybe so, but how big a driver is it? I would have thought that more omnicidal actors will be created by the increasing popularity of environmentalism. The only people who I have heard say things like \"humanity is a virus\" are environmentalists.</li><li>Can you point me to the studies involving formal models that suggest that there will be global food system collapse at 3-4\u00baC of warming? I know that people like Lenton and Rockstrom <i>say</i> this will happen but they don't actually produce any quantitative evidence and it's completely implausible on its face if you just think about what a 3\u00baC world would be like. Economic models <i>include</i> &nbsp;effects on agriculture and they find a ~5% counterfactual reduction in GDP by 2100 for warming of 5\u00baC. There's nothing missing in not modelling the tails here.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>ok</li><li>What is the rationale for democratising? Is it for the sake of the intrinsic value of democracy or for producing better spending decisions? I agree it would be more democratic to have all EAs make the decision than the current system, but it's still not very democratic - as you have pointed out, it would be a load of socially awkward anglophone white male nerds deciding on a lot of money. Why not go the whole hog and have everyone in the world decide on the money, which you could perhaps roughly approximate by giving it to the UN or something?&nbsp;<ol><li>We could experiment with setting up one of the EA funds to be run democratically by all EAs (however we choose to assign EA status) and see whether people want to donate to it. Then we would get some sort of signal about how it performs and whether people think this is a good idea. I know I wouldn't give it money, and I doubt Moskovitz would either. I'm not sure what your proposal is for what we're supposed to do after this happens.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>I actually think corporations are involved in collaborative mission-driven work, &nbsp;and your Mondragon example seems to grant this, though perhaps you are understanding 'mission' differently to me. The vast majority of organisations trying to achieve a particular goal are corporations, which are not run democratically. Most charities are also not run democratically. There is a reason for this. You explicitly said \"Worker self-management has been shown to be <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/worker-cooperatives-are-more-productive-than-normal-companies/\">effective</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative#Research_on_worker_cooperatives\">durable</a>, and naturally better suited to collaborative, mission-oriented work than traditional top-down rule\". The problems of worker self-management are well-documented, with one of the key downsides being that it creates a disincentive to expand, which would also be true if EA democratised: doing so would only dilute each person's influence over funding decisions. Another obvious downside is division of labour and specialisation, i.e. you would empower people without the time, inclination or ability to lead or make key decisions.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>\"Finally, we are not sure why you are so keen to repeatedly apply the term \u201cleft wing environmentalism\u201d. Few of us identify with this label, and the vast majority of our claims are unrelated to it.\" Evidently from the comments I'm not the only one who picked up on this vibe. How many of the authors identify as right wing? In the post, you endorse a range of ideas associated with the left including: an emphasis on &nbsp;identity diversity; climate change and biodiversity loss as the primary risk to humanity; postcolonial theory; Marxist philosophy and its offshoots; postmodernist philosophy and related ideas; funding decisions should be democratised; and finally the need for EA to have more left wing people, which I take it was the implication of your response to my comment.&nbsp;</p><p>If you had spent the post talking about free markets, &nbsp;economic growth and admonishing the woke, I think people would have taken away a different message, but you didn't do that because I doubt you believe it.

If an EA researcher had made it their job to try to forecast the probability that FTX collapses and assigned a very low probability to it after much effort, that probably would have been a bad forecast. But that's not what happened; in reality EAs just failed to even consider that forecasting question. EAs *have* very seriously considered forecasting questions on x-risk though.</p><p>So the better critique of EAs in the spirit of Tyler's would not be to criticize EA's existential risk forecasts, but rather to suggest that there may be an existential risk that destroys humanity's potential that isn't even on our radar (similar to how the sudden end of FTX wasn't on our radar). Others have certainly talked about this possibility before though, so that wouldn't be a new critique. E.g. Toby Ord in The Precipice put \"Unforeseen anthropogenic risks\" in the next century at ~1 in 30. (Source: https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z5KZ2cui8WDjyF6gJ/some-thoughts-on-toby-ord-s-existential-risk-estimates). Does Tyler think ~1 in 30 this century is too low? Or that people haven't spent enough effort thinking about these unknown existential risks?</p></blockquote><p>You made a further point, Devon, that I want to respond to as well:</p><blockquote><p>There is a certain hubris in claiming you are going to \"build a flourishing future\" and \"support ambitious projects to improve humanity's long-term prospects\" (as the FFF did on its website) only to not exist 6 months later and for reasons of fraud to boot.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with you here. However, I think the hubris was SBF's hubris, not EAs' or longtermists-in-general's hubris.</p><p>I'd even go further to say that it wasn't the Future Fund team's hubris.<br><br>As John <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1?commentId=65LZmXnRzjv6WxZCs\">commented</a> below, \"EAs did a bad job on the governance and management of risks involved in working with SBF and FTX, which is very obvious and everyone already agrees.\"<br><br>But that's a critique of the Future Fund's (and others') ability to think of all the right top priorities for their small team in their first 6 months (or however long it was), not a sign that the Future Fund had hubris.<br><br>Note, however, that I don't even consider the Future Fund team's failure to think of this to be a very big critique of them. Why? Because anyone (in the EA community or otherwise) could have entered in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KigFfo4TN7jZTcqNH/the-future-fund-s-project-ideas-competition\">The Future Fund's Project Ideas Competition</a> and suggested the project of investigating the integrity of SBF and his businesses, and the risk that they may suddenly collapse, to ensure the stability of the funding source for the benefit of future Future Fund projects, and to protect EA's and longtermists' reputation from risks arising from associating with SBF should SBF become involved in a scandal. (Even Tyler Cowen could have done so and won some easy money.) But no one did (as far as I'm aware). So given that, I conclude that it was a hard risk to spot so early on, and consequently I don't fault the Future Fund team all that much for failing to spot this in their first 6 months.<br><br>There is a lesson to be learned from peoples' failure to spot the risk, but that lesson is not that longtermists lack the ability to forecast existential risks well, or even that they lack the ability to build a flourishing future.</p>", "parentCommentId": "AEdivNsE5uunETgda", "user": {"username": "WilliamKiely"}}, {"_id": "Krh9mbaiJWg9QSi69", "postedAt": "2023-01-31T07:25:11.500Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>I second this.</p><p>FWIW I read from the beginning through <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4/doing-ea-better-1?fbclid=IwAR2ijsxJ0ZINorL1WAFn2IHsIMo5AFaIiJrK-NYNq6TCa7wjAhGjgCY6U5w#What_actually_is__value_alignment__\">What actually is \"value-alignment\"?</a> then decided it wasn't worth reading further and just skimmed a few more points and the conclusion section.

And I understand skepticism that funders who have made their wealth in the technology industry have only global impact in mind when they focus their philanthropy on technology issues. For what it\u2019s worth, in the case of the particular billionaires I know best, Cari and Dustin were pretty emotionally reluctant to work on x-risks (and I was as well) - this felt at least to me like a case of them reluctantly concluding that these are important issues rather than coming in with pet causes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>On centralization of funding: </strong>I\u2019m having trouble operationalizing the calls for less centralization of funding decision-making, which seems to be the main driver of much of your concerns. I agree that heavy concentration of funding for a given area brings some concerns that would be reduced if the same amount of funding were more spread out among funders; but I haven't seen an alternative funding mechanism proposed that seems terribly promising. \n</p>\n<p>\nI was broadly in sync with Dustin's thoughts<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zuqpqqFoue5LyutTv/the-ea-community-does-not-own-its-donors-money?commentId=SuctaksGSaH26xMy2\"> here</a>, though not saying I'd endorse every word. I don't see a good way to define the \"members\" of EA without keeping a lot of judgment/discretion over what counts (and thus keeping the concentration of power around), or eroding the line between EA and the broader world with its very different priorities. To me, it looks like EA is fundamentally a self-applied label for a bunch of individuals making decisions using an intellectual framework that\u2019s both unusual and highly judgment-laden; I think there are good and bad things about this, but I haven't seen a way to translate it into more systematic or democratic formal structures without losing those qualities. \n</p>\n<p>\nI\u2019m not confident here and don\u2019t pretend to have thought it fully through. I remain interested in suggestions for approaches to spending Cari\u2019s and Dustin\u2019s capital that could improve how it\u2019s spent - the more specific and mechanistic, the better.\n</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "HoldenKarnofsky"}}, {"_id": "NiuWPTzvGh7DXhdwy", "postedAt": "2023-02-10T06:19:42.614Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>Do <em>you</em> have specific concerns about how the capital is spent?

This concession though comes with asterisks though. If we, for sake of argument, assume climatology research benefits greatly from climatologists getting close to hurricanes then we should expect climatologists, as a group, to see more hurricane wounds.

The jokes (told, of course, by men) always represented women\u2019s logic as fundamentally alien and incomprehensible. \u201cYou have to love them,\u201d the message always seemed to run, \u201cbut who can really understand how these creatures think?\u201d One never had the impression the women in question had any trouble understanding men. The reason is obvious. Women had no choice but to understand men. In America, the fifties were the heyday of a certain ideal of the one-income patriarchal family, and among the more affluent, the ideal was often achieved. <strong>Women with no access to their own income or resources obviously had no choice but to spend a great deal of time and energy understanding what their menfolk thought was going on.</strong></p><p>This kind of rhetoric about the mysteries of womankind appears to be a perennial feature of such patriarchal arrangements. It is usually paired with a sense that, though illogical and inexplicable, women still have access to mysterious, almost mystical wisdom (\u201cwomen\u2019s intuition\u201d) unavailable to men.<strong> And of course something like this happens in any relation of extreme inequality: </strong>peasants, for example, are always represented as being both oafishly simple, but somehow, also, mystically wise. Generations of women novelists\u2014Virginia Woolf comes most immediately to mind (To the Lighthouse)\u2014have documented the other side of such arrangements:<strong> the constant efforts women end up having to expend in managing, maintaining, and adjusting the egos of oblivious and self-important men, </strong>involving the continual work of imaginative identification, or interpretive labor. This work carries over on every level. Women everywhere are always expected to continually imagine what one situation or another would look like from a male point of view. <strong>Men are almost never expected to do the same for women.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Overwhelmingly one-sided social arrangements breed stupidity</strong>: by being in a position where you're powerful enough to ignore people with other points of view, you become extremely bad at understanding them.</p><p>Thus, the oblivious bosses (egged on by mixed teams of true sycophants and power/money-seeking yes-men) continue doing whatever they want to do, and an invisible army of exhausted, exasperated, and powerless subordinates scramble to semi-successfully translate the whims of the bosses into bureaucratic justifications for doing the things that actually need to be done.</p><p>The bosses can always cook up some justification for why them being in charge is always the best way forward, and either never hear critiques because critics fear for their careers or, as seen here, lazily dismiss them without consequence.</p><p>Speaking as someone with a little experience in similar organisations and movements to this one that slowly lost their principles as they calcified into self-serving bureaucracies:</p><p><strong>This is what it looks like.</strong></p>", "parentCommentId": "Ac7aMneKS4Tnzaaxc", "user": {"username": "A.C.Skraeling"}}, {"_id": "y76Jfp9mqQJn6THfo", "postedAt": "2023-02-16T22:22:44.031Z", "postId": "54vAiSFkYszTWWWv4", "htmlBody": "<p>We have warned A.C.
