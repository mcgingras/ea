Unfortunately, in general I am very skeptical of the sort of studies you are referencing. The researchers typically have a clear agenda - they know what conclusions they want to come to ahead of time, and what conclusions will most advantageous to their career - and the statistical rigour is often lacking, with small sample sizes, lack of pre-registration, p-hacking, and other issues. I took a closer look at the four sources you referenced to see if these issues applied.</p><blockquote><p>When more women participate in traditionally male-dominated fields like the sciences, the breadth of knowledge in that area usually grows, a surge in female involvement <strong>directly correlates</strong> with advancements in understanding[<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/141107-gender-studies-women-scientific-research-feminist\"><u>1</u></a>].

But female scientists being better at understanding women seems less relevant to AI technical alignment work, because AIs are not female or male. Maybe it is useful for understanding what distinctly female values we want AIs to promote, but it doesn't seem particularly relevant for things like Interpretability or most other current research agendas. The article also suggests that women are more communal and emotionally aware, vs men who are more agentic. But it doesn't really make any claims about overall levels of understanding 'directly correlating' with female involvement, especially in more abstract, less biological fields, and the word 'correlate' literally does not appear in the text.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Cox &amp; Fisher (2008) found that women in a single-sex environment in a software engineering course reported higher levels of enjoyment, fairness, motivation, support, and comfort and allowed them to perform at a level that exceeded that of the all-male groups in the class [<a href=\"https://www.informingscience.org/Publications/175?Source=%2FJournals%2FJITEResearch%2FArticles%3FVolume%3D0-0\"><u>1</u></a>].&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.jite.org/documents/Vol7/JITEv7p001-020Cox299.pdf\">The first paper</a> describes a n=7 study of a female group project, which apparently scored more highly than other group projects run by men. The study was not pre-registered, blinded or randomised, the researcher was an active participant, and there was no control. The author also obliquely references the need to avoid ''rigid marking schemes' if these might reveal the all-female group performing worse, which suggests a bias to me.</p><blockquote><p>Kahveci (2008) explored a program for women in science, mathematics, and engineering and found that it helped marginalized women move towards legitimate participation in these fields and enhanced a sense of community and mutual engagement [<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/sce.20234\"><u>2</u></a>].&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/sce.20234\">The second paper</a> describes a n=74 study of a women-in-science program, where the positive result is basically that the participants gave positive reviews to the program and said it made them more likely to do science. The study was not pre-registered, blinded or randomised, the researcher was an active participant, and there was no control. The only concrete example provided of a student switching major was from Biology to Exercise Physiology, which seems like a move away from core science.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt is not about men against women, but there is evidence to show through research that when you have more women in public decision-making, you get policies that benefit women, children and families in general.

With respect to the main post, the question is whether women are excluded from computer science jobs in particular. The paper found that with respect to hiring, biases are in favour of women in a range of STEM disciplines. In computer science in particular, there is evidence either of equal treatment or of a<i> large </i>bias in favour of women.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In computer science, Way et al. (2016) found that more highly ranked departments hired women and men at comparable rates, holding constant publications, department prestige, geography, and postdoc experience.</p><p>The Computer Research Association commissioned a national audit of U.S. and Canadian computer-science hiring (Stankovic &amp; Aspray, 2003). They found that new women recipients of PhDs applied for far fewer academic jobs than men: Women with PhDs applied for six positions, whereas men applied for 25 positions. However, female PhDs were offered twice as many interviews per application (0.77), whereas men received only 0.37. Further, women received 0.55 job offers per application, whereas men received only 0.19: \u201cObviously women were much more selective in where they applied, and also much more successful in the application process\u201d (Stankovic &amp; Aspray, 2003, p. 31).</p></blockquote><p>The same is true for other STEM disciplines. Thus, it is more accurate to say that the evidence suggests that men are on balance excluded from jobs in male-dominated STEM disciplines, in academia at least.

While this community tries hard to be meritocratic, and is <i>much</i> less overtly hostile to women than neighboring communities I\u2019ve experienced, I have personally noticed and experienced unintentional-yet-systemic patterns of behavior that can make it particularly difficult to remain and advance in this field as a woman. I\u2019d prefer not to get into an in-depth discussion of that on here, though I have written about a bit of it in a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JCyX29F77Jak5gbwq/ea-sexual-harassment-and-abuse?commentId=gFi5roZeJBp9xu2PY\">related comment</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefujqf77oiunq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnujqf77oiunq\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I believe that a more gender-balanced environment, and particularly more accessible senior female researchers and mentors, would likely reduce this.<br><br>I also suspect that more balanced gender representation would make more people feel comfortable entering the field. I am often the only woman at lab meetings, research workshops, and other AIS events, and very often the only woman who isn\u2019t married to a man who is also in attendance. This doesn\u2019t bother me, but I think that\u2019s just a random quirk of my personality. I think it\u2019s totally reasonable and not uncommon for people to be reluctant to join a group where their demographics make them stand out, and we could be losing female entrants this way. (Though I have noticed much more gender diversity in AIS researchers who\u2019ve joined in the past &lt;2 years than in those who joined &gt;=5 years ago, so it\u2019s possible this problem is already going away!)<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Women (or any member of an underrepresented group or background) could provide important perspective for some areas of AIS research. It's important to distinguish between different research areas here, so I\u2019m gonna messily put AIS topics on a spectrum between \u201cfundamental\u201d and \u201capplied\u201d. By \u201cfundamental\u201d, I mean topics like interpretability, decision theory, science of deep learning, etc \u2014 work to understand, predict, and figure out how to control AI behavior at all. By \u201capplied\u201d, I mean topics like practical implications of RLHF when teachers have differing preferences, or constructing meaningful evaluations for foundation models \u2014 work to understand, predict, and dictate how AI interacts with the real world and groups of humans.&nbsp;<br><br>On the \u201cfundamental\u201d end of the spectrum, I don\u2019t think that diversity in researcher background and life experience really matters either way. But in topics further toward the \u201capplied\u201d end of the spectrum, it can help a whole lot. There\u2019s plausibly-important safety work happening all along this spectrum, especially now that surprisingly powerful AI systems are deployed in the real world, so there are areas where researchers with diverse backgrounds can be particularly valuable.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I think that this is an excellent thing to dedicate some resources to on the margin.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnujqf77oiunq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefujqf77oiunq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>A relevant excerpt: <i>\"most of these interactions were respectful, and grew to be a problem only because they happened so systematically -- for a while, it felt like every senior researcher I tried to get project mentorship from tried to date me instead, then avoided me after I turned them down, which has had serious career consequences.\"</i></p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "rachelAF"}}, {"_id": "dDZJEWNjpxPbwJ9Lw", "postedAt": "2023-11-15T08:50:54.015Z", "postId": "B2t559dP65ffKZsDa", "htmlBody": "<p>I can say why I downvoted it - the commenter argued that presenting good arguments and evidence, and asking for results is bad because they don't like the vibe and find those things upsetting.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "hrLs4RuKjnqnzpM4e", "user": null}, {"_id": "vMm5wWMeGDfdasb3W", "postedAt": "2023-11-15T09:11:00.441Z", "postId": "B2t559dP65ffKZsDa", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm not sure that local norms do tilt in favour of my position.
