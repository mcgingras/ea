Allying with a crypto billionaire who turned out to be a scammer. Being part of a board who fired a CEO, then backpedaled after he threatened to destroy the company.

I agree FTX was genuinely bad, and I feel awful for the people who lost money. But I think this proves my point: in a year of nonstop commentary about how effective altruism sucked and never accomplished anything and should be judged entirely on the FTX scandal, nobody ever accused <i>those people</i> of downplaying the 200,000 lives saved. The discourse sure does have its priorities.)</p></blockquote><p>I'm concerned about the bolded part; I'm including the caveat for context. I don't want to imply that saving 200,000 lives isn't a really big deal, but I will discuss from the perspective of \"cold hard math\" .</p><ol><li>200,000 lives equals roughly a ~.0025% reduction in extinction risk, or a ~.25% reduction in risk of a GCR killing 80M people, <i>if we care literally zero about future people.</i> To the extent we weight future people, the numbers obviously get much lower.</li><li>The magnitude of the effect size of the board firing Sam, of which the sign is currently unclear IMO, seems arguably higher than .0025% extinction risk and likely higher than 200,000 lives if you weight the expected value of all future people &gt;~100x of that of current people.</li><li>The FTX disaster is a bit more ambiguous because some of the effects are more indirect; quickly searching for economic costs didn't find good numbers, but I think a potentially more important thing is that it is likely to some extent an indicator of systemic issues in EA that might be quite hard to fix.</li><li>The claim that \"I\u2019m not sure they cancel out the effect of saving <i>one</i> life<strong>\" </strong>seems silly to me, even if we just look at generally large \"value of a life\" estimates compared to the economic costs of the FTX scandal.</li></ol><p>Now I'll discuss the AI section in particular. There is little attempt to compare the effect sizes of \"accomplishments\" (with each other and also with potential negatives, with just a brief allusion to EAs accelerating AGI) or argue that they are net positive.

Those effects can be hard to detect until something blows up.

FTX was not the sort of update that would overpower my first-order impressions here, which were based on many interactions/lots of EA experience. (FWIW, it <i>would have been</i> a big negative update for me if the recent OpenAI board drama had been instigated by some kind of backdoors plan about merging with Anthropic, but to my knowledge, these were completely unsubstantiated speculations.

Those events happened long ago and in my view they tentatively(?) suggest that the EA community had a good-enough self-correction mechanism so that schemers don't tend to stay in central positions of power for long periods of time.

I'm not sure if Leverage was mentioned there \u2013 I could imagine that it was, but I don't remember details and my most salient memory is that I thought of it as \"not good leadership for CEA.\" My friend and I encouraged them to stay and speak up to try to change leadership, but the person had enough for the time being or had some other reason to leave (again, I don't remember details). Anyway, this person left CEA at the time without a plan to voice their view that the org was in a bad state. I don't know if they gave an exit interview or deliberately sought out trustees or if they talked to friends or whether they said nothing at all \u2013 I didn't stay in touch. However, I do remember that my friend discussed if maybe we should at some point get back this former CEA staff person and encourage them again to find out if there are more former colleagues who are dissatisfied and if we could cause a wave of change at CEA. We were so far removed and had so few contacts to anyone who actually worked there that it would've been a bit silly for us to get involved in this. And I'm not saying we would've done it \u2013 it's easy to talk about stuff like that, but then usually you don't do anything. Still, I feel like this anecdote suggests that there are sometimes more people interested and invested in good community outcomes than one might think, and multiple pathways to beneficial leadership change (like, it's very possible this former staff had nothing to do with the eventual chain of causes that led to leadership change, and that means that multiple groups of people were expressing worried sentiments about CEA at that time independently).</li><li>At one point somewhere between 2017-2018, someone influential in EA encouraged me to share more about specific stuff that happened in the EA orgs I worked because they were sometimes talking to other people who are \"also interested in the health of EA orgs / health of the EA community.\" (To avoid confusion, this was not the community health team.) This suggests that people somewhat systematically keep an eye on things and even if CEA were to get temporarily taken over by a Silicon Valley cultish community, <i>probably</i> someone would try to do something about it eventually. (Even if it's just writing an EA forum post to create common knowledge that a specific is now taken over and no longer similar to what it was when it was founded. I mean, we see that posts did eventually get written about Leverage, for instance, and the main reasons it didn't happen earlier are probably more because many people thought \"oh, everyone knows already\" and \"like anywhere else, few people actually take the time to do community-useful small bits of work when you can just wait for someone else to do it.\")&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "g8zHx8RnZSqLGqED6", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "8AcWv7ybZDTRJ5Xkj", "postedAt": "2023-12-01T23:19:45.305Z", "postId": "ML6hxqM6g6mXewJtZ", "htmlBody": "<p>The list of achievements in the post contains items like \"played a big part in creating the YIMBY movement\" (A bit of an overstatement imo), and \"sparked a renaissance in forecasting\" (made a bunch of fun online prediction markets).

It is a claim about creating something in the past, and getting a bunch of people to agree. It's similar to saying \"Karl Marx founded Communism and got many people to agree\" - the claim is not that Marx is in an influential position (he cannot be, since he is dead) but that he created something. There are related claims that are about influence, like if it had instead said \"Founded and remain influential in the field\", but the actual specific claim here is fully consistent with the EAs birthing and then seeing their relevance come to an end. The thing that the hundreds of people endorsed wasn't the EA movement itself, or even specific EAs, but the abstract claim that AI is risky.</p>", "parentCommentId": "t5MwpnDmoDKeE26pv", "user": {"username": "Larks"}}, {"_id": "WTH7x2BQZ2pR6LC42", "postedAt": "2023-12-04T08:18:01.470Z", "postId": "ML6hxqM6g6mXewJtZ", "htmlBody": "<p>We might mostly be arguing about semantics.

Your analogy with Marx illustrates that point.&nbsp;</p><p>I do disagree with your last sentence. The thing that people are endorsing is very much both a social movement as well as some object level claims.
