Obviously, Open Phil and EA Infra have funded awesome projects, but it's true that having so many important decisions made by a small number of grant makers at those orgs can lead to group biases and echo chambers that may lead them to neglect other high-potential opportunities. I'd be curious to to see how a more decentralized group of less committed (in terms of time) grant makers fairs against a few full-time grant makers, but of course it's not a competition.

EA funds and Open Phil do a great job, but only a dozen people making most significant grants is likely going to lead to biases and knowledge gaps.

What's your policy on being a member and encouraging these orgs to apply? Part of me would argue I would be above average in evaluating these projects because I know their work and founders, but I could also argue I might be too biased and should refrain from evaluating (but encouraging applications and independent evaluations). Like many on this forum, I'm concerned by the amount of people/orgs getting funded by current grant makers that are (in)directly linked to these organisations and people, but in some cases I do see that might lead to better decisions. I'm very interested to know what people think and your policies on potential conflicts of interest.&nbsp;<br><br>[EDIT]: I now see that there is a minimum of '$100,000 per year minimum of expected donations'. But in this post I see 'and philanthropic advisors each moving $100,000 or more per year to meta charities'.
