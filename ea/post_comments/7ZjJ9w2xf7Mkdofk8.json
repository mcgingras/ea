There are lots of things attempted to help with this over the years. We branded one EAG after \"keeping EA weird\", we encouraged formats like whiteboard debates at EAG to show that disagreement among highly-engaged people is common, we added things like disagree-voting in addition to normal upvoting and downvoting to encourage a culture where it's normal and expected that someone can write something that many people disagree with, without that thing being punished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My sense is this all isn't really enough, and we still kind of suck at it, but I also don't think it's an ignored problem in the space. I also think this problem gets harder and harder the more you grow, and larger communities trying to take coordinated action require more conformity to function, and this sucks, and is I think one of the strongest arguments against growth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know it may feel like someone \"curb stomping you while you're on your knees\".

You <strong>deserve</strong> a vacation.  A nice long sabbatical, even.  Not only do you deserve it, it seems justified on consequentialist grounds -- I think the opportunity cost of your vacation will be less than the cost of the ingroup-hardening process you describe in your post.

I think Julia Wise's stuff is high-variance and sometimes has bad consequences, but I've come around over the years to thinking that it's probably good for the world, though I am still hesitant. I think Redwood Research is genuinely well-intentioned and doing good work, and I trust Buck a lot, though almost all the work they do doesn't seem to be on the critical path towards safe AI (but it's still my favorite prosaic alignment place to send people to). I think Paul fucked up hard by endorsing OpenAI as much as he did, and I think something kind of bad is happening with his writing style, but he is a genuinely great thinker for AI Alignment and I've learned a lot from him about how to think about AI Alignment, and want him to have the resources to pursue his research even if it seems doomed to me. I think CFAR makes some great workshops, though also had some pretty fucked-up dynamics and Anna continues to have a not-great track record at identifying who will end up kind of crazy and causing a bunch of harm. I think Robin Hanson's research and writing is great, though I heard he has some more dubious in-person behavior. I think the Atlas Fellowship seems pretty cool and I support it, though I think the presentation is too... I don't know, fake-ambitious/EAish. In-general the Stanford EAs seem like they are doing cool stuff with a bunch of the events and workshops they are running.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "E2pRCXnrpsavEA8zW", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "Smkzo4dG9zw7bQTu3", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T18:42:16.157Z", "postId": "7ZjJ9w2xf7Mkdofk8", "htmlBody": "<p>I have maybe 1-2 other people/organizations that I feel as doomy about as I did for SBF.</p>\n<p>That said, there are definitely lots of other parts of EA that I feel unhappy about, and I do think there are some deeper things going wrong (like generally too much private scheming and empire building, and not enough blurting out of opinions and open curiosity and deep commitment to honesty).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "L3yKHRK7bq4zrHBFu", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "v6c8wNAeBgqBPfwxL", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T19:18:10.673Z", "postId": "7ZjJ9w2xf7Mkdofk8", "htmlBody": "<p>Your contention: Too much planning and building, not enough blurting out \"deeply honest\" (and very negative!) opinions.&nbsp;<br><br>My contention: Stop burning each other online, EA is not Mean Girls.

There has been no guarantee that all promised grants will be fulfilled as far as I am aware, even through another funding source like Open Phil as they mentioned raising their criteria. There will be people, as a direct result of this, who do not know whether their work can continue or if they lose their job/business/other project, or whether past money that they spent, having received in good faith while trying to have the highest positive impact they could, may even be clawed back. Some of these people will be students, or people early in their careers, who are less likely to have savings to fall back on, or in the event of a clawback may have their savings wiped out (I have no idea of the actual likelihood of this, but I have seen this discussed on the forum). Who perhaps have not been given a clear answer, by other people in the movement who they may have been expecting an answer from but who are instead remaining silent (although there might have been private communication that I am unaware of). My sympathy lies with them the most, and I do not blame them (or others) for potentially questioning people who perhaps could have known more (not saying anyone did or didn't, I wouldn't know beyond what is in the media).&nbsp;<br><br>And that's of course just the people affected within the EA community.
