As if you were automatically famous and influential.</p>\n<p>Now I ask you to consider whether benefit (1) would in fact be the case for important elections (elections say where the elected will govern over 10 000 000 people). If 100 Worlds had an election decided based on one vote, which percentage of those would be surreptitiously biased by someone who could tamper with the voting? How many would request a recount? How many would ask it's citizens to vote again? Would deem the election illegitimate? Etc... \nMaybe some of these worlds would indeed accept the original counting, or do a fair recounting that would reach the exact same number, I find it unlikely this would be more than 80 of these 100 worlds, and would not be surprised if it was 30 or less.</p>\n<p>We don't know how likely it is that this will happen, in more than 16000 elections in the US only one was decided by one vote, and it was not an executive function in a highly populated area.</p>\n<p>This has been somewhat discussed in the rationalist community before, with different people reaching different conclusions.</p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions for EA's that are consistent with the point of view that voting is, ceteris paribus, not valuable:</p>\n<p>EA's who are not famous and influential should consider never making political choices.</p>\n<p>EA's who are uncertain or live in countries where suffrage is compulsory may want to consider saving time by copying the voting decisions of someone who they trust, to avoid time and attention loss.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for those who think voting is valuable:</p>\n<p>EAs should consider the marginal cost of copying the voting policy of a non-EA friend/influence they trust highly, and weight it against the time, attention and decision cost of deciding themselves.</p>\n<p>EAs should consider using safe vehicles (all the time and) during elections.</p>\n<p>EAs who think voting is valuable because it represents what all agents in their reference class would do in that situation should consider other situations in which to apply such decision procedure.

The talk went better than I expected: several of my coworkers told me afterwards that it was really good.  So I thought I would summarize the contents of the talk so it can be used as a data point for presenting on effective altruism.</p>\n<p>You can see the slides for my talk in <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7ec38lpg1cpo7hj/AAA1m_SZNs4Qxa-NXYqEf7wTa?dl=0\">keynote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/nanyxfo3cgq9y7s/effective-altruism.pptx?dl=0\">pptx</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cl2ounpj1y48j8d/AAD-boyIYg5KvXfetuK1V7-ea?dl=0\">html</a>.  Here are some notes on the slides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The thought experiment on the second slide was Peter Singer's drowning child thought experiment.  After giving everyone a few seconds to think about the thought experiment, I asked everyone who thought there was 50% probability or higher that they would save the drowning child to raise their hand (inspired by <a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/handwritingwall\">this essay</a>).  Almost everyone raised their hands.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I threw in a few ideas that haven't seen wide discussion of in the effective altruist community.  For example, in the last chapter of Martin Seligman's book Learned Optimism he explains how he thinks that Western culture's focus on consumerism and our lack of purpose and connection has contributed to our depression epidemic, which I covered on slides 6-7.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>On slide 9, I tried to make things concrete and interesting by suggesting that Scribd could save money by giving everyone Chromebooks to work with, but this would probably end up being bad for the company's bottom line in the long run because we would work less efficiently.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Another thing I haven't seen wide discussion of in the EA community is the analogy between groups like Givewell and scientists (see <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/l89/the_value_of_doing_ones_own_philanthropic_research/bl3o\">this LW comment</a> for more on this idea).  I discussed this on slides 11-12.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>On slide 14, I discussed in depth the idea that doctors don't do all that much good due to replaceability effects.  (The 4 principles were stolen from <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-reading#on-thinking-like-an-effective-altruist\">Ben Kuhn's writeup</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, I found this experience really encouraging.  Initially I was afraid that the drowning child thought experiment would make people hostile, but that didn't seem to happen at all... there wasn't any criticism of the idea even during the Q&amp;A period at the end.  I was also afraid that the talk tried to cram too many ideas in to just 10 minutes, which may have occurred but all the evidence I observed afterwards suggested to me that the concepts I tried to communicate were well-understood.  The people at Scribd are pretty smart though: the talk before mine was about the physics of motorcycle riding, and the talk after mine was by a champion Go player.  So a different presentation might be optimal for a different crowd.</p>\n<p>Although several people told me they thought the talk was good, I didn't hear much discussion about the concepts I presented afterwards.  And of course it's hard to measure whether people actually became significantly inclined towards effective altruism or not.  So in the long run we should still probably do rigorous message A/B testing.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}, {"_id": "pS4seSGrRLW3FFhht", "postedAt": "2014-11-22T11:59:33.387Z", "postId": "JdqzNvvPscsghW8xR", "htmlBody": "<p>I just read <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/when-should-an-effective-altruist-be-vegetarian/\">Katja's post on vegetarianism</a> (recommended).

In this comment, I will discuss a few things that I would like to see 80,000 Hours consider doing, and I will also talk about myself a bit. </p>\n<p>I found 80,000 Hours in early/mid-2012, after a poster on LessWrong linked to the site. Back then, I was still trying to decide what to focus on during my undergraduate studies. By that point in time, I had already decided that I needed to major in a STEM field so that I would be able to earn to give. Before this, in late 2011, I had been planning on majoring in philosophy, so my decision in early 2012 to do something in a STEM field was a big change from my previous plans. I hadn't known which STEM field I wanted to major in at this point; I had only realized that STEM majors generally had better earning potentials than philosophy majors.</p>\n<p>The way that this ties back into 80,000 Hours is that I think that I would have liked someone to help me decide which STEM field to go into. Actually, I can't find any discussion of choosing a college major on the 80,000 Hours site, though there are <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/jzy/career_prospects_for_physics_majors/\">a</a> <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/9tp/which_college_major/\">couple</a> of threads on this topic posted to LessWrong. I would like to see an in-depth discussion page on major choice as one of the core posts on 80,000 Hours.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I ended up majoring in chemistry because it seemed like one of the toughest things that I could major in-- I made this decision under the rule-of-thumb that doing hard things makes you stronger. I probably should have majored in mathematics, because I actually really enjoy math, and have gotten good grades in most of my math classes; neither of those two things are true of the chemistry classes I have taken. I think that my biggest previous misconception about major choice was that all STEM majors were roughly equal in how well they prepared you for the job market-- looking back, I feel that CS and Math are two of the best choices for earning to give, followed by engineering and then biology, with chemistry and physics as the two worst options for students interested in earning to give. Of course, YMMV, and people with physics degrees do go into quantitative finance, but I do think that not all STEM majors are equally useful for earning to give.</p>\n<p>The second thing that I would like to mention is that, <em>from my point of view</em>, 80,000 Hours seems very elitist. I don't mean this in a bad way, <em>really</em>, I don't, but it is hard to be in <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/top-careers/profiles/trading-in-quantitative-hedge-funds/\">the top third</a> of mathematics graduates from an ivy league university. The first time that I had a face-to-face conversation with an effective altruist who had been inspired by 80,000 Hours, I told them that I was planning on doing important scientific research, and they just gave me a <em>look</em> and asked me why I wasn't planning on going into one of the more lucrative earning-to-give type of careers.</p>\n<p>I am sure that this person is a good person, but this episode leads me to wonder if adding more jobs that very smart people who aren't quite ready to go into quantitative finance or strategic consulting could do to the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/top-careers/\">top careers</a> page on 80,000 Hours' site would be a good idea. Specifically, mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering, as well as the actuarial sciences, could be acceptable fields for one to go into for earning to give.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Fluttershy"}}, {"_id": "663z5Zpj9GAZH8fht", "postedAt": "2014-11-29T04:58:22.026Z", "postId": "JdqzNvvPscsghW8xR", "htmlBody": "<p>Seems like 80K could probably stand to link to more of Cognito Mentoring's old stuff in general.
