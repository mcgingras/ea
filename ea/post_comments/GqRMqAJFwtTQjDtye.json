On digging back into it, we realise we unfortunately missed copy-pasting corrected prevalence data into the report when we fixed a code bug for urban slum Baseline (which initially included diarrhoea instances for an additional week for both timeframes). The other wards used a later survey version with separate logic and are not impacted. The pre-post results data in the report&nbsp;<i>were</i> updated after the fix, so no change needed there.</p><p>That all said, the&nbsp;<i>corrected</i> urban slum Baseline 2-week and 4-week prevalences of 30.1% and 41.8% (will update original post) are still comparatively high.</p><p>Regarding the proportion of all distributed ORS that was used, we asked households how many ORS sachets they used by age-group for the 6-week follow-up period and counted how many sachets they had left, so we do have those extra signals with which to scrutinise their claimed ORS treatment rates. A complicator here is the unknown volume of ORS used in a given treatment; 2 x one litre sachets are provided per co-pack, but one litre can be sufficient depending on the diarrhoea duration and whether the caregiver abides by the instruction to discard prepared ORS after 24 hours. Nonetheless, this is certainly something for us to look into further.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks again for your thoughtful comments and for helping improve our program!</p>", "parentCommentId": "6BfcDztQB4cdJxqDd", "user": {"username": "Martyn J"}}, {"_id": "JbZWbKCPfBDRfuD9Q", "postedAt": "2024-03-26T08:16:55.574Z", "postId": "GqRMqAJFwtTQjDtye", "htmlBody": "<p>Nice one great reply!&nbsp;</p><p>Just to double check (still not completely clear) did you distribute to about 1000 households and about 930 of those used the ORS over a 6 week follow up period?
