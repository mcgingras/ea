Humans are not only moral patients, but also moral agents, and these being forcibly impregnated or murdered is highly anti-cooperative. I follow expectational total hedonistic utilitarianism, but this only justifies creating net positive lives all else equal. In a society where humans are forcibly impregnated and murdered for food, I think it is fair to say that all else would not be equal! One should take into account the actions involved in the creation of lives, and forced impregnation and murder are actions with pretty bad consequences. For example, they would tend to normalise violence and inequality, which correlate with lower wellbeing longterm.</p><p>These concerns apply to animals too. Forcibly impregnating or murdering animals is still uncooperative, and my ideal world does not involve those. However, by decreasing the consumption of animals, one may accidently increase the suffering of wild animals, and the existential risk from ASRSs. So, as a precautionary measure, I think it would be better to increase resilience to ASRSs before/while driving down the number of factory-farmed animals. I think welfare reforms are more robustly good because they significantly decrease the suffering of factory-farmed animals while not decreasing much the resilience against ASRSs, at least in the nearterm (in the longer term, continued welfare reforms will increase prices, and therefore decrease the consumption of animals).</p>", "parentCommentId": "nWWzqNpFNKCTrsbYD", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "F3yL2ynRKNx3itF2K", "postedAt": "2023-05-28T15:30:20.535Z", "postId": "7hMgK4hciBhXmBRnW", "htmlBody": "<p>So the thing wrong with breeding, murdering and eating humans is the harmful effects it would have on other humans not the treatment of the victim?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "NH94ZNj6hqzcq7D3g", "user": {"username": "matty"}}, {"_id": "Qkto57WeLWfLpwkL4", "postedAt": "2023-05-28T18:24:29.020Z", "postId": "7hMgK4hciBhXmBRnW", "htmlBody": "<p>I wonder how the magnitude of these various effects would scale between 1 additional percent of the population going vegan vs. 10 percent vs. 100 percent.</p>\n<p>Specifically, at least in the medium run, it seems that many of the inputs of producing crops are sunk costs, and that a reduction in the demand for farmed animal feed would cause agricultural producers to keep growing many crops but try to sell them as biofuel material.

I found the situation intuitively quite bad, and therefore stumbled into some motivated reasoning. I would be okay with the situation described by matty as long as the lives of the children were sufficiently good (to offset the negative effects to the mothers, and the pain involved in the murders), and neglecting indirect effects.</p><p>Nevertheless, in practice, if a bunch of humans contacted me describing their great plan to produce lots of utility along the lines described by matty, I would just report them to the police. I think having such plans in real life correlates with bad outcomes (compared to non-existence), even if the plan itself describes a good outcome (compared to non-existence).</p>", "parentCommentId": "ndoxvFKcftFPoLFeF", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "G2QfeNaEWjK4im38n", "postedAt": "2023-06-11T14:24:43.626Z", "postId": "7hMgK4hciBhXmBRnW", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey Vasco, I edited my response around when you were replying, and replaced the bottom part of my comment.

It's worth noting that the rainforest and Cerrado numbers in that piece are very rough guesses based on limited and noisy data. As one friend of mine would say, I basically pulled those numbers out of my posterior (...distribution). :) Also, even if that comparison is accurate, it's just for one region of the world; it may not apply to the difference between, e.g., temperate forests and grasslands. All of that said, my impression is that crop fields do tend to have fewer mammals and birds than wild grassland or forest. For birds, see the screenshot of a table in <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/how-many-wild-animals-are-there/#Birds\">this section</a>.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "f3ZEj7e7d9did6ksF", "user": {"username": "Brian_Tomasik"}}]
