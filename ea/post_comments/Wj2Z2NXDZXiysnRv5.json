I think your observation that there are not really big barriers to individuals effectively donating is correct.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to check out my approach to funding charities, it would enable individuals to fund charities without personal sacrifice, by buying from companies with charities in the vast majority equity position. That way they could pay the same amount for goods and services, but charities benefit rather than traditional shareholders.</p>\n<p>The back end of this project, which I call the Profit for Good model, is potentially pretty powerful: people can fund charities without personal sacrifice through economic discrimination. The front end is a much heavier lift however. Not only do you have to have companies with charities in the equity position, you also have to have a public that is aware of the option and has the means of exercising it easily available. Nonetheless, I think this model has a good chance of solving many major global problems because anyone would rather buy in a way that helps people if there are not associated sacrifices.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more :\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMiGwDoqEyswaE6hN/making-trillions-for-effective-charities-through-the\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMiGwDoqEyswaE6hN/making-trillions-for-effective-charities-through-the</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Brad West"}}, {"_id": "fSi6HeEAppMrRJc6o", "postedAt": "2022-12-20T08:40:19.048Z", "postId": "Wj2Z2NXDZXiysnRv5", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for sharing this, I really enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>I did some \"customer\" research around effective giving a year or so back and found some similar themes.</p>\n<p>Engaged EAs already seem to have what they need.

Here are some thoughts off the top of my head in the meantime.<br><br>1. Rate of enrollment at companies.</p><p>I think this averaged 25%. We had a couple of enthusiastic companies of around 50 people where we got 35-40% . But it wasn't uncommon to have more like 6%.<br><br>2. Average donation amount.<br>The \u00a315,000 number includes company matches. The average monthly donation is \u00a375 and the average company contribution is \u00a325. Some companies offer very generous matching e.g. topping up donations by \u00a350 regardless of donation size. Also bear in mind a small number of people are donating 10x more than the average.<br><br>I don't think it was lower when we were operating as a for-profit.<br><br>3. Dropoff rates<br>Dropoff rates are very low (less than 5% a year if you exclude people who leave the company). This is one of the biggest advantages of payroll giving.<br><br>Would be great to hear your account of the Swedish charity startup.</p>", "parentCommentId": "AJCbrvTC6PDdP9enc", "user": {"username": "imben"}}, {"_id": "CzsbJ2zuYepzdWRpq", "postedAt": "2022-12-26T10:55:44.288Z", "postId": "Wj2Z2NXDZXiysnRv5", "htmlBody": "<p>Glad to hear Jan.<br><br>That's right re: PMF. We were very open about what causes people could support but I think you could be right that leaning into e.g. climate change could have helped. My sense was that companies in the UK preferred other ways to contribute to these causes because:<br>1. Donating money feels less direct than interventions like recycling, not using plastic, vegetarian catering<br>2. HR didn't want to be seen to ask people to give their money away (this felt awkward for some)<br>3. There are activities which are more visible, feel-good and cheaper to signal support (e.g. charity fundraisers).</p>", "parentCommentId": "hStwaGM3Bcb8A4kub", "user": {"username": "imben"}}, {"_id": "yNjPssoqjsuw8crz2", "postedAt": "2022-12-26T10:56:51.759Z", "postId": "Wj2Z2NXDZXiysnRv5", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Craig - I'm glad to hear it.

I'm not sure EA will help you fundraise more at work.<br>As in the above example, people are happy to give to charity regardless of the EA pitch.
