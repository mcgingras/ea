Thanks for engaging. Three quick notes. (Edit: I see that Peter has made the first already.)</p><p>First, and less importantly, our numbers don't represent the relative value of individuals, but instead the relative possible intensities of valenced states at a single time. If you want the whole animal's capacity for welfare, you have to adjust for lifespan. When you do that, you'll end up with lower numbers for animals---though, of course, not OOMs lower.</p><p>Second, I should say that, as people who work on animals go, I'm fairly sympathetic to views that most would regard as animal-unfriendly. I wrote a book criticizing arguments for veganism. I've got another forthcoming that defends hierarchicalism. I've argued for hybrid views in ethics, where different rules apply to humans and animals. Etc. Still, I think that <i>conditional on hedonism</i> it's hard to get MWs for animals that are super low. It's easier, though still not easy, on other views of welfare. But if you think that welfare is all that matters, you're probably going to get pretty animal-friendly numbers. You have to invoke other kinds of reasons to really change the calculus (partiality, rights, whatever).</p><p>Third, I've been trying to figure out what it would look like to generate MWs for animals that don't assume welfarism (i.e., the view that welfare is all that matters morally). But then you end up with all the familiar problems of moral uncertainty. I wish I knew how to navigate those, but I don't. However, I also think it's sufficiently important to be transparent about human/animal tradeoffs that I should keep trying. So, I'm going to keep mulling it over.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "bob-fischer"}}, {"_id": "zbKCd3B2NAzekj7zW", "postedAt": "2023-09-28T17:38:10.805Z", "postId": "H6hxTrgFpb3mzMPfz", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for the post!</p><blockquote><p>What concerns me is that I suspect people rarely get deeply interested in the moral weight of animals unless they come in with an unusually high initial intuitive view.</p></blockquote><p>I also suspect this, and have concerns about it, but in a very different way than you I speculate. More particularly, I am concerned by the \"people rarely get deeply interested in the moral weight of animals \" part. This is problematic because for many actions humans do, there are consequences to animals (in many cases, huge consequences), and to act ethically, even for some non-conseuquentialists, it is essential to at least have some views about moral weights of animals.</p><p>But the issue isn't only most people not being interested in investigating \"moral weights\" of animals, but <strong>that for people who don't even bother to investigate, they don't use the acknowledgement of uncertainty (and tools for dealing with uncertainty) to guide their actions - they assign, with complete confidence, 1 to each human and 0 to almost everyone else.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The above analysis, if I am only roughly correct, is crucial to our thinking about which direction to move people's view is a correct one. If most people are already assigning animals with virtual 0s, where else can we go? Presumably moral weights can't go negative, animals' moral weights only have one place to go, unless most people were right - that all animals have moral weights of virtually 0.</p><blockquote><p>\"I would expect working as a junior person in a community of people who value animals highly would exert a large influence in that direction regardless of what the underlying truth.\"</p></blockquote><p>For the reasons above, I am extremely skeptical this is worthy of worry. I think unless it happens to be true that all animals have moral weights of virtually 0, it seems to me that \"a community of people who value animals highly exerting a large influence in that direction <i>regardless of what the underlying truth</i>\" is something that we should <i>exactly</i> hope for, rationally and ethically speaking. (emphasis on \"<i>regardless of what the underlying truth\" </i>is mine)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>P.S. A potential pushback is that a very significant number of people clearly care about some animals, such as their companion animals. But I think we have to also look at actions with larger stakes. Most people, and even more so for a collection of people (such as famailies, companies, governments, charities, and movements), judging from their actions (eating animals, driving, animal experiments, large scale constructions) <i>and reluctance to adjust their view regarding these actions</i>, clearly assign a virtual 0 to the moral weights of most animals - they just chose a few species, maybe just a few individual animals, to rise to within one order of magnitude of difference in moral weight with humans. Also, even for common companion animals such as cats and dogs, many people are shown to assign much less moral weight to them when they are put into situations where they have to choose these animals against (sometimes trivial) human interests.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "tseyipfai@gmail.com"}}, {"_id": "kPftdPrXr5pgYcQ2G", "postedAt": "2023-09-28T17:43:02.556Z", "postId": "H6hxTrgFpb3mzMPfz", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I think the conclusions of RP's research <i>with respect to cause prioritization</i> still hold up after incorporating the arguments you've enumerated in your post.</p></blockquote><p>This seems maybe truth for animals vs AMF but not for animals vs Xrisk.</p>", "parentCommentId": "fJ8XiZgL6KqTvmYTy", "user": {"username": "Larks"}}, {"_id": "nycp8CGWeiZwMpfhg", "postedAt": "2023-09-28T17:56:55.136Z", "postId": "H6hxTrgFpb3mzMPfz", "htmlBody": "<p>Yes, I agree with that caveat.</p>", "parentCommentId": "kPftdPrXr5pgYcQ2G", "user": {"username": "Ariel Simnegar"}}, {"_id": "NrsfThD4pDcdquFr3", "postedAt": "2023-09-28T18:51:41.017Z", "postId": "H6hxTrgFpb3mzMPfz", "htmlBody": "<p>Hm, I'm not sure how I would have read this if it had been your original wording, but in context it still feels like an effort to slightly spin my claims to make them more convenient for your critique.

I'll assume some kind of expectational utilitarianism.</p>\n<p>The strongest case for extinction and existential risk reduction is on a (relatively) symmetric total view. On such a view, it all seems dominated by far future moral patients, especially artificial minds, in expectation. Farmed animal welfare might tell us something about whether artificial minds are likely to have net positive or net negative aggregate welfare, and moral weights for animals can inform moral weights for different artificial minds and especially those with limited agency. But it's relatively weak evidence. If you expect future welfare to be positive, then extinction risk reduction looks good and (far) better in expectation even with very low probabilities of making a difference, but could be Pascalian, especially for an individual (<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/christian-tarsney-the-epistemic-challenge-to-longtermism/\">https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/christian-tarsney-the-epistemic-challenge-to-longtermism/</a>). The Pascalian concerns could also apply to other population ethics.</p>\n<p>If you have narrow person-affecting views, then cost-effective farmed animal interventions don\u2019t generally help animals alive now, so won't do much good. If death is also bad on such views, extinction risk reduction would be better, but not necessarily better than GiveWell recommendations. If death isn't bad, then you'd pick work to improve human welfare, which could include saving the lives of children for the benefit of the parents and other family, not the children saved.</p>\n<p>If you have asymmetric or wide person-affecting views, then animal welfare could look better than extinction risk reduction depending on human vs nonhuman moral weights and expected current lives saved by x-risk reduction, but worse than far future quality improvements or s-risk reduction (e.g. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpr.12927\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpr.12927</a>, but maybe animal welfare work counts for those, too, and either may be Pascalian). Still, on some asymmetric or wide views, extinction risk reduction could look better than animal welfare, in case good lives offset the bad ones (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpr.12927\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpr.12927</a>). Also, maybe extinction risk reduction could look better for indirect reasons, e.g. replacing alien descendants with our happier ones, or because the work also improves the quality of the far future conditional on not going extinct.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Or, if the people alive today aren't killed (whether through a catastrophic event or anything else, like malaria), there's a chance they'll live very very long lives through technological advancement, and so saving them could at least beat the near-term effects of animal welfare if dying earlier is worse on a given person-affecting view.</p>\n<p>That being said, all the above variants of expectational utilitarianism are irrational, because unbounded utility functions are irrational (e.g. can be money pumped, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phpr.12704\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phpr.12704</a>), so the standard x-risk argument seems based on jointly irrational premises.

I think you should weigh the empirical and philosophical evidence about how to value the lives of the global poor directly and not do too much, if any, reference class checking about other people's views on the topic.

Which makes this scenario more similar to my \"When using the moral weights of animals to decide between various animal-focused interventions this is not a major concern: the donors, charity evaluators, and moral weights researchers are coming from a similar perspective.\"</p>\n<p>But say I argued that the US Department of Transportation funding (<a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/office-policy/transportation-policy/revised-departmental-guidance-on-valuation-of-a-statistical-life-in-economic-analysis\">$12.5M/life</a>) should be redirected to foreign aid until they had equal marginal costs per life saved. I don't think the objection I'd get would be \"Americans have greater moral value\" but instead things like \"saving lives in other countries is the role of private charity, not the government\". In trying to convince people to support global health charities I don't think I've ever gotten the objection \"but people in other countries don't matter\" or \"they matter far less than Americans\", while I expect vegan advocates often hear that about animals.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "QbqxM5idheTNgcs5e", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "tFgkRYWfdvJJJLQNy", "postedAt": "2023-10-02T21:09:08.008Z", "postId": "H6hxTrgFpb3mzMPfz", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>In trying to convince people to support global health charities I don't think I've ever gotten the objection \"but people in other countries don't matter\" or \"they matter far less than Americans\", while I expect vegan advocates often hear that about animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have gotten the latter one explicitly and the former implicitly, so I'm afraid you should get out more often :).</p>\n<p>More generally, that foreigners and/or immigrants don't matter, or matter little compared to native born locals, is fundamental to political parties around the world. It's a banal take in international politics. Sure, some opposition to global health charities is an implied or explicit empirical claim about the role of government. But fundamentally, not all of it as a lot of people don't value the lives of the out-group and people not in your country are in the out-group (or at least not in the in-group) for much of the world's population.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First, I think GiveWell's research, say, is mostly consumed by people who agree people matter equally regardless of which country they live in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GiveWell donors are not representative of all humans. I think a large fraction of humanity would select the \"we're all equal\" option on a survey but clearly don't actually believe it or act on it (which brings us back to revealed preferences in trades like those humans make about animal lives).</p>\n<p>But even if none of that is true, were someone to make this argument about the value of the global poor, the best moral (I make no claims about what's empirically persuasive) response is \"make a coherent and defensible argument against the equal moral worth of humans including the global poor\", and not something like \"most humans actually agree that the global poor have equal value so don't stray too far from equality in your assessment.\" If you do the latter, you are making a contingent claim based on a given population at a given time. To put it mildly, for most of human history I do not believe we even would have gotten people to half-heartedly select the \"moral equality for all humans\" option on a survey. For me at least, we aren't bound in our philosophical assessment of value by popular belief here or for animal welfare.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "J2ZB9qjS8bF3ibu3Q", "user": {"username": "Marcus_A_Davis"}}, {"_id": "eCDeWpMjzj3QjsCvt", "postedAt": "2023-10-02T21:19:04.924Z", "postId": "H6hxTrgFpb3mzMPfz", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>I have gotten the latter one explicitly and the former implicitly, so I'm afraid you should get out more often :).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yikes; ugh.
