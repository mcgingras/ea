I also want to see any mistakes, assumptions, or just bad logic called out so that I can avoid making them in the future, assuming they are a clear cut case.</p><p>Context for the interested. Recently I have been thinking about the \u201cEnd justifies the means\u201d saying, and how viable it is because of the FTX topic. I am conflicted in that area because saying that the end justifies the means feels cheap, is an excuse to put in less effort, and a slippery slope with a vague limit of where to stop. At the same time however, my belief is that the world was not created with justice in mind, and if human survival is at stake, how dare we take the high horse by saying that we don't need the \u201cdirty\u201d practices to succeed. Will we die because of our pride? I have also seen this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npo3.nl/keuringsdienst-van-waarde/15-09-2022/KN_1729782\"><u>https://www.npo3.nl/keuringsdienst-van-waarde/15-09-2022/KN_1729782</u></a> short report about using monkeys as forced labor to collect coconuts. Nothing new I guess, but I have not been aware of it before.</p><p>I find the following topic hard to assess. Forced labor of primates is, for me, obviously animal cruelty. It is a restriction of freedom, with occasional physical punishment. The businesses exploit them because they are cheaper, and perhaps even more efficient in terms of collecting coconuts.</p><p>It starts to get tricky for me when I consider that humans would have to do this job otherwise. If I am trying to minimize human suffering, and ideally suffering in general, doesn't that make humans suffer less? Perhaps the monkeys suffer even less at that work, thus less suffering in general, although I doubt that in this case. If I have the opportunity to use another species for work, while that species would otherwise be doing \u201cnothing useful\u201d or even seen as pests to humans, would it make sense to use that species for forced labor? If Macaques are a bad example, in the highly theoretical example, what if cockroaches were more sentient, and capable of complex tasks? How okay would we be with forced labor of invasive species, which are considered pests, while they would be suffering less than humans at the given job?</p><p>Even more confusing thought for me is the following. The \u201cnatural\u201d evolution of Macaques does not give them a desire to help humans, or to work for them. If humans however crossbreed this species up to a moment when Macaques become intrinsically rewarded by cooperating with humans, and therefore they gain joy from it, does that no longer make it an animal cruelty? I would still consider forcefully breeding Macaques, basically into a slave species, fairly unethical. However, is the work ethical now because they enjoy it? Sorry for the term, but that sounds like slavery with extra steps.</p><p>With this in mind, I am at a loss of where I am supposed to draw the line. Were dogs or other domesticated species just bred into slavery? Does that make owning pets, or even putting any animal into a restricted area unethical? What if we bred the species into slaves indirectly by rewarding the behavior of collecting coconuts with food, and they would \u201cnaturally\u201d become the dominant species because now you can call it a symbiotic relationship. Technically we have still forced part of the species into extinction by rewarding the Macaques with preference towards work. Do the \u201cextra steps\u201d make unethical areas ethical? Perhaps, the human mind is no longer capable of perceiving ethics after a certain \u201cmental distance\u201d, or \u201cextra steps\u201d, in which case, how can we say that distance of 1 is unethical, but distance of 8 is just \u201cnatural\u201d?</p><p>The question I have is what mistakes or incorrect conclusions did I make, and what are your perspectives? I believe that it is simply a very complex situation, but I feel conflicted, especially even towards people who prefer the \u201cends justifies the means\u201d, and I would simply like to have someone else's views as well.</p>", "user": {"username": "vmasarik"}}, {"_id": "RPTPo8eHTnruoFyRH", "title": "Some important questions for the EA Leadership", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T17:10:26.505Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The recent FTX scandal has, I think, caused a major dent in the confidence many in the EA Community have in our leadership. It seems to me increasingly less obvious that the control of a lot of EA by a narrow group of funders and thought leaders is the best way for this community full of smart and passionate people to do good in the world. The assumption I had is we defer a lot of power, both intellectual, social and financial, to a small group of broadly unaccountable, non-transparent people on the assumption they are uniquely good at making decisions, noticing risks to the EA enterprise and combatting them, and that this unique competence is what justifies the power structures we have in EA. A series of failure by the community this year, including the Carrick Flynn campaign and now the FTX scandal has shattered my confidence in this group. I really think EA is amazing, and I am proud to be on the committee of EA Oxford (this represent my own views), having been a summer research fellow at CERI and having spoken at EAGx Rotterdam; my confidence in the EA leadership, however, is exceptionally low, and I think having an answer to some of these questions would be very useful.</p><p>An aside: maybe I\u2019m wrong about power structures in EA being unaccountable, centralised and non-transparent. If so, the fact it feels like that is also a sign something is going wrong.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Thus, I have a number of questions for the \u201cleadership group\u201d about how decisions are made in EA and rationale for these. This list is neither exhaustive nor meant as an attack; there possibly are innocuous answers to many of these questions. Moreover, not all of these are linked to SBF and that scandal, and many of these probably have perfectly rational explanation.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, I think now is the appropriate time to ask difficult questions of the EA leadership, so this is just my list of said questions. I do apologise if people take offence to any of these (I know it is a difficult time for everyone), as we really are I am sure all trying our best, but nonetheless I do think we can only have as positive an impact as possible if we are really willing to examine ourselves and see what we have done wrong.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Who is invited to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/coordination-forum#:~:text=The%20Coordination%20Forum%20(formerly%20known,the%20Centre%20for%20Effective%20Altruism.\"><u>coordination forum</u></a> and who attends?

Passing laws at the local level allows people to help animals in their communities, while providing a model for other cities and jurisdictions. Local laws can also create momentum for statewide initiatives, which demonstrates a state\u2019s strong commitment to protecting animals.</p><p>The goal of this project was to look at whether local laws have laid the groundwork for laws at the state level of government, as a potential avenue for change. This study aimed to determine whether there is evidence that local animal laws have been or could influence state laws. And secondarily, whether case law has influenced state legislation.</p><p>To this end, we reviewed legal materials relating to animal welfare in the United States. The scope of this review included legislation and case law from the past twenty years, related to a range of animal welfare topics. Our primary focus was on farmed animal issues, but with consideration given to other issues that are similar and potentially generalizable. Our goals were to identify any trends and provide recommendations to advocates based on previous attempts to broaden the scope of animal welfare laws.</p><p><strong>Research Team</strong></p><p>The project\u2019s lead author was Precious Hose (Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University). Dr. Jo Anderson (Faunalytics) reviewed and oversaw the work.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Successes &amp; Challenges</p><p>Local laws can sometimes create meaningful change at the state level. Success is far from guaranteed, but this review found evidence of states taking into account local laws and resolutions during discussion of bills on animal topics including battery cages, gestation crates, veal crates, foie gras, and meat reduction. Some of those attempts failed, but they suggest that at the bare minimum, states will generally consider local examples, even outside of their own state.&nbsp;</p><p>This research encompassing all fifty U.S. states found evidence suggesting that when similar laws are widely adopted across multiple municipalities, it appears to increase the chances of passing related state laws. In the strongest example, over 400 municipalities passed their own ordinances banning puppy mill sales and the widespread support from many municipalities supported five states passing statewide bans on puppy mill sales within the past six years.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest barrier to creating change from the ground up is state preemption of local laws. While existing preemptions\u2014which are particularly common for laws around animal farming\u2014pose a major hindrance to progress, the worst-case scenario is for opponents of animal protection fight back against legislation by bringing a state bill to preempt pro-animal local ordinances, as occurred in the case of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.lexis.com/document/midlinetitle/?pdmfid=1530671&amp;crid=9b30520e-ebd0-4720-b06f-7b4807aa3e57&amp;docfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5PRP-D1G1-JJK6-S2C8-00000-00&amp;componentid=6419&amp;prid=cf7bc863-6a27-46e7-ad8e-89ae2d0888f5&amp;ecomp=7y7g&amp;earg=sr2\"><i><u>Puppies \u2019N Love v. City of Phoenix</u></i></a><i>,</i> 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Some opponents may also bring lawsuits against the city enforcing the ordinance. While this is a concerning possible outcome to consider, we found that it is a relatively rare outcome to date, having occurred in only four examples we reviewed. Even in instances where there is a lot of support for animal protection actions like banning puppy mill sales\u2014which accounted for two of the four examples\u2014there may also be strong pushback from opponents of the bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>An additional option for local governments is to file resolutions to advance the community\u2019s position on specific animal topics. Resolutions have no legal or binding effect on law, so additional research is needed into whether they cause a meaningful shift in citizen or corporate behavior in the locality itself, but regardless of that impact, they may bring awareness to state legislators about a particular issue. If a state legislature fails to act upon the resolution, local governments can reissue another one the following year.&nbsp;</p><p>Resolutions may be particularly helpful when multiple cities file resolutions addressing the same topic. It can show there is widespread support or concern about an issue, which may inspire legislators to focus on passing specific legislation at the state level\u2014though again, more research is needed.</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>Throughout this review, we have also made note of city ordinances and local initiatives that may influence state law in the future. While state legislators may not look to these local efforts unless a person or organization is lobbying for similar legislation, they provide evidence of a city\u2019s position on a particular issue, and it can be used for future state legislation. Bringing existing ordinances to the attention of state representatives can be part of efforts to introduce legislation.</p><p>A Senior Policy Advisor representing an international nonprofit animal protection organization noted that the legislative environment between state and local governments varies widely, which can make it difficult to predict whether a bill will pass at the state level (Personal communication, August 5, 2022). Yet, advocates can gain insightful information if a bill fails to pass during the process by either talking to legislators or with members of the committee where the bill died. Legislators may even release reports or participate in interviews to discuss why the bill did not pass.</p><p>Overall, this review supports the idea that local laws and initiatives can influence state bills with positive animal impacts, which recommends it as a pathway for grassroots advocates to become involved in making systemic change. Lobbying local legislators and supporting initiatives creates momentum in communities that may be helpful to those working for state-level progress, as submitting this type of information informs state legislators that other jurisdictions have passed similar laws, which conveys an impression of support and gives them information to draw upon when considering whether it would be beneficial for their state to adopt it. Including mentions of local ordinances and/or local initiatives in addition to other evidence or arguments can strengthen the influence of passing a bill. Additionally, participating in the local legislative process and supporting other cities in passing these types of laws at the local level can advance animal interests when the state cannot or will not provide such protection.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important for advocates working at the state level to build relationships with local council members as well as state legislators in order to improve communication and transparency between these groups. Approaching legislators who are from cities that have passed similar ordinances to the proposed state bill may also be influential. Advocates may gain a greater understanding of the likelihood a state bill will pass and legislators can additionally offer advice to ensure advocates are successful in other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/local-action-as-stepping-stone/\"><strong><u>Read the full study here</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "JLRiedi"}}, {"_id": "YA86Z2q9enZ9g6GbL", "title": "Agent Of Illumination", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T15:36:30.099Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This short piece on Awakin.org by Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <u>Eat, Pray, Love,</u> felt like a good reminder today of the many ways that we each can harness the power of our good intent when the emotional atmosphere around us feels bleak.

As this diagnosis goes, Bankman-Fried's behaviour was partly (though not entirely) the result of attitudes that are unfortunately general among Effective Altruists, such as a too-easy willingness to violate side-constraints, too little concern with honesty and transparency, and sometimes a lack of integrity. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moskov/status/1591592384936435713?s=20&amp;t=QLMZbbDA-Sbm6_nyQug6mA\">This thread</a> by Dustin Moskovitz and <a href=\"https://muddyclothes.substack.com/p/the-perils-of-underestimating-second\">this post</a> by Julian Hazell both exemplify the conclusion that EA needs to be a bit more 'deontological'.</p><p>I\u2019m sympathetic here: I\u2019m an ethics guy by background, and I think it\u2019s an important and insightful field. I understand that EA and longtermism emerged out of moral philosophy, that some of the movement\u2019s most prominent leaders&nbsp;<i>are</i> analytic ethicists in their day jobs, and that the language of the movement is (in large part) the language of analytic ethics. So it makes sense that EAs reach for ethical distinctions and ideas when trying to think about a question, such as \u2018what went wrong with FTX?\u2019. But I think that it is&nbsp;completely the wrong way to think about cases where people abuse their power, like Bankman-Fried abused his.</p><p>The problem with the abuse of power is not simply that having power lets you do things that fuck over other people (in potentially self-defeating ways). You will&nbsp;<i>always</i> have opportunities to fuck people over for influence and leverage, and it is&nbsp;<i>always</i> possible, at least in principle, that you will get too carried away by your own vision and take these opportunities (even if they are self-defeating). This applies no matter if you are the President of the United States or if you\u2019re just asking your friend for \u00a320; it applies even if you are purely altruistically motivated.</p><p>However, morally thoughtful people tend to have good \u2018intuitions\u2019 about everyday cases: it is these that common-sense morality was designed to handle. We know that it\u2019s wrong to take someone else\u2019s money and not pay it back; we know that it\u2019s typically wrong to lie solely for our own benefit; we understand that it\u2019s good to be trustworthy and honest. Indeed, in everyday contexts certain options are just entirely&nbsp;<i>unthinkable</i>. For example, a surgeon won\u2019t typically even ask themselves&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27902416\"><u>\u2018should I cut up this patient and redistribute their organs to maximise utility?\u2019</u></a>\u2014the idea to do such a thing would never even enter their mind\u2014and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://people.whitman.edu/~frierspr/Persons,%20character%20and%20morality%20-%20Bernard%20Williams's%20Moral%20Luck.pdf\"><u>you would probably be a bit uneasy with a surgeon who had indeed asked himself this question, even if he had concluded that he shouldn\u2019t cut you up.</u></a></p><p>This kind of everyday moral reasoning is exactly what is captured by the kinds of deontological \u2018side constraints\u2019 most often discussed in the Effective Altruism community. As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5o3vttALksQQQiqkv/consequentialists-in-society-should-self-modify-to-have-side\"><u>this post</u></a> makes wonderfully clear, the reason why even consequentialists should be concerned with side-constraints is because you can&nbsp;<i>predict ahead of time&nbsp;</i>that you will face certain kinds of situations, and you know that it would be better if you acted according to these maxims. The same kind of reasoning applies to ideas like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CfcvPBY9hdsenMHCr/integrity-for-consequentialists-1\"><u>\u2018integrity\u2019</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SWxnP5LZeJzuT3ccd/pr-is-corrosive-reputation-is-not\"><u>\u2018reputation\u2019</u></a>; the entire point is that you can predict ahead of time the kind of situations you are likely to face, so can draw on the resources of moral philosophy to come up with strategies for facing them responsibly. (Yes, for those who speak fluent <i>LessWrong</i>, this is essentially just self-modification.) The steady, predictable nature of these kinds of cases is precisely why everyday moral thinking is so well-suited to them.</p><p>The problem is more specific to circumstances of <strong>power</strong>, because everyday moral thinking is&nbsp;<i>not</i> all that well-suited to the high-stakes choices that you have to make when you have power. Very often,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/public-and-private-morality/politics-and-moral-character/A93C04E07939933543B93D3216EE7FBF\"><u>these choices force you to make trade-offs and moral compromises that would be unacceptable by everyday standards</u></a>. Further, these situations often involve pervasive uncertainty, with no \u2018given\u2019 probabilities or regular laws that can be exploited to structure your decision-making, only your own judgment and best guesses. With no single obvious reference class and a huge degree of unknown unknowns, it\u2019s not clear ahead of time what situations you will even face\u2014and, as a result, not clear at all what the relevant side-constraints should&nbsp;<i>be</i>. You just don\u2019t know which types of moral reasoning will be helpful or necessary, and which would stop you from making the necessary trade-offs.</p><p>The possibility of motivated reasoning makes this problem even more serious. Many people who&nbsp;<i>do</i> care about side-constraints nonetheless find ways to justify obvious-seeming violations, through rhetorical redescription and motivated reasoning,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1590841627979153409?s=20&amp;t=Z-KaAi2TyhX3UEzkkBztzQ\"><u>if they are put in contexts that provide them with the opportunity to do so</u></a>. This means that a proposed deontological rule must be specific enough to avoid this problem, while also general enough to actually be workable. The maxim \u2018never commit murder\u2019 is nice, but wouldn\u2019t have prevented a fiasco like Bankman-Fried\u2019s; the maxim \u2018do not misuse customer funds\u2019 is better, but far too open to motivated reasoning about the meaning of \u2018misuse\u2019; and while a maxim of \u2018do not use customer funds to prop up your insolvent hedge fund while just&nbsp;<i>hoping</i> to make the money back later\u2019 is perfect, you can only formulate it after the fact.</p><p>To be sure, it seems as though Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t take side-constraints particularly seriously. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he would have done any better&nbsp;<i>had</i> he taken them seriously.&nbsp;<i>Intending</i> to obey deontological constraints is no more a guarantee that you will obey them than&nbsp;<i>intending</i> to maximise utility is a guarantee that you will maximise utility. What\u2019s needed is a more systematic analysis of how to act in situations of power, potentially including proposals for reform at the institutional level\u2014not simplistic rules drawn from intuition.</p>", "user": {"username": "Peter McLaughlin"}}, {"_id": "W5bT8mxvXzkrKifTE", "title": "Eirik Mofoss named \"Young leader of the year\" in Norway", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T13:31:03.405Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Written by J\u00f8rgen Lj\u00f8nes, managing director of Gi Effektivt and co-founder of &nbsp;the Norwegian effective altruism movement.</i>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eirikmofoss/\"><i>Eirik Mofoss</i></a><i> was recently named \u201c</i><a href=\"https://www.dn.no/ledestjerner/ledestjerner/ledestjerner-2022/d2/arets-ledestjerne-eirik-mofoss-29/2-1-1341654\"><i>Young leader of the year</i></a><i>\u201d by the largest business newspaper in Norway.

We wanted to share and celebrate this, not only as a recognition of Eirik, but also for &nbsp;all the Norwegian EAs who has made this possible.</i></p><h3>Background</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.dn.no\">Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv</a> (Norwegian for \"Today's Business\"), commonly known as DN, is the third-largest daily newspaper in Norway. Every year, DN nominates 30 people under the age of 30 who, through good ideas, entrepreneurial or leadership skills, represent guiding figures for others, and want to make the world more sustainable. First, DN\u2019s readership nominates a selection of people, then an independent jury picks the final 30, based on the UN's 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). The jury, together with readers, then selects a single winner, among people whose accomplishments have yielded some kind of measurable impact in the realm of sustainable development.</p><h3>The nomination of Eirik as a candidate for the award</h3><p>Eirik Mofoss co-founded <a href=\"https://effektivaltruisme.no/ntnu\">the first Norwegian branch of the Effective Altruism movement at NTNU</a> in 2014, and has remained true to his ideals ever since. Eirik has committed to donating 20 percent of his income for the rest of his life, and has\u2014through his nomination\u2014imparted his mode of working and living on a readership of over 150 000 people. He has also widely publicised his altruistic ideals through his earlier work, as adviser to both the Conservative Party in Parliament, as well as adviser to <a href=\"https://www.norad.no/en/front/\">Norad</a> (Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation). According to the jury:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Eirik Mofoss examines our fundamental assumptions about what aid currently is, and our vision for what it could be; how one can\u2014and should\u2014contribute, as a private citizen.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.dn.no/d2/ledestjerner/ledestjerner-2022/altruisme/bistand/eirik-29-skal-gi-bort-20-prosent-av-inntekten-sin-resten-av-livet/2-1-1294958\">DN\u2019s first interview with Eirik Mofoss</a> quickly became their most read \u201c30 under 30\u201d-interview ever, and the newspaper\u2019s most read piece in 2022.</p><p>Eirik Mofoss is 29 years old, born in Troms\u00f8, in the north of Norway, and has a master's degree in industrial economics and technology management from NTNU. Mofoss has previously worked as a political and financial adviser for the Conservative Party of Norway, and as a business development manager for Visma. Almost ten years ago, he became a member of Giving What We Can, and committed to donating 20 percent of his income for the rest of his life. Mofoss co-founded the first effective altruism group in Norway in 2014 while studying at NTNU, and has later co-founded the foundation Gi Effektivt that fundraises for charities recommended by GiveWell.</p><h3>The jury\u2019s reasoning for naming Eirik \"Young leader of the year\"</h3><blockquote><p>Eirik Mofoss shows us that our direct actions still yield impactful results during a time when many feel increasingly powerless. Mofoss builds bridges, and has skillfully integrated his personal and working lives. He seeks, through his activism and modes of thinking, to elevate the discourse around sustainability\u2014away from individualistic critiques, and toward systemic ones.</p><p>Mofoss\u2019 generation has been raised in the global labour aristocracy. Despite this, some of them have recognized the extent to which their privileges and positions can be used for good. Mofoss challenges how we as individuals can contribute, and works to deflate the myth that impoverished people spend economic transfers inefficiently. Furthermore, his rhetoric serves as an antidote to political division, contributing to the widening conception that the climate crisis, endemic poverty, and public health are, in fact, bipartisan political challenges.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "Jorgen_Ljones"}}, {"_id": "efkxaQSQbBx7wpHpi", "title": "[Linkpost] [Summary] The Guardian: Is the effective altruism movement in trouble?

But<strong> </strong>if we establish knowledge it is good for community, culture might change?</li><li>If<strong> tiny wrongdoings are common</strong> in the community, then this idea would face a lot of resistance.

&nbsp;That she was doing, even, what Naomi Novik would have told her to do?</p><p>The Scholomance novels feature a protagonist, Galadriel Higgins, with unusually dark and scary powers, with a dark and scary prophecy about herself, trying to do the right thing anyways and being misinterpreted by her classmates, in an incredibly hostile environment.</p><p>The line of causality seems clear - Naomi Novik, by telling her readers to <i>do the right thing</i>, probably contributed to Caroline Ellison doing what <i>she</i> thought was the right thing - misusing Alameda's customer deposits. &nbsp;Furthermore, the Scholomance novels romanticized people with dark and scary powers, and those people <i>not </i>just immediately killing themselves in the face of a prophecy that they'd do immense harm later, i.e., sending the message that it's okay for them to take huge risks with other people's interests.</p><p>I expect this to be a very serious blow to Naomi Novik's reputation, possibly the reputation of fantasy fiction in general. &nbsp;The now-deleted Tumblr post is tantamount to a declaration that Caroline Ellison was doing this <i>because she thought Naomi Novik told her to.</i> &nbsp;We can infer that probably at least $30 of Scholomance sales are due to Caroline Ellison, and with the resources that Ellison commanded as co-CEO of Alameda, some unknown other fraction of Scholomance's entire revenues could have been due to phantom purchases that Ellison funded in order to channel customer deposits to her favorite author.</p><hr><p>My moral here? &nbsp;It can also be summed up in an old joke that goes as follows: &nbsp;\"He has no right to make himself that small; he is not that great.\"</p><p>The best summary of the FTX affair that I've read so is Milky Eggs's <strong>\"</strong><a href=\"https://milkyeggs.com/?p=175\"><strong>What Happened at Alameda Research?</strong></a><strong>\"</strong> &nbsp;If you haven't read it already, and you're at all interested in this affair, I recommend that you go read it right now.</p><p>Pieced together from various sources, including some allegedly shared from FTX-employees (and including some comments posted by those to the Effective Altruism forum), Milky Eggs pieces together a harrowing story of how Alameda Research probably lost in excess of $15 billion dollars. &nbsp;Primary causative factors:</p><ul><li>Their actual arb strategies stopped working, and were frog-boilingly gradually replaced with long bets on crypto that paid out during the boom and exploded during the bust;</li><li>Poor accounting, possibly just <i>no</i> really global accounting or sense of where the money was going;</li><li>Excessive use of stimulants, including those known to result in compulsive gambling behavior;</li><li>A corporate acquisitions spree, possibly partially motivated by buying up corporate entities that held the FTT token and could have taked the market by dumping it, maybe even raiding those companies for their own customer deposits;</li><li>A general lack of spending discipline: for example, buying naming rights to the e-sports organization TSM for $210M, which was way out of line to comparable deals in e-sports.</li></ul><p>Completely missing from Milky Eggs's account: &nbsp;Any mention of effective altruism, except that the EA Forum is listed as a source for some of their alleged-ex-FTX-employee accounts.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because - and I say this meaning it gently, and with kindness - you were not that fucking important.</p><p>The amount that FTX spent on e-sports naming rights for TSM was greater than everything they donated to effective altruism.</p><p>Can you imagine how you'd judge it if, rather than my writing it as a joke, Naomi Novik had gone online and sincerely tried to accept blame for FTX's fall, because she thought she hadn't been careful enough to put messages about good corporate governance and careful accounting into her fantasy novels, and Novik had talked about how she was planning to donate an appropriate portion of her Scholomance book royalties back to FTX's ruined customers? &nbsp;Depending on her state of mind, you might either try to gently console her and somehow get her to realize that she was being way too scrupulous and might possibly want to try standard meds for OCD at some point; or, on another hypothesis about Novik's state of mind, you might try to gently explain that she's not the center of the universe and that this wasn't mostly about her.</p><p>This would be true even if Sam Bankman-Fried himself had presented as a Naomi Novik fan, if he had told others that he wanted to be a Novik-style DoTheRightThingist just like Galadriel Higgins the Scholomance protagonist, and he had funneled $140M to causes having to do with things that were on-theme for some of Novik's books. &nbsp;The $140M would still be less than FTX had spent on e-sports naming rights. &nbsp;SBF calling himself a Novikian RightThingist would not have been much of a factor in why he was trusted, compared to their claims of being the first GAAP-audited crypto exchange and so on.</p><p>There probably <i>would</i> be some sort of weird blowup in the Novik fandom, in that case, it would make <i>more</i> sense for them to wonder if they were responsible. &nbsp;But I'd expect people in the Novik fandom to <i>also</i> vastly overestimate how much it was all about them, in that case; because they would know all about Novik, but have <i>less </i>daily exposure to the much wider world in which FTX operated. &nbsp;They'd have heard about the money donated to RightThingism but not about the e-sports naming rights. &nbsp;They would not realize that there were other and bigger fish in the pond.</p><p>(Be it clear, I'm not analogizing myself to Novik in that metaphor. &nbsp;I'm analogizing Peter Singer and classical Givewell-style EA to Novik. &nbsp;I asked SBF if he wanted to meet with me ever, he never got around to it, I do not think he was a Yudkowsky fan and he hung out with some EAs who definitely weren't.)</p><p>(ADDED: &nbsp;I am not saying that EA influence on Alameda was comparable in magnitude to Novik's influence on Caroline Ellison; I am giving an example of the mental motion of trying to grab too much responsibility because you don't know about all the parts of the universe that aren't yourself.)</p><p>It wouldn't, even, reflect all that badly on the spirit running across many fantasy novels of RightThingism. &nbsp;Not just because \"no true Scotsman\", not even because SBF would have really actually missed the point of fantasy-novel RightThingism. &nbsp;But because the amount that FTX spent on e-sports naming rights vs the amount they gave to RightThingist causes, and how they didn't take a billion off the table for RightThingism while they still had a billion, maybe belied a bit the idea that RightThingism was in fact <i>that central</i> to their mental lives.</p><p>Also Milky Eggs's account says that FTX's own employees were encouraged to keep all their salaries on the exchange, which... I don't really have words. &nbsp;It's not - what you'd expect somebody to do if they still had even fantasy-novel RightThingism inside them. &nbsp;The Milky Eggs account says that Caroline Ellison was one of four FTX employees who knew. &nbsp;I wish I had a reliable printout of what Caroline Ellison was actually thinking at the time she wrote that Tumblr post. &nbsp;I would bet that, even without the benefit of hindsight on how it turned out, Naomi Novik wouldn't have agreed with it at the time.</p><p>And whatever Caroline Ellison was thinking when she wrote that, it is obvious - when you look at it from safely outside - that it wasn't Naomi Novik's fault.</p><p>If Caroline Ellison had worn a Naomi Novik T-shirt and put the Scholomance books in her Twitter profile and told her crypto clients \"Trust me, I read fantasy novels and I know what the Right Thing is,\" it would still not have been Naomi Novik's fault.</p><p>It wouldn't have been the fault of the abstract concept of \u201cyou can either do the thing that\u2019s easy and safe or you can do the thing that\u2019s hard and scary but right, and being a good person is doing the right thing\u201d. &nbsp;Plenty of people have read fantasy novels like that and not wrecked depository institutions. &nbsp;Not just in terms of moral responsibility, but <i>actual causality,</i> I'd be surprised if that was really in actual fact a key driver in the decisions that Caroline Ellison made; maybe she used that to rationalize that afterwards, but I doubt it's what was going through her mind on the fatal day that FTX used customer deposits to pay back Alameda creditors (if that's in fact when FTX first touched customer deposits). &nbsp;Pride did it, I'd sooner guess, or the desire to not not not be in this universe going so badly and taking the only step that preserved the feeling that everything could still be okay.</p><p>Who's at fault for FTX's wrongdoing?</p><p>FTX.</p><p>Ask a simple question, get a simple answer.</p><p>You have no right to blame yourself any more than that. &nbsp;You weren't that important.</p><hr><p>If there's anyone <i>other</i> than FTX who's really to blame, here, it's me. &nbsp;I've written some fiction that tries to walk people through the experience of abandoning sunk costs and facing reality. &nbsp;Including my most recent work.</p><p>Caroline Ellison, according to her tumblr, had even started reading it...</p><p>But her liveblogs cut out before she got very far in.</p><p>I just wasn't a good-enough writer; I lost my reader's attention, and with it, perhaps, the world.</p><hr><hr><p>Now, some people might say here: &nbsp;\"But Eliezer, aren't you co-writing that story with another author?\" &nbsp;And to this I can only reply: &nbsp;I see no reason why the existence of any other people in the universe ought to detract from my own sole accountability for everything that anyone does inside it.</p>", "user": {"username": "EliezerYudkowsky"}}, {"_id": "vmCvQfosvyi6E5nDF", "title": "SBF, Pascal's Mugging, and a Proposed Solution", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T09:34:30.872Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Cole Killian"}}, {"_id": "cwa5m5pJQh857GE7C", "title": "EA & LW Forums Weekly Summary (7th Nov - 13th Nov 22')", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T03:04:38.401Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Supported by Rethink Priorities</i></p><p>This is part of a weekly series summarizing the top (40+ karma) posts on the EA and LW forums - you can see the full collection <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/W4fhpuN26naxGCBbN\">here.</a> The first post includes some details on purpose and methodology.</p><p>If you'd like to receive these summaries via email, you can subscribe <a href=\"https://easummaries.substack.com/?r=1p817z&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=pub&amp;utm_medium=web\">here.</a></p><p><strong>Podcast version</strong>: prefer your summaries in podcast form?

The FTX Future Fund, financed by FTX and its founder SBF (Sam Bankman-Fried), had been a major funder in EA since its launch in Feb this year.<br><br>What happened: Binance, a competitor, sold their stake in FTX\u2019s primary coin - this caused it to drop in value, and led to the equivalent of a bank run ie. a large number of clients attempting to withdraw funds. FTX didn\u2019t have enough money to pay them, and there have been claims this is due to SBF misusing customer funds to prop up his trading company Alameda Research.</p><p>This has meant thousands of people with funds in FTX have likely lost them. If you need someone to talk to, even just to vent, CEA\u2019s community health team&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJooJD0Sm2csCYgd0Is6FkpyQa3ket8IIcFzd_FcTRU7avRg/viewform\"><u>is available</u></a> or you can access peer support set up by Rethink Wellbeing and the Mental Health Navigator&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7PqmnrBhSX4yCyMCk/effective-peer-support-network-in-ftx-crisis-update\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j7sDfXKEMeT2SRvLG/ftx-faq\"><u>FTX FAQ</u></a> by Hamish Doodles<i>&nbsp;</i>provides a good overview of the situation as of Sunday 13th November.</p><p>Other key points from posts:</p><ul><li>The EA community has distanced itself from FTX and is strongly condemning any misuse of customer funds that might have occurred. This includes statements by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/txGgPvKgZFpphdkHe/my-reaction-to-ftx-appalled\"><u>Robert Wiblin</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT/a-personal-statement-on-ftx\"><u>William MacAskill</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1\"><u>the FTX fund team</u></a> (who have resigned), and many others.</li><li>Upcoming grantees of the FTX Future Fund who have yet to receive money are unlikely to.

Most longtermist funding applications are paused while they re-evaluate this bar.</li><li>There have been various discussions on how to prevent something similar happening again - including private investigators for this case, discussions on how much due diligence to apply to funders, better governance practices generally, and whistleblowing mechanisms.</li></ul><p>This is an evolving situation, with many posts on the topic.

I didn't see what else holds us together besides the maximizing thing.</p>\n<p>But I was kind of ignoring the reasoning thing! I thought about it, and I think that we can make minimal changes: The framing I like is \"Do good, using REASONING\". With capital letters :)</p>\n<p>I think deleting \"the most\" is a change we should have made a long time ago; few of the important people in EA were claiming that they were doing the <em>most</em> good anyway. And EA at its core <em>is</em> about reasoning: reasoning carefully, using evidence; thinking about first-order and second-order effects; comparing options in front of you; argument and debate. The simpler phrasing of this new mission is intended to make reasoning stand out.</p>\n<p>If this direction is adopted, I have the following hopes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that EA will become a \"bigger tent,\" accepting of more types of people doing more types of good things in the world and reasoning about them. e.g., we'll welcome anyone who is trying to do good, and is open to talking through the 'why' behind what they are doing</li>\n<li>that naive utilitarian maximizers will go away or be a bit more humble :)</li>\n<li>that people will put more emphasis on developing and relying on their own reasoning processes, and rely less on the reasoning of others to make big decisions in their lives.</li>\n<li>that cause prioritization will get less emphasis, especially career cause prioritization (I think the maximizing thingy regularly causes people to make bad career decisions)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Some color on the final one: I've had a blog post brewing for a long time against strong career cause prio but haven't really managed to write it up in a convincing way. e.g., I think AI is a bad career direction for a lot of people, but young EAs are convinced to try it anyway because AI is held up as the priority path and they'll have so much more impact if they make it. This seems bad for lots of reasons which I will try to write up in a post if I can ever figure out how to articulate them.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think the above hopes, if they pan out, will make the community stronger.

This projection never gets to 11 billion, as it peaks at 10.4 billion during the 2080s and slowly declines throughout the last decades of this century. Other population projections predict an even earlier peak in the human population, which would happen before there are 10 billion of us (<a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/e1853ba8-4444-11e8-a9f4-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\"><u>Lutz et al. 2018</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30677-2/fulltext\"><u>Vollset et al. 2020</u></a>).</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-of-all-world-regions-including-the-un-projection-until-2100\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div data-owid-slug=\"population-of-all-world-regions-including-the-un-projection-until-2100\" class=\"owid-preview\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-of-all-world-regions-including-the-un-projection-until-2100\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</iframe></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a reasonable amount of uncertainty about whether the peak will happen by the end of this century.

For one, a higher population might be desirable on its own. For example, according to the <a href=\"https://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert2255/papers/population_axiology.pdf\"><u>total view</u></a>&nbsp;in population ethics, creating lives with positive wellbeing is good, all else equal. Moreover, population growth may also affect other variables of moral importance, such as economic growth (<a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/annualreview.pdf\"><u>Jones, 2022b</u></a>) and social and political norms (<a href=\"https://www.whatweowethefuture.com/\"><u>MacAskill 2022</u></a>, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Empty_Planet.html?id%3DqOm3tAEACAAJ%26redir_esc%3Dy\"><u>Bicker and Ibbitson 2020</u></a>). At first glance, increasing population growth may have an unusually lasting impact, as the children one causes to exist will eventually come to have children of their own.</p><p>The aim of this report&nbsp;is to evaluate the case for prioritising population growth as a priority. We consider the effects of a population increase on three variables: the size of future population, economic growth, and civilizational resilience to catastrophes.&nbsp;For each of these effects, we present a broad picture of the key arguments for population growth and the counterarguments, as well as our conclusion about the relative strengths of these arguments.</p><p>Four key assumptions behind our analysis are:</p><ol><li>The <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/\"><u>longtermism paradigm</u></a>&nbsp;(any action that is among the best positively impacts the world far away in the future),</li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/population-ethics\"><u>total view</u></a>&nbsp;in population ethics,</li><li>Welfarism,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx9l6fg029so\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx9l6fg029so\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and</li><li>Fertility increases or reductions in child mortality are the main channels through which we can increase population size.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsjnwd8zq41q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsjnwd8zq41q\">[4]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>It is not obvious that these assumptions hold in practice.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg55iydenp9q\"><sup><a href=\"#fng55iydenp9q\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, we believe that they constitute a reasonable basis for the present analysis, and dropping some of them likely weakens the case for population growth.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwdiojn3sjvm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwdiojn3sjvm\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<strong>We conclude that the case for population growth as we understand it is not strong enough to make it a priority, that is,&nbsp;to justify considering it a top career path or a major funding opportunity for actors aiming to do the most good.</strong></p><h1>1. Population increases are unlikely to persist in the long run</h1><p><i>Caveat: this section is inherently more speculative than the others, as it deals with very long-run trends, and </i><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/all-possible-views-about-humanitys-future-are-wild/\"><i><u>radically different future possibilities</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;make us much less sure about what will happen then.</i></p><p>If&nbsp;a larger human population is better, and short-run increases in population growth translate into a higher long-run population size, then increasing population growth now could lead to significantly higher total wellbeing&nbsp;in the future.&nbsp;In principle, this effect could be comparable in impact&nbsp;to existential risk reduction: increasing the expected size of the entire future population by a fixed proportion is equivalent to increasing our probability of survival by that same proportion.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7inici9lij3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7inici9lij3\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thus, if existential risk reduction is one of the most impactful interventions, changing population sizes may be similarly impactful. Furthermore, population&nbsp;increases have been responsible for most of the growth in total human wellbeing (as measured by the log of GDP) in the last century (<a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/slides-popwelfare.pdf\"><u>Klenow et al. 2022</u></a>), which sets a precedent for this type of effect.</p><p>There are a few different ways in which these long-run population increases could take place, and the graphs below illustrate some of these possibilities. In each case, the red line denotes the business-as-usual scenario, and the blue line denotes a possible population trajectory after an intervention. In scenarios (a) and (b), population eventually declines to zero without intervention, as an extrapolation of the UN projection would suggest.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhb9q6lhzf1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhb9q6lhzf1\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;An intervention in these cases could either slow down the decline or change the long-run trajectory from a decline to an increase. Alternatively, long-run population may not decline without bound without intervention, as it could increase without bound (scenario c) or stabilise (scenario d). Population interventions could hence increase the long-run rate of growth or increase the level at which it will stabilise.</p><p><img style=\"width:601.7px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/nakawoii6otbzkyzwd4w\" alt=\"\"></p><p>We argue that the trajectory with and without the intervention converges in the long run.&nbsp;First, we make the case that the futures with artificial people are much bigger in expectation, and that population sizes in those worlds are unaffected by human population size.&nbsp;Second, we contend that even in cases where we do not create artificial people, there are several channels through which the effects of increasing population growth can fade away.</p><h2>Artificial people would ultimately change population growth dynamics</h2><p>The creation of artificial people might be feasible through technology such as mind uploading, which would enable us to simulate human people and create people living in virtual reality.&nbsp;The creation of artificial people may allow a substantially larger number of humans to inhabit a given area, experience faster-paced virtual worlds, expand to regions of space inhospitable to biological humans, and have a wide range of other benefits.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp69sx6vmopd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp69sx6vmopd\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The advent of digital people would make space settlement more likely, and plausibly the vast majority of people in the long-run future will be artificial.</p><p>The transition from biological to artificial people would likely bring about substantial changes in key considerations underlying a reproduction/replication decision, such as a substantial reduction in cost. Even if artificial people can reproduce sexually, and their fertility preferences are similar to those of biological people&nbsp;at the time of their creation, higher population growth could be achieved by simply creating more simulations. Moreover, artificial people could be immortal, in which case additional people would only increase population. Hence, assuming that creating artificial people will eventually be possible, it seems unlikely that a higher biological population would have any significant direct effect on the population size of artificial beings.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpaec92dcv4e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpaec92dcv4e\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We put &gt;50%&nbsp;credence that such technology will be developed in the next thousand years (more reasoning in <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21505\"><u>this guesstimate model</u></a>). It follows that we believe biological population growth interventions should not have effects lasting more than a few centuries.</p><p>One has to ask about the moral status of artificial people, and when we would have such technology. We believe that sentience is sufficient for moral patienthood status. Moreover, if beings are conscious, they are likely also sentient. Most consciousness researchers believe that machines can have consciousness,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5r3fcjfdhtk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5r3fcjfdhtk\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and most consciousness theories allow for this possibility.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4intposr0q6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4intposr0q6\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>An overwhelmingly high probability that artificial beings will exist is not necessary for this argument. Even if they are&nbsp;only 10% likely to ever be developed, the sheer number of potential people in such worlds would make them have a much larger value potential than those where artificial minds do not come into existence. Hence, expected value considerations&nbsp;would lead to the conclusion that we should focus our actions on the worlds where mind uploading is possible.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6i5ihxywxec\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6i5ihxywxec\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><p>Although we have focused on the case of artificial people when making this argument, it is worth noting that this line of reasoning is more general. Higher biological population growth would not be the best way to promote long-run increases in population size, as long as the following two conditions are satisfied:</p><ol><li>Future worlds with the highest expected population size are those where we develop technologies that enable us not to depend on biological reproduction for increasing population size; and</li><li>The population trajectory after the development of such technologies is independent of the trajectory before their development.</li></ol><p>While the creation of artificial people is a key example of a change enabled by future technology, it is not the only one. For example, advanced AI may manage biological human population size in a way that could also satisfy the two conditions above. A reason for believing that these conditions will hold is that our future will be drastically different from the present, and brings with it the potential for increasing population growth in ways that are far more efficient than traditional biological reproduction.</p><h2>Short-run population changes only persist under particular circumstances</h2><p>Even if we assume that biological reproduction will never cease to be the main form of reproduction, there are good reasons to expect that changes to the current population growth trajectory will not have lasting effects.</p><p>First, regarding the possibility of a permanent fertility decline&nbsp;(as in scenarios <i>a</i>&nbsp;and <i>b</i>&nbsp;in the figure above), note that there are good reasons to expect fertility rates to rebound and reach a long-run above-replacement level. For a rebound to happen, we would only need a single human group satisfying the following two conditions: long-run above-replacement fertility, and a high enough \u201cretention rate\u201d, that is, a large enough fraction of the descendants of this group continues to belong to the group (<a href=\"https://sites.utexas.edu/pwi/files/2021/09/HertiableFertility.pdf\"><u>Arenberg et al. 2021</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi80c0pq4a47\"><sup><a href=\"#fni80c0pq4a47\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There are several ways by which we could get at least one group satisfying these conditions:</p><ul><li>Evolutionary pressure leading to high-fertility genes being selected for in human populations, eventually leading to above replacement fertility and total prevalence of high-fertility genes in the population;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftmmgm1qfeyp\"><sup><a href=\"#fntmmgm1qfeyp\">[15]</a></sup></span></li><li>One country successfully implementing a fertility policy, and having low enough migration (\u201cretention\u201d); or</li><li>A culture within a country developing high fertility and high retention rates.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefayzezcd7un6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnayzezcd7un6\">[16]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Thus, for long-run population decline to occur, all of these mechanisms would have to fail, which appears unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, we have observed systematic fertility decline throughout the world. This may suggest that fertility decline continues because of systematic drivers, such as wealth, simply make people much less inclined to have children, and that there is not much that individual actors can do to change that. It follows from this reasoning that population decline is much more likely to continue, but also that it should be much harder to prevent it.</p><p>Second, population cannot keep growing indefinitely.&nbsp;We assume in this section that biological humans will never be replaced by another species. As an upper bound, there are only so many atoms in the universe reachable by biological humans, and only so many ways in which we can arrange those atoms. Hence, given enough time, we would reach some steady state where future societies are using all the resources available to them.&nbsp;In the figure below, <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/sx2ljjxqgqn8nrj8ovwn\"> denotes the steady state population size when society is using the entirety of resources available, <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/jdoj0xaq63mddrvcvc2g\"> denotes the time at which we will reach this population size, and <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/wot9r5zqnxqrslbuedew\"> denotes the time at which the universe would become inhospitable for humans.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw9i1p09abxi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw9i1p09abxi\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The area between the blue and the red curves denotes the impact of getting to this upper bound in population more quickly.

And these are figures for the US, which means there is more room for growth in research efforts in most other countries, as they have a much lower proportion of researchers in 2022.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1cdkzmo2gw7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1cdkzmo2gw7\">[26]</a></sup></span></p><p>Furthermore, on a&nbsp;scale of millennia, economic growth will likely be entirely driven by advanced artificial intelligence or by artificial people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefus98xpnywm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnus98xpnywm\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Hence, to our mind, the most compelling cases for biological population growth to be a key factor behind economic growth are those where this process takes several centuries to unfold. In these scenarios, biological population growth still has to be the best candidate for increasing growth over the next centuries.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6l9qtnb30fw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6l9qtnb30fw\">[28]</a></sup></span></p><p>Moreover, by increasing population, one may also bring the creation of artificial people forward in time as there is more research in each period.</p><h2>The risk&nbsp;and long-term consequences of stagnation are overstated</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/\"><u>What We Owe the Future</u></a>&nbsp;(chapter 7), MacAskill and Aschenbrenner (henceforth MA) argue that the possibility that economic growth slows down considerably or stagnates might be particularly dangerous for humanity. The expectation of a significant growth slowdown is justified by the following arguments:</p><ol><li>The population growth rate, a driver of economic growth (as discussed <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/assessing-the-case-for-population-growth-as-a-priority#Population_growth_constitutes_a_small_share_of_current_economic_growth\"><u>above</u></a>), is declining, and population will start to decline by the end of the century.</li><li>Other drivers of economic growth cannot keep on generating growth at the current rate for more than a couple of centuries.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/aer.20180338\"><u>Ideas are getting harder to find</u></a>, that is, the rate at which a single researcher is discovering new ideas has decreased over time.</li></ol><p>Furthermore, they mention that if growth does slow down a lot or completely stops, there are two reasons to believe that stagnation would be harmful:</p><ol><li>If we stagnate at an unsustainable level of technological development, this stagnation period could be particularly likely to cause existential risks. As an illustration, if technological development were to have stopped in the 1920s, we would have no way to control climate change. We would also eventually run out of fossil fuels to burn, eventually leading to collapse.</li><li>The values that humanity would have after the stagnation is over are different from&nbsp;those that we have now, and are more likely than not to be worse than our current values. For instance, because there is a positive <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/bfriedman/pages/moral-consequences-economic-growth\">correlation between economic growth and better values\u2014see <u>Friedman (2005)</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxjtt4xzxuhc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxjtt4xzxuhc\">[29]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>We agree with them about the importance of the harms caused by stagnation, and think that its potential causes mentioned above are worthy of serious consideration. However, as we argue below, we believe that their arguments overstate&nbsp;the plausibility and size of the effects of stagnation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv8xxl1aswa7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv8xxl1aswa7\">[30]</a></sup></span></p><p>We are not the first to scrutinise this chapter's arguments. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9Y6Y6qoAigRC7A8eX/my-take-on-what-we-owe-the-future\"><u>This writeup</u></a>&nbsp;provides additional reasons for scepticism about their claims. In particular, the argument that technology to drastically increase economic growth might already be available strikes us as particularly strong.</p><h3>The possibility of stagnation</h3><p>Regarding the possibility of stagnation happening, we are more optimistic about the timing of factors causing population in the long-run to rebound from a decline. In particular, there is evidence that evolutionary pressure is already leading to increases in fertility (a potential pathway for population increases&nbsp;not considered by MA).&nbsp;We expect that this force alone will likely be able to single-handedly prevent population decline lasting more than a couple of centuries.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrp58ch3u07t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrp58ch3u07t\">[31]</a></sup></span></p><p>Furthermore, it is uncertain whether ideas in the future will be getting harder to find. <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/aer.20180338\"><u>Bloom et al. (2020)</u></a>, the main source cited for these claims, present figures showing central trends in productivity for various sectors over time. One of us (Charlotte) analysed the data used for this paper and found that, while ideas got harder to find in the past 60 years, the trends and fluctuations in the data does not allow us to confidently extrapolate this trend into the future.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefciwyywi235k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnciwyywi235k\">[32]</a></sup></span></p><p>Lastly, and more importantly, even if we take all of MA\u2019s arguments for granted, there are still good reasons for scepticism that attempting to increase population growth would be the best way to bring about high growth. Population growth currently only accounts for 0.3 p.p. of economic growth. Other interventions, such as increasing the proportion of researchers, may be more cost-effective.</p><h3>The long-term harms of stagnation</h3><p>Turning to the reasons MA provided as to why stagnation might be bad, we think that a few caveats are in order regarding the existential risks arising from the level of technological development. Current&nbsp;levels of technological development may be unsustainable. The development of synthetic biology today and in the next decades poses a dual-use risk. If the cost of renewable energy had stalled in 2009, a transition to clean energy would have been much less likely.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref86oo2wuuws5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn86oo2wuuws5\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, at some levels of technological development,&nbsp;stagnating for several centuries would not generate particularly high levels of existential risk.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefemr1rxw7wm4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnemr1rxw7wm4\">[34]</a></sup></span></p><p>Second, if a level of technological development is unsustainable, then society also has the option to choose to ban unsustainable technologies. If we were stuck with the technological level of the 1920s, we could collectively abstain from using fossil fuels, and the aforementioned risks would disappear. Although banishment might seem particularly hard in the case of fossil fuels, given how large their role in the 1920s world was, it would be a more attractive option for less important technologies, or less widespread technologies. Such a possibility has precedents: as MA themselves mention, we have opted not to use cloning technology to clone human beings, a technology that could be extremely beneficial to economic growth.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp0ygbyvszao\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp0ygbyvszao\">[35]</a></sup></span></p><p>Finally, actors concerned with economic stagnation should also consider options that would improve civilisational prospects conditional on stagnation. Two examples are investing more resources to increase their influence in a stagnant world, or trying to lock in some values.</p><h2>Increasing economic growth is suboptimal for changing societal preferences</h2><p><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Leopold-Aschenbrenner_Existential-risk-and-growth_.pdf\"><u>Aschenbrenner (2020)</u></a>&nbsp;models the relationship between existential risk and economic growth.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo258yjrnc3\"><sup><a href=\"#fno258yjrnc3\">[36]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The key idea behind the results of this model is that, as people become wealthier, their lives become more valuable, and extra money can do ever less to improve their wellbeing. Hence, people start spending their extra wealth to increase&nbsp;their life expectancy over increasing consumption. While at the individual level this implies investing more money in health and safety (<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/684750\"><u>Jones, 2016</u></a>), at the societal level this would include spending more to reduce&nbsp;the risk of existential catastrophes. Under some plausible assumptions about parameter values, speed-ups in economic growth would make people invest in safety enough to reduce the total risk of an existential catastrophe. A temporary increase in the population growth rate would be sufficient to speed growth up in this way, and hence cause existential risk reduction.</p><p>We believe this is a useful consideration for the case that increasing population reduces existential risks. However, it does not follow that increasing population size is among the best ways to reduce existential risks. There are seemingly&nbsp;more direct and high-leverage opportunities to increase the number of existential risk safety researchers. For instance, as the paper\u2019s numerical estimates suggest, increasing the patience of important actors by a small amount could lead to an effect on existential risk reduction comparable to a substantial&nbsp;increase in economic growth. Alternatively, private actors can (i) increase awareness of the risks facing humanity or (ii) subsidise existential risk safety research, which could increase the proportion of researchers working on safety.</p><p>Moreover, the consideration above regarding risk from changes in technological development also applies here. If one believes that risks arising from increases in technological development are higher when economic growth occurs at a faster pace, then accelerating&nbsp;growth would bring about negative consequences that could be stronger than the gains.</p><h1>3. Unclear effect of population size on existential risks</h1><p>We consider the effect of existential risks that are not mediated by effects on economic growth. We tentatively argue that changes to population size do not have a clear effect on human resilience to existential catastrophes.</p><p>An implication of Rodriguez\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GsjmufaebreiaivF7/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would\"><u>analysis of civilisational collapse</u></a>&nbsp;is that&nbsp;a higher population can increase our resilience to disasters. If a nuclear war breaks out, the larger the population at the time, (generally) the higher the probability that enough people will survive the catastrophe, enabling a civilisational rebound. However, it seems implausible that this can make population increases cost-effective. We have to compare population growth increases with interventions that directly target ensuring survival in such scenarios, which would likely generate an equivalent benefit for a fraction of the cost.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsq0p0tvxhob\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsq0p0tvxhob\">[37]</a></sup></span></p><p>When it comes to the direct effects of population growth on other existential risks, the direction of the effect is unclear. For some risks concentrated in the upcoming decades, fertility changes would most likely have little effect, because most of the effect would come from additional adults. For global catastrophic biological risks, some factors\u2014higher social contact between humans and higher risk of cross-species disease transmission\u2014increase the&nbsp;risk, and while others\u2014larger expected immune population\u2014decrease it.&nbsp;When it comes to other risks and risk factors, such as great power conflict and authoritarianism, the effects have an unclear sign and high variance. We are unaware of any attempts at modelling or understanding these dynamics.</p><h1>4. The main potential harms of population growth accrue in the short-run</h1><p>So far, we discussed arguments pointing to a positive value of an additional person. One might think such an assumption is not warranted, as there are also negative consequences for bringing people into existence, most importantly climate change and the consumption of animal products. While we agree with these arguments, we do not expect these negative effects to last long enough to make the long-term value of additional lives negative.&nbsp;This assumes population changes have positive long-run effects, which we have been sceptical about in the previous sections.</p><p>Concerning climate change, a greater population could reduce the moral value of life on earth because the pollution emitted by the additional people worsens climate change. However, given the current trends in carbon emissions and policies, we ultimately find this argument unconvincing. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/18BRaXY1kcoWhYcLs698ey5sfzES9Jrbv/view\"><u>Kuruc et al. (in progress)</u></a> estimate that even a reasonably large change in the UN population trajectory would likely have small negative effects on climate.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxouk5um3wq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxouk5um3wq\">[38]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Furthermore, when Kuruc et al. consider the benefits of a larger population in terms of climate change reduction R&amp;D, and find that these benefits seem to outweigh the costs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefupc2p0uh6d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnupc2p0uh6d\">[39]</a></sup></span></p><p>The negative effects of animal consumption alone may arguably make the net effect of additional human lives negative. However, animal consumption most likely will only continue for a couple of centuries, while&nbsp;the benefits of population growth that we consider would purportedly last much longer.&nbsp;For more background on the duration of factory farming, we refer to Dullaghan and Zhang\u2019s discussion of cultivated meat <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/y8jHKDkhPXApHp2gb/cultured-meat-a-comparison-of-techno-economic-analyses\"><u>forecasts</u></a>, Brauner and Grosse-Holz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/the-expected-value-of-extinction-risk-reduction-is-positive\"><u>writeup</u></a>&nbsp;on the long-run value of extinction risk, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Tu49CKohfNZZ33WXp/ama-lewis-bollard-open-philanthropy\"><u>this AMA</u></a>&nbsp;by Lewis Bollard.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>We have considered three ways population increases may benefit the future:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/assessing-the-case-for-population-growth-as-a-priority#1__Population_increases_are_unlikely_to_persist_in_the_long_run\">Increasing the long-run population size</a>,&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/assessing-the-case-for-population-growth-as-a-priority#2__Population_increases_have_a_small_effect_on_economic_growth\">Increasing economic growth, and</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/assessing-the-case-for-population-growth-as-a-priority#3__Unclear_effect_of_population_size_on_existential_risks\">Reducing the probability of existential risks</a>.</li></ol><p><strong>When it comes to changes to long-run population size,</strong>&nbsp;our main argument is that we will likely not depend on biological population growth for very long, as we put 50% credence that artificial people will be developed within this millennium. Even in cases where we still depend on biological population growth on the long-run, higher population growth is unlikely to have substantial effects on long-run population <i>size</i>. Furthermore, expected value considerations indicate that scenarios where population interventions actually increase long-run population size have a much lower potential for value than the other scenarios. Hence, increasing population size may be comparatively less important.&nbsp;Our arguments here rely on very speculative assumptions.</p><p><strong>We consider the effects of a greater population on economic growth</strong>&nbsp;as the main channel through which population size can increase average wellbeing and reduce existential risks. We outline some arguably more cost-effective ways to increase economic growth over the next centuries. Further, we discuss several limitations in the existing arguments that establish the link between economic growth and existential risk, and propose more targeted ways of achieving similar benefits.</p><p><strong>The effect of changes to&nbsp;current population size on increasing probability of survivor after a catastrophe are minor.</strong>&nbsp;We expect interventions that directly target survival after a catastrophe to be much more effective. <strong>The relationship between population and other existential risks&nbsp;is much less clear</strong>, if any, due to the scarcity of previous work on the topic. Changes to population growth&nbsp;will not affect AI risk under short AI timelines and global catastrophic biological risks.</p><p>Lastly, we discussed some potentially harmful effects of a higher population on the world. We argued that the case for larger populations worsening climate change is weak, and the negative animal welfare externality should only last for at most a century.</p><p><strong>In conclusion, we believe that the current case for population growth falls short of the bar needed to consider it a priority. </strong>The arguments discussed above suggest that increasing population growth is beneficial on the margin, but the scale of these benefits does not seem comparable with other areas. That said, we believe that the strongest effect of population growth is on economic growth and population size itself over the next few centuries, as biological population growth might still be important in this timescale.&nbsp;</p><p>The analysis has some noteworthy limitations. First, we ignored issues related to the costs of interventions. We still think that the overall case for population growth as a priority seems weak enough that influencing population growth would have to be outstandingly tractable to change our minds\u2014which could be true for developing countries.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj879cx3jd3m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj879cx3jd3m\">[40]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Second, our analysis of each specific argument was relatively shallow, and a more in-depth analysis of some of these could change our conclusions somewhat.</p><p><strong>The robustness argument: </strong>We argued that population&nbsp;growth falls short of being a cause area assuming the longtermism paradigm. However, one may argue that it looks promising when compared to other longtermist cause areas in a timescale of 200-400 years, and that while each individual pathway to impact is not convincing enough, their combination passes the bar for a priority. A proper assessment of such claims is outside the scope of this report, as it involves a comparison with other cause areas. Nevertheless, we believe there are likely non-population interventions that increase economic&nbsp;growth in the coming centuries and that are more cost-effective. We also expect prima facie that a promising cause area has at least one robust theory of change,&nbsp;rather than several frail ones that add up to a strong thesis.</p><p>The arguments we discussed above suggest various ways in which we could change our minds regarding whether population growth should be a priority. We outline some of these considerations here:</p><ol><li>Evidence that sentient artificial people will not be feasible in the upcoming millennia, or that humanity would never want to create artificial people.</li><li>Evidence that significant population decline is likely to last for many centuries, such as a good model of natural selection for fertility hinting that this process will never succeed to increase fertility above replacement.</li><li>Evidence that population growth is likely to have a particularly large effect on existential risk through a channel other than economic growth.</li></ol><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>We thank Gustav Alexandrie, Isabel Juniewicz, Kevin Kuruc, Eli Lifland, Andreas Mogensen, Jonas Sandbrink, Andreas Schmidt, and Philip Trammell&nbsp;for their comments and useful discussion, and Justis Mills for editing an earlier version.

Any comments, discussion, construction critiques, and/or brainstorming (please note your comments accordingly) of ideas to help increase the amount of donations and funding to the wider EA community down below would be extremely helpful for members of the community who are no doubt looking for ways to tackle this crisis in EA. FTX funds contributed an estimated ~35% of the total EA funding in 2022. Given the distance that we ought to make between EA and FTX given the (highly probable) unethical business practices/lack of integrity FTX was conducting itself with, this crisis in funding needs to be solved by community members bringing novel solutions / or revitalizing older strategies and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of the FTX crisis, EA is facing a major narrowing in available funds.

However, we are a community of people aimed at doing the most good we can, in as skillfully, effectively, and integrity laiden way as we can muster.

In particular, once customer deposits were raided, he may very well have tried to \u201cmake it all back\u201d in increasingly desperate attempts that just dug the hole deeper and deeper ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is one (possible, <em>speculative</em>) intellectual justification for even <em>negative-EV</em> risk-taking: if you think \"making it all back\" is the <em>only</em> way to get acceptable outcomes.

One of my attempts consists in collecting a number of crucial questions (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/double-crux\"><u>cruxes</u></a>), which I believe need to be answered in order to make an informed decision about how to approach nuclear risk mitigation. Among these crucial questions is the following: What can be done to reduce the probability of nuclear war? In this write-up, I first give a brief account of what the crux in question is and then outline different approaches to answering it. For each approach, I seek to summarize the most prominent proponents and critics and point out crucial questions that account for their disagreements (further cruxes). I then describe my attempts to assess the viability and desirability of each approach, explain why I abandoned that quest, and defend my decision to emphasize the deep empirical uncertainty we face in this space instead of giving tentative policy recommendations to favor one or a few of the proposed approaches.</p><h2>Terminology</h2><ul><li>Abbreviations sometimes used throughout the article<ul><li>NWS = nuclear weapons states, i.e. those countries that possess nuclear weapons</li><li>NPT = Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</li></ul></li><li>Definition of terms whose meaning might be unclear<ul><li>I use \u201cpreventing\u201d, \u201chelping prevent\u201d, or \u201creducing the probability of\u201d nuclear war synonymously.</li><li>\u201cUsing\u201d nuclear weapons: this is a broad phrase that refers to any purposive action involving nuclear weapons, which includes using the possession of nuclear weapons as a threat and deterrent</li><li>\u201cDetonating\u201d nuclear weapons: this refers to any detonation of nuclear weapons, including accidental ones and those that happen during tests as these weapons are developed; the phrase by itself does not imply that nuclear weapons are used in an act of war and it says nothing about the place and target of the detonation</li><li>\u201cDeploying\u201d/\u201dEmploying\u201d nuclear weapons: this is the phrase that refers specifically to the purposive detonation of nuclear weapons against an enemy in war.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzxuyhy5imu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzxuyhy5imu\">[1]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkuwbt4c9ql\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkuwbt4c9ql\">[2]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li></ul><h1>What is the crux?</h1><p>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/K7aA9YXRoRQvqjXuq/a-case-against-focusing-on-tail-end-nuclear-war-risks\"><u>different post</u></a>, I make the case for caring about the danger of nuclear war and for working to prevent it<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh8ysunai9sj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh8ysunai9sj\">[3]</a></sup></span>.

This is because these full-fledged strategies unite a number of often implicit assumptions and ideas under one umbrella, which are hard to tease apart and analyze one by one or in conjunction. Furthermore, I fear that it is very easy to miss relevant ideas when picking out a small number of existing approaches to the problem. Another option would be to look at each nuclear-weapons state and figure out what motivates decision-makers in that state to deploy or refrain from deploying nuclear weapons in war. The interest in determinants of \u201cstate behavior\u201d, which underlies this option and is relevant for achieving many high-level outcomes, is listed as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/cruxes-for-nuclear-risk-reduction-efforts-a-proposal#Basic_questions_about_global_politics\"><u>basic/foundational question</u></a> in the overview of cruxes that has resulted from my project; I will thus not go into it here.&nbsp;</p><p>A third way to carve up the debate is by trying to come up with a categorization that captures many of the specific proposals for preventing nuclear war.

Nevertheless, I hope that the categorization I offer here will be a helpful tool for bringing structure and some clarity to debates on how to reduce the probability of nuclear war.</p><h3>Stable &amp; effective deterrence&nbsp;</h3><p>\u201cDeterrence theory refers to the scholarship and practice of how threats or limited force by one party can convince another party to refrain from initiating some other course of action\u201d (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory#Nuclear_deterrence_theory\"><u>Wikipedia</u></a>).&nbsp;<i>Nuclear</i> deterrence theory\u2019s basic theorem holds that nuclear weapons states (NWS) deter each other\u2019s deployment of nuclear weapons through the threat of nuclear retaliation.&nbsp;</p><p>There are multiple different types of deterrence that people have been and are advocating for: major differences revolve around how many states need to possess weapons for deterrence stability to prevail<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb8uwofjbb0n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb8uwofjbb0n\">[8]</a></sup></span>, how large a nuclear arsenal ought to be to constitute a \u201cdeterrence capability\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflgdb62apcun\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlgdb62apcun\">[9]</a></sup></span>, and what the importance of factors aside from the weapons stockpiles is<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftc10zbohxp8\"><sup><a href=\"#fntc10zbohxp8\">[10]</a></sup></span>. There are thus multiple different deterrence concepts, and - as far as I can tell - all of them are contested. I will not list these different concepts nor recount discussions about pros and cons for each here; determining whether and how nuclear deterrence stability should be pursued requires a more thorough analysis in a separate write-up (in other words: this is a crux of its own)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcgf4a4xnl8w\"><sup><a href=\"#fncgf4a4xnl8w\">[11]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the specific concept at issue, however, there exists a more fundamental debate on nuclear deterrence as a strategy to prevent nuclear war. Some people reject this approach outright, for either or several of the following beliefs: 1) nuclear deterrence is not actually what prevents decision-makers from launching nuclear attacks, which is why the strategy is&nbsp;<i>worthless&nbsp;</i>(and dangerous, in as far as it engenders a false sense of security and discourages other approaches to nuclear risk reduction)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref00diqdh1oz9wg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn00diqdh1oz9wg\">[12]</a></sup></span>; 2) nuclear deterrence is fundamentally&nbsp;<i>immoral</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6wotxe5arni\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6wotxe5arni\">[13]</a></sup></span>; and 3) given an irreducible risk of nuclear accidents as well as incomplete rationality on the side of decision-makers in NWS, nuclear deterrence is&nbsp;<i>insufficient&nbsp;</i>to prevent nuclear war<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqgvw6ll7xea\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqgvw6ll7xea\">[14]</a></sup></span>. All of these claims are contested and an assessment of deterrence as a promising strategy would require some resolution or justified stance on these controversies (further cruxes), which I am not capable of producing with any level of seriousness/confidence (without having done a thorough primary-source investigation):</p><ul><li>(How) Does nuclear deterrence prevent decision-makers from launching nuclear attacks?&nbsp;</li><li>How (un-)reliable is nuclear deterrence, especially given human fallibility, and how reliable can it be expected to be over the coming decades?&nbsp;</li><li>How likely is an accident involving nuclear weapons facilities in any given year, and how is that going to change over the next few decades? Are there viable interventions to significantly decrease the likelihood of an accident?</li><li>How is the (im-)morality of nuclear deterrence to be assessed?</li></ul><h3>Norms against nuclear deployment (in its strongest form, the nuclear taboo)</h3><p>Some scholars, especially those of a constructivist bent, have argued that nuclear war is being and has been averted at least in part by norms that discourage leaders of NWS from making (or from seriously contemplating) the decision to deploy nuclear weapons against \u201cenemy\u201d targets . The claim is either that decision-makers feel normative pressure from domestic and/or global public opinion, or that they have internalized these norms themselves, or both.</p><p>Whether norms have any significant effect on how nuclear weapons are used is contested. There is debate on the power and effect of norms on (global) politics in general<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjetd8tswa6n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjetd8tswa6n\">[15]</a></sup></span>. In the nuclear space more specifically, discussions have centered mostly on the so-called nuclear taboo: \u201cThe \u201cnuclear taboo\u201d refers to a powerful&nbsp;<i>de facto</i> prohibition against the first use of nuclear weapons. The taboo is not the behavior (of non-use) itself but rather&nbsp;<i>the normative belief about the behavior</i>\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511491726\"><u>Tannenwald 2007</u></a>, p. 10). While some authors have debated the existence and strength of the nuclear taboo on a general level<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8hqtfjxf6gp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8hqtfjxf6gp\">[16]</a></sup></span>, others decided to break it down into the two major pathways by which norms could affect the decision to (not) deploy nuclear weapons and have argued over the likelihood of those<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefosxukexgbgk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnosxukexgbgk\">[17]</a></sup></span>. Here are the two pathways and the crucial questions to determine to what extent each is active in preventing nuclear war:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Pathway #1: external normative pressure&nbsp;<ul><li>Is there a strong popular norm against deploying nuclear weapons?</li><li>What is the effect of public opinion on decision-making in NWS?</li></ul></li><li>Pathway #2: internal normative motivation<ul><li>Is there a strong norm/aversion against deploying nuclear weapons amongst decision-making elites in NWS?</li><li>What is the effect of personal beliefs, convictions, and intuitions of elite politicians on their decision-making?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Arguably, there are a number of norms aside from the nuclear taboo which could have an effect on whether or not nuclear weapons are deployed: norms about bi- and multilateral relations, about appropriate behavior in conflict and war, and about the role of different institutions for resolving tensions. I am not aware of much literature specifically on these norms and their role in preventing nuclear war, though the volume of publications in this field is rather large and I did not spend much time looking for relevant resources.</p><p>In addition to the above, there is also controversy over how norms on nuclear weapons interact with the other possible strategies to reducing the probability of nuclear war. It seems plausible that these interactions exist and are important, chiefly because norms affect how state officials make their decisions. However, the precise nature of these interactions is not entirely straightforward, both in terms of their direction (do norms increase or decrease the chance that other approaches, such as deterrence or disarmament, succeed?) and their strength (how much do these norms affect the success probabilities of other approaches?).&nbsp;</p><p>As done in the other subsections, I don\u2019t try to resolve these debates and instead note the sub-questions as relevant cruxes that are in need of deeper study (or that cannot be answered well given the available evidence, thus making a confident assessment of the value of this approach difficult).</p><h3>Nuclear safety &amp; security</h3><p>In this write-up, I take nuclear safety to mean that there are no accidental detonations of nuclear weapons nor any technical or human errors that lead to the inadvertent deployment of nuclear weapons against \u201cenemy targets\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjuf2qea8za\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjuf2qea8za\">[18]</a></sup></span>. An example for a technical error would be an incident in 1983, where Soviet \u201csatellites mistook sunlight reflecting off the tops of clouds for missile launches\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/close-calls-nuclear-weapons#ucs-report-downloads\"><u>USC 2015</u></a>), falsely alerting Soviet Lieutenant Stanislov Petrov of an incoming US nuclear attack, which could plausibly have led to nuclear war had the lieutenant in question decided to retaliate instead of waiting for confirmation. The various types of human errors that could increase the probability of nuclear conflict are well outlined in an early Bulletin article by Lloyd Dumas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.1980.11458778\"><u>1980</u></a>): issues of drug abuse and mental illness, erratic or careless behavior due to relative isolation, stress (in some situations) and monotony (in other situations), coordination problems (especially as regards the transmission of information between upper-level and lower-level employees), biases in group decision-making, and the need to react quickly in times of crisis all make an accidental detonation or inadvertent deployment of nuclear weapons more likely. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/resource/nuclear-close-calls-a-timeline/\"><u>list of actual accidents and close calls (Conn 2016)</u></a> reinforces the sense that human fallibility poses a serious danger of nuclear weapons being deployed without full intention at some point in the future. Efforts to improve nuclear safety include technical innovations, but they also encompass policy advocacy, most prominently calls for taking nuclear missiles off hair-trigger alert, such that accidental warnings and similar incidents are less likely to result in nuclear escalation<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjmhmtsgdxtl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjmhmtsgdxtl\">[19]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>By nuclear security, on the other hand, I refer to the prevention of or protection against the theft of nuclear weapons and weapon-relevant material, as well as attacks (physical or cyber) on nuclear weapons systems and facilities by \u201crogue actors\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefevmvujejy1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnevmvujejy1\">[20]</a></sup></span>. Most efforts to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons to North Korea and Iran, and to guard against cyber attacks fall into this category.</p><p>I believe that attempts to increase the safety and security of nuclear weapons and weapons systems is one of the least controversial approaches to reducing the probability of nuclear war. It is criticized mainly for being too moderate, distracting from more radical and more promising approaches. The harshest version of this criticism takes the form of accusations against NWS for being disingenuous and hypocritical in their emphasis on the importance of nuclear security (and, to a lesser extent, safety), while refusing to acknowledge that their insistence on retaining a nuclear weapons arsenal is the larger danger and root cause of the risk<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdpyokid5s3m\"><sup><a href=\"#fndpyokid5s3m\">[21]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>Without going too much into depth on this approach and the debate surrounding it<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefissxuytk6pe\"><sup><a href=\"#fnissxuytk6pe\">[22]</a></sup></span>, I think the questions needed for assessing its value are relatively straightforward:</p><ul><li>How likely is a nuclear accident to lead to nuclear war? / What are risks to nuclear safety?</li><li>How large is the probability of a nuclear accident?</li><li>What, if anything, can be done to reduce the probability of nuclear accidents?</li><li>What, and how large, are risks to nuclear security?&nbsp;<ul><li>How likely are \u201cbad actors\u201d to engage in attacks on nuclear weapons facilities or to try to steal nuclear materials?</li><li>How likely are these efforts by \u201cbad actors\u201d to succeed?</li></ul></li><li>What can be done to mitigate those risks to nuclear security?</li></ul><h3>Security environment (of nuclear-weapons states)</h3><p>The idea that changes in the international/global security environment constitute the most promising path to preventing nuclear war is as old as nuclear weapons themselves<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1xz66jjb97q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1xz66jjb97q\">[23]</a></sup></span>. Discussions throughout the last century have featured unresolved controversies over what kind of changes are desirable (helpful for reducing or eliminating the probability of nuclear war) and over how to pursue those changes. In addition, the literature features competing accounts of how changes to the security environment interact with the other approaches I list here.</p><p>On the last point, some commentators view a changed security environment as a long-term goal and one or several of the other approaches (disarmament, deterrence stability, strengthening norms, ensuring nuclear safety and security) as either a means for getting there or as a short-term fix to survive the interim until desirable changes in the security environment have been achieved. For instance, some nuclear abolitionists argue that \u201cthe commitment to the elimination of nuclear weapons, and the process of elimination, also create enormous opportunities to reach a stable and more cooperative international system\u201d (Payne&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01495939808403130\"><u>1998</u></a>, p. 11) by reducing tensions, hostility, and global injustice. Others, however, emphasize the reverse effect, i.e. the positive impact that changes in the security environment can have on disarmament progress, deterrence stability, the strengthening of favorable norms, and nuclear security. Because of that, some commentators have argued that reforming the global order should be the overarching concern, labeling alternative approaches to preventing nuclear war as unfeasible and/or insufficient, and relegating them to the sidelines<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefohmsqz0zqd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnohmsqz0zqd\">[24]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>As regards the question of what kinds of change are needed to improve the global security environment, perspectives differ widely. On the moderate side stand proposals for reducing and managing inter-state tensions, especially between \u201cgreat powers\u201d, through means such as confidence-building measures, the establishment of permanent communications channels, security guarantees, and certain declaratory policies<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi8z2b4yesk\"><sup><a href=\"#fni8z2b4yesk\">[25]</a></sup></span>. Radicals, on the other hand, call for a fundamental reform (or revolution) of the way global politics is done; ideas in this bucket range from the institution of a world government<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefggl044a1ihj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnggl044a1ihj\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to the rejection of states as the central actors in global affairs and of power politics as the core conceptual framework used for thinking about global challenges (of which the risk from nuclear weapons is one)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8donkojhgjt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8donkojhgjt\">[27]</a></sup></span>.

As before, I explicitly opt against a more in-depth analysis of the approach, being content with having outlined the various different manifestations this approach can take in practice and with having identified sub-questions that merit more sophisticated study.</p><h3>Complete and permanent nuclear disarmament</h3><p>On paper, complete and permanent disarmament is endorsed as the eventual goal by a widespread constituency: it is enshrined in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/\"><u>Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)</u></a>, which was signed by 191 states, including some (US, Russia, China, UK, France) but not all (India, Pakistan, Israel) states currently in possession of nuclear weapons; it is supported by the United Nations<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffjt5ygp18nt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfjt5ygp18nt\">[32]</a></sup></span>; it is championed by many civil society organizations and individuals that take a stance on nuclear issues<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe0rtcgxwyua\"><sup><a href=\"#fne0rtcgxwyua\">[33]</a></sup></span>; and it has found considerable academic support across the last seventy years<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbu9w9915gwj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbu9w9915gwj\">[34]</a></sup></span>. However, there is quite some variation on what kind of disarmament different supporters call for<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsut9jn2ga3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsut9jn2ga3\">[35]</a></sup></span>, what they consider the appropriate path towards a nuclear weapons free world<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefux0gx7qm8wh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnux0gx7qm8wh\">[36]</a></sup></span>, and arguably how serious their calls for eventual disarmament are (skepticism has been particularly high with regards to the proclamations of the NWS).&nbsp;</p><p>Given this diverse constituency, the arguments brought into play in favor of complete and permanent disarmament are quite varied. One strand of reasoning holds that the credible prospect of global nuclear disarmament is needed to&nbsp;<i>avert a world of widespread nuclear proliferation&nbsp;</i>(acquisition and build-up of nuclear weapons arsenals by numerous states). The current nuclear order consisting of some states with and many without atomic weapons is unsustainable, according to this argument, because non-NWS are unlikely to continuously put up with the inherent inequality in that regime<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0u0y1qzntfwm\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0u0y1qzntfwm\">[37]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and will sooner or later take steps to acquire their own arsenals. Add to this the claim that widespread proliferation leads to a higher chance of nuclear accidents as well as of deterrence failure<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3t9mpp16vvy\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3t9mpp16vvy\">[38]</a></sup></span>, thus increasing the likelihood of nuclear war, and you get a logically coherent justification for nuclear disarmament.</p><p>The strength of this first argument depends on answers to the following questions (further cruxes), which I cannot provide with a great level of confidence at this point:</p><ul><li>(How much) Do missing steps towards nuclear disarmament, and a failure of NWS to disarm over the mid- to long-term, encourage other states or non-state actors to obtain nuclear weapons arsenals of their own (horizontal proliferation)?</li><li>(How much) Does horizontal nuclear proliferation increase the probability of nuclear war?</li></ul><p>A second line of reasoning holds that barring eventual complete and permanent disarmament, the risk of nuclear weapons deployment is too high, even if there is no further acquisition of nuclear weapons by states that don\u2019t currently possess them. This is based on the premise that deterrence does not reliably prevent nuclear war and/or that there is a significant chance of a nuclear accident in any given year<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxkamcm4lqh8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxkamcm4lqh8\">[39]</a></sup></span>, which adds up to the conclusion that nuclear war grows more likely the longer nuclear weapons exist&nbsp;<i>(compounding probability across time)&nbsp;</i>and becomes close-to-inevitable eventually<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjwtfs1d75aj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjwtfs1d75aj\">[40]</a></sup></span>. For instance, if the probability of nuclear war due to an accident or due to deterrence failure is around 1.17% per year (a number suggested by an analysis by Rodriguez&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PAYa6on5gJKwAywrF/how-likely-is-a-nuclear-exchange-between-the-us-and-russia-1\"><u>2019</u></a>), it adds up to a 60% chance of nuclear war sometime within one person\u2019s lifetime (assuming 75 years of life expectancy: 1-(1-.0117)^75; calculation taken from Tabarrok&nbsp;<a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/what-is-the-probability-of-a-nuclear-war-redux.html\"><u>2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Once again, acceptance of this justification for disarmament hinges on answers to a few empirical questions:</p><ul><li>How (un-)reliable is nuclear deterrence, especially given human fallibility, and how reliable can it be expected to be over the coming decades?&nbsp;</li><li>How likely is an accident involving nuclear weapons facilities in any given year, and how is that going to change over the next few decades? Are there viable interventions to significantly decrease the likelihood of an accident?&nbsp;</li><li>How likely are changes in the world that will make concerns about deterrence failure and accidents obsolete within the near- to mid-future (such that compounding probabilities are less of an issue)?</li></ul><p>Some proponents of nuclear disarmament take a somewhat different approach to the whole issue, focusing less on the reasons why nuclear weapons deployment is more likely than often assumed and instead arguing that disarmament is a&nbsp;<i>moral and legal duty</i> for NWS. The immortality of the weapons is grounded in the catastrophic effects that they would have if deployed in war, in the oppressive and destabilizing effects they already have on the global order, and in the financial and health costs of their production and maintenance<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref37clsrytdho\"><sup><a href=\"#fn37clsrytdho\">[41]</a></sup></span>. In addition, critics have argued that the idea of nuclear deterrence as a purposive strategy is problematic from a moral and international law perspective, because it is built on \u201ca conditional commitment to a direct attack on millions of noncombatants, a commitment often interpreted by deontologists as a commitment to mass murder\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-philosophy-and-policy/article/immoral-risks-a-deontological-critique-of-nuclear-deterrence/3C7266A3F04C880E5B0A072CB539B301\"><u>Lackey 1985</u></a>, p. 156).</p><p>In addition to these arguments for the need of nuclear disarmament, proponents of this approach also necessarily endorse the following two claims: (1) it is technologically feasible to have a global mechanism for verifiably getting rid of all nuclear weapons and for monitoring that no new ones are being built; and (2) it is politically feasible, or at least can become so at some point, to get rid of all nuclear weapons. As with all the preceding arguments, these questions are contested and no obvious resolutions seem discernable from the literature.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In summary</strong>, then, I have encountered the following set of arguments in favor of pursuing complete and permanent nuclear disarmament as a promising strategy to reduce the probability of nuclear war:</p><ol><li>Lack of nuclear disarmament encourages the acquisition and buildup of weapons arsenal by ever more states (proliferation), which in turn increases the probability of nuclear war.</li><li>As long as nuclear weapons exist, there is a significant chance of nuclear war because deterrence is no guarantor for non-deployment and because nuclear weapons may be set off by accident.</li><li>Nuclear disarmament is a moral and legal imperative.</li><li>Complete and permanent nuclear disarmament is both politically and technologically feasible.</li></ol><p>Support for any of these arguments, and for the different approaches to reduce the probability of nuclear war more generally, hinges on a number of empirical and normative questions (further cruxes). My review of the literature did not reveal any widely-accepted and/or empirically well-supported answers to these questions, which makes me hesitant to conclude anything here. It would strike me as irresponsible and somewhat pointless to cite and compare available pieces of evidence and to draw conclusions based on my cursory look at the topic; instead, I think these questions deserve more scrutiny than I can provide without doing a thoroughgoing primary investigation (to determine whether we have sufficient evidence/reason to give an answer at all and, if so,&nbsp; to identify that answer). I will thus leave them unaddressed - and leave myself and the reader without a strong basis for evaluating the strength of the arguments at issue.

In this section, I will shortly describe my attempts to reduce my skepticism and to come to an informed assessment of different strategies for reducing the probability of nuclear war. I explain my dissatisfaction with each of these strategies, and outline my conclusions for what to do in the face of deep uncertainty:&nbsp;<i><strong>In short, I argue that this is a situation where an empirically grounded assessment of policy recommendations does more harm than good; that scholars, researchers and intellectuals should keep investigating the&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/cruxes-for-nuclear-risk-reduction-efforts-a-proposal#Substantive_cruxes\"><i><strong><u>substantive</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjxkf6w94hdc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjxkf6w94hdc\">[42]</a></sup></span><i><strong>and&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/cruxes-for-nuclear-risk-reduction-efforts-a-proposal#Meta_level_cruxes__methodology_and_epistemology\"><i><strong><u>meta</u></strong></i></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvdgzh0a2i4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvdgzh0a2i4\">[43]</a></sup></span><i><strong>&nbsp;questions raised; that policymaking and public discourse should be informed first and foremost by an awareness of the existing uncertainties; and that the most prudent approach for the time being seems to me to be one which diversifies between different strategies for reducing the probability of nuclear war</strong></i>.</p><h2>My attempts to rank the strategies</h2><p>Okay, let\u2019s start with a short recap of how I went about the assessment task: A first thing to note is that I was unsure about the value of this enterprise from the very start of the fellowship, suspecting that the main value of my research project would be in clarifying relevant questions and outlining possible perspectives on these questions, not in actually resolving the questions and settling on one of the perspectives. This means that I came to the task with a bias towards skepticism, and the fact that my conclusions after ten weeks of working on the topic continue to embody that bias may invite some suspicions about the validity of my reasoning processes<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9guisojw0y5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9guisojw0y5\">[44]</a></sup></span>. My decision for attempting an assessment in spite of my doubts was prompted by conversations I had with my mentor, with the CERI nuclear risk research coordinator, and with other fellows in the program, which alerted me to the merits of formulating concrete policy recommendations if possible and unsettled my conviction that \u201cmerely\u201d highlighting uncertainties and debunking unduly confident beliefs is one of the most valuable things social scientists (can) do.&nbsp;</p><p>I considered a few approaches for assessing the different strategies identified, and took a stab at some of them:</p><ul><li>Red-Teaming: My description of each strategy, and especially the identification of crucial questions to determine the promise of each, embodies some of the elements of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/red-teaming\"><u>Red-Teaming approach</u></a>. I didn\u2019t pursue this in more detail because of (a) the sense that the strategies are too vague and varied to allow for an in-depth critique using Red-Teaming techniques (individual proposals to reduce the probability of nuclear war, such as the specific nuclear doctrine of government X or an action plan submitted by the United Nations at a given point in time, would seem more suited for that); and (b) time constraints (Red-Teaming each strategy would have required substantial time commitments from my side, which I didn\u2019t have or preferred to spend on other tasks).</li><li>Learning by Writing: After I had come up with the categorization of strategies, I briefly resolved to explore my views on how to prioritize between them through a Learning by Writing exercise as outlined by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/learning-by-writing/\"><u>Holden Karnofsky in this blog post (2022)</u></a>. I failed to force myself to settle on a first hypothesis that would single out one of the strategies as the most promising one. Instead, the hours spent on the Learning by Writing exercise devolved into an exploration of the epistemological and moral challenge of dealing with deep uncertainty, resulting in me spending substantial time reading, thinking, and talking about different responses to that challenge. I think that I learned a great deal from that experience, I am still grappling with the challenge and will probably continue to for the foreseeable future, and am kind of glad to have stumbled down that rabbit hole; however, the \u201cbad news\u201d of all that is that I basically aborted the Learning by Writing exercise, failing to follow through on the steps outlined by Karnofsky and ending up without a well-informed hypothesis for how best to help prevent nuclear war.</li><li>Hits-based approach: Another approach I took consists in an analysis of the possible upsides and downsides of each strategy. The idea was that this analysis could unearth some strategies with high potential upsides and low conceivable downsides (or the reverse), which would help filter out promising interventions even when their success probabilities are highly uncertain and/or estimated to be low. However, it turned out that the strategies are all marked by potentially high upsides&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>downsides, such that the hits-based analysis did not seem to justify recommending any one of them over the others.</li><li>Assigning values and probabilities based on my subjective credences (like a good Bayesian?): I considered constructing some model for estimating the promise of each strategy (consisting of the questions I identified as relevant, of the importance-tractability-neglectedness criteria, or of some other set of variables), and populating that model with my best guesses at appropriate probabilities and values. These guesses wouldn\u2019t be completely unfounded, since I did spend some substantial time studying the topic and have seen many bits of seemingly relevant evidence and reasonable arguments, and they could be made more robust through sensitivity analyses. In spite of that, I felt like an utter fraud and like an irresponsible researcher/scholar/intellectual when sitting down to actually come up with those numbers. I did not put down any numbers and aborted the attempt.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>My reasons for refusing to rank the strategies</h2><p>I recognize that my abandonment of the Learning by Writing exercise and of the expected values estimation (based on parameters provided by my subjective credences) is not neatly justified by the account given above. In this section, I try to spell out my reasons for refusing to take a stance and for preferring to highlight and emphasize the extent of our uncertainty instead.</p><p>I believe that researchers can cause significant negative consequences when they support actions in spite of being highly uncertain about those actions\u2019 effects:</p><ol><li>A research report that suggests answers can create a false sense of certainty and thus reduce the perceived need for cautious action, further research, and/or alternative decision-making procedures.</li><li>Research, especially when heavily reliant on intuitions and plausibility judgements, may be systematically biased and may in turn contribute to reinforcing biased and flawed narratives (because research has effects on what is considered/perceived as common-sensical, intuitive, and natural).</li><li>Expert advice is a valuable good in democratic societies, and trust and reliance on expert advice (among elites but especially among the wider public) may be harmed if researchers fail to communicate the level of confidence their findings/guesses ought to inspire.</li></ol><p>Inspired by these concerns, I would argue that there is substantial value in epistemically modest and skeptical scholarship that draws attention to the range of alternative answers to a given question and to the uncertainty we face when forced to decide between these answers. Such scholarship can disrupt the proliferation of bias, discover systematic flaws and distortions in our understanding of social phenomena, and unsettle (over-)confidence. That can push decision-makers to be more critical of their own and of others\u2019 plans for action. In addition, it can facilitate people\u2019s ability to develop an informed opinion on tricky questions. This carries the potential to enrich debates on these tricky questions and to improve a society\u2019s ability to respond \u201cwisely\u201d to uncertain situations.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668600555/mirroredImages/JDi9MGdKkuT3PbiSc/cgxmbigkmhmftyugwiuz.png\"><figcaption><i>Figure 2: An illustration of the value of critical/deconstructionist scholarship.</i></figcaption></figure><p>In short, I believe in the value of critical scholarship that emphasizes uncertainty and deconstructs epistemically shaky knowledge claims; I think that it is that belief which caused me to rebel against rank-ordering the different strategies to prevent nuclear war in this research project, and to insist on the lack of a sufficiently strong evidential or theoretical basis to underpin such a ranking.</p><h2>My alternative recommendation: More research, and a diversification in strategies&nbsp;</h2><p>Given the above, I conclude by recommending a multi-pronged approach to reducing the probability of nuclear war. This means that I would caution against elevating one of the goals to be the sole priority, and against discouraging people and organizations from pursuing any one of them. Instead, I think that efforts on each goal should continue at least in some capacity, and that further research is sorely needed, especially regarding how the different goals affect each other (e.g., do attempts to stabilize deterrence weaken or strengthen norms against nuclear weapons deployment?), whether there are strong reasons&nbsp;<i>against</i> pursuing any one of the goals (e.g., because there is good reason to believe that it may actually increase the probability of nuclear war, or because there is good reason to believe that it is unattainable), and how each goal can be pursued most effectively (e.g., what is a promising path towards disarmament and which steps/interventions advance that path?). On top of that, I advocate for critical research that is primarily aimed at spotting weaknesses and biases in prominent arguments and policy recommendations in the field.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Other pieces I wrote on this topic</h1><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvS-hmI18zwU7wQZCk5fvIwCsCVuYIVVUvod80B_ITs/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Disentanglement of nuclear security cause area_2022_Weiler</u></a>: written prior to CERI, as part of a part-time and remote research fellowship in spring 2022)</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/cruxes-for-nuclear-risk-reduction-efforts-a-proposal\"><u>Cruxes for nuclear risk reduction efforts: A proposal</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/K7aA9YXRoRQvqjXuq/a-case-against-focusing-on-tail-end-nuclear-war-risks\"><u>A case against focusing on tail-end nuclear war risks</u></a></li><li>List of useful resources for learning about nuclear risk reduction efforts: This is a work-in-progress; if I ever manage to compile a decent list of resources, I will insert a link here.</li><li>How to decide and act in the face of deep uncertainty?: This is a work-in-progress; if I ever manage to bring my thoughts on this thorny question into a coherent write-up, I will insert a link here.</li></ul><h1>References</h1><p>Atkinson, Carol. 2010. \u201cUsing nuclear weapons.\u201d&nbsp;<i>Review of International Studies</i>, 36(4), 839-851. doi:10.1017/S0260210510001312&nbsp;</p><p>Ban, Ki-Moon. 2008. \u201cThe United Nations and Security in a Nuclear Weapons-Free World.\u201d A speech delivered by the Secretary-General to the East-West Institute, published on the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation\u2019s website, October 24.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wagingpeace.org/the-united-nations-and-security-in-a-nuclear-weapons-free-world/\"><u>https://www.wagingpeace.org/the-united-nations-and-security-in-a-nuclear-weapons-free-world/</u></a>.</p><p>Brito, Dagobert L., and Michael D.

One of the cruxes I identified was about the \u201chigh-level outcomes\u201d that people interested in nuclear risk reduction might aim for. I came up with a list of the nuclear-related outcomes that I think could conceivably constitute a high-level goal (it is likely that this list is incomplete and I welcome suggestions for additional items to put on it).

In conversations with others at the fellowship, I encountered the view<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxdx91pq787\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxdx91pq787\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that nuclear weapons are relevant to a committed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/longtermism\"><u>longtermist</u></a> only insofar as they constitute an existential risk, and that only certain kinds of nuclear conflict fulfill that criterion, which is why work to reduce nuclear risk (in the EA community) should mainly be targeted at addressing the danger of these \"tail-end outcomes\" (i.e., the worst kinds of nuclear war, which may cause nuclear winter). I felt quite concerned by this stance and what I perceive to be its fragile foundations and dangerous implications. In particular, I was shaken by the claim that \"small-scale nuclear conflict essentially doesn't matter to us\". This essay is an attempt to spell out my disagreements with and concerns about this view<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuuy7m8suime\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuuy7m8suime\">[2]</a></sup></span>, and to make the case that preventing any kind of nuclear war should be a core priority for effective altruists (or longtermists) seeking to work on nuclear risk reduction.</p><h2>Terminology</h2><ul><li>\u201cUsing\u201d nuclear weapons: this is a broad phrase that refers to any purposive action involving nuclear weapons, which includes using the possession of nuclear weapons as a threat and deterrent</li><li>\u201cDetonating\u201d nuclear weapons: this refers to any detonation of nuclear weapons, including accidental ones and those that happen during tests as these weapons are developed; the phrase by itself does not imply that nuclear weapons are used in an act of war and it says nothing about the place and target of the detonation</li><li>\u201cDeploying\u201d/\u201dEmploying\u201d nuclear weapons: this is the phrase that refers specifically to the purposive detonation of nuclear weapons against an enemy in war.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkt3l2ikjcv9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkt3l2ikjcv9\">[3]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoysbrhg85va\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoysbrhg85va\">[4]</a></sup></span></li></ul><h1>Spelling out the argument</h1><p>The main thrust of my argument is that I contest the viability/feasibility of present-day attempts to either prevent cascading consequences of the one-time deployment of nuclear weapons or to prepare for those consequences. Because of this,&nbsp;<strong>I argue that it is dangerously overconfident to focus on those two outcomes (preventing the worst case; preparing for the world after) while deprioritizing the goal of preventing any kind of nuclear war</strong>. I point to the unpredictable consequences of a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons, and to the potentially far-reaching damage/risk they may bring, to assert that \"small-scale\" nuclear conflict does matter from a longtermist perspective (as well as from many other ethical perspectives).</p><p>Below, I spell out my argument by breaking it up into three separate reasons, which together motivate my conclusion regarding which high-level outcome to prioritize in the nuclear risk reduction space.</p><h2>Reason 1: The possible consequences of a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons are potentially catastrophic</h2><p>While I would argue that the sheer destruction wrought by the detonation of a single nuclear weapon is sufficient grounds for caring about the risk and for making the choice to attempt to reduce it<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaf5ncpwl3pj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaf5ncpwl3pj\">[5]</a></sup></span>, I understand and accept that this is less obvious when taking on a scope sensitive moral perspective (such as total utilitarianism), which recognizes/assumes that there are many incredibly important problems and risks in the world, that we cannot fix all of them at once, and that this obliges us to prioritize based on just how large the risk posed by each problem is (and on how good our chances to reduce it are). I will here make the case that the consequences of a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons are large enough in expectation to warrant the attention of a cause prioritizing consequentialist, especially if that consequentialist accepts the ethical argument of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/longtermism\"><u>longtermism</u></a>. I assume that such a (longtermist) consequentialist considers a problem sufficiently important if it contributes significantly to existential risks<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd4yg9iqaubr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd4yg9iqaubr\">[6]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>There are several plausible ways in which a one-time use of nuclear weapons can precipitate existential risk:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Escalation / Failure at containing nuclear war<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6qbznnkftby\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6qbznnkftby\">[7]</a></sup></span><ul><li>A relatively immediate consequence of a first deployment of nuclear weapons, or of a \"small-scale\" nuclear conflict, is that it can escalate into a larger exchange of attacks, with no obvious or foolproof stopping point.&nbsp;</li><li>The first deployment of nuclear weapons can also lead to large-scale nuclear war more indirectly, by setting a precedent, weakening strong normative anti-use inhibitions among decision-makers, and thus making the use of these weapons in future conflicts more likely.</li><li>In either case, a first deployment of nuclear weapons would then be a significant causal factor for larger-scale deployment, as such contributing to the risk of nuclear winter (which in itself has some chance of constituting an existential catastrophe<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuhf3jcm9pgh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuhf3jcm9pgh\">[8]</a></sup></span>).</li></ul></li><li>Civilizational collapse<ul><li>The one-time deployment of nuclear weapons could severely upset norms against violence in the global system (and/or in specific localities).&nbsp;</li><li>It could thus be a significant causal factor in increasing the incidence and severity of violent conflict globally.</li><li>In a worst case scenario, such conflict could occur at a scale that induces civilizational collapse even if no further nuclear weapons are deployed.</li></ul></li><li>Societal vulnerability<ul><li>The one-time deployment of nuclear weapons would plausibly lead to political, economic, social, and cultural/normative shocks that could cause turmoil, instability, and a breakdown/weakening of societies' abilities to deal with, prepare for, and respond to pressing and longterm challenges (such as run-away climate change, the development and control of dangerous technologies, etc).</li><li>One more specific example/scenario of these effects would be<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx7gezot1mh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx7gezot1mh\">[9]</a></sup></span>: The one-time deployment of nuclear weapons makes people more suspicious and distrusting of other countries and of efforts for bi- and multilateral cooperation, thus exacerbating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/great-power-conflict\"><u>great power conflict</u></a>, fueling technological arms race dynamics, decreasing the chance that revolutionary tech like AGI/TAI is developed safely, and increasing the chance of destructive conflict over the appropriation and use of such tech.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Reason 2: It seems virtually impossible to put a likelihood on any of these consequences, or on the chance that interventions taken today to prevent or prepare for them succeed</h2><p>How would a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons today influence state leaders' decisions to acquire, modernize, and use nuclear weapons in the future? Would it lead to an immediate retaliation and escalation, or would there be restraint? Would the vivid demonstration of these weapons' destructive power reinforce emotions, norms, and reasons that deter from their use in war, or would the precedent break a taboo that has hencetoforth prevented the intentional deployment of nuclear weapons? How would such an event impact deterrence dynamics (incl. the credibility of retaliatory threats, a trust in each party's rational choice to avoid MAD, etc)? How would it impact proliferation aspirations by current non-nuclear weapons states?&nbsp;</p><p>How would a deployment of nuclear weapons influence the current global order, the relations and interactions between nation-states and non-state actors, and the global economy? How would it affect cultural norms and values, as well as social movements and civil society across the world? How would all this impact on efforts to tackle global challenges and risks? How would it impact the global as well as several regional communities' resilience and ability to respond to crises?&nbsp;</p><p>I consider these questions impossible to answer with any degree of certainty. Why? Because we have close to no relevant empirical data to infer the probability of different consequences of a one-time nuclear deployment, nor can these probabilities be derived logically from some reliable higher-order principles/theories.&nbsp;</p><p>Statements about the causal effects of interventions face similarly severe challenges: Even if we were able to make a decent guess at what the world after a one-time deployment of nuclear weapons would look like, I don't think we have much data or understanding to inform decisions meant to prepare for such a world. In addition, such preparatory or preventive interventions can't be assessed while or after they are implemented, since there is no feedback that would give us a sense of how effective the interventions are.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi62ehhduqv9\"><sup><a href=\"#fni62ehhduqv9\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Reason 3: De-emphasizing the goal of preventing any nuclear war plausibly has adverse effects</h2><p>I'm thinking about two channels through which a focus on the tail-ends of nuclear war risk can have the adverse effect of making the deployment of nuclear weapons more likely: opportunity costs, and a weakening of the normative taboo against nuclear weapons employment. In an expansion of the latter point, I'm also concerned about the more general desensitizing effect that such a focus can bring.</p><h3>Opportunity costs</h3><p>The first channel is probably obvious and doesn't require much additional explanation. If resources (time, political capital, money) are spent narrowly on preventing or preparing for the worst-case outcome of a nuclear conflict, those same resources cannot be spent on reducing the probability of nuclear war per se<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefba7s5ewrwif\"><sup><a href=\"#fnba7s5ewrwif\">[11]</a></sup></span>. Given that the resources to address nuclear risks are seriously limited in our present world (especially after the decision by one of the biggest funders in this space, the MacArthur Foundation, to phase out its support by the end of 2023; see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2021-07-20/blow-efforts-reduce-nuclear-risks\"><u>Kimball 2021</u></a>), such diversion of available means would arguably be quite significant and could seriously impact our overall efforts to prevent nuclear war.</p><h3>Weakening of the nuclear taboo</h3><p>The second channel is a little less direct and requires acceptance of a few assumptions:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>First, that \"nuclear war is being and has been averted at least in part by norms that discourage leaders of nuclear weapons states from making (or from seriously contemplating) the decision to use nuclear weapons against 'enemy' targets, [...] either [because] decision-makers feel normative pressure from domestic and/or global public opinion, or [because] they have internalized these norms themselves, or both.\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4iz2frwkaq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4iz2frwkaq\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>Second, that these norms are affected by the way in which authoritative voices talk about nuclear weapons, and that they are weakened when authoritative voices start to use diminutive language to describe some forms of nuclear war (describing them as minor, small-scale, or limited) as well as when they rank different types of nuclear war and downplay the danger of some types by contrasting their expected cost with the catastrophic consequences of the worst-case outcomes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4i7y7hj2uv7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4i7y7hj2uv7\">[13]</a></sup></span></li><li>Third, that the discourse of the policy research community is an authoritative voice in this space<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4jgve882a6p\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4jgve882a6p\">[14]</a></sup></span>, and&nbsp;</li><li>fourth, that effective altruists and effective altruist organizations can contribute to and shape this authoritative discourse.</li></ul><p>What follows from these assumptions is that research that makes the case for prioritizing worst-case outcomes (by \"demonstrating\" how working on them is orders of magnitude more important than working on \"smaller nuclear war issues\") could have the unintended negative side effect of increasing the probability of a nuclear first strike, because such research could weaken normative barriers to the deployment of nuclear weapons.</p><h3>Desensitizing effect</h3><p>In addition to the concern that focusing on worst case outcomes can end up increasing nuclear war risk (by increasing the probability of weapons deployment), I am worried that such a focus, and the language surrounding it, has a morally desensitizing effect. I feel a stark sense of unease (or, at times, terror) when I hear people talk nonchalantly about \u201cunimportant small-scale nuclear war\u201d or, to name a more specific example, \u201cthe likely irrelevance of India-Pakistan war scenarios\u201d, when I read long articles that calculate the probability for different death counts in the event of nuclear escalation with the explicit intention of figuring out whether this is a risk worthy of our attention, or when I listen in on discussions about which conditions would make the deployment of nuclear weapons a \u201crational choice\u201d. These experiences set off bright warning lights before my inner eye, and I feel strongly compelled to speak out against the use and promulgation of the types of arguments and reasoning just listed.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe the reason for this intuitive response is that I\u2019ve been taught - mostly implicitly, through the culture and art I encountered while growing up in a progressive, educated slice of Austrian society - that it is this kind of careless, trivializing language, and a collective failure to stand up and speak out against it, that have preceded and (at least partially) enabled the worst kinds of mass atrocity in history? I don\u2019t have full clarity on my own views here; I find myself unable to pin down what I believe the size and probability of the problem (the desensitizing effect of this type of speech) to be; nor can I meticulously trace where my worry comes from and which sources, arguments, and evidence it is informed by. For the last months (all throughout and after the summer fellowship), I\u2019ve been trying to get a better understanding of what I think and to mold my opposition into a watertight or at least comprehensible argument, and I largely failed. And yet - I continue to believe fairly strongly that there is harm and danger in the attitudes and conversations I witnessed. I\u2019m not asking anyone to defer to that intuitive belief, of course; what I ask you to do is to reflect on the feelings I describe, and I\u2019d also encourage you to not be instantly dismissive if you share similar concerns without being able to back them up with a rational argument.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if you think the last paragraph betrays some failing of my commitment to rational argument and reason, I hope that it doesn\u2019t invalidate the entire post for you. Though I personally assign substantial weight to the costs (and risks) of \u201cmoral numbing\u201d, I think that the overall case I make in this essay remains standing if you entirely discard the part about \u201cdesensitizing effects\u201d.&nbsp;</p><h1>Other pieces I wrote on this topic</h1><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvS-hmI18zwU7wQZCk5fvIwCsCVuYIVVUvod80B_ITs/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Disentanglement of nuclear security cause area_2022_Weiler</u></a>: written prior to CERI, as part of a part-time and remote research fellowship in spring 2022)</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/cruxes-for-nuclear-risk-reduction-efforts-a-proposal\"><u>Cruxes for nuclear risk reduction efforts - A proposal</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JDi9MGdKkuT3PbiSc/what-are-the-most-promising-strategies-for-reducing-the\"><u>What are the most promising strategies for preventing nuclear war?</u></a></li><li>List of useful resources for learning about nuclear risk reduction efforts: This is a work-in-progress; if I ever manage to compile a decent list of resources, I will insert a link here.</li><li>How to decide and act in the face of deep uncertainty?: This is a work-in-progress; if I ever manage to bring my thoughts on this thorny question into a coherent write-up, I will insert a link here.</li></ul><h1>References</h1><p>Atkinson, Carol. 2010. \u201cUsing nuclear weapons.\u201d&nbsp;<i>Review of International Studies</i>, 36(4), 839-851. doi:10.1017/S0260210510001312.</p><p>Bostrom, Nick. 2013. \u201cExistential Risk Prevention as Global Priority.\u201d&nbsp;<i>Global Policy</i> 4 (1): 15\u201331.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12002\"><u>https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12002</u></a>.</p><p>CERI, (Cambridge Existential Risk Initiative). 2022. \u201cCERI Fellowship.\u201d CERI. 2022.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cerifellowship.org/\"><u>https://www.cerifellowship.org/</u></a>.</p><p>Clare, Stephen. 2022. \u201cModelling Great Power conflict as an existential risk factor\u201d, subsection: \u201cWill future weapons be even worse?\u201d&nbsp;<i>EA Forum</i>, February 3.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mBM4y2CjfYef4DGcd/modelling-great-power-conflict-as-an-existential-risk-factor#Will_future_weapons_be_even_worse_\"><u>https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mBM4y2CjfYef4DGcd/modelling-great-power-conflict-as-an-existential-risk-factor#Will_future_weapons_be_even_worse_</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Cohn, Carol. 1987. \u201cSex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals.\u201d&nbsp;<i>Signs</i> 12 (4): 687-718.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174209\"><u>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174209</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>EA Forum. n.d. \u201cDisentanglement Research.\u201d In&nbsp;<i>Effective Altruism Forum</i>.

However, I would argue that interventions to reduce the likelihood of any nuclear war are at least somewhat more tractable than those that aim to foresee and prepare for the consequences of nuclear weapons deployment. This is because the former at least have the present world - which we have some evidence and familiarty with - as their starting point, whereas the latter attempt to intervene in a world which is plausibly significantly different from the one we inhabit today. In other words: The knowledge that would be relevant for figuring out how to prevent the worst kinds of nuclear war, or to prepare for a post-nuclear war world, is particularly unattainable to us at the present moment, simply because we have so little experience with events that could give us insights into what the consequences of a break in the nuclear taboo would be.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnba7s5ewrwif\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefba7s5ewrwif\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Unless reducing the probability of any kind of nuclear war is viewed as the best available means for preventing or preparing for the worst-case outcome, which is what I argue for in this essay.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4iz2frwkaq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4iz2frwkaq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I put this in quotation marks because the lines are copied directly from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JDi9MGdKkuT3PbiSc/what-are-the-most-promising-strategies-for-reducing-the\"><u>this investigative report I wrote on reducing the probability of nuclear war</u></a> (in other words, I\u2019m shamelessly quoting myself here).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4i7y7hj2uv7\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4i7y7hj2uv7\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;For a more extensive discussion and defense of the claim that language affects nuclear policy, I point the reader to the literature of \u201cnukespeak\u201d.

Perhaps you work for a cultured meat company, and so buy meat from an animal to compare it to your products. Or maybe you fly to a conference, releasing greenhouse gases and spending money on travel/housing, when that money could be spent in better ways. Whatever it is, there's a common response to such behaviors: offsetting.&nbsp;</p><p>Offsetting often takes the following form: you spend money on something harmful, so you spend the same amount of money on a charity combatting said harm. Much of the time, when people talk about offsetting, they see it as a form of absolution, repentance, etc. \"It's undoing the harm I caused.\" &nbsp;But is this really the case? I think not.</p><p>The money you donated to charity, in offsetting, could've been donated regardless of the initial harm. Thus, it's plausible that you should've donated said money, even if you didn't perform this harm. The harm isn't 'undone' or 'cancelled out of existence' by your offset. It happened, it's done, there's nothing you can do about it. While it's true that a donation can do an equivalent amount of good to your harm, but wouldn't it have been better to do that good without the preceding harm?</p><p>It's not my intention to tell people not to offset: I'd rather you offset than not. Rather, I want people to change the way they think about offsetting. If you can already afford to donate that extra bit of money, then donate it. And if you're unsure about doing something wrong for the greater good, don't let the thought of offsetting bring you too much comfort. You're still enacting harm in the world. Sometimes we need to do something bad, I won't deny it. But there exists a threshold for how bad a thing we should do for the greater good, and offsetting shouldn't encourage us to raise that threshold.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Yair Atlas"}}, {"_id": "YAsJCsvi4tBpCwuFB", "title": "Why didn't the FTX Foundation secure its bag?", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T19:54:52.061Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>\u201cAsked whether he had set up any kind of endowment for his giving, Mr. Bankman-Fried said in the Times interview last month: \u201cIt\u2019s more of a pay-as-we-go thing, and the reason for that, frankly, is I\u2019m not liquid enough for it to make sense to do an endowment right now.\u201d\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/business/ftx-effective-altruism.html\"><u>Source</u></a> (<a href=\"https://archive.ph/yTkIK\"><u>a</u></a>))</p><p>Quite apart from the fact that in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ftx-crisis\"><u>hindsight</u></a>, the above quote should\u2019ve been ringing alarm bells<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzm2tsimbmdm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzm2tsimbmdm\">[1]</a></sup></span>, I think a big lesson here is that foundations should \"secure their bags\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefniyfwgu0g09\"><sup><a href=\"#fnniyfwgu0g09\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2013 aka secure assets/their endowment \u2013 early.

I took several stabs at the problem, and this is my latest attempt to make progress on this disentanglement goal.&nbsp;</p><h2>My previous attempts to disentangle nuclear risk</h2><p>While I had some exposure to nuclear affairs during my studies of global politics at uni (i.e., at least since 2018) and have been reading about the topic throughout the last few years, I\u2019ve been engaging with the topic more seriously only since the beginning of this year (2022), when I did a part-time research fellowship in which I decided to focus on nuclear risks. For that fellowship, I started by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvS-hmI18zwU7wQZCk5fvIwCsCVuYIVVUvod80B_ITs/edit#heading=h.e8eoqsnh71zk\"><u>brainstorming my thoughts and uncertainties</u></a> about nuclear risk as a problem area that I might want to work on (resulting in a list of questions and my preliminary thoughts on them), did a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvS-hmI18zwU7wQZCk5fvIwCsCVuYIVVUvod80B_ITs/edit#heading=h.bzn9ke34gog9\"><u>limited survey of the academic literature</u></a> on different intellectual approaches to the topic of nuclear weapons, and conducted a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvS-hmI18zwU7wQZCk5fvIwCsCVuYIVVUvod80B_ITs/edit#heading=h.2z9vx4zeqdet\"><u>small-scale empirical investigation</u></a> into how three different non-profits in the nuclear risk field (the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nti.org/\"><u>Nuclear Threat Initiative</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.icanw.org/\"><u>International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons</u></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rand.org/\"><u>RAND Corporation</u></a>) conceptualize and justify their work on nuclear risk (resulting in a sketch of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/theory-of-change\"><u>theory of change</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefat9m54vtfc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnat9m54vtfc\">[2]</a></sup></span><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/theory-of-change\"><u>.</u></a> of each organization, constructed based on the information they provide on their websites).</p><p>During ten weeks over this summer (Jul-Sep 2022), my participation in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cerifellowship.org/\"><u>Cambridge Existential Risk Initiative</u></a> \u2014 a full-time, paid and mentored research fellowship \u2014 has allowed me to dedicate more time to this project and to test out a few more approaches to understanding the nuclear risk field. I spent around three weeks with the goal of&nbsp;compiling a list of organizations working on nuclear risk issues, collecting information on their self-described&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/theory-of-change\"><u>theory of change</u></a>, and categorizing the organizations in a broad typology of \u201capproaches to nuclear risk mitigation\u201d. While I learned quite a bit about different ways of thinking about (and working on) nuclear affairs in that process, I ended up deciding against pursuing this specific project for the rest of the summer fellowship, because I got the sense that it wasn\u2019t an optimal approach for obtaining a better understanding of the nuclear risk reduction field<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0phe07pbo72r\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0phe07pbo72r\">[3]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>After some time spent trying to construct&nbsp;a network-like graph to interlink different possible goals for nuclear risk reduction work (possibly similar to attempts in the field of artificial intelligence research, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/aERZoriyHfCqvWkzg/p/qnA6paRwMky3Q6ktk\"><u>Manheim and Englander 2021 (AI Alignment Forum)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xTkejiJHFsidZ9hMo/p/isTXkKprgHh5j8WQr\"><u>MMMaas 2022 (EA Forum)</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/63stBTw3WAW6k45dY/paul-christiano-current-work-in-ai-alignment\"><u>Christiano 2020 (EAG talk)</u></a>), reading widely and reconsidering my goal and thoughts for how to get there, I have now arrived at the question-focused approach presented in this document (justification follows below).&nbsp;</p><h2>What others have done</h2><p>Attempts to introduce and give an overview of debates and different views on nuclear weapons are surprisingly hard to find (or I\u2019m just bad at looking for them; please do comment if you think I missed something obvious that renders my project obsolete/redundant). The closest I have come across&nbsp;<strong>in academic or popular publishing&nbsp;</strong>are&nbsp;</p><ul><li>empirical studies on the attitudes of the general population (e.g., see this special journal issue on \u201cImages of Nuclear War\u201d:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1983.tb00126.x\"><u>Fiske et al 1983</u></a>, or this study of predictors for attitudes towards deterrence and disarmament:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00440.x\"><u>Axelrod and Newton 1991</u></a>),&nbsp;</li><li>studies that trace the doctrine and policymaking debates in individual nuclear weapons states (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0020881700037004001\"><u>Bajpai 2000</u></a> on different views regarding the acquisition of nuclear weapons in India, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/auk-1987-1-201\"><u>Lackey 1987</u></a> on the debate about the value and costs of nuclear weapons in the United States) or in other countries (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10357718.2010.489994\"><u>Leah and Lyon 2010</u></a> who analyze the debate in Australia), and&nbsp;</li><li>reports that outline one or a small set of strategies (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unidir.org/publication/nuclear-risk-reduction-framework-analysis\"><u>Wan 2019</u></a>, a recent UNIDIR investigation which uses different scenarios that could lead to nuclear war to construct a framework for thinking about risk reduction), or analyses that seek to evaluate past attempts to reduce nuclear risk (e.g., the \u201cNuclear Challenges Big Bet: 2020 Evaluation Report\u201d commissioned by the MacArthur Foundation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macfound.org/press/evaluation/nuclear-challenges-big-bet-2020-evaluation-report\"><u>(Gienapp et al. 2021)</u></a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While these works give some insights into different efforts for how to work on nuclear risk reduction, they don\u2019t aim for a comprehensive overview of existing ideas (instead focusing on different subsets thereof). I thus believe and argue that, in the traditional nuclear studies field, there is a serious lack of thorough and accessible resources for managing, organizing and sharing/diffusing existing knowledge, understanding and arguments.</p><p><strong>Within the effective altruism community</strong>, there are a number of write-ups introducing the nuclear risk problem area and giving some tentative takes on how to address the issue:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>OpenPhil produced a shallow investigation on nuclear weapons policy in 2015 with a section specifically on \u201cWhat are possible interventions?\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/nuclear-weapons-policy/#Who_else_is_working_on_this\"><u>OpenPhilanthropy 2015</u></a>).</li><li>80,000 Hours has a problem profile on the topic with an extensive section on \u201cWhat can you do about this problem?\u201d (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/#what-can-you-do-about-this-problem\"><u>Hilton and McIntyre 2022</u></a>).</li><li>There is a chapter on nuclear weapons in&nbsp;<i>The Precipice</i> (Ord 2020) with a high-level discussion on nuclear weapons\u2019 contribution to existential risks and the value of working on this problem.</li><li>Rethink Priorities has published a number of posts on the topic (see this series on the EA Forum:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk\"><u>Aird 2021a</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li>What might come closest to my aspirations for this disentanglement challenge are the following works by Michael Aird (a researcher at Rethink Priorities): a categorization of views on nuclear risks and what to do about them (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/z3BNer81wHM\"><u>Aird 2021b</u></a>), and a shallow review of approaches to reducing risks from nuclear weapons (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQgYUoN270weTRBqqLrCnEKLafq8Xq4ZPdYL0kPHROQ/edit\"><u>Aird 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While these resources have been very helpful to me in generating ideas and spurring my intuitions, I didn\u2019t think that they were quite the thing that I envisioned as a resource to organize and optimally draw from the existing knowledge base on nuclear issues (mainly because these write-ups do not contain a thorough overview of and engagement with the nuclear issues literature and mainstream debate).</p><p>In addition to the above, there are some&nbsp;<strong>(EA-aligned) research projects and methodological commentaries outside the nuclear risk field&nbsp;</strong>that resemble my goal and which I have drawn on for inspiration and methodological insight:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Luke Muehlhauser\u2019s \u201cTips for conducting worldview investigations\u201d (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vcjLwqLDqNEmvewHY/tips-for-conducting-worldview-investigations\"><u>Muehlhauser 2022</u></a>) and Holden Karnofsky\u2019s blog posts on \u201cWicked problems\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/the-wicked-problem-experience/\"><u>Karnofsky 2022b</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/useful-vices-for-wicked-problems/\"><u>Karnofsky 2022c</u></a>, and also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/learning-by-writing/#i-hope-i-havent-made-this-sound-fun-or-easy\"><u>Karnofsky 2022a</u></a>) as helpful for navigating the challenging and often confusing/frustrating task I set myself</li><li>An EA Forum post on strategy research (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oovy5XXdCL3TPwgLE/a-case-for-strategy-research-what-it-is-and-why-we-need-more\"><u>Rozendal, Shovelain and Kristoffersson 2019</u></a>) and another one proposing the concept of \u201cepistemic maps\u201d (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/s33LLoR6vbwiyRpTm/epistemic-maps-for-ai-debates-or-for-other-issues\"><u>Durland 2021</u></a>) as sources for methodological ideas</li><li>Attempts to disentangle and organize debates and thinking around the risks from artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/aERZoriyHfCqvWkzg/p/qnA6paRwMky3Q6ktk\"><u>Manheim and Englander 2021 (AI Alignment Forum)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xTkejiJHFsidZ9hMo/p/isTXkKprgHh5j8WQr\"><u>MMMaas 2022 (EA Forum)</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/63stBTw3WAW6k45dY/paul-christiano-current-work-in-ai-alignment\"><u>Christiano 2020 (EAG talk)</u></a>) as sources of inspiration and for emulation</li></ul><h2>Value proposition: Why focus on identifying cruxes?</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668579115/mirroredImages/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/am00kyxsdrl9qka794sk.png\"><figcaption><i>Figure 2: Theory of Change for this disentanglement project. I converted the font for two of the rectangles to white in retrospect to signal that I did&nbsp;</i>not<i> successfully implement these steps.</i></figcaption></figure><p>My rationale for this project is as follows: Ever since the invention of the atomic bomb in the 1940s (and arguably even before that, if fictional and/or futuristic contributions to the literature are counted<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjcqrsdrlqb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjcqrsdrlqb\">[4]</a></sup></span>), the consequences of that new weapon and the question of how to deal with these consequences have been explored in debates between academics, public intellectuals, elite decision-makers, civil society activists, and the public at large (for an analysis of this early debate, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-26688-2_2\"><u>Sylvest 2020</u></a>). This means that there now exists a vast body of literature on nuclear weapons, which may contain some valuable insights to inform our present-day thinking but which can also easily confuse and overwhelm those that seek to learn from prior debates. I have the impression that there is little consensus in the literature on nuclear weapons about what the major risks are and even less about how those risks could possibly be mitigated<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqlnyx2pkim\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqlnyx2pkim\">[5]</a></sup></span>. As a result, people who want to learn from prior work on the topic need to engage with it in some depth, since there are no obvious insights or consensus views to simply adopt on the basis of trust in the academic community<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgvnk9eqlgrs\"><sup><a href=\"#fngvnk9eqlgrs\">[6]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, however, I think that engaging with the literature effectively is very difficult: It seems impossible to read everything that has been written on the topic, and I don\u2019t think there is an obvious structure or a straightforward procedure for identifying the most important strands/arguments/texts to get an overview and a good idea of what the core disagreements (and competing positions) are.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where my project comes in. My attempts to grapple with the nuclear risk field have led me to believe that a list of crucial questions can be used to break down the broader puzzle of \u201cWhat can be done to mitigate nuclear risks?\u201d. I hope that this will result in a useful means to structure the debate on nuclear issues and to highlight relevant considerations for deciding how to work on this problem. More concretely, I envision several ways in which the list of questions can be helpful:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>People or groups that want to contribute to risk reduction efforts (through their own work or financial support) can go through the questions, figure out their own current best guess at an answer to each, and use that to choose the specific actions they think are worthwhile.</li><li>People or groups that want to improve their understanding of nuclear issues (and want to contribute to ongoing intellectual debates) can use the questions as an organizing device to navigate the existing literature/debate.</li><li>The list is also meant to highlight open questions, uncertainties, and holes in our current evidence base, and may thus be a basis for future research aimed at increasing/improving our actual knowledge regarding the effectiveness and value of different nuclear risk reduction efforts.</li></ol><h1>The cruxes of nuclear risk reduction work as I currently perceive them</h1><p>Figure 1 (see above) gives a high-level overview of the relevant questions to address when trying to figure out how to work on nuclear risk reduction effectively (and whether to work on it at all). It contains a few substantive questions (located towards the middle part of the figure), answers to which can directly inform the kind of work an individual or group chooses to take on. Addressing these cruxes is helped by engagement with a number of meta questions (located in the top of the figure) and sub-questions, which break down the broad puzzle and thus hopefully make finding robust answers easier.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, I first address the substantive cruxes, listing conceivable answers, sub-questions to help tackle the broader puzzles, and my tentative position on each crux. I then turn to the meta-level question and briefly explain why I believe engagement with each of them to be vital if nuclear risk reduction efforts are to be effective.</p><h2>Substantive cruxes</h2><p>There is a sense in which the structure I settled on for this list of cruxes works in linear progression, starting with the question of whether and how much to care about nuclear risk overall and then successively moving from considerations about the desired high-level outcomes/goals, over intermediate goals/strategies, to specific interventions to pursue. However, the relationship between the different substantive cruxes is not entirely linear and one-directional once you take a closer look: questions about promising strategies and interventions feed back into higher-level cruxes, because the value of working on a high-level goal is partially determined by the tractability of such work and that tractability depends on how promising different concrete strategies and interventions are. In other words: If it turned out that the best strategies for achieving a certain high-level goal are not very promising, then that would be a significant argument in favor of deprioritizing the goal in question.</p><p>I believe, and hope, that the succession of substantive questions can aid individuals and groups in spelling out what they care about and why they decide to take some actions over others. I also hope that the cruxes help structure disagreements between different people working on nuclear risks, and that this structure can be an instrument for resolving disagreements, or at least misunderstandings, to some extent.&nbsp;</p><p>In this section, I give my (non-exhaustive) summary of possible views to take on each of these substantive cruxes and spell out my own tentative stance. The cruxes can be broken down into sub-questions; some of these are general and can be applied to each crux (listed in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/cruxes-for-nuclear-risk-reduction-efforts-a-proposal#Sub_questions__Tackling_substantive_cruxes_by_breaking_them_up\">separate section below</a>), others are more concrete and tailored to a specific crux, likely to emerge only in the process of tackling the crux in-depth.&nbsp;</p><h3>How \u201dworthwhile\u201d is nuclear risk reduction relative to other possible goals?</h3><p>This question is very much inspired by reasoning around cause prioritization prevalent within the effective altruism community, well-summarized on the Global Priorities Institute\u2019s About page (<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/about-us/\"><u>GPI n.d.</u></a>): \u201cThere are many problems in the world. Because resources are scarce, it is impossible to solve them all. An actor seeking to improve the world as much as possible therefore needs to prioritise, both among the problems themselves and (relatedly) among means for tackling them.\u201d</p><p><strong>Possible answers:</strong> In general, answers to this crux can fall on a continuum anywhere between \u201cnot worthwhile at all\u201d to \u201cmore worthwhile than any other possible goal\u201d, and can be given for an individual, a group, or for \u201chumanity overall\u201d. Addressing this crux requires taking a stance (implicitly or explicitly) on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/cruxes-for-nuclear-risk-reduction-efforts-a-proposal#Sub_questions__Tackling_substantive_cruxes_by_breaking_them_up\"><u>normative and empirical questions</u></a>, since it is necessary to know/define your values as well as your beliefs for how these values can be realized/furthered before being able to evaluate different goals in terms of how worthwhile they are.&nbsp;</p><p>I am aware of little in-depth engagement with the question from the \u201ctraditional nuclear risk field\u201d (i.e., governments, multilateral organizations, NGOs, academia), members of which tend to take the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons use as sufficient justification for their work and usually don\u2019t compare nuclear risk reduction to other possible cause areas. In the effective altruism community, on the other hand, the crux has been tackled by some analysts in recent years (see Rethink Priorities\u2019 series of posts on the EA Forum (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk\"><u>Aird 2021a</u></a>) 80,000 Hours\u2019 problem profile (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/#top\"><u>Hilton and McIntyre 2022</u></a>), and Toby Ord\u2019s (2020) assessment of nuclear risk in&nbsp;<i>The Precipice</i>). These analyses look at the topic primarily from a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/longtermism\"><u>longtermist perspective</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq9264gj4pn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq9264gj4pn\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and they suggest, broadly speaking, that it is unclear whether risks from nuclear weapons should be amongst the most highly prioritized cause areas for the effective altruism community, but that they are sufficiently important, tractable, and neglected to be a worthwhile focus area for some people and organizations in the community<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbsaantl321\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbsaantl321\">[8]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>For readers who like to think about cause prioritization with EA-esque frameworks in mind (using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\"><u>importance-tractability-neglectedness framework</u></a>, the longtermist-neartermist distinction, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/expected-value\"><u>expected-value reasoning</u></a> generally) and who would like to engage with this crux by themselves rather than deferring to the sources I link to above, I think that the following propositions about nuclear weapons and their significance could be helpful (accepting either of them could form the basis for thinking about how to prioritize between nuclear risk reduction and other cause areas)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwegauudxxv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwegauudxxv\">[9]</a></sup></span>:</p><ul><li>Nuclear weapons pose an existential risk (of varying probability).<ul><li>Nuclear weapons pose a direct extinction risk (through nuclear winter).</li><li>Nuclear weapons pose a direct risk to curtail humanity's potential in a different way (e.g., by enabling the rise of a global totalitarian regime).</li><li>Nuclear war is an existential risk factor, i.e. would render the world more vulnerable to other risks.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Nuclear war is a non-existential global catastrophic risk, and working on it is competitive with working on leading neartermist interventions.</li><li>Nuclear war is a non-existential global catastrophic risk, and working on it is not competitive with working on leading neartermist interventions (it is more akin to earthquakes or smaller-magnitude volcanic eruptions).</li></ul><p><strong>My tentative answer:</strong> I must admit that I\u2019m quite confused about the methodological and normative questions surrounding \u201ccause prioritization\u201d generally and more clarity on that seems a prerequisite for addressing this crux more thoroughly. I have a fairly strong intuitive (or common-sense-backed?) sense that working on this problem is important and that it is worth my time and effort to at least try and see whether I might be well-suited for contributing something to this cause area. This is partly based on the fact that I can imagine several ways in which nuclear weapons could feature prominently in global catastrophic, and possibly in x-risk, events, and partly based on deference to the large number of prominent and seemingly smart individuals who consider the danger of nuclear weapons massively important to address (for one example out of many, see this commentary on the website of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons\"><u>Union of Concerned Scientists (n.d.)</u></a>, and for an example from within the effective altruism community, see Toby Ord\u2019s chapter on nuclear weapons in&nbsp;<i>The Precipice</i>), but is not the conclusion of a sophisticated personal cause prioritization research project on my side.&nbsp;</p><h3>What high-level outcome(s) (relevant to nuclear issues) do you seek to achieve?&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Possible answers:&nbsp;</strong>Once again, the answer to this question relies on certain normative as well as empirical beliefs, none of which I will expand on here. Instead, I offer a list of conceivable high-level outcomes, without specifying the premises one would need to accept to endorse or prioritize each one:</p><ul><li>Prevent nuclear winter, by preventing the worst kinds of nuclear war (in terms of numbers or types of weapons used, or targets chosen)</li><li>Prevent nuclear war of any kind</li><li>Prepare for the consequences of nuclear war (ecological, i.e. nuclear winter, political, social, economic, cultural/normative, technological)</li><li>Prevent (or end) the use of nuclear weapons for (totalitarian) oppression (by a world state, by a small group of nuclear weapons states, by terrorists or rogue actors)</li><li>Ensure that country X would win if it came to nuclear war</li><li>Reduce \u201cnuclear injustice\u201d&nbsp;<ul><li>Injustice in the international system as a result of the unequal distribution of power between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapons states</li><li>Injustice suffered by victims of nuclear war, or of the production of nuclear weapons (esp. through weapons tests)</li><li>Injustice suffered by future generations that will not come to exist or will have substantially worse lives due to present-day nuclear policies</li></ul></li><li>Deter (conventional) war through the non-military use of nuclear weapons (possession of nuclear weapons as a deterrent and \u201cforce for peace\u201d)</li><li>\u2026</li></ul><p><strong>My tentative answer:&nbsp;</strong>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/K7aA9YXRoRQvqjXuq/a-case-against-focusing-on-tail-end-nuclear-war-risks\"><u>separate post</u></a>, I explain why I am moderately confident at the moment that the priority of nuclear risk reduction for myself and the large majority of others working on the topic should be \u201creducing the probability of any kind of nuclear war\u201d, rather than reducing the probability of only specific kinds of nuclear war or preparing for the consequences of nuclear war. I have not looked at and don\u2019t have a strong opinion about the importance of other conceivable high-level outcomes relative to those three goals addressed in my write-up<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1x7epixq8un\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1x7epixq8un\">[10]</a></sup></span>. To address this question, I did not conduct a sophisticated academic investigation, nor did I go through and carefully answer the meta-level questions listed above. Instead, my provisional, but nonetheless moderately confident stance is based on a few weeks worth of dedicated reading, thinking and talking about the crux, and is informed by the intuitions I developed through my study of nuclear issues throughout the last few years.&nbsp;</p><h3>What are the best strategies for achieving high-level outcome X?&nbsp;</h3><p>Addressing this question in the abstract seems not very promising since the answer will likely differ depending on the specific high-level outcome you look at. In the end, I think it is necessary to pick out whichever high-level outcome strikes you as (most) relevant and tackle the more specific question of how to achieve that. In a separate write-up, I take a stab at one of these more specific questions:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JDi9MGdKkuT3PbiSc/what-are-the-most-promising-strategies-for-reducing-the\"><u>What are the most promising strategies for reducing the probability of nuclear war?</u></a>, in which I seek to give a comprehensive (if not exhaustive) overview of the answers that have been proposed by others and then break up the broad puzzle into more specific subquestions to evaluate the validity of different answers.&nbsp;</p><h3>What are the most promising interventions for pursuing strategy X?</h3><p>In my investigations during this fellowship, I found it useful to differentiate between broad strategies and specific interventions when thinking about approaches for achieving a given high-level outcome (quite similar to the differentiation between strategy and tactical research proposed in this EA Forum post:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oovy5XXdCL3TPwgLE/a-case-for-strategy-research-what-it-is-and-why-we-need-more\"><u>Rozendal, Shovelain and Kristoffersson 2019</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, my deep-dive into the question of how best to reduce the probability of nuclear war led me to identify five broad strategies: complete and permanent nuclear disarmament, stable &amp; effective deterrence, norms against nuclear use (in its strongest form, the nuclear taboo), changes to the security environment (of nuclear-weapons states), and measures to enhance nuclear safety &amp; security (prevent accidents, technological glitches, theft). Answering \u201cWhat are the best strategies for preventing nuclear war?\u201d by opting for one or several of these approaches then leads straightforwardly to follow-up cruxes that ask about the best intervention(s) for pursuing the chosen approach(es). It is not enough, for instance, to say that permanent and complete nuclear disarmament seems the most promising strategy for reducing the probability of nuclear war; in order to come up with an actionable plan for how to work on nuclear risk reduction, you also need some idea about how disarmament can be achieved.</p><h2>Sub-questions: Tackling substantive cruxes by breaking them up</h2><h3>Prioritization questions</h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668579115/mirroredImages/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/hrjago8qvfquslblocpr.png\"><figcaption><i>Figure 3: Questions for prioritizing between different goals or strategies.</i></figcaption></figure><p>Since the point of this overview is to give people and groups an aid for deciding which problems and interventions to focus on, heuristics for prioritization seem obviously useful. I follow common EA practice here and suggest the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\"><u>importance-tractability-neglectedness (ITN) framework</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefukeyqey9ejj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnukeyqey9ejj\">[11]</a></sup></span>, as well as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/personal-fit/\"><u>personal fit heuristic (Todd 2021)</u></a> to come up with a rough ranking of which problems to work on. In addition, I claim that consideration should be given to possible adverse effects (risks) of working on different goals, strategies and interventions. These decision criteria and their relevance to the nuclear risk cause area are described in a bit more detail in this section. The questions cannot be answered in the abstract; rather they are relevant when applied to any one of the substantive cruxes outlined above.</p><h3>What are your values/ethical priorities, and what do they imply for the importance of different goals, strategies and interventions in the nuclear risk reduction field, as well as for nuclear risk reduction as an overarching goal?</h3><p>I imagine that this question will raise some eyebrows: Does it really make a significant difference whether a consequentialist or a deontologist is asked about the importance of nuclear weapons and the value of work to reduce the risks associated with them? Should this not be a priority across the majority of existing and conceivable ethical beliefs?&nbsp;</p><p>While most ethical approaches can generate arguments to justify/recommend nuclear risk reduction efforts, differentiating between them does matter when it comes to figuring out just how important the danger from nuclear weapons is relative to other problems. It also matters for deciding which specific aspects of that danger to focus on. I won\u2019t give this an in-depth discussion (the time I have in the fellowship is limited, and I don\u2019t understand the range of ethical views well enough to give a sophisticated elaboration even if I wanted to), but here\u2019s an example to illustrate why and how values matter:&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_utilitarianism\"><u>suffering-focused utilitarian (Wikipedia 2021)</u></a> is going to care about how many people are likely to be harmed by different kinds of nuclear war (as well as by other risks associated with nuclear weapons, such as the possibility of a global totalitarian regime in possession of these weapons), compare this to the amount of suffering caused by other problems, and then distribute resources for fighting different problems according to how much suffering they cause in expectation. Many proponents of the Treaty to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons likely believe these questions and calculations to be besides the point, arguing that the nature of nuclear weapons and their role in today\u2019s militaries is so fundamentally wrong that no accounting for the precise amount of suffering they cause in expectation is needed in order to decide that fighting for their abolition is worth the effort (e.g., compare ICAN\u2019s commentary on the treaty (<a href=\"https://www.icanw.org/why_a_ban\"><u>ICAN n.d.</u></a>)). I would guess that a ranking of different problems is as irrelevant for this TPNW proponent as the fundamental moral character of nuclear weapons is to the suffering-focused utilitarian.</p><h3>How tractable and neglected is work on different outcomes, strategies, or interventions?</h3><p>Tractability and neglectedness are criteria taken from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\"><u>ITN-framework</u></a> for comparing different problems and the value of working on them (I discuss the third criterion, importance, in the previous section): \u201cThe&nbsp;<strong>tractability</strong> of a problem (also called its&nbsp;<strong>solvability</strong>) is the degree to which it is solvable by a given increase in the resources allocated to it\u201d (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/tractability\"><u>EA Forum description</u></a>); \u201cThe&nbsp;<strong>neglectedness</strong> of a problem (also called its&nbsp;<strong>uncrowdedness</strong>) is the amount of resources currently allocated to solving it\u201d (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/neglectedness\"><u>EA Forum description</u></a>). The basic idea is that a stock of resources will contribute more to solving a given problem if it is more tractable and/or more neglected (other things being equal), and that it is good for resources to have more rather than less (positive) impact. It follows from these assumptions that the tractability and neglectedness of two problems can serve as an input for deciding which of the two to work on.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is your \u201cpersonal fit\u201d for working on different outcomes, strategies, or interventions?</h3><p>It seems uncontroversial to say that decisions for how to approach nuclear risk reduction need to take into account not just characteristics of the different problems and interventions but also of the actors that seek to do the interventions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcyq1vp0yy9p\"><sup><a href=\"#fncyq1vp0yy9p\">[12]</a></sup></span>. In the words of Ben Todd from 80,000 Hours (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/most-pressing-problems/#your-personal-fit-and-expertise\"><u>2016</u></a>): \u201cThere\u2019s no point working on a problem if you can\u2019t find any roles that are a good fit for you \u2013 you won\u2019t be satisfied or have much impact.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cPersonal fit\u201d in this case refers to a person (or group\u2019s) interests, capabilities, knowledge/skills, resources (budget, network, credentials, etc), and constraints (e.g., a legal barrier to working in a certain country or position).</p><h3>What are possible adverse effects of working on different outcomes, strategies or interventions, and how likely are they?</h3><p>For many interventions in the nuclear risk reduction space, a convincing case can be made that there are substantial downside risks that warn against pursuing the interventions. These could be risks that materialize if the intervention fails (e.g., arms reduction efforts could actually lead to a more dangerous world, if they stop short of complete disarmament and make nuclear weapons states feel more vulnerable and more quick to escalate in times of crisis), it could be side effects (e.g., attempts to strengthen deterrence postures may lead to security dilemmas, or simply to a more hostile international environment, both of which make escalation and conflict more likely), or unforeseen outcomes (e.g., centralizing command over nuclear weapons in a global authority to prevent their use in inter-state war may end up empowering a global regime of totalitarian repression). It\u2019s not obvious how strongly such potential adverse effects should weigh against an intervention, but it seems very intuitive that they should receive some consideration in the evaluation of different strategies for reducing nuclear risk.</p><h3>Basic questions about global politics</h3><p>I think there are some general questions about how global politics works that are relevant for all or most conceivable high-level outcomes, strategies, and interventions in the nuclear risk reduction field:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>What influences state<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnguwaxmqarg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnguwaxmqarg\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;decision-making?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkhugs0m71vi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkhugs0m71vi\">[14]</a></sup></span></li><li>What influences bi- and multilateral relations in our current (or a conceivable future) world?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd90gwiq9qgs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd90gwiq9qgs\">[15]</a></sup></span></li><li>\u2026</li></ul><p>These questions are&nbsp;<i>hard</i> and there is some evidence to suggest that they are fairly intractable: they have decades- and sometimes centuries-long debates to their name, without the emergence of anything like a robust scholarly consensus<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpgrosa8aow\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpgrosa8aow\">[16]</a></sup></span>, and there is no straightforward way to test different answers to these questions and to receive reliable or clear feedback on which hypothesized answer performs best. However, I believe that it\u2019s worth thinking about whether there might be ways to improve the validity/robustness of our answers to these questions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoeza4zgaopr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoeza4zgaopr\">[17]</a></sup></span>, and I encourage readers to address that challenge in the kind of thesis-long treatment that it deserves!</p><h2>Meta-level cruxes: methodology and epistemology</h2><p>Whether consciously or not, grappling with the cruxes I list requires taking a stance on methodological and epistemological conundrums. I believe that it is preferable if this is done explicitly rather than in an un- or poorly considered reliance on some unstated assumptions. Additionally, I hold out some hope for progress on the methodological and epistemological disputes at issue, which is a further reason to spell out (and subsequently try to address) these meta-level questions.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668579115/mirroredImages/pqGnC4sAjzzZHoqXY/a6ifhcgipa6kzje8posa.png\"><figcaption><i>Figure 4: Meta-level questions to consider when thinking about and making choices in the nuclear risk reduction space.</i></figcaption></figure><h3>What are promising/valuable methods for establishing causality when studying social phenomena?</h3><p>The relevance of understanding how to identify causal relationships can be illustrated by listing a few example questions that feed into evaluating different outcomes, strategies and interventions in the nuclear risk reduction space: How would international politics be affected by a conflict involving nuclear weapons? How would movement towards a more just/equal global (nuclear) order<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwblnsuxkc4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwblnsuxkc4\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;affect the world\u2019s ability to tackle catastrophic risks? What causes decision-makers to take escalatory steps in a crisis? What (if anything) is the effect of the Treaty to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons on state leaders\u2019 willingness to use nuclear weapons?</p><h3>Which kind of evidence would be helpful to answer the substantive cruxes more reliably?&nbsp;</h3><p>Insightful evidence to illuminate many of the relevant cruxes in the nuclear risk reduction field (and in political science more broadly) is hard to come by. So hard, in fact, that I developed doubts on whether evidence-based policymaking in this space is an option at all, which is the reason why I included the following question about what to do in the face of deep uncertainty in my list of cruxes. That being said, I believe that there could be value in a deep-dive into the crux of what kind of evidence is used in prominent arguments and proposals in the nuclear risk space and of how strong or robust the conclusions from that evidence are. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t really manage to address this puzzle during the summer fellowship and only have broad impressions and some scattered resources on possible answers to the question at this point.&nbsp;</p><h3>What should we do if the uncertainty on empirical questions is such that no better-than-chance answer is available?</h3><p>Efforts to tackle nuclear risks face enormous levels of uncertainty. Our understanding of the likely effects of different types of intervention to reduce nuclear risks is quite poor and, arguably, hard to improve because of the nature of the problem. We are faced by a multiplicity of possible causal influences and by multi-directionality/complexity of the relationship between variables, and we have to accept that no counterfactual world is available, that we are unable to conduct controlled experiments, and that we only have access to a relatively low number of relevant observations to perform natural experiments and statistical analyses on. All of this, I would argue, severely limits our ability to reduce uncertainty vis-a-vis questions such as \u201cWhat kind of security environment makes nuclear war less likely?\u201d, and \u201cAre there viable interventions to significantly decrease the likelihood of a nuclear accident?\u201d</p><p>I think it\u2019s vitally important that we face the challenge of that empirical uncertainty and grapple with the question of what to do in the face of it - Are there ways to reliably reduce uncertainty to such an extent that policy recommendations based on empirical analyses become feasible? Or should the ideal of evidence-based policy be given up as not workable? How should decisions be made&nbsp;<i>if&nbsp;</i>the consequences of our actions are to a significant extent unknown and unknowable?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjt7n9w7c06i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjt7n9w7c06i\">[19]</a></sup></span></p><h3>What does existing scholarship on nuclear issues (and on global politics more generally) get wrong?</h3><p>Questions in the nuclear risk space are hard, and straightforward answers, backed by a strong evidence base, don\u2019t seem to be available. This makes it all the more important, in my opinion, to carefully scrutinize existing attempts to provide answers. The wealth of critical analysis which highlights systemic biases and distortions in the relevant literature (on international relations (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogz029\"><u>Goh 2019</u></a>), foreign policy (<a href=\"https://books.google.at/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=NSScAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=Foreign+policy+bias&amp;ots=8BQx5vE2zo&amp;sig=7oeYdJ-Jowp7KrLHqr0ZqnjBzsM#v=onepage&amp;q=Foreign%20policy%20bias&amp;f=false\"><u>Yetiv 2013</u></a>), security studies (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09636419608429277\"><u>Schweller 2007</u></a>), as well as on nuclear weapons more specifically (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogz025\"><u>Braut-Hegghammer 2019</u></a>)) gives further impetus to this call for scrutiny and critical reflection. Such critical scholarship vis-a-vis existing arguments and policy recommendations may help avoid mistaken policy choices, may improve the epistemic quality of the debate on the topic, and may forestall overconfidence in both researchers/analysts and in policymakers.</p><h3>What are the (adverse) effects of scholarship on nuclear issues, and what does that imply for how research should be conducted?</h3><p>Reflectivist theories in the social sciences argue that academic research has significant effects on developments in the real world, including on political decision-making<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuay260gzxs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuay260gzxs\">[20]</a></sup></span>, and that researchers thus have a special responsibility in how they go about their work (which topics they choose, which perspectives they adopt and ignore, which methods they employ, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>In the fields of international relations and security studies, which seem to be the academic disciplines most relevant to the study of nuclear risks, this issue has been raised, for instance, by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2486.2009.00873.x\"><u>Houghton 2009</u></a> (who describes how theories about global politics can turn into self-fulfilling or self-denying prophecies), by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2006.00403.x\"><u>Ish-Shalom 2006</u></a> (who traces harmful attempts of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to encourage development abroad at least partly to reductionist academic modernization theories), and by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.t01-1-00312.x\"><u>Smith 2004</u></a> (who argues that the International Relations discipline employs and thus reinforces a narrow definition of violence, contributing to policies that ignore or even further certain forms of injustice and oppression, which in turn creates the conditions for terrorism and other forms of violent resistance).</p><p>I won\u2019t provide well-defined guidelines for how (EA) nuclear risk researchers should behave in light of these arguments here, but I do think that it\u2019s important for scholars to be aware of these arguments and to have spent some time thinking through what they imply for their own work.</p><h1>Other pieces I wrote on this topic</h1><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GvS-hmI18zwU7wQZCk5fvIwCsCVuYIVVUvod80B_ITs/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Disentanglement of nuclear security cause area_2022_Weiler</u></a>: written prior to CERI, as part of a part-time and remote research fellowship in spring 2022)</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/K7aA9YXRoRQvqjXuq/a-case-against-focusing-on-tail-end-nuclear-war-risks\"><u>A case against focusing on tail-end nuclear war risks</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JDi9MGdKkuT3PbiSc/what-are-the-most-promising-strategies-for-reducing-the\"><u>What are the most promising strategies for preventing nuclear war?</u></a></li><li>List of useful resources for learning about nuclear risk reduction efforts: This is a work-in-progress; if I ever manage to compile a decent list of resources, I will insert a link here.</li><li>How to decide and act in the face of deep uncertainty?: This is a work-in-progress; if I ever manage to bring my thoughts on this thorny question into a coherent write-up, I will insert a link here.</li></ul><h1>References</h1><p>Atkinson, Carol. 2010. \u201cUsing nuclear weapons.\u201d&nbsp;<i>Review of International Studies</i>, 36(4), 839-851. doi:10.1017/S0260210510001312.</p><p>Aird, Michael. 2021a. \u201cRisks from Nuclear Weapons.\u201d&nbsp;<i>EA Forum (Series of Posts)</i> (blog).

Even if you aren't sure if you'll be hiring on more people in the next year it can be valuable to spend a small amount of time to take stock of your hiring systems and strategize about what hire you'd like to make next.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> High Impact Recruitment is supporting research into the hiring practices of smaller, younger EA organizations. Organizations that participate will receive a pro-bono in-depth consultation about how to improve their hiring systems based on current best practices for reducing bias and improving the quality of hires.&nbsp;The outcomes of the research will be used to create freely accessible tools and templates for hiring that the wider community can use as well.<br><br>We are partnering with Brennan Wilkerson, a Masters in Management candidate at ESCP Business School, who is conducting this research as part of his thesis.&nbsp;<br><br>Organizations under 5 years old and between 3-100 employees qualify to participate in a free consultation as part of the research.&nbsp;<strong>To participate, sign up for a time&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://calendly.com/brennan_wilkerson/90-120min?month=2022-11\"><strong><u>HERE</u></strong></a><strong> and fill in the pre-consult survey&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forms.gle/2Bm8TNrZfzGa41yS9\"><strong><u>HERE</u></strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>We're also sharing a few links to hiring resources below.&nbsp;</p><h2>FULL POST:&nbsp;</h2><p>Hiring well is important for an organization at any size, but for micro-sized organizations of under 20 people, hiring can be trajectory-changing. Your 2nd, 4th, or 8th employee, even in junior-level positions can have huge implications for team culture and dynamics and your overall success. Making a wrong hire rarely endangers a whole organization on its own, but can easily derail projects and demoralize teams in a way that tends to last and linger, even if the employee moves on.&nbsp;</p><p>Organizations under about 20 people likely shouldn't have a full time recruiter or HR professional on board unless they are set to scale really rapidly, so when hiring is happening in a small organization it can take a good deal of attention of the founder, director or board ... especially when it is a new skill! High Impact Recruitment has been supporting a number of smaller EA organizations with hiring in the last 6 months. While most of our clients have some experience with hiring in some way, maybe by participating in interviews during a former job, few people have experience running hiring rounds from start to finish and so it takes a lot of logistical and emotional attention.&nbsp;<br><br>Many resources online and in books are geared for larger organizations. Not only do most HR people work in larger organizations, most hiring happens in bigger groups too. In the US only about .1% of businesses have more than 500 employees but these companies employ roughly 45-50% of the workforce. Even though there are &nbsp;millions of small groups, hiring skill, research and tools generally cater to big organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>So, it makes sense that hiring is challenging for many EA orgs! Hiring and recruiting is a skill set that some professionals study for years and years, and yet relatively young organizations need to start hiring from the get-go while having less name recognition and organizational stability than larger organizations.&nbsp;<br><br>We want to help by supporting organizations individually, and creating a pool of shared resources and tools for the community that will be tailored for smaller organizations under 100 people.&nbsp;</p><h3>Here are a few parts of hiring well to pay attention to:</h3><p><strong>1. Be very accurate in predicting the key skills and talents of the person you need on your team.</strong> In a smaller organization, this takes a special amount of foresight, self-awareness, and creativity because the roles often have not existed before.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.managementcenter.org/tools/hiring/\"><u>Resource: The Management Center has good templates, including a \u201cFiguring Out the Role Worksheet\u201d</u></a></p><p><strong>2. Become attractive enough that good-fit candidates are interested in working with you.&nbsp;</strong>In a smaller organization, this means making a compelling case for your impact and culture when it may be unproven and stretching the edges of your network to meet candidates because they aren\u2019t coming to you.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rLO0MhGQuBijrgdUinEFOnBZbqENLRTQQDiOUKV6EM8/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Resource: Check out High Impact Recruitment's comprehensive list of places to post EA jobs and outreach tracker.</u></a></p><p><strong>3. Design the most accurate measures of skills and talents you can, optimizing for quality of hire based on time and effort input.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hiring processes try to get to know candidates as accurately as possible using a range of tools. Your process can be quick but risks being artificial, or more realistic but lengthy and energy-consuming. Balancing this is challenging.&nbsp;<br><br>This is the part of hiring that usually gets the most attention, but can be overrated to some degree. Sometimes if you don't hire well it isn't because you failed to pick the right person out of the pool, it is because the right person never came through the door in the first place. Typically small organizations should consider putting a little less weight here, and a little more weight on #1 and #2.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j9JnmEZtgKcpPj8kz/hiring-how-to-do-it-better#comments\"><u>Resource: Forum post discussing the research about hiring methods.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p><strong>4. Learn enough and set up the right people management systems to do this well for the size and shape of the organization.</strong> The systems an organization needs changes if they are hiring 1x a year vs 10x a year vs 100x a year. It doesn\u2019t make sense for a founder to invest as deeply in hiring skills and systems if the organization is only going to be a handful of people, but you do need a baseline of compliance and management systems.</p><p><a href=\"https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/handbook-policies\"><u>Resource: Anti-Entropy is developing a resource portal with sample employee handbook policies&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>AND<br><a href=\"https://www.managementcenter.org/resources/why-you-need-chief-talent-officer/\"><u>Resource: The Management Center's guide to when you need a Chief Talent Officer</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h1>Research Project&nbsp;</h1><p><strong>Designing hiring systems on your own can be a challenge and we'd like to help!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Helping organizations with this is motivating both for High Impact Recruitment and for Brennan Wilkerson, a Masters in Management candidate at ESCP Business School.

His estimate for the number of particles in a piece of incense \"not larger than a pea\" was of the order of 10^18. This estimate is remarkably accurate, within about three orders of magnitude of the true value (based on the number of molecules in the unburned incense) and thus only one order of magnitude off in linear dimension of the molecule.

Is it not strange that a philosophical movement dedicated to rationally doing good almost completely ignores something which is universally regarded as one of life\u2019s highest intrinsic goods, something that also happens to possess immense extrinsic value as a buffer against a variety of social ills (e.g. radicalization, crime/violence, physical and mental <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316\"><u>health issues</u></a>, addiction, homelessness, etc.)?</p><p>I have a few hypotheses for why this blind spot exists in effective altruism/intellectual domains and the wider culture. First, effective altruism (and business and politics and education and\u2026) likes legibility and friendship just isn\u2019t a very legible thing. Is someone a BFF, a friend, or an acquaintance? How strongly would you rate your friendship on a scale of 1-100? Would they give a similar rating? Are you sure? Can you truly count on them to help you in your time of need?</p><p>Furthermore, it\u2019s generally a bad idea to think too deeply or quantitatively about your friendships\u2014a certain degree of irrationality and forgetfulness is essential to the whole enterprise. It\u2019s usually not good for a friendship when you start thinking things like \u201cBob is kind of a shitty person, why exactly am I still buddies with him?\u201d (because you\u2019ve known him for a long time and he really got you out of jam back in college, and that\u2019s plenty enough reason to stay friends with him; also people change and you might be really glad that you stayed friends with him in the future) or \u201cNancy has to initiate the next hang out because I\u2019ve done it nine times this year compared to her three\u201d(she\u2019s going through some things you don\u2019t know about so cut her a break, just like she\u2019s cut you one in the past). Friendship drama caused by weddings is another example\u2014shit can really get awkward when you have to basically rank your friends by choosing a best man/maid of honor or deciding who makes it into the wedding party and who doesn\u2019t.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668531367/mirroredImages/kEbdGgMt4Qfair3aN/copkdidfd5mxlduzmmuj.jpg\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b3433da-f51c-4a13-a1ed-aab767b06852_500x347.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b3433da-f51c-4a13-a1ed-aab767b06852_500x347.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b3433da-f51c-4a13-a1ed-aab767b06852_500x347.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b3433da-f51c-4a13-a1ed-aab767b06852_500x347.jpeg 1456w\"><figcaption>cool pose, bros</figcaption></figure><p>So perhaps this aversion towards over-scrutinizing our own personal relationships manifests on a collective level as a kind of cultural blind spot around friendship. I think there are is at least one more factor at play however, one which I previously highlighted as responsible for our intellectual bias against sports (see <a href=\"https://www.secretorum.life/p/the-future-where-are-the-colors-and\"><u>The Future: Where are the Colors and Sports?</u></a>).</p><p>It comes down to what\u2019s known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory\"><u>Construal-level Theory</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>People are capable of thinking about the future, the past, remote locations, another person's perspective, and counterfactual alternatives. Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point\u2014in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality\u2014constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20438233/\"><u>source</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>So distance\u2014whether spatial, temporal, social-emotional, or conceptual\u2014causes us to think more abstractly and with less attention to detail. This is why we always picture the future as blue and black (because those are the colors of the sky which is very far away) and smooth and shiny (i.e. lacking in texture and imperfections), and why the future always seems so boring\u2014it\u2019s all epic battles between good and evil or far-flung space exploration and not a whole lot of sports or sex, drugs, and rock n\u2019 roll (all of which are things I like to do with my friends, coincidentally).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/10/the-future-seems-shiny.html\"><u>Robin Hanson</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/near-far-summary.html\"><u>discusses</u></a> it as far vs. near modes of thinking:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668531367/mirroredImages/kEbdGgMt4Qfair3aN/un3p574qc0h6bs6qp3sj.gif\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ea589f4-43ef-4dd9-a24b-8911984c5602_567x472.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ea589f4-43ef-4dd9-a24b-8911984c5602_567x472.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ea589f4-43ef-4dd9-a24b-8911984c5602_567x472.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ea589f4-43ef-4dd9-a24b-8911984c5602_567x472.gif 1456w\"><figcaption>.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>\u201cIn far mode we tend to focus more on our simple abstract ideals and values, relative to messy desires and practical constraints.

For all of the undeniable benefits of not having to schlep to the office every day, we are less likely to make friends when working remotely. This isn't to say that remote work is bad for platonic companionship in general\u2014some of the time and energy we save while working from home is devoted to maintaining existing friendships or developing new ones\u2014but it does make us less likely to become friends with people very different from ourselves, people who we sometimes have almost nothing in common with except that we work together. How else would I, a born-and-raised American who has never lived abroad, make friends with a Belarusian immigrant (the physics teacher at the school where I formerly worked) and an Albanian-Italian immigrant 20 years my senior (the art teacher)? Uncommon friendships of this sort are incredibly valuable on societal level for obvious reasons (especially for a country as diverse as the USA), and if office work isn't helping to create them as it once did then we need something new to fill the void.</p><h2><strong>III.</strong></h2><p>What then, if anything, can be done to encourage more friendship and raise its stature in our culture? Searching the effective altruism forum did yield the transcript of a talk from 2018 on something called <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-the-friendship-bench\"><u>the Friendship Bench</u></a>, which is kind of a misnomer because it\u2019s not really about friendship per se. In the talk, Dr. Dixon Chibanda discusses a mental health intervention that he designed and implemented in his home country of Zimbabwe.</p><blockquote><p>And over a couple of months, we managed to come up with a meaningful sort of intervention, and over the years we developed a series of components to this intervention, which became known as the Friendship Bench, which in essence is psychological therapy which is delivered on a bench in the community by grandmothers. And one of our most recent publications is a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594719\"><u>clinical trial</u></a> of this intervention, where we compared the Friendship Bench with usual care, through a cluster randomized controlled trial. And the cluster randomized controlled trial, which is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association actually showed that grandmothers were more effective at delivering and alleviating symptoms of depression and averting suicides than usual care.</p></blockquote><p>From the Q&amp;A:</p><blockquote><p><i>Dixon: </i>\u2026And one of the other things which we also encourage on the Friendship Bench, which is really not in-keeping with your usual psychotherapy or CBT therapy is that the therapist becomes almost involved. And this is something that I was never trained to do as a psychiatrist, you know? You always keep your distance, but we've learned from the grandmothers that it's critically important to show your weaknesses too as a human being, by sharing your own lived experience, but within a very structured way, and by doing that you really establish strong rapport with the client.</p><p><i>Question:</i> It strikes me that this is also sort of an instruction manual for how to be a good friend.</p><p><i>Dixon</i>: Well, that's why it's called the \"Friendship Bench\"!</p></blockquote><p>The Friendship Bench sounds cool and all (I am 100% on board with any experiments/mental health interventions that incorporate grandmas), but I am more interested in the simple idea of having public spaces dedicated to friendship, especially ones where old and young can interact and form relationships.</p><blockquote><p>\"They're really proving to be a win, win, win, very beneficial for both ages,\" Donna Butts, the executive director of <a href=\"https://www.gu.org/\"><u>Generations United</u></a>, a nonprofit that promotes intergenerational programs, policies, and strategies, told Insider. \"With intergenerational programming, it helps older adults develop a sense of purpose. They're giving back, they're engaged, they're stimulated by the interactions with younger people. And it also gives them hope for the future. For younger people, it really helps in terms of a sense of roots, history.\"</p></blockquote><p>Anything we can do to spread more grandmotherly (or grandfatherly) love and wisdom sounds good in my book\u2014this is why I\u2019m bullish on intergenerational housing programs (<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/dutch-nursing-home-college-students/408976/\"><u>1</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200212-the-housing-project-where-young-and-old-must-mingle\"><u>2</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/intergenerational-living-senior-citizens-college-students-2020-1\"><u>3</u></a>) that give young people a break on rent if they live in retirement homes and contribute to the community.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668531367/mirroredImages/kEbdGgMt4Qfair3aN/wiyfmljc0rfrlcv274jx.jpg\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30f851a9-c8dc-4907-bcf6-f5b505948e53_600x413.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30f851a9-c8dc-4907-bcf6-f5b505948e53_600x413.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30f851a9-c8dc-4907-bcf6-f5b505948e53_600x413.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30f851a9-c8dc-4907-bcf6-f5b505948e53_600x413.jpeg 1456w\"><figcaption>The Friendship Temple in Potsdam\u2026like this but more bigger and majestical</figcaption></figure><p>Friendship benches and intergenerational housing are a nice start, but Let\u2019s Not Stop There. I want friendship temples and an entire friendship religion, a first-of-its-kind belief system that doesn\u2019t worship a god or some abstract metaphysical principle but a Divine Friendship, a bond between two perfect beings who become even more perfect through their free association with another, a simple companionship that makes an existence of infinite eternal bliss even more infinite and eternal and blissful (to be crystal clear about this: the deities themselves are not worshipped or even described in any particular detail, only the Divine Friendship is truly regarded sacred).</p><p>Epicurus will be our philosophical patron saint.</p><blockquote><p>Epicurus placed an extremely high value on friendship (or love: <i>philia</i>). A saying with rather a more poetic flair than is Epicurus\u2019 custom runs: <strong>\u201cFriendship goes dancing round the world, announcing to all of us to wake up to happiness\u201d</strong>. Epicurus held that a wise man would feel the torture of a friend no less than his own, and would die for a friend rather than betray him, for otherwise his own life would be confounded. These are powerfully altruistic sentiments for a philosopher who posits as the unique goal in life happiness based on freedom from physical pain and mental anxiety. Epicurus could justify such an attitude by the same prudential calculus that he uses to argue in favor of living justly: only by living in such a way that loyalty to friends is perceived to be a consummate value will one be able to feel secure in one\u2019s friends, and thus maximize one\u2019s felicity.</p></blockquote><p>One important custom of the friendship religion regards the usage of philosophical thought experiments (The Drowning Child, trolley problems, etc.); all mentions of \u201cpeople\u201d, \u201cchildren\u201d and other general descriptors must be replaced by \u201cfriend\u201d. Thus, we have The Drowning Friend, the fat friend whom you can push on to the tracks in order to save your other five friends, friends chained to the wall of Plato\u2019s allegorical cave , and so on and so forth. This simple substitution changes nothing, but also everything.</p><blockquote><p>Epicureans were encouraged to form communities and to observe certain rituals, although most of these practices, such as the celebration each month of the day (the 20th) on which Epicurus w no no noas born or wearing rings bearing an image of Epicurus, may have originated after the founder\u2019s death.</p></blockquote><p>This is the killer app of the religion: a monthly day of celebration dedicated to renewing one\u2019s friendships and forging new ones (we can get dope friendship rings too though). I predict that this custom will quickly spread beyond the religion and become so popular that countries across the world will be forced to make the 20th of every month into a national holiday (a holy-day) as large swaths of their populations will simply refuse to work on these days anyways. For any world leaders reading this (no doubt there are many), why wait until the friendship religion becomes a thing? Stand on the right side of history (just think of how your approval rating will skyrocket!).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668531367/mirroredImages/kEbdGgMt4Qfair3aN/vjo3onsiepjihvpqzfpy.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3595bbdf123d65b1f0806203a2bc6293edc511c6765a8369.png/w_120 120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3595bbdf123d65b1f0806203a2bc6293edc511c6765a8369.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3595bbdf123d65b1f0806203a2bc6293edc511c6765a8369.png/w_280 280w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3595bbdf123d65b1f0806203a2bc6293edc511c6765a8369.png/w_360 360w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3595bbdf123d65b1f0806203a2bc6293edc511c6765a8369.png/w_440 440w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3595bbdf123d65b1f0806203a2bc6293edc511c6765a8369.png/w_520 520w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/3595bbdf123d65b1f0806203a2bc6293edc511c6765a8369.png/w_600 600w\"><figcaption>.</figcaption></figure><p>Returning to more practical matters (not to say that I\u2019m being anything less than 100% serious about the friendship religion), I think we should also begin re-considering some of our laws around friendship. We should of course be very wary of over-legalizing our platonic relationships, but under-legalizing them can be problematic as well.</p><blockquote><p>In 2012, Canada\u2019s <a href=\"http://slace.syr.edu/issue-1-2013-14-on-equality/recognizing-care-the-case-for-friendship-and-polyamory/\"><i><u>The Globe and Mail</u></i></a> reported that the 73-year-old American companion of an 83-year-old Canadian woman had been deported from Canada despite their relationship of many years: \u2018She and her friend of three decades, Ms. Sanford, 83, are inseparable. In addition, Ms. Sanford suffers from a heart condition and dementia and Ms. Inferrera looks after her.\u2019 The American woman had been refused permanent residency in spite of numerous appeals, even though she performs extensive caregiving for her friend.&nbsp; The two women are not romantically involved. <strong>They are \u2018just friends\u2019.</strong> As such, their relationship, no matter how long-term or caring, received no legal protection. (In a happy turn of events, the Canadian government relented once the women\u2019s plight was publicised.)</p><p>\u2014\u201c<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/theforum/why-cant-we-be-legally-recognized-friends/\"><u>Why Can\u2019t We Be (Legally Recognized) friends?</u></a>\u201d)</p></blockquote><p>The quoted article raises an interesting question: why does marriage get special treatment when it comes to immigration?</p><blockquote><p>It might be thought that long-term caring relationships need no special support or recognition.&nbsp;But in an array of contexts, such as immigration, caring relationships need state protection to enable the parties to play key roles in each other\u2019s lives. Some such entitlements are currently only available through marriage, and while others can be contracted independently, this involves lawyer\u2019s fees far in excess of the cost of the marriage license.</p><p>(Ibid)</p></blockquote><p>You could even argue that friendship is much less problematic when it comes to immigration because it can\u2019t be faked in quite the same way as a romantic relationship\u2014there is no \u201clove at first sight\u201d. I feel much better about extending citizenship to someone's long-time friend (assuming they can adequately document said friendship) than I do to some guy\u2019s new (mail order) bride that he met three months ago on the internet.</p><p>Whether legalized or not, I would also like to see platonic life-partners become more of a thing: enduring non-sexual relationships in which two friends cohabitate, commingle finances, and support each other in all the ways a romantic partner would. For example:</p><blockquote><p>Last fall Renee moved from Singapore to Los Angeles to be with her partner April. April calls it a grand gesture and it certainly is. But it was confusing to a lot of people because Renee and April aren't in a romantic relationship. At all. And yet they do consider themselves life partners. The two women have been best friends since they were teenagers and they now consider themselves platonic life partners. But our society doesn't really recognize that as a thing.</p><p>\u2014show notes, the \u201c<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/platonic-life-partners/id1382244741?i=1000570568675\"><u>Platonic Life Partners</u></a>\u201d episode of the Committed podcast</p></blockquote><p>The friendship religion might play a role here similar to the role that other religions play in marriage: supplying friendship oaths or ceremonies that formalize and sacralize these platonic partnerships.</p><h2>IV.</h2><p>My fear with essays like this is that people will read them and think something like, \u201cwhat a fun little essay filled with cute little ideas and arguments, perhaps I will ponder it again some time, or even bring it up in conversation one day\u201d. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that of course\u2014we all do it all the time\u2014but another response is possible, something like, \u201cthis was a work of divine inspiration, I will treat these words as gospel and reorient my entire life around their message\u201d. I expect that most readers will fall somewhere in between these two extremes, perhaps tending slightly more towards the former over the latter (but maybe I\u2019m wrong). For those chosen few who have been touched (lightly, lovingly) by this essay, I recommend that you take the following actions:</p><p><strong>1) Create a friendship bench and find a grandmother to sit on it</strong></p><p><strong>2) Get together a bunch of your friends and build a friendship temple</strong></p><p><strong>3) Start a friendship religion, become a friendship priest</strong></p><p><strong>4) Make a commitment, right here and right now, at this very moment, to stop making excuses and simply become a better friend.</strong></p><blockquote><p>But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long, close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self: the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.</p><p>\u2014David Whyte</p></blockquote><p>I have a few more not-at-all-outlandish proposals\u2014train people in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa\"><u>tulpamancy</u></a> so that they can make imaginary friends for themselves if the need arises,

EAGxBoston in April, I attended his talk of the same name (embedded below for those who prefer video format). I found it to be a great introduction to the current state of pandemic preparedness/GCBR. It has now been published as a paper by the Geneva Centre for Security Policy. I had some trouble finding it even on their website, so it seemed worth linkposting here. Executive summary and key takeaways are reproduced below.</p><hr><h1>Executive summary</h1><p>The world is demonstrably vulnerable to the introduction of a single pandemic virus with a comparatively low case fatality rate. The deliberate and simultaneous release of many pandemic viruses across travel hubs could threaten the stability of civilisation. Current trends suggest that within a decade, tens of thousands of skilled individuals will be able to access the information required for them to single-handedly cause new pandemics. Safeguarding civilisation from the catastrophic misuse of biotechnology requires delaying the development and misuse of pandemic-class agents while building systems capable of reliably detecting threats and preventing nearly all infections.</p><h1>Key takeaways</h1><h3>Background</h3><ul><li>We don't yet know of any credible viruses that could cause new pandemics, but ongoing research projects aim to publicly identify them.</li><li>Identifying a sequenced virus as pandemic-capable will allow &gt;1,000 individuals to assemble it.</li><li>One person with a list of such viruses could simultaneously ignite multiple pandemics.</li><li>Viruses can spread faster than vaccines or antivirals can be distributed.</li><li>Pandemic agents are more lethal than nuclear devices and will be accessible to terrorists.</li></ul><h3>Delay</h3><ul><li>A pandemic test-ban treaty will delay proliferation without slowing beneficial advances.</li><li>Liability and insurance for catastrophic outcomes will compensate for negative externalities.</li><li>Secure and universal DNA synthesis screening can reduce unauthorised access by &gt;100-fold.</li></ul><h3>Detect</h3><ul><li>Untargeted sequencing can reliably detect all exponentially spreading biological threats</li></ul><h3>Defend</h3><p>Goal: eliminate the virus while providing food, water, power, law<br>enforcement, and healthcare</p><ul><li>Develop and distribute pandemic-proof protective equipment for all essential workers</li><li>Comfortable, stylish, durable powered respirators must be proven to work reliably</li><li>Foster resilient supply chains, local production, and behavioural outbreak control</li><li>Strengthen systems and offer individualised early warning to block transmission</li><li>Develop and install germicidal low-wavelength lights, which appear to be harmless to humans</li><li>Overhead fixtures can reduce airborne and surface pathogens by &gt;90 per cent in seconds</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://dam.gcsp.ch/files/doc/gcsp-geneva-paper-29-22\">Read the Full PDF.</a></p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxtHJ5D0VII\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxtHJ5D0VII\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure>", "user": {"username": "captainjc"}}, {"_id": "23ACb9MjQn7tizKY7", "title": "Selective truth-telling: concerns about EA leadership communication.", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T19:45:24.330Z", "htmlBody": "<h3>Intro</h3><p>I have had concerns about EA leadership communication as long as I've known about EA, and the FTX meltdown has persuaded me I should have taken them more seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>(By leadership I mean well-known public-facing EAs and organizations.)</p><p>This post attempts to explain why I'm concerned by listing some of the experiences that have made me uncomfortable. <strong>tl;dr:</strong> EA leadership has a history of being selective in the information they share in a way that increases their appeal, and this raises doubts for me over what was and wasn't known about FTX.</p><p>I do <strong>not think</strong> I'm sharing any major transgressions here, and I suspect some readers will find all these points pretty minor.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm sharing them anyway because I'm increasingly involved in EA (two EAGs and exploring funding for an EA non-profit) and I've lost confidence in leadership of the movement. A reflection on why I've lost confidence and what would help me regain it seems like useful feedback, and it may also resonate with others.&nbsp;</p><p>i.e. This is intended to be a personal account of why I'm lacking confidence, not an argument for why you, the reader, should also lack confidence.</p><h3>2014: 80K promotional event in Oxford.</h3><p>I really wish I could find/remember more concrete information on this event, and if anyone recognizes what I'm talking about and has access to the original promotional material then please share it.</p><p>In 2014 I was an undergraduate at Oxford and had a vague awareness of EA and 80,000 hours as orgs that cared about highly data-driven charitable interventions. At the time this was not something that interested me, I was really focussed on art!</p><p>I saw a flyer for an event with a title something like 'How to be an artist <strong>and</strong> help improve the world!' I don't remember any mention of 80K or EA, and the impression it left on me was 'this is an event on how to be a less pretentious version of Bono from U2'. (I'm happy to walk all of this back if someone from 80K still has the flyer somewhere and can share it, but this is at least the impression it left on me.)</p><p>So I went to the event, and it was an 80K event with Ben Todd and Will MacAskill. The keynote speaker was an art dealer (I cannot remember his name) who talked about his own career, donating large chunks of his income, and encouraging others to do the same. He also did a stump speech for 80K and announced ~\u00a3180K of donations he was making to the org.</p><p>This was a great event with a great speaker! It was also not remotely the event I had signed up for. Talking to Ben after the event didn't help: his answers to my questions felt similar to the marketing for the event itself, i.e. say what you need to say to get me in the door. (Two rough questions I remember: Q: Is your approach utilitarian? A: It's utilitarian flavoured. Q: What would you say to someone who e.g. really cares about art and doesn't want to earn to give? A: Will is actually a great example of someone I think shouldn't earn to give (he intended to at the time) as we need him doing philosophical analysis of the best ways to donate instead.)</p><p>This all left me highly suspicious of EA, and as a result I didn't pay much attention to them after that for years. I started engaging again in 2017, and more deeply in 2021, when I figured everyone involved had been young, they had only been minorly dishonest (if I was even remembering things correctly), and I should just give them a pass.&nbsp;</p><h3>Philosophy, but also not Philosophy?: Underemphasizing risk on the 80K website</h3><p>My undergraduate degree was in philosophy, and when I started thinking about EA involvement more seriously I took a look at global priorities research. It was one of five top-recommended career paths on 80K's website and required researchers in philosophy. 80K website at time of writing:</p><blockquote><p>In general, for foundational global priorities research the best graduate subject is an <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/economics-phd/\">economics PhD</a>. The next most useful subject is philosophy</p></blockquote><p>(https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/)</p><p>This article contrasts sharply with the 80K page on philosophy:</p><blockquote><p>the academic job market for philosophy is extremely challenging. Moreover, the career capital you acquire working toward a career in philosophy isn\u2019t particularly transferable. For these reasons we currently believe that, for the large majority of people who are considering it, pursuing philosophy professionally is unlikely to be the best choice.</p></blockquote><p>(https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/philosophy-academia/)</p><p>It seems like there are significant risks to pursuing further study in philosophy that 80K are well aware of, and it does not look great that they mention them in the context of general philosophical research (that they presumably don't care about their readers pursuing) but omit them when discussing a career path they are eager for their readers to pursue. Spending 7 years getting a philosophy PhD because you want to research global priorities and then failing to find a position (the overwhelmingly likely outcome) does not sound like much fun.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a particularly clear example of a more general experience I've had with 80K material, namely being encouraged to make major life choices without an adequate treatment of the risks involved. I think readers deserve this information upfront.</p><h3>Public Interviews (where is the AI?)</h3><p>If you talk about EA's priorities in 2022 and fail to mention AI, I do not think you are giving an accurate representation of EA's priorities in 2022. But I've seen prominent TV and Radio interviews this year where AI isn't mentioned at all, I assume because interviewees are worried it won't appeal to viewers/listeners.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is Ben Todd on a show titled 'What\u2019s the best job to do good?' from the BBC: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ystj\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ystj</a> . (Will MacAskill was also on the Daily Show recently `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm3LjX3WhUI` though they since seem to have pulled the video, perhaps due to FTX).&nbsp;</p><p>I think EA's answer to 'What\u2019s the best job to do good?' is, all other things being equal, AI Safety and Biorisk work. But Ben barely mentions biorisk, and doesn't mention AI at all. I was really uncomfortable listening to this, and I think most listeners encountering EA for the first time could justifiably feel bait-and-switched if they took a look at 80K's website after listening to the show.</p><h3>Recent Internet Takes</h3><p>A lot of stuff has come out in the wake of FTX that wasn't publicly discussed in EA but seems like it should have been.</p><p>I was pretty alarmed by this thread from Kerry Vaughan which touches on Ben Delo, a major EA donor prior to SBF who pled guilty for \"willfully failing to establish, implement, and maintain an anti-money laundering ('AML') program at BitMEX\": <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KerryLVaughan/status/1591508697372663810\">https://twitter.com/KerryLVaughan/status/1591508697372663810</a>. The implication here is that Ben Delo's involvement with EA just quietly stopped being talked about without any kind of public reflection on what could be done better moving forwards.&nbsp;</p><p>I was also surprised to see that Will MacAskill is in a signal chat with Elon Musk, in which he previously tried to connect SBF with Elon to fund Elon's twitter acquisition <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1591091481309491200\">https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1591091481309491200</a>. Not only does this strike me as a strange potential use of significant financial resources, it raises questions about Will's unadvertised relationship with a controversial public figure, and one who founded a wildly successful AI Capabilities Research Lab. Furthermore, Will's tweet here about WWOTF implied to me that he didn't know Elon personally: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1554378994765574144\">https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1554378994765574144</a>. It turns out he did, the above text messages were sent several months prior to that tweet.</p><p><i>Edit: I think I messed the above paragraph up, I'm leaving it in so the comments make sense but thanks to Rob Bensinger for calling it out and see my subsequent comment </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/23ACb9MjQn7tizKY7/selective-truth-telling-concerns-about-ea-leadership?commentId=6jy79EgwSygKcmfmu\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Finally, Rhodri Davies recently wrote a blogpost (this was actually prior to the FTX scandal) titled 'Why am I not an Effective Altruist?' including the text below:</p><blockquote><p>And there are even whistle blowers accounts of the inner workings of the EA community, with rumours of secret Google docs and WhatsApp groups in which the leaders of the movement discuss how to position themselves and how to hide their more controversial views or make them seem palatable. I have no idea how much of this is true, and how much is overblown conspiracy theory, but it certainly doesn\u2019t make the whole thing feel any <i>less</i> cult-like.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://whyphilanthropymatters.com/article/why-am-i-not-an-effective-altruist/\">https://whyphilanthropymatters.com/article/why-am-i-not-an-effective-altruist/</a></p><p>I have zero evidence for or against this happening, but it unfortunately fits the pattern of my prior experience with EA leadership communications.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Nobody made a single false statement in any of the examples I've given above, but they are all cases in which I have felt personally misled by omission. These examples range from cases that could be honest mistakes (the 80K careers page example) to ones where the omissions seem pretty intentional (the 'art' event, Ben Delo).</p><p>My suggestion to any public-facing EAs: don't deliberately do this, and if you do this by mistake, take it seriously and course-correct. Failing to share information because you suspect it will make me less supportive or more critical of your views, decisions, or actions smells of overconfidence and makes you difficult to trust, and this has regularly happened to me in my engagement with EA. Otherwise, well, I'll probably still stick around because EA contains plenty of great people, but I'll have to be much more careful about who I collaborate with, and I won't be able to endorse or trust EA's public figures.</p>", "user": {"username": "tcelferact"}}, {"_id": "qegC9AwJuWbCkj8xY", "title": "If FTX is liquidated, who ends up controlling Anthropic?", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T15:04:04.807Z", "htmlBody": "<p>[EDIT: The original title of this question was: \"If FTX/Alameda currently control Anthropic, who will end up controlling it?\".

We\u2019ve now discontinued the majority of these programmes and have narrowed our focus to running fellowships that directly place early-career individuals in impactful careers.</p><p>Now that TFG has a clearer focus, we're writing this post to update others in the EA community on our activities and the scope of our organisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>What we do</h1><p>Training for Good runs fellowships that place talented professionals in impactful careers in policy, journalism &amp; other areas. We do this by providing a combination of stipends, mentorship from experienced professionals, training and placements in relevant organisations.</p><p>Between Sep 2022 - Aug 2023 (i.e. year 2), we plan to&nbsp;<strong>only</strong> run the following programmes:</p><ul><li>EU Tech Policy Fellowship</li><li>Tarbell Fellowship</li><li>*<i>An unannounced 3rd programme</i>&nbsp;<i>which is still under development*</i></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Why this might be important</h1><p>Many high impact career paths are neglected by talented and altruistic people, often because they lack clear pathways for entry. This is limiting progress on some of the world\u2019s most important problems: reducing existential risk, ending factory farming and tackling global poverty.</p><p>TFG seeks to provide concrete opportunities for early-career professionals to gain entry level roles in impactful career paths that are difficult to enter. Building these talent pipelines could be important because:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct progress on problems:&nbsp;</strong>Talented individuals in these career paths can directly contribute to progress on solving the world\u2019s most important problems</li><li><strong>Closer towards the \u201cideal portfolio\u201d:&nbsp;</strong>We mostly take a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/coordination/#3-take-the-portfolio-approach\"><u>portfolio approach</u></a> to doing good. One could imagine an optimal distribution of talent within the effective altruism community, which might involve people pursuing a variety of different career paths. With our fellowships, we are attempting to move the effective altruism community closer towards this ideal allocation by enabling people to pursue paths that we believe are currently underrepresented (and expect to remain so) within this community\u2019s portfolio. We believe that thinking in these terms is particularly useful partly due to:<ul><li>Diminishing returns from certain career paths</li><li>Epistemic uncertainty about which career paths are best (and the associated information value from reducing this uncertainty somewhat)</li><li>Differing personal fit for individuals across different career paths</li></ul></li><li><strong>Concrete opportunities:</strong> The number of people interested in effective altruism has been growing in recent years, but many are unclear how to contribute. Fellowships provide concrete opportunities for early-career individuals to build career capital &amp; explore their fit for a specific career path.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Our focus</h1><p>Our fellowships centre on:</p><ul><li><strong>Early career&nbsp;individuals </strong>Our programmes target the most talented &amp; altruistic people who are within the first 5 years of their career (we also consider this to include mid-career professionals who are pivoting to a new career). We are confident that the effective altruism movement will provide a promising stream of such people in the coming years.</li><li><strong>Entry level positions: </strong>We place these talented professionals in entry level positions (eg. by coordinating bespoke internships with partner organisations).</li><li><strong>Difficult to enter careers: </strong>We focus on career paths which are potentially high impact but unusually difficult to enter. In particular, this means focusing on careers in policy and journalism.</li></ul><p>We choose to narrow our attention to the above stated focus because:</p><ul><li><strong>Focus is good.</strong> In year 1, TFG&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GnXw3fYF6byJvpnjG/apply-for-professional-coaching\"><u>spread</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5zgn5H6LKr4c9jCcG/apply-to-negotiating-for-good-feb-26-mar-12\"><u>ourselves</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dEaPmvwo3Eu4kSFce/the-ea-training-board-is-now-live\"><u>thinly</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trainingforgood.com/policy-careers-europe\"><u>across</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DqBEwHqCdzMDeSBct/apply-for-red-team-challenge-may-7-june-4\"><u>many</u></a> projects. We were keen to maximise the information value of exploring many different topics, formats and stages of the talent pipeline. We are now keen to \u201cdo less and obsess\u201d by focusing our attention on ensuring the highest impact projects go as well as possible.</li><li><strong>Doubling down on our most promising programme:&nbsp;</strong>The EU Tech Policy appears to have been of much higher value than all of the other programmes we ran in year 1. We successfully placed 7 fellows in relevant European think tanks focused on emerging technology policy. We are keen to explore programmes similar to this in form to see whether we can replicate this across other career paths.</li><li><strong>Clearer feedback loops.&nbsp;</strong>We expect to see clear signs whether programmes of this type are working within ~6 months of starting them (as we can observe whether people are being offered full time roles, etc.). This will allow us to iterate much more quickly on our programmes - doubling down on what\u2019s working and improving / removing what\u2019s not.</li><li><strong>Comparative advantage.</strong> Excelling here does not seem to require expertise in the specific career paths. Rather it mainly consists of (i) identifying suitable career paths &amp; entry level opportunities (ii) coordinating &amp; collaborating with relevant actors to arrange placements, mentorship, stipends, etc and (iii) vetting suitable candidates<ul><li>Given that our team is highly entrepreneurial &amp; strong at building partnerships, we expect to be unusually good at (ii). By focusing on a narrow set of career paths (policy and journalism) we also expect to become excellent at (iii).</li></ul></li><li><strong>More directly influence whether people enter given career paths.&nbsp;</strong>By placing people directly in career paths , we reduce the number of steps in the theory of change and thus increase the likelihood of them successfully entering a given career path (compared to programmes which primarily provide upskilling / career planning).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Talent funnel</h1><p>We work to increase the supply of talented &amp; altruistic professionals&nbsp;<strong>entering&nbsp;</strong>high impact career paths.</p><p>When considering the \u201ctalent funnel\u201d for entering an impactful career, we view ourselves as primarily moving people from taking moderate altruistic action to entering the early stages of a high impact career.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668529635/mirroredImages/22zk3tZyYWoanQwt7/mkmklrvwtrgp7pqvjrpw.png\"></p><p><i>(note: this funnel is massively simplified.

Governments have an important role to play in managing the long-term societal impacts of these technologies. We believe that EU policy could be an important lever in positively shaping the trajectory of these technologies and are excited to support aspiring policy professionals interested in working in this area.</p><h3>What we offer</h3><ul><li><strong>Summer sessions (June - Aug).&nbsp;</strong>An 8-week reading group &amp; guest lecture series. These sessions focus mostly on AGI safety fundamentals, cybersecurity and the EU policy landscape. Guest lectures are conducted by leading researchers from organisations such as GovAI and policy professionals working in EU organisations.</li><li><strong>Brussels training weeks (June &amp; Sep).</strong> Two separate week-long trainings in Brussels: one in June before the summer sessions and the second in September at the end. These are intensive weeks featuring guest speakers, workshops and networking events.</li><li><strong>Placements (Sep - Feb)&nbsp;</strong>A&nbsp; 4-6 month placement at a relevant European think tank. Partner organisations include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thefuturesociety.org/\"><u>The Future Society</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cepa.org/\"><u>Centre for European Policy Studies</u></a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gmfus.org/\"><u>German Marshall Fund</u></a>&nbsp;<i><strong>(track 1 only)</strong></i></li><li><strong>Application support&nbsp; (Sep).&nbsp;</strong>A month to explore relevant roles in the European Commission, party politics and other areas relevant to emerging technology.

Fellows receive stipends of up to $2,250 per month during the full time period of the program.<ul><li>Track 1 = 4-6 months (for the duration of the placement)&nbsp;</li><li>Track 2 = 1 month (while receiving application support)</li></ul></li></ul><h3>2022 Programme</h3><ul><li>We launched this programme in June 2022 with 12 fellows. At present:&nbsp;<ul><li>6 fellows are currently completing 4-month placements at European think tanks.</li><li>4 fellows received support to apply for roles in the European Commission and other relevant organisations.</li><li>2 fellows are using their increased understanding of the space to pursue other goals (e.g. bridging the gap between policy &amp; research while completing their Phd at Stanford).</li></ul></li><li>Following the 8-week summer sessions &amp; a week-long training in Brussels, fellows reported that they were&nbsp;<strong>very likely to recommend this programme</strong> to others in their position, with an average score of&nbsp;<strong>4.9 / 5.</strong></li></ul><h3>2023 Programme</h3><ul><li>Applications for the 2023 EU Tech Policy Fellowship are open until December 11.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trainingforgood.com/europe-tech-policy\"><u>Apply here</u></a>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tarbell Fellowship</h2><h3>What is it?</h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tarbellfellowship.org\"><u>Tarbell Fellowship</u></a> is a 12-month programme for early-career journalists interested in covering topics that could have a major impact on the lives of billions, such as global poverty, animal welfare, and existential risks.</p><h3>Why</h3><p>Our vision is for a world where journalism is focused on highlighting &amp; solving the world\u2019s most important problems.</p><p>We believe that journalists have a powerful role to play in positively shaping public discourse on important topics. Impact-focused journalists can encourage the adoption of good policies, hold powerful actors accountable in the public arena, and inspire readers to take specific high-impact actions.&nbsp;</p><h3>What we offer</h3><ul><li><u>Stipends.</u> Fellows receive stipends of up to $50,000, depending on circumstances, to accelerate their journalism careers. We expect stipends to vary between $35,000 - $50,000 depending on location and personal circumstances.</li><li><u>Mentorship from an experienced journalist</u>. Each fellow is matched with an experienced journalist. Mentors will provide critical feedback and challenge the fellow to set goals and deliver on them. They'll conduct fortnightly mentorship calls and connect mentees with their network.</li><li><u>Training</u>. Fellows participate in remote sessions each week as a cohort. This will include training in best practices, talks from experts in the field and challenging assignments designed to build skills.</li><li><u>Oxford Summit</u>. Fellows attend a two week summit in Oxford at the beginning of the fellowship (March 1st - March 14th 2023). This will be an intensive fortnight of guest speakers, workshops and networking events in Oxford / London. Travel and accommodation costs will be fully covered.</li></ul><h3>2023 Programme</h3><ul><li>2023 will be the inaugural year of the Tarbell Fellowship. In our recent application round, we received over 950 applications in total and ultimately expect to accept up to 10 fellows.</li><li>We have an exciting line-up of mentors, including experienced journalists with experience in the New York Times, the Economist, Vox Future Perfect, and the BBC.</li><li>Although applications for the 2023 cohort have now closed, we encourage you to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trainingforgood.com/newsletter\"><u>sign up to our newsletter</u></a> if you might be interested in participating in future years.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Discontinued programmes from year 1</h2><p>We experimented with running a lot of different programmes in year 1. Those listed below no longer fit within our scope and have been discontinued.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>We don\u2019t expect to prioritise writing up detailed learnings from these programmes in the near future. Get in touch if you feel such a write-up would be especially useful to you.

Email cillian [at] trainingforgood [dot] com.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trainingforgood.com/policy-careers-europe\"><u>Impactful Policy Careers</u></a> a training programme designed to help participants plan for a high-impact career in policy. The first iteration in December 2021 was a 2-day programme and the second iteration in March 2022 was a 4-week programme. We\u2019ve observed several job changes towards (higher-impact) policy roles and participants attributed substantial percentages to the IPC workshop.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YgBXswPkPeqf99mrb/back-by-popular-demand-the-impactful-policy-careers-workshop\"><u>Applications for a new edition</u></a> recently closed. This is now led by some trusted former trainees and previous TFG interns.</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DqBEwHqCdzMDeSBct/apply-for-red-team-challenge-may-7-june-4\"><u>Red Team Challenge</u></a> was a programme that called small teams together to \"red team\" important ideas within effective altruism. The inaugural challenge was run with 35 people participating, across 10 teams. This programme provided training in \u201cred teaming\u201d best practices and some teams posted their critique on the EA Forum.</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5zgn5H6LKr4c9jCcG/apply-to-negotiating-for-good-feb-26-mar-12\"><u>Negotiating for Good</u></a> was a training programme in salary negotiation to help individuals increase \u200bthe amount they earn and their capacity for effective giving. It was conducted in February 2022 with 35 participants. The training was well-received, with an NPS of 9.1/10 and we observed self-reported confidence in negotiation skills from 2.3/5 to 3/5. We are unsure whether this outcome is net positive in expectation. This is mainly because (i) this programme may have encouraged some participants to remain in roles with relatively low donation potential that would be well suited to direct roles, and (ii) this programme may have discouraged participants who are a good fit for roles with higher donation potential (e.g. quant trading, entrepreneurship, etc.) from pursuing those paths.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOt5jQM25XRc02kSz-90-CEgEsiJtdBN6U1ak8RyQd0/edit\"><u>Impact Grantmaking</u></a> was a 6-week grantmaking training programme with a cohort of ~10 people. We discontinued this programme before our pivot. This is mainly because (i) our research &amp; conversations with grantmakers has produced mixed results on the need for this programme, (ii) the introduction of the FTX Regranting Programme likely addressed the need for funding diversity to a greater extent than this programme could, (ii) the pilot appeared to have been largely unsuccessful. We suspect that the main reason for this is that most participants did not have access to regranting funds and therefore did not see the \u201creal world\u201d application of this programme.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.trainingforgood.com/capacity-ventures\"><u>Capacity Ventures</u></a>: We completed a first iteration, a 3 day virtual bootcamp to help aspiring entrepreneurs to build skills by (i) executing a self-directed project over 1-6 months and (ii) conducting a skills assessment and developing an upskilling plan in response to that. ~10 people participated in this pilot, all of whom had made it to the final stages of Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s application process for their Incubation Programme.</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GnXw3fYF6byJvpnjG/apply-for-professional-coaching\"><u>Coaching</u></a>: Began offering subsidised professional coaching to 20 EA leaders and high-potential individuals.

I'd guess it probably works out to a couple hundred dollars directed to your nonprofit of choice per hour in expectation for most people reading this, which is a lot more than the rate most of us earn the money we're donating.</p>", "user": {"username": "WilliamKiely"}}, {"_id": "65fdPP2crjF9hBhtZ", "title": "What to do if a reporter contacts you about FTX?", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T07:48:38.789Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I have been contacted by a reporter (see below, omitting name/email).</p><p>I am going to ignore.

They might have felt that acknowledging the legitimacy of both perspectives and compromising might have appeared duplicitous</li><li>They might have decided there was no reason to partially return funds, given that donation was not a substantial proportion of the charity\u2019s overall income.</li><li>This is speculation \u2013 the source didn\u2019t provide enough information about the rationale for the decisions.</li></ul></li><li>To the extent that a rationale was stated, multiple charities did provide the rationale of having already spent the money as a rationale for not returning the money, and hence they implicitly believed it was legitimate not to return funds which were already spent.</li><li>It\u2019s unclear what happened to the returned funds. I\u2019ve seen no sign of the thought processes that charities went through when deciding whether to return these funds. However in other cases relating to tainted donations, the consequentialist argument that it is better for the funds to be put to good use than returned is a common theme.</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Sanjay"}}, {"_id": "dgss9eWfHrZBuEds4", "title": "An Important Lesson of the FTX Implosion...", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T02:59:41.262Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Distrust complexity.</p>", "user": {"username": "EliezerYudkowsky"}}, {"_id": "buk2kgMFxWzQAuJta", "title": "Has karma/agreement voting behavior changed?", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T03:01:03.826Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Here's an example of what I'm asking about:<br><br>I just came across <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ucqPQ5sgMsj5WMpsT/jeff-bezos-announces-donation-plans-in-response-to-question?commentId=pQ6CaphvRba2Sjktx\">this comment by Geoffrey Miller</a> from 9 hours ago:</p><blockquote><p>Once the FTX debacle gets resolved, and the PR blowback dies down, it might be useful for EAs to try to nudge Bezos to broaden his cause areas -- on the principle that tackling climate change may be moderately important in scope and severity, but is far from neglected, and seems rather intractable politically.</p><p>It would be great to see some of the Amazon money going to higher-impact cause areas.</p></blockquote><p>The comment is essentially a truism within EA, yet as of this moment it has <strong>9 karma with 11 votes</strong> and only <strong>2 agreement karma with 7 votes</strong>, meaning a nontrivial fraction of EA Forum users voting on it disagreed with it.<br><br>It's not very often that I come across posts/comments on the Forum where both (1) the karma/agreement voting behavior seems very off the mark from what it seems to me it should be, and (2) I further don't have a good explanation for why the current vote is what it is.</p><p>However, in the last few days since the FTX news broke I have noticed more than a few unexpected karma/agreement vote counts (though I didn't save any examples), hence why I'm asking this now.<br><br>Has anyone else noticed karma/agreement votes being off from what you'd expect recently too?

The overall summary is that these acts are effective, of course some more than others, but potentially work on infrastructure and larger scale ideas could have a larger impact. At the very least I hope this to be a rough summary of some of the data behind these issues and creating a springboard for these issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My criteria for thinking about these are mostly in line with other effectiveness criteria:</p><ul><li>The number of people affected by the act/product.</li><li>Marginal benefit of the trail/Is it neglected? For example: cancer already has lots of stuff but very few stuff about ageing.&nbsp;</li><li>Chance of success</li><li>Time investment/monetary reward/Opportunity cost (what else could you be doing, how are you compensated)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Medical trails:</u></p><p>The number of people affected by the aliment being treated is highly dependent on the trail. A good summary can be found here: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death-treemap\">Causes of death globally: What do people die from? - Our World in Data</a></p><p>Importantly here is that different trails have very different likelihoods of success a lovely table can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845\">https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845</a> .&nbsp;</p><p>This compliments the work of 1Day Sooner; vaccine trails are very likely to succeed and typically have a large impact so a very good way to make an impact and additionally has some great scale, unlike some other issues. There are some trails which pay well and potentially that money could be useful. Some trails giving \u00a33,000 and that could then be given to highly effective charities, although I\u2019m aware that money will need to cover the cost of doing such a trail. Also reviews of such things, like FluCamps ,have been somewhat mixed. Of course trails can extend to many other areas and could give breakthroughs in antiaging, prions or mental health/psychology trails so lots of potential. &nbsp;</p><p><u>Organ donation</u></p><p>Firstly there is a shortage of organs (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18261540/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18261540/</a>). Lots of potentially benefit (<a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics\">https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics</a>) not many but still unknown long term effects for living donors. 6,000 living donations take place a year out of 40,000 transplants so potential for high impact. There are longer waiting lists for some organs (<a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics\">https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics</a>). Highish opportunity cost in terms of recovering from surgery, around a week staying in hospital <a href=\"https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/organ-transplantation/kidney/at-the-transplant-centre/recovery-at-the-transplant-centre/\">https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/organ-transplantation/kidney/at-the-transplant-centre/recovery-at-the-transplant-centre/</a> but that is for receiving an organ so I could imagine it may be less time. On the other hand, it may have a serious long term effect on overall productivity. I have heard of some EA\u2019s donating organs though.&nbsp;</p><p>On the whole if living organ donation isn\u2019t something you are keen to do then you could always make sure you are on your countries organ donation list as afterlife you have a larger impact with the potential to save up to 8 lives. So if this interests you make sure you are signed up to donate organs. One thing to note is that opt-in/out-out policies aren\u2019t the major thing that affect supply (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8128443/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8128443/</a>), other issues which are bigger in size need to be addressed such as public education, awareness and health system structures. Potentially solving these problems could led to more impact than just the simple donating your organs and save 8 lives figure. One donation I discovered was cornea transplants (I believe they are also called eye donations) some data shows that over 10 million people are blind in such a way that they could benefit from an eye transplant and has an over 95% success rate (<a href=\"https://www.nvisioncenters.com/eye-surgery/transplant/\">https://www.nvisioncenters.com/eye-surgery/transplant/</a>). This complaints the highly effective charity Helen Keller International (one of GiveWell\u2019s top charities) which aims at intervening at the root cause of blindness.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Blood products:</u></p><p>There are many distinct blood products and my understanding is that these are filtered and produced when you donate blood so likely supply and demand is very efficiently meet, given ample supply of the initial blood product. An EA forum post has already been done on blood donation (https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jqCCM3NvrtCYK3uaB/blood-donation-generally-not-that-effective-on-the-margin) so not too much I can add. The blood products are similar with their opportunity costs, at around an hour every month given regular donations, and chance of success is high due to low waste. Blood products are very efficiently used so it\u2019s likely that any donation you make will be utilized as supply and demand is efficiently maintained with good transportation and storage. Due to this it does mean that blood products are sometimes shipped abroad where supply is much lower so does increase the effectiveness of donating blood products. Could have more impact in off seasons where there is an increased demand such as winter.&nbsp;</p><p>Blood donations from Black, Asian and Ethnic minorities in England and America are low, a similar story occurs with bone marrow donation, so a particular benefit you may be able to give.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Conclusion:</u></p><p>The overwhelming theme is that these medical donations are thankfully very efficient and so it\u2019s unlikely that your impact would be wasted. There is a possibility with medical trails of failure but due to their scale they also have a large upside so a higher risk higher reward scenario it seems. Most of these ideas are relatively effective but lack real scale to maximise a person\u2019s singular impact. To have a larger scale within these fields would likely be from improving infrastructure and potentially doing novel medical research creating potential alternatives. But if these don\u2019t suit your current skill set and you are an in demand donor you can make an impact.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the diverse nature of medical trails I believe there is still a bit of potential for researching effective trails that you can sign up for not just the challenge trails covered by 1Day sooner but also anti-aging trails and psychology trails so if anyone is interested or wants to discuss please get in contact with me.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "julian196"}}, {"_id": "ZnhLAzQxSi9svpkLQ", "title": "The NY Times Interviewed SBF on Sunday", "postedAt": "2022-11-14T23:07:39.961Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The NY times did an interview with SBF yesterday that \"stretched past midnight\".&nbsp;<br><br>Here are some quotes from the article:&nbsp;<br><br>\u201cHad I been a bit more concentrated on what I was doing, I would have been able to be more thorough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would have allowed me to catch what was going on on the risk side.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried, who is based in the Bahamas, declined to comment on his current location, citing safety concerns.

This happened in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, specifically near the port of Chicxulub, at 19\u00b0 18\u2032 south latitude and 127\u00b0 46\u2032 east longitude.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the meteorite was no more than 20 km in radius, the diameter of the impact is close to 200 km, with a depth of 900 meters. This is because the event released energy equivalent to hundreds of thousands of gigatons of dynamite.&nbsp;</p><p>Few people in Yucatan are aware of living over a crater because it is buried under a thick layer of carbonates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Geomagnetic and gravimetric anomalies</strong></p><p>Among the most mentioned consequences of the Chicxulub impact is the extinction of the dinosaurs, but little is said about others, for example, the anomalous values of&nbsp;<strong>the gravimetric field</strong> (the impact produced compressions followed by decompressions in the rocks)&nbsp;<strong>and the earth's magnetic field</strong> (the shock wave produced remagnetizations in the rocks) in this region. In fact, these variations were the main reasons why the crater was discovered and characterized. The story goes something like this:</p><p>Around 1960, Jaime Urrutia (Institute of Geophysics of the Autonomous University of Mexico) reported certain gravity anomalies near the Yucatan Peninsula. However, it was not until 1970 that Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (PEMEX) geophysicists, searching for oil, detected a surprisingly symmetrical arc-shaped subsurface structure. In 1978, Glen Penfield, who worked with PEMEX, measured the magnetic field of the rocks off the coast of the port of Chicxulub and found a value different from that of any known volcanic terrain. Putting these results together, he was able to identify a 180 km diameter circle with a center in Chicxulub, half on land and half in the waters of Mexico\u2019s Gulf.</p><p><strong>Iridium, an alien among us</strong></p><p>Iridium is a metal that is scarce on the Earth's surface, but abundant in some space objects such as meteorites. It was therefore surprising to detect a thin, scattered layer of this metal all over the world. It is now known that these large amounts of iridium are due to the disintegration of the meteorite and the area with the highest concentration is the center of the Chicxulub crater. It is estimated that the dust raised by the impact spread in the atmosphere for decades, while living beings were dying.</p><p>The various geochemical, microscopic, and stratigraphic studies of the crater helped to reconstruct a hypothetical structure of the meteorite: a 10 km diameter projectile entering the Earth at a speed of 10 km per second.</p><p><strong>Cenotes, entrances to the world of the dead</strong></p><p>In the 1980's, American archaeologists who were studying the ancient Maya civilization, detected a strange but perfect ring of almost 200 km in diameter in several satellite images of the Yucatan Peninsula.&nbsp;</p><p>The cenotes (from Maya ts'ono'ot: abyss, depth, deep freshwater lake or well), are crystalline water reservoirs, heavily exploited by the Yucatan's tourist industry. Their strange circular arrangement perplexed everyone at the Latin American Symposium on Remote Sensing, held in Acapulco in 1988.</p><p>Adriana Ocampo, a NASA planetary geologist in the audience, suggested considering the impact of an asteroid giant and violent enough to leave such clear traces 65 million years later. That was the beginning of a scientific adventure that led to the theory most widely accepted today:&nbsp;<strong>the ring corresponds to the crater rim caused by a 10 km wide meteor&nbsp;that hit Yucatan with unimaginable force.</strong> Since the 1990s, scientists from Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Asia have joined forces to solve the questions that remain buried, as many of&nbsp;the<strong> mysteries of the Chicxulub crater are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For the ancient Maya, the cenotes were entrances to the<strong> Xibalb\u00e1</strong> (<strong>world of the dead</strong>). In some of them, human skeletons have been found, so it is believed that they served as natural burial chambers or aquatic cemeteries, and that the remains did not always come from human sacrifices (<strong>Fun Fact:</strong> There is a Costco in M\u00e9rida with a cenote in its parking lot).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EA Yucatan emerged from the crater</strong></p><p>In November 2021, a group of 6 Yucatecan professionals from different areas, with several years of volunteering in traditional altruistic causes, discovered in EA a hopeful and promising global movement. This month, our regional <a href=\"https://www.aeyucatan.org/\">EA Yucatan</a> group celebrates its first anniversary and, despite the difficulties we have encountered in adapting EA's ideas to our socioeconomic and cultural context, we have grown in number of members of all ages. The details can be read in the report we are preparing, however, we want to mention here that one of our first intentions, since several of us are professors, was to make EA known in the universities, but we did not do it right away because we received from many people with more experience, a call to prudence and caution (to erroneously transmit the EA message could be worse than not giving it).</p><p>A few months ago, the wonderful mobility dynamics of the EA community made <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/mati_roy\">Mati Roy</a> visit our city, and in a matter of days, we had already planned the first approach with students. As he is part of OpenAI, we asked him to prepare a talk about the risks of AI and give it at the <a href=\"https://www.upy.edu.mx/\">Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Yucat\u00e1n</a> (UPY).&nbsp; He did much better, he prepared a simple but substantial talk on Risks and Hopes of AI, attracting the attention of the 100 young attendees. It was wonderful to see a positive message. That talk was followed by a close conversation with the 15 students who expressed interest through their questions. Mati spent almost 3 hours with them chatting about existential risks, transhumanism and walking under a heavy rain through the halls of the university. You can see Mati's post on fb <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09/posts/pfbid02u8CYSP8aY8T9YGMiotZiuKCZAfNFLAvRA5tNn2G1eHY5XphaBrFecmd6bt48fqgkl\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Why starting at UPY</strong></p><p>The Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Yucat\u00e1n is a public university, decentralized from the Government of Yucat\u00e1n, which operates under a Bilingual, International and Sustainable (BIS) model, and offers degrees in different fields of technology. The BIS model is an avant-garde model in higher education in Mexico that responds to international trends, unique in Latin America. This model is highly oriented to the global development of students that will enable them to be professionals of the world, with a high command of the English language, an international vision, and a broad sense of sustainability. Under this scheme, UPY offers 4 engineering programs: Cybersecurity, Embedded Systems, Computational Robotics and Data.</p><p>The concept of sustainability is incorporated in the architectural design, use of energy-saving construction materials, water reuse practices, rainwater harvesting, recycling, use of solar and wind energy, and planting of green areas to mitigate CO2 emissions. In this beautiful space nestled in the Yucatecan jungle, it is common to observe young people removing insects from the path so that they are not trampled, or guiding the various animals that occasionally approach the classrooms towards nature.</p><p>The BIS system, the level of English achieved by the students about to graduate, and the technological careers, made UPY an interesting option to introduce the EA ideas.</p><p><strong>The EA-UPY Club is born</strong></p><p>A short time after the talk with Mati, about a dozen students joined and formalized the creation of the EA-UPY Club. Almost 3 months after its formation, they have met every Sunday to read and discuss EA content; have chatted with interesting people like Sabin Roman from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/\">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER)</a> and <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/Cassidy13K\">Cassandra Kind</a> from <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/singularity-group-net/\">The Singularity Group</a>; have participated in EAGx Virtual where they made new contacts; have applied to the EAG-Berkeley event (waiting for a response); are ready to apply to EAGx Latin America and; of course, have collaborated in the research and writing of this article. So, this is a document written by 24 hands! Most of them are about to graduate and have expressed that these first contacts with EA have made them rethink their lives and careers. They are eager to discover the options they have to carry out this transformation.</p><p><strong>Why the Yucatecan perspective is valuable</strong></p><p>In many ways, <strong>Yucatan is unique</strong>, because phenomena of different nature have shaped and continue to shape the imaginary and mental structure of the Yucatecans. The impact of the meteorite, the presence of the cenotes, being descendants of the Mayan culture, which among its great discoveries we can mention the conceptual development of the number zero and the creation of a calendar, that was the most accurate of the time. Yucatecan Maya, the language spoken in the Peninsula, is a<strong> time capsule for those who decide to look inside</strong>. Linked to that, Yucatan Scientific Research Center has a <strong>Germplasm Bank where native seeds are protected</strong>.</p><p>It is in this region where the first mestizo was conceived and also the last region to succumb to the various attempts of Spanish conquest, as the last rebellion of the Mayan against the divine caste (the name given to the whites) culminated in the early twentieth century, an event known as the Caste War. Likewise, it was in Yucatan where the first Socialist Government of America was established, under the command of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, member of the Socialist Party of the Southeast, who also founded the first university in the southeast of Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p>In more recent years, Yucatan has consolidated its position as the safest region in Latin America. Merida, the capital of southeastern Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula, is a place where many digital nomads are arriving. Existential Risks scholars might find it attractive to put an office inside the Chicxulub crater ;)&nbsp;</p><p>While recognizing that, as part of a developing country, Yucatan has many problems to solve, the events mentioned above (just to cite a few), show us that Yucatan has a unique way of thinking, perspective and way of life that must be integrated into the <strong>epistemic diversity</strong> of the EA movement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Finally\u2026</strong></p><p>From what has been described here, it is a fact that Yucatan holds wonders in all its corners. From being the epicenter of one of the most important events in the history of life on Earth, to diverse social and historical phenomena that changed the course of many human generations. We, the members of EA Yucatan and EA UPY, are proud of our roots and the possibilities they have provided to us. Therefore, we are determined to help change the course of our history as a species, offering our creative, scientific, and technological skills to the service of those who are most in need at a global level. It will be a pleasure to collaborate with the entire Effective Altruism community in their future projects and events. We look forward to seeing you soon. <strong>A warm hug and greetings from the EA Yucatan and EA UPY groups!</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/dhzicbykatvvdbzapzy5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/hj8bsp4cifxcrgei8byo.jpg 590w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/tvfvhohdtq8gq9w23l1u.jpg 1180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/towm7yx5mj1ckcgi0wje.jpg 1770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/mbgxzcovxxh01lzf7ucr.jpg 2360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/regqxmljic83hkahktq3.jpg 2950w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/frmn9ic5l1u07jzikuko.jpg 3540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/hexnddyavsebb3dmwvha.jpg 4130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/ayjcdxrzgpl77jkpnej8.jpg 4720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/o8a0jalefns9vxtljbdq.jpg 5310w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676964172/mirroredImages/sEJLsCwAGeLDqXaX4/wbaktxamtnzqeijsrzdh.jpg 5867w\"><figcaption>Chicxulub Port, Yucat\u00e1n, Nov 13 2022</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>Arrellano Catal\u00e1n, O.

Fraud becomes a crime when it is a \u201cknowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary). In other words, if you lie in order to deprive a person or organization of their money or property, you\u2019re committing fraud.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>The Fraud Triangle (pre-requisites of fraud as defined in CFE website)</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:300px\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668448261/mirroredImages/h7gnYAvEpqBxAr3Wr/wvoszysvb6jdi1hm1ci6.jpg\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The Fraud Triangle hypothesizes that if all three components are present \u2014 unshareable financial need, perceived opportunity and rationalization \u2014 a person is highly likely to pursue fraudulent activities.</p><h2>Categories of Fraud as defined in CFE website:</h2><blockquote><h3><br>Against individuals&nbsp;</h3><p>This is when a single person is targeted by a fraudster \u2014 including identity theft, phishing scams and \u201cadvance-fee\u201d schemes. Perhaps one of the most noteworthy and devastating individual frauds is the Ponzi scheme.&nbsp;</p><h3>Internal organizational fraud</h3><p>Sometimes called \u201coccupational fraud,\u201d this is when an employee, manager or executive of an organization deceives the organization itself. Think embezzlement, cheating on taxes, and lying to investors and shareholders.&nbsp;</p><h3>External organizational fraud</h3><p>This includes fraud committed against an organization from the outside, such as vendors who lie about the work they did, demand bribes from employees and rig costs. But customers sometimes defraud organizations, such as when they submit bad checks or try to return knock-off or stolen products. And increasingly, technology threatens organizations with theft of intellectual property or customer information.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again, it requires more people thinking correctly to build the future.

So you might not extend him the same trust that I do. But: Sam doesn\u2019t have a history of lying on the record. Even at this point in time, when the muckrakers of the world are busy scrutinizing every deed he\u2019s done, I don\u2019t see any allegations of the form \u201che lied about this thing\u201d. \u201cTruthful, but mistaken\u201d seems like a better model for SBF than \u201cmasterful schemer\u201d.

Because \u201cdon\u2019t do fraud\u201d is a good heuristic to propagate, but \u201cdon\u2019t make mistakes\u201d is not.</p><p>It\u2019s really, really easy to pick apart other people\u2019s mistakes, especially after the fact. If you\u2019re a public figure making 10 good decisions and 1 bad one, a critic can jump in with \u201clook at that mistake! It was such a mistake! I would never had made that mistake!\u201d Oftentimes, the critic is even correct! But: in the same position, they would have made 2 other bad decisions, ones that weren\u2019t even on their radar. From <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2021/02/07/why-i-am-not-in-charge/\">Zvi Mowshowitz on what would be difficult about being \u201cin charge\u201d during Covid</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\u2026You can do better by taking a market price or model output as a baseline, then taking into account a bias or missing consideration. Thus, you can be&nbsp;<i>much worse</i>&nbsp;at creating the right answer from scratch, and yet do better than the consensus answer.</p><p>Think of this as trying someone\u2019s fifteen-step chocolate chip cookie recipe, then noticing that it would be better with more chocolate chips. You might have better cookies, but you should not then claim that you are the superior baker.</p></blockquote><p>If you, right now, are sitting on a high horse, saying \u201cit\u2019s so obvious; just don\u2019t take customer deposits and gamble with them\u201d\u2026 guess what, you do not understand how complex systems break. There is no special ability to know which of your many decisions might be the one that causes it all go kaput. I\u2019ve witnessed and responded to my fair share of outages at Google and Manifold, and very often dumb things led to these outages\u2014 but you\u2019ll never know <i>which</i> of your actions are the dumb ones. While you were editing a config file that later broke the site, you didn\u2019t sit back and think \u201chm, maybe this will crash the site, I should look at it carefully\u201d. That change looked no different than the twenty other changes you made this week, all of which were fine and good.</p><h3>2. On loyalty</h3><p>Whether this blowup was caused by intentional deception or an honest mistake, the EA community has been extremely quick to change its tune. In less than a week, everyone has gone from \u201cSBF, golden boy\u201d to \u201cWhat a criminal, don\u2019t be like that guy\u201d. EA leaders have posted <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT/a-personal-statement-on-ftx\">denunciations</a> of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mCCutDxCavtnhxhBR/some-comments-on-recent-ftx-related-events#Separate_from_the_details_of_the_FTX_situation__do_you_think_that_fraud_could_be_justified_if_it_raises_huge_amounts_of_money_for_good_causes_\">fraud</a>, and distanced themselves from Sam; the most upvoted all-time EA Forum post is a community condemnation; the entire Future Fund team <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1\">up and resigned</a>.</p><p>To be fair, the rest of the world is dogpiling on him too. <a href=\"https://coingape.com/this-dude-is-full-of-shit-elon-musk-shares-his-impression-of-sbf-in-a-twitter-space/\">Elon Musk called Sam \u201cfull of shit\u201d</a>; Sequoia <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-investor-sequoia-removes-sam-bankman-fried-profile-2022-11\">deleted their glowing profile of SBF published one month ago</a>; Miami took the FTX name off their arena.</p><p>But from EA folks, this behavior strikes me as cowardly, coldhearted, opportunistic, bandwagon-y, two-faced and distasteful. I am extremely confused, because these EA leaders are some of the smartest and \u201cgood-est\u201d people in the world, whose work I respect and admire, who have shaped the way I think. So it\u2019s very possible that I\u2019m just in the wrong here, but\u2026</p><p>Whatever happened to loyalty? To supporting those who have helped you in the past? Are EA folks only fair-weather friends, happy to accept your money in good times but also ready to eviscerate you to maintain deniability and a glossy PR sheen? What distinguishes altruism from selfishness is \u201cbeing good to people who cannot help you back\u201d. It is extremely suspicious that EA as a whole was happy to laud praise on SBF while the money was flowing, and then turn their backs as soon as it was clear the gravy train dried up.</p><p>Having a scout mindset is good; updating your beliefs about SBF in light of new evidence is good; but there is such a thing as updating too far. Sure, the community should call out the bad, but have we up and forgotten about every good thing that SBF have accomplished, <strong>especially</strong> for EA? Every point in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027181005/https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/\">the deleted Sequoia article</a> is still true.</p><p>SBF:</p><ul><li>Is a committed vegan</li><li>Earned to give while at Jane Street</li><li>Led CEA for a few months</li><li>Sent money to Ukrainians in time of need</li><li>Incubated hundreds of millions worth of good longtermist causes through Future Fund and related spending on eg Anthropic</li></ul><p>Take a step back: what are we assessing here? If the question is \u201cshould I associate with a person who has this track record, and also once fraudulently misused customer money, but has repented and is trying as hard as possible to fix it\u201d\u2026 the answer seems like a clear yes to me. And as a prosaic consideration, I continue to believe that Sam and the rest of the FTX leadership team are extremely talented and aligned people. Even with tarnished reputations today, I expect them to accomplish good and great things. To jump immediately to cutting ties seems like a large strategic error.</p><p>And on a personal note, I aspire to create a lot of value for the world, and direct it towards doing lots of good. Call me overconfident, but I expect to be a billionaire someday. The way EA treats SBF here sets a precedence: if the EA community is happy to accept money when the going is good, but then is ready to cut ties once the money dries up\u2026 you can guess how excited I would be to contribute in the first place.</p><h3>3. On ambition</h3><p>Imagine a world in which things had gone a little differently. In World 2, CZ never triggered a bank run on FTX because he got locked out of his Twitter account. Alameda repays its debts and continues on to print money. In 2025, FTX is stable and worth hundreds of billions as the world\u2019s largest online brokerage \u2014 and then the news breaks that three years ago, Sam willfully took a risky gamble using customer funds to keep FTX and Alameda both afloat. What would your reaction be? Would you denounce fraud, demand that customers be compensated (how much?), ask Sam to step down?</p><p>Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx, famously gambled his company\u2019s entire bank account at a casino in order to keep deliveries going:</p><blockquote><p><i>I asked Fred where the funds had come from, and he responded, \u2018The meeting with the General Dynamics board was a bust and I knew we needed money for Monday, so I took a plane to Las Vegas and won $27,000.\u2019 I said, \u2018You mean you took our last $5,000-- how could you do that?\u2019 He shrugged his shoulders and said, \u2018What difference does it make? Without the funds for the fuel companies, we couldn't have flown anyway.\u2019 Fred's luck held again. It was not much, but it came at a critical time and kept us in business for another week.</i></p></blockquote><p>Of course, these two stories aren\u2019t exactly the same; betting investor/company money is different than betting money entrusted to you for other purposes. But I can\u2019t help but think that if SBF\u2019s plan had worked, and he was still EA\u2019s rich uncle financing our ventures, we would be applauding him for bravado and wisdom in making that call. It feels like EA is punishing SBF not for being unethical, but for being unlucky.</p><p>(Crucially: I think that it is correct to consistently support him in our world and World 2. You can also be consistent by saying that EA should denounce him in both worlds. But if you believe the latter \u2014 tell me, how much did you know about crypto, exchanges, or trading firms before last week?)</p><p>Risk-taking and ambition are two sides of the same coin. If you swarm to denouncing risks that failed, you do not understand what it takes to succeed. My very subjective sense of people in the EA community is that we are much more likely to fail due to insufficient ambition than too much risk-taking, especially without the support and skillset of the FTX team.</p><h3>Appendix</h3><p><strong>Disclaimers</strong>: Manifold received a $1m investment and $500k grant through the FTX Future Fund.

Apologies for the introductory tone as this is copied from my substack. I take inspiration from Tyler Cowen's call for Talent (which is an art form) as a bulwark against existential risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>I. Enter the Void</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, SBF, a young crypto billionaire and philanthropist saw his fortune and reputation crash. The celebrated effective altruist and major donor to the Democratic party proved insolvent when his rival and ex-friend, CZ, publicly dumped millions of dollars worth of FTX\u2019s \u201cFTT\u201d tokens (proving them worthless). In some ways, the fall from grace is a typical Aristotelian tragedy. But much still remains unclear\u2014how much of SBF\u2019s folly was the result of regular human weakness (a gambling addiction spun out of control, leading to a death spiral), typical grift and hypocrisy (using donations and moral language as cover for a premeditated scam), or ideological purity (the aggressive approach to risk was \u201cjustified\u201d by some expected value calculus intended to help the world)? As Finance writer Matt Levine tells us, SBF has been frank for a long time that he is \u201cin the ponzi business\u201d\u2014in some speculative industries like crypto this is par for the course, as you only succeed if you get millions of users to trust you <i>before </i>you can genuinely assure them that they should. Finance writer Byrne Hobart has a good rule of thumb: \u201cThere are no hard and fast rules, but Read Matt Levine and try not to do things that would lead you to getting written about by Matt Levine.\u201d</p><p>If you dig into the story, there are some oddities about the company culture at FTX and Alameda (the hedge fund to which he was self-dealing), which was based out of a luxury property in the Bahamas: a widespread encouragement of Amphetamines and sleeping pills, polyamory, and a cult-like org structure. You don\u2019t need to impute malice to see how a cocktail of delayed adolescence, combined with a sense of being \u201coff-shore,\u201d a feeling of (self-)righteousness, and a commitment to disagreeableness, might lead to delusions of grandeur, and eventual disgrace. Although it is not so different a story than that of any financial scam, what stands out is the image of youth. These were not people in suits trading mortgage debt, but college nerds in Hawaii shirts convincing celebrities from Tom Brady to Bill Clinton that their tokens are the future.</p><h2>II. The Consequences of Consequentialism</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m telling you the story of SBF and FTX as I understand it, not because I enjoy gossip and want to draw you into it, but because there\u2019s a philosophical and sociological feature to the story that makes it worthy of attention. SBF was the poster-child for the Effective Altruist movement, a school of thought devoted to \u201cdoing the most good.\u201d On the face of it, scamming people and erasing 32 billion dollars of wealth, including money tagged for philanthropic causes, is probably neither effective nor altruistic. In terms of PR for the effective altruism movement, alone, it\u2019s a drag. Still, you might argue the other side\u2014if SBF thought he had a 10% chance at a trillion dollars or more and planned to give it all away, maybe he thought it was worth the risk. Surely, $100 Billion in probabilistic terms to fight pandemics and prevent existential risk is worth rolling the dice? He got unlucky this time, but if you run the simulation, he still did the rational (and noble) thing.</p><p>SBF\u2019s EA allies have been quick to denounce. Will MacAskill, who purportedly convinced Sam as an MIT undergrad to join the EA cause, writes that dishonesty is bad.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218014707671040\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668439543/mirroredImages/yaC7KqZ3zkzXXuyCD/kua5mdalh21bdciy70hj.jpg\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218014707671040\">William MacAskill @willmacaskill</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218014707671040\">This is a thread of my thoughts and feelings about the actions that led to FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, and the enormous harm that was caused as a result, involving the likely loss of many thousands of innocent people\u2019s savings.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218014707671040\">11:55 PM \u2219 Nov 11, 2022</a></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218014707671040\">2,173Likes312Retweets</a></p><p>But is dishonesty bad? The whole thrust of the \u201ceffective\u201d in effective altruism is that you should do what works. Why, from a consequentialist point of view, is lying bad? It seems like it would be bad only if you got caught or if it led you to become comfortable lying too often which then eventually led to getting caught. B<a href=\"https://betonit.substack.com/p/singer-and-the-noble-lie?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=820634&amp;post_id=75227499&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">ryan Caplan argues that Peter Singer must believe it is ok to lie to save lives</a>, and that includes lying about the repugnant conclusions to which one\u2019s philosophy leads (for example, in the case of a doctor who knowingly but surreptitiously kills one person during a surgery to save five others by using the dead man\u2019s organs). My point here is not to doubt MacAskill\u2019s genuineness or to suggest that all consequentialists support esoteric morality, but to question how the effective altruism movement can reasonably have it both ways. Why should common sense morality matter to a strict utilitarian? Is there a way to throw common sense morality to the winds without becoming an SBF? How is that line drawn?</p><p>Here is Tyler Cowen on how bad optics for Effective Altruism will lead it to scale back its ambition:</p><blockquote><p>I do anticipate a boring short-run trend, where most of the EA people scurry to signal their personal association with virtue ethics.&nbsp; Fine, I understand the reasons for doing that, but at the same time grandma, in her attachment to common sense morality, is not telling you to fly to Africa to save the starving children (though you should finish everything on your plate).&nbsp; Nor would she sign off on Singer (1972).&nbsp; While I disagree with the sharper forms of EA, I also find them more useful and interesting than the namby-pamby versions.</p></blockquote><p>I think Cowen\u2019s point is that effective altruism is going to have high variance, and it\u2019s not clear that you can avoid an SBF without also defanging and neutering the other impulses of the movement. It\u2019s a package.</p><h3>III. Utilitarianism as Secular Religion</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One reason I\u2019m interested in this stuff is that I think Effective Altruism as a kind of secular religion (which isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t some religious EAs). It offers meaning, purpose, a set of directives, and a set of ceremonies and narratives and leaders that come to fill the hole left by traditional religion, particularly amongst so-called \u201crationalists.\u201d In some ways, EA and utilitarianism, generally conceived, are just a particular expression of Enlightenment values. But in other way they are responses to Nietzsche\u2019s death of God\u2014instead of accepting that life is meaningless now that science and rationality have thrown out \u201csuperstition,\u201d they\u2019ve gone ahead and turned themselves into gods. If the classical God of medieval times was once omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient, now the goal is to attain that potency (efficacy) and goodness for oneself. As Nietzsche wrote, \u201cIf God exists, how can I bear not to be him?\u201d</p><p>A basic premise of both Effective Altruism and Utilitarianism is that human beings have the ability to know and measure what\u2019s good. This premise is challenged by traditional pre-Enlightenment societies in several ways. 1) Only God has total knowledge, so human attempts to engineer the good will fail as we oversimplify. 2) Many goods are non-fungible. You can\u2019t abstract all goods into a common currency and then speak of them as having a common value, whether that\u2019s in dollars, utils, or FTT tokens. Value pluralism comes out of the notion that various goods are incommensurate. You can\u2019t just put everything into a spreadsheet and see what it spits out, and the reason isn\u2019t just limited knowledge (1) but also ontology (2), the world was designed to have a certain level of diversity. The desire to overcome that diversity through a common language or system of value is just a recapitulation of the Tower of Babel.</p><p>Here is Tyler Cowen again:</p><blockquote><p>Hardly anyone associated with Future Fund saw the existential risk to\u2026Future Fund, even though they were as close to it as one could possibly be.</p><p>I am thus skeptical about their ability to predict existential risk more generally, and for systems that are far more complex and also far more distant.&nbsp; And, it turns out, many of the real sources of existential risk boil down to hubris and human frailty and imperfections (the humanities remain underrated).&nbsp; <strong>When it comes to existential risk, I generally prefer to invest in talent and good institutions, rather than trying to fine-tune predictions about existential risk itself.</strong></p></blockquote><p>The biggest existential risk to humanity may be the hubris in thinking we can build something like a common project that might mitigate it. This is one reason why the Humanities matter\u2014the study of stories like Babel help protect us from erring too much to the scientific and technocratic.</p><p>Cowen recently wrote a book on <i>Talent </i>in which he says that picking and cultivating talent is an art not a science. Paired with the above point, we learn that the bottleneck to progress is not scientific progress, but humanistic progress, the ability to produce great art, to think like an artist, to interpret the world as though it were a work of art, not a math problem.</p><p>This is one of the central teachings of Hans Georg-Gadamer whose <i>Truth and Method</i> bemoans our culture of treating cultural challenges as engineering ones.</p><p>If EA is to be successful, ironically put, it must temper its own confidence. It must commit to learning the art of interpretation. It must commit to admitting the world\u2019s problems as interpretive ones. That means going beyond the logic of how many malaria nets can I buy with this many hours of work on Jane Street. (Gadamer won\u2019t say this is wrong, just that it can\u2019t be exhaustive of the way we think about value, work, or bettering the world).</p><p>I am more convinced, as Tyler is, and here I am talking my own book, that art and religion matter and that an over-reliance on statistics and so-called rationalism just leads to bad religion and bad art.</p><h2>IV. The Case For Moderation</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Enlightenment project, if it can be properly executed, has many pros, and I\u2019m a beneficiary of many of them. But let\u2019s not forget that the Enlightenment, in practice, is rarely executed well. Kant, Hegel, and Marx didn\u2019t usher in a world of radical egalitarianism. Instead they provided an intellectual prologue to several world wars + Stalinism. The Enlightenment wasn\u2019t a straight line of moral progress, but also created a backlash in the counter-Enlightenment. Reason, over-emphasized, gave rise to an equally diffident fideism, emphasizing blind and absurd faith (Jacobi, Kierkegaard), or reliance on nationalist spirit (Herder, Fichte). Perhaps a middle way might have allowed reason and faith, critique and custom to co-exist rather than lead to a zero-sum battle.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZoharAtkins/status/1591819178700595203\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668439543/mirroredImages/yaC7KqZ3zkzXXuyCD/dcwivghrb22ljj70hvaj.jpg\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZoharAtkins/status/1591819178700595203\">Zohar Atkins @ZoharAtkins</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZoharAtkins/status/1591819178700595203\">A small dose of irrationality may be an effective vaccine against greater irrationality conducted in the name of rationality.

It is irrational, in fact, and paradoxically, to think we can extricate ourselves from irrationality, and it is dangerous, moreover, because it leads to denial. To the extent that SBF presided over a cult it was a unique one\u2014the cult of justifying oneself not in terms of divine prophecy, but in terms of Enlightenment values. The shock here is that we expect religious scandal and hypocrisy involving the sacred. But what happens when rationality itself is so warped that it becomes no different?</p><p>The spiritual solution is not failsafe, but involves whatever practice and worldview can lead to humility. Typically, this role is played by some sense of God as transcendent. In Jewish terms, this is what is meant by \u201cyirat shamayim.\u201d But the practical-social solution is that we should probably tolerate a bit more irrationality in ourselves and others so as to accept upon ourselves the recognition that we are limited and so as to protect ourselves from the greater risk of thinking we can totally shake off irrationality. I won\u2019t prescribe the dosage here, but we should be pluralistic\u2014it\u2019s time we stop judging communities through Enlightened eyes and ask ourselves if perhaps the inefficacy and even lack of altruism in those communities might not be more effective and altruistic in the end than living a life in accordance with the principles of Peter Singer.</p><p>A set of contradictory and competing values might provide the necessary set of checks and balances needed to offset the maniacal elevation of any one ethical theory or style, be it virtue ethics, deontology, or effective altruism. Perhaps the debate we need to have is about the equilibrium between these, rather than the assumption that any of them alone is optimal.</p><h3>V. Polyamory</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m probably over-generalizing but I don\u2019t think the polyamory is incidental to the story of SBF or FTX (and the \u201crationality\u201d community more broadly). I think that monogamy is an acceptance of limits in many senses, and that this is good for character and good for society. Polyamory may work for a handful of young individuals in the Bay Area\u2014I\u2019ll keep an open mind here\u2014but it would be a terrible way to organize society as a whole. To the extent that the principles behind it are idealistic, utopian even, it seems like it is ripe for abuse and cult-like manipulation. Free-love in theory will not overcome human vice, but simply provide cover for it, just as EA as an ideology ended up leading to SBF\u2019s self-justification of fraud in the name of holiness. I\u2019d be surprised if Polyamory endures beyond a certain age bracket, which makes me feel that it is largely a form of extended college culture. Perhaps the same can be said of much of crypto in general. To grow up, the crypto and polyamory crowd will have to realize that they need not invent the wheel or rebuild society from first principles; folks in traditional finance and traditional marriage have reckoned with the same problems over centuries and have come up with some relatively wise solutions. From my limited and biased position, I contend that both Polyamory and Crypto do not appreciate Chesterton\u2019s Fence. This is neither financial nor relationship advice. I\u2019d be willing to say the same about effective altruism as well. Optimizing for efficacy and altruism alone will likely take us to zero. But we won\u2019t know we\u2019re in a ponzi until it\u2019s too late. The collapse of civilization is the cultural version of a liquidity crunch. Let\u2019s make sure we are holding some trusted and stable cultural assets in reserve.</p>", "user": {"username": "Zohar Atkins"}}, {"_id": "5D2Nx4vscpAWLiFqB", "title": "When is it impostor syndrome?

In fact, women\u2019s empowerment became very popular in the last decade and NGOs proved to be efficient in this field, helping states eradicate poverty and guarantee gender equality.</p><p>We strongly believe that women should have equal socio-economic, cultural, and political opportunities as men. With this ideology in mind, a successful attempt was made to empower women of the slum area, we provided them with vocational training in sewing which is relevant to their needs, and provides them value-added skills to help them earn additional income for their families to be proud. Women can be the most important catalysts for change in their children\u2019s lives. Vocational Training Programme &amp; <a href=\"https://auroveda.org/support-underprivileged-women-children/\"><strong>NGO Working for Women Empowerment</strong></a> can be the most important catalysts for change in their kids' lives.

Here's a proposal I've heard:</p><blockquote><p>The people SBF was seeking out to run the FTX Foundation should have requested an audit of FTX's finances at the start.</p></blockquote><p>This isn't enough for me to construct a detailed, plausible story for things going better. In particular, I think one of two things would have happened:</p><ul><li>The FTX leadership would have agreed to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sbf_ftx/status/1421354721911115776\">basic audit</a> that wouldn't have uncovered underlying problems (much as the entire finance industry failed to uncover the problems).</li><li>The FTX leadership would have refused to accede to the audit.</li></ul><p>In the first case, the proposal fails at accomplishing its goal.

If FTX leadership had refused, they should have refused to run the FTX Foundation.</p></blockquote><p>This still isn't detailed enough: SBF would have just asked someone else to run the Foundation. It seems like the default outcome is that someone who's a bit worse at the job would have been in charge instead.</p><p>A more detailed proposal:</p><blockquote><p>The people SBF was seeking out to run the FTX Foundation should have requested a thorough, rigorous audit of FTX's finances at the start. If FTX leadership had refused, they should have refused to run the FTX Foundation and made it public that FTX leadership had refused the audit. Then, EA leaders should have discouraged major EA organizations from taking money from the FTX Foundation and promoted a culture of looking down on anyone who took money from the Foundation.</p></blockquote><p>This is starting to get to the point where something could have realistically changed as a result of the actions. Maybe the pressure for transparency would have been strong enough that SBF would have acceded to an audit -- though I still think the audit wouldn't have uncovered anything.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx9qntyd8zi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx9qntyd8zi\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Or maybe he wouldn't have acceded, and for a while EA organizations would have refused his money, before eventually giving in to the significant incentives to take the money. Or maybe they would have refused his money for many years -- in that case, I would question whether criterion (1) is still satisfied (given only information we would have had at the time, remember). But at least we have a somewhat detailed story to argue about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without a detailed story, it's easy to convince yourself that the change you propose would have plausibly averted the disaster we face.

A culture of accountability starts with documenting and taking responsibility in the task of uncertainty and <i>handing real power to people</i> even if it means they can use it against you when you think you haven't done wrong.

Like this post <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sEpWkCvvJfoEbhnsd/the-ftx-crisis-highlights-a-deeper-cultural-problem-within\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sEpWkCvvJfoEbhnsd/the-ftx-crisis-highlights-a-deeper-cultural-problem-within</a> and some of the comments note, &nbsp;EA tends to have &nbsp;aversion to putting <i>institutional safeguards</i> into place and prefers to run things on a trust basis. What all of the responses to crisis and continued existence of bad practices highlight is that <i>there are no real attempts to do anything </i>and instead contests are held, which are nice, but in the end are...contests. Games held at the discretion of the same culture, to cherry-pick whatever is convenient to appear acting, while not really changing anything. And to call out one person and organisation in particular, I found it quite rich that EY derided the red teaming contest and hinted at his own rich set of EA criticism while continually profiting of a system of intransparency, hype and lack of accountability to anyone with MIRI<i>.</i></p><h1>On the purpose of institutions</h1><p>Which serves as a nice segue into the next topic that Abigail touches on in the video: what is the <i>real</i> purpose of institutions? She discusses Stafford Beers perspective of the purpose of an institution being what an institution <i>does</i>. MIRI, to continue the example, provides cushy job with little to no tangible output or interaction with the wider research community to its members - the output of the group would fail any institutional review. &nbsp;Given this and the fact that to date there is not even a clear definition of the problem the group is meant to solve published in a way that has found acceptance or critique in the wider research community (outside of hype machines like OpenAI and Anthropic where OH HEY LOOK, SBF lead a 500e6$ series B round just a while ago), applying the principle would then hint that until we see further evidence, the point of MIRI is exactly this job providing.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, what does EA <i>do</i>? And here I think, EA (in a wider sense) does <i>a lot</i>: if we count GiveWell, the communities actual giving preferences etc. it provides a lot of money flowing to worthwhile causes - like the LIONS club, the rotary club or similar humanitarian social associations. And I think that is a perfectly fine thing to be - the next elites social club, where you can network and find business partners while doing something for the community. Perfectly fine. EA <i>in the narrower sense</i> (i.e. the longtermist and more distinct work) is a bit different though. There, the main focus appears to be...growing the movement, educating and developing the <i>culture</i> and doing ever more cause prioritization...to the degree of losing touch with actually <i>doing</i> much that the broader world would consider impactful, and being under scrutiny even before the FTX topic broke. I served as a facilitator for an impact seminar, and a good chunk of my group mirrored the criticisms lanced in Emile Torres <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk\">https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk</a> &nbsp;article. If EA/longtermism <i>isn't</i> &nbsp;a utilitarian justification for continued wealth inequality,focus on growth now at the cost of seriously addressing climate change and general techno-optimism, then it's doing a poor job at communicating this. <i>Saying</i> EA isn't utilitarian as Will did in his twitter thread isn't worth much if the institutional actions and systems aren't in place to prove this through action. If the world keeps thinking you are a basic utilitarian who will, to paraphrase SBF \"bet the earth for a 51% chance on a second one\", then <i>maybe there's something in your reasoning and actions that makes them think that</i>.</p><h1>Non-performative speech in responses so far</h1><p>Which brings me to pointing out non-performative speech in three posts that triggered me into writing this:</p><ul><li>Wills personal statement: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT/a-personal-statement-on-ftx\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT/a-personal-statement-on-ftx</a>&nbsp;</li><li>evhubs \"fraud is bad actually\": <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHrHsrQGyr4NnqCA7/we-must-be-very-clear-fraud-in-the-service-of-effective\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHrHsrQGyr4NnqCA7/we-must-be-very-clear-fraud-in-the-service-of-effective</a></li><li>Roberts exclamation of disgust: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/txGgPvKgZFpphdkHe/my-reaction-to-ftx-appalled\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/txGgPvKgZFpphdkHe/my-reaction-to-ftx-appalled</a></li></ul><p>First of all, I want to make clear: I'm not shitting on any of these people. I think it's good of will to say some personal stuff even while not having processed enough for an official statement. I think it's good that somebody spells out \"fraud is bad actually\" for those that need it, and evhub says all the right things. And I <i>welcome</i> people expressing emotions - including disgust. And I fully expect all three of the people I will directly speak towards to already be thinking about what I will say - I assume they are smart people, nice people, and I don't want to attack them.</p><p>What this section is about that these personal statements are <i>not enough</i> and a call to the &nbsp;community to not stop at accepting or performing personal statements, denouncing fraud and feeling disgust. Instead, we should demand to <i>actually &nbsp;do something and do so ourselves</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;If we check 80khours \"about us\" section, we find the \"our mistakes section, a favourite symbol of good EAs - but what I'm missing is mission statements, legal charter, some form of commitment to an accountability process.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668468745/mirroredImages/ZxrhehvzGXbKAb9rH/zilggyfcvjhdircbtoep.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2167f0f1cb95b5a1b8da5f06d5b758de6e80ae592dd2f3e5.png/w_155 155w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2167f0f1cb95b5a1b8da5f06d5b758de6e80ae592dd2f3e5.png/w_235 235w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2167f0f1cb95b5a1b8da5f06d5b758de6e80ae592dd2f3e5.png/w_315 315w\"></p><p>Likewise on effective ventures website: no charter linked, nothing about how we can trust them through institutional mechanisms. &nbsp;I hope Rob feels disgusted enough to not just \"trust less across the board\" but to use his position to <i>lobby for institutional safeguards and accountability</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Same for Will and Evan: you hold influence in your respective institutions (especially Will). I hope you (and the community) aren't just satisfied with feeling personally betrayed and your communities and institutions threatened by it, I hope you will actually <i>do things to change the system that enabled this.</i></p><p>Evan, while I can understand how nice it is not to work under deadline pressure and constant scrutiny the extremely opaque and doomsday-culty way that MIRI, OpenAI and it's recent imitators operate by are part of the problem.</p><p>As for Will, I hope that it won't take you <i>months</i> to realize that the guidelines, principles etc. you link are completely empty of mechanisms to enforce and be verified. That whether you think SBF acted withing EA principles or not, there was nothing to seriously challenge him: he was a rich dude doing \"philantropic\" things and for those with capital (be it social or otherwise), there are no control mechanisms being recommended by anything you cited in that thread, nor in any of the EA material I read in the years I've hung out with my local EA group (the call for a better governance norm post goes into more detail here).</p><p>I have been in sporting associations, student associations and open source &nbsp;collectives which were much younger and smaller than EA but had more of these structures - formalized ways of distributing decision making power, of deciding who may or may not associate themselves with the organisation or movement, of electing their official and in-official representatives and leaders and &nbsp;removing bad actors and of keeping track of provenance and availability of committed resources. This stuff isn't rocket science, and for a group that values introspection and carefulness as much as EA/longtermists, these things <i>need to be developed</i>.</p><h1>Methods of accountability: doing the doing</h1><p>Which brings us to the final section: how can we avoid non-performative speech? How can we avoid a big debate on this forum, or in the halls of Trajan House, that results in a <i>firm letter</i> &nbsp;opposing doing bad in the name of EA and <i>urging</i>, <i>URGING</i> members of the community to please not do bad things?</p><p>Well, I'm biased and a single person, but if you want <i>my</i> opinion (and you made it through the post so I guess you either do or are collecting arguments for criticism [that I welcome]), the most important things are</p><ul><li>try to diffuse the soft powers that come with the current \"old boys\" structure of EA:&nbsp;<ul><li>put money in escrow accounts and be transparent about funding source and reliability,</li><li>in fact, make all money flows public as a rule,&nbsp;</li><li>where applicable, publish official charters which have some legal heft to them,&nbsp;</li><li>make the structures of EA more transparent and remove the conflicts of interest that comes from everyone being advisor or board member of one-anothers NGO,</li></ul></li><li>beyond that, <i>dismantle</i> the old boys structure:<ul><li>develop methods of <i>formal</i> ascension through the ranks of EA (with short cuts, you can make this flexible! but it needs to be formalised so there is a tack record)</li><li>democratise said ranks!

Most of you all are lovely people. Evan, Will, Rob, despite being singled out in this post are lovely people trying their hardest. But the one thing that drives me <i>insane</i> is the tendency to pontificate and philosophize about accountability, when most of the charities and associations are not run by their communities, and make no effort to <i>encourage</i> to be run by their communities. Even some Protestants and Catholics have figured out how to do democratic self governance by now by voting in their dioceses and equivalent communities and <i>some</i> are even starting to put accountability and prevention mechanisms into their system. I like the good parts of EA too much and respect the intelligence of the people in this movement too &nbsp;to accept \"it's a young movement\" as an excuse to do worse than these century old, conservative institutions.</p><p>\"Doing Good Better\" - well, then let's do Good, better.</p>", "user": {"username": "eaanon2022"}}, {"_id": "oiEArRjkajAKayMCp", "title": "What might FTX mean for effective giving and EA funding", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T13:24:09.037Z", "htmlBody": "<p>FTX's demise is understandably dominating EA discussion at the moment.

We may find out in the coming months that grantees didn\u2019t consider this risk sufficiently either, for example if they bought fixed assets with significant running costs.</p><p>Funding diversity is important not just to protect the overall amount of funding available to EA. It\u2019s also vital to avoid a very small number of decision-makers having&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@sven_rone/the-effective-altruism-movement-is-not-above-conflicts-of-interest-25f7125220a5#:~:text=By%20relying%20heavily,of%20these%20ideas.\"><u>too much influence</u></a> (even if they don\u2019t want that level of influence in the first place). If we have more sources of funding and more decision-makers, it is likely to improve the overall quality of funding decisions and, critically, reduce the consequences for grantees if they are rejected by just one or two major funders.

So what could we do to try to mitigate the risks of overly concentrated sources of funding?</p><h2>Bring more donors at every level into EA</h2><p>It seems wise to support organizations that can broaden the funding base of EA. Recently, there has been a move to prioritize securing major donors (and, in some extreme cases, to suggest that anything attracting small donors is a waste of time). Seeking more super wealthy donors is a sensible move (see below), but there is a reasonable case for seeking more donors in general at the same time. More donors in EA means more reliable, less volatile funding overall. Additionally, even if the amounts they give seem trivial by comparison, small donors can still make a difference, for example by funging dollars back to larger donors, who can then give more to things that are less popular, more technical or higher risk.&nbsp;</p><p>To this end, we should celebrate, encourage and (most importantly) fund the wide range of projects that attract effective givers - pledge organizations (<a href=\"http://1fortheworld.org\"><u>One for the World</u></a>, where I am Executive Director;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><u>Giving What We Can</u></a>); organizations targeting specific audiences (<a href=\"https://www.highimpactprofessionals.org/\"><u>High Impact Professionals</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://highimpactathletes.org/\"><u>High Impact Athletes</u></a>); and national regranting organizations (there is a fairly comprehensive list&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/tax-deductibility\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p>These organizations not only bring thousands of new donors into EA each year - they also simultaneously increase our chances of finding new major donors, whether those are earning to givers or, rarely, Ultra High Net Worths. Even \u2018entry level\u2019 approaches like the One for the World pledge have uncovered billionaire donor prospects, by exposing enough people to EA that even very rare events become more probable, while also attracting thousands of \u2018grassroots\u2019 givers.</p><p>I\u2019m extremely excited that Open Philanthropy now has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/ea-community-growth-global-health-and-wellbeing/\"><u>dedicated pot of funding and programme officer</u></a> for these sorts of organizations - but the risks of this space relying on a single funder are especially obvious at the moment. Almost all of these organizations have funding gaps right now and report that they have significant funding insecurity. You can directly improve the funding diversity and security of many of these organizations today. If you would like to donate to one or more of the above, please DM me.</p><p>(It would also be amazing if effective giving could be a more prominent part of EA Groups outreach, but I discussed this in some detail previously&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9sF6Gs95EmjK2nXGQ/why-your-ea-group-should-promote-effective-giving-and-how#Giving_does_not_mean_you_cannot_pursue_the_full_range_of_EA_activities\"><u>here</u></a>. For some of those who made counterarguments there, the calculus may now have shifted.)</p><h2>Seek more Ultra High Net Worth (e.g. billionaire) funders</h2><p>I also think we need explicitly to target more Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) donors. [UPDATE: for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/14/jeff-bezos-fortune-dolly-parton-amazon-climate-crisis\"><u>this guy</u></a>.]&nbsp;</p><p>One reaction to recent events might be to swear off these funders entirely. I\u2019m really supportive of diversification of EA and keen to grow the movement, and understand that super rich figureheads may run counter to these goals. I\u2019m also very conscious of the general reputational risks of being too closely associated any specific individual or industry, or with billionaires in general.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it seems unlikely that EA cause areas could ever get the&nbsp;<i>majority</i> of their funds from small dollar donors, unless overall amount available decreased dramatically. Almost all funding obeys the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/80-20-rule.asp\"><u>Pareto principle</u></a> - and even movements that have tried to prioritize small dollar donors still receive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/api-gateway/apsa/assets/orp/resource/item/5e1f540bcd361a001afed264/original/small-dollar-donors-and-the-evolving-democratic-party.pdf\"><u>most of their funding</u></a> from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/us/politics/democrats-dark-money-donors.html\"><u>a few massive ones</u></a> in reality. So I suspect that avoiding UHNW fundraising entirely would be net negative. (Side note: if there are counterexamples, I\u2019d be very interested to learn about them in the comments.)</p><p>On one level, saying \u201crecruit more massive donors\u201d sounds pretty facile. The benefits are fairly self-evident - more individual UHNW donors means more funding in total and, critically, less reliance on any one person\u2019s wealth - but the execution is hard. However, I think there is some value to having this as an explicit EA goal; and to committing resources to projects that can help attract UHNW donors.</p><p>We need to recognize that each individual UHNW funder is inherently risky if their wealth is bound up in a small number of companies, whose value can change very quickly. I have heard some suggestions that a lesson from FTX\u2019s demise is to diversify the assets of existing major funders. But this often isn\u2019t controllable - asking FTX founders to sell FTX and diversify their wealth not only could have crashed the price of the company, it also would have been a significant barrier to convincing them to donate. It\u2019s also not always good in expectation - holding on to significant chunks of stock can massively increase the amount of capital you can deploy in the future. As a result, finding more individual sources of massive funding is a more practical route to reducing risk than trying to restructure the wealth of existing donors.</p><p>Our best shot at achieving this would seem to be celebrating and funding efforts that are likely to generate interest from new UHNW donors. These include projects like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.generationpledge.org/\"><u>Generation Pledge</u></a> (which explicitly targets billionaire inheritors),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/\"><u>Founder\u2019s Pledge</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\"><u>GiveWell</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivegiving.org/about-us/\"><u>Effective Giving</u></a>. Each of these has the potential to bring new massive donors into the EA space - and, while most of them are adequately resourced, some have significant funding gaps or have small enough budgets that you can make a difference even as a small dollar donor.</p><h2>Celebrate and encourage earning to give</h2><p>A third reform I\u2019d like to see is a refreshed focus on and celebration of earning to give. While FTX funding was still available, it\u2019s understandable that earning to give seemed less impactful&nbsp;<i>on the margin</i>. But, in general, earn to givers are incredibly useful and impactful (and remained so throughout FTX\u2019s rise and fall). They give amounts that can be extremely significant to small organizations. They can also funge not-insignificant funds back to major institutional donors if they donate to e.g. GiveWell charities; and they are often willing to fund things that are higher risk or less popular (e.g. meta charity start-ups). They also have a tiny chance of turning into mega donors, as Sam Bankman-Fried was for a period.</p><p>In general, I want to be forward-looking in this post. However, I do want to draw attention retrospectively to the apparent marginalization of earn to givers in recent years. I spent time with some earning to give people at EAG London 2021 and they&nbsp;<i>all</i> reported that they felt completely undervalued at the conference. One person, who is both an earn to giver and sits on the Board of more than one EA organization, had their initial application to the conference rejected - and the earning to give meetup was almost exclusively people considering doing it rather than people actually doing it, which suggests it\u2019s possible that earn to givers were systematically not invited or rejected.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if earning to give becomes less valuable on the margin, and even as our priorities have evolved to give more weight to direct work, we have to acknowledge how&nbsp;<i>profoundly virtuous</i> earning to give is. It was really gut-wrenching to see people who acted on EA\u2019s best advice in its early years, and who have made huge sacrifices in their own material wealth to help other people, feeling like there wasn\u2019t a place for them at one of EA\u2019s biggest conferences and generally feeling like \u2018yesterday\u2019s news\u2019 when talking to delegates.</p><p>To this end, I was delighted to see the founding of High Impact Professionals to provide a community for those earning to give; and discussions with Open Philanthropy are ongoing about how best to nurture the effective giving space with some dedicated staff, an annual retreat and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>I would love us to refresh our commitment to celebrate those who earn to give, whether that\u2019s in systemic ways, like representation at EA events, or just in our personal interactions. They are people who work incredibly hard and then voluntarily give away hundreds of thousands, and sometimes millions, of dollars that they could spend on themselves.</p><h1>We should retain awareness around optics, in good times and bad</h1><p>It seems fair to say that the massive opportunity of a large influx of funding led us to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HWaH8tNdsgEwNZu8B/free-spending-ea-might-be-a-big-problem-for-optics-and\"><u>take optics less seriously</u></a> in the last year. This seems particularly unfortunate now that the source of funding has dried up, and we are seeing further reputational damage to EA as the FTX saga unfolds.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to suggest&nbsp;<i>at all</i> that these were easy decisions at the time. It doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that disbursing funding quickly and (arguably) somewhat liberally was a bad idea in expectation, just because FTX has now failed.</p><p>I do think, however, that we should consider carefully steps we might take next time to mitigate reputational risks to EA. Again, I want to emphasize that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s straightforward to weigh up the benefits of disbursing funding really quickly versus using a slower, more structured approach. But it might seem a good rule of thumb to err on the side of registering charitable foundations to disburse grants; to avoid putting single donors on a huge pedestal inside and outside the community; and to try to avoid major sources of funding being publicly tied to any one individual or industry.</p><p>These sorts of reforms might avoid some of the issues we\u2019re now grappling with, where FTX grantees&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BesfLENShzSMeb7Xi/community-support-given-ftx-situation?commentId=QrEB5q35LxCAPqFvH\"><u>could plausibly be subject to clawbacks of their funding in a way that wouldn\u2019t apply if FTX had made grants from a charitable vehicle</u></a>; and where FTX\u2019s failure might cause significant reputational damage to EA by association. If calling a fund \u2018The Future Fund\u2019 rather than \u2018FTX Future Fund\u2019 helps mitigate this risk, it seems worth doing.&nbsp;</p><p>To make this point a bit facetiously, Open Philanthropy Project isn\u2019t called 'The Facebook-Asana Fund' and hasn\u2019t seen its reputation affected by scandals at Meta, for example. It's also noticeable that Dustin Moskovitz has received relatively little adulation and exposure inside and outside EA since becoming a mega donor.</p><p>I find it notable that very few of the UHNW fundraisers above (Generation Pledge most of all, but also Founder\u2019s Pledge, GiveWell etc.) mention Effective Altruism&nbsp;<i>almost at all</i> on their websites. Staff at several of them have told me directly that this is because of EA\u2019s mixed reputation. This seems like a further reason to consider optics more carefully, especially if we are able to secure significant influxes of funding in the future - if we seem to have gone off-piste in utilizing one funder, we might inadvertently discourage other funders from getting involved [UPDATE: again, for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/14/jeff-bezos-fortune-dolly-parton-amazon-climate-crisis\"><u>this guy</u></a>.]</p><h1>We need to retain nuance in discussions around funding, in good times and bad</h1><p>When FTX first announced the FTX Future Fund, it represented a major change in Effective Altruism.

In general, the most efficient way to predict the behavior of a complex agent in an environment is to run it in that exact environment.

To quote \"<a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES11-00211.1\">The limits to prediction in ecological systems</a>\" by Beckage et al.:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAn ecological system changes through time, updating its state continuously, and the process of system evolution can be thought of as computation\u2026Our use of the term \u2018system evolution' is much broader in meaning than biological evolution, and also includes changes in abundance, location and interactions between individuals irrespective of species, and the interface between the biotic and abiotic components of the system, e.g., flux of nutrients, water, etc. Predictive models, then, are able to forecast the future state of the system before the system performs the intermediate computations to reach its updated state. An astronomical model, for example, might predict the earth's position and orientation relative to the sun millions of years into the future, without the need for the solar system to perform the intervening computations. The intervening computations that the system performs can be circumvented to predict its future state. The astronomical model might, for example, be used to predict the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of insolation on earth, which describes the past orbital forcing of the climate system, for comparison with paleoclimatic data (e.g., EPICA community members 2004).\"</p></blockquote><p>Unlike astronomical systems, however, ecological systems often have <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/\">computationally irreducible</a> dynamics.</p><blockquote><p>\"Computational irreducibility refers to systems where the intervening computations cannot be bypassed using a simplified model. The dynamics of a system that is computationally irreducible cannot be predicted without allowing for the actual evolution of the system\u2026A simplified model that can predict the future state of the system does not exist. Thus, the only way to ascertain the future state of the system is to allow the system to evolve on its own characteristic time scale. Computational irreducibility does not imply that the underlying processes are stochastic or chaotic, but that they are complex. The complexity can be manifested through high levels of contingency, interactions among system components, and nonlinearity. In fact, systems that evolve according to simple deterministic processes with exactly-known initial conditions can give rise to a complex state evolution that cannot be exactly predicted except by allowing the system to evolve in real time\u2026Computational irreducibility, furthermore, may be a fundamental characteristic of some systems and does not merely reflect a shortcoming of proposed models or modeling techniques. This implies that the intrinsic predictability of these systems is inherently low.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The computational irreducibility of ecological systems is due to \u201c(1) the difficulty of pre-stating the relevant features of the niche, (2) the complexity of ecological communities, and (3) their potential to enable novel system states (e.g., niche creation).\u201d As a result, the inherent predictability of ecological systems out-of-distribution is generally low. Some compelling examples of this phenomenon include the inherent unpredictability of how ecological systems will respond to future climate change and the inherent unpredictability of invasive species impact. An analogous argument correctly deduces that <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6565712_Dimensions_of_systems_biology\">epigenetic systems</a> (of genome-environment interactions) and <a href=\"https://brianbeckage.github.io/myManuscripts/Beckage_etal.5Oct2012.pdf\">neurocognitive systems</a> (of brain-environment interactions) have computationally irreducible dynamics.</p><p>The three factors causing computational irreducibility in biological systems (comprised of biological agents and their environments) also seem likely to apply to AGI-scale deep-learning systems (comprised of AI agents and their training or deployment environments).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Implications for predictability of agent-environment interactions</strong></p><p>What are the implications of computational irreducibility for high-complexity systems like biological systems and future AGI systems? To again quote Beckage et al.:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cComplex systems with extremely large numbers of components can sometimes become predictable from a macro-level perspective due to the averaging of a very large number of separate interactions. In statistical physics, for example, an approximate description of the mean state of a gas is possible without an exact description of the velocities and locations of each molecule; the temperature and pressure of a gas can be described using the ideal gas law. An ecological analogy to the ideal gas law might be the species composition of a forest. Forest composition is ultimately an emergent property that results from the local interactions of many individuals and processes, i.e., seed production and dispersal, competition, growth rates, tradeoffs, etc. While it may not be possible to determine the outcome of all of these complex interactions to predict the species identity of the tree species that captures a given canopy gap, the overall composition of the forest can be predictable to some approximation\u2026While this statistical averaging of interactions is the standard assumption in many deterministic ecological models, it may be more accurate to view most ecological systems as small-to-middle-number systems because local interactions are quite relevant in affecting system behavior. In this case, there would be a general lack of the homogeneous mixing necessary for a purely statistical mechanics view to be applicable.</p><p>We conjecture that skill in predicting the future states of ecological systems will decrease as system complexity increases up to some threshold level. Further increases in system complexity beyond this threshold, for example, through expanding interconnected components of the system or increasing potential for nonlinear interactions, will not result in further losses in predictability\u2026Furthermore, this threshold may occur at relatively low system complexity. We note, however, that the behavior of complex ecological systems can often be readily deconstructed and explained in hindsight as the cascade of interactions and nonlinearities is examined and understood. We emphasize that this may not aid predictions of future system states due to computational irreducibility.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>A <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.074105\">coarse-grained model</a>\u2014if decently correct\u2014can make robust predictions about a computationally irreducible system, although such predictions would necessarily be informationally incomplete. This is consistent with my research background in high\u00ad-complexity systems like those of biological science and social science. For such a high-complexity system, the only general hope for predictability out-of-distribution (in the absence of unrealistically large amounts of time and computational resources) is to deduce theorems from a coarse-grained model of the system based on decently correct first principles. And due to information loss, the types of predictions this method can yield are generally quite limited in scope.</p><p>In the more optimistic case where one can fully specify a computationally irreducible agent\u2019s environment <i>a priori</i>, the most efficient way to predict the agent\u2019s behavior in that environment is to run it in that exact environment. There is no shortcut, such as one based on the agent's internal data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What does this mean for current AI safety research directions?</strong></p><p>Given that future AGI systems will plausibly be computationally irreducible, I think the following implications of computational irreducibility deserve consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>1. Fine-grained interpretability of an AGI-scale model (e.g., interpreting circuits) may be intractable if researchers only have a short amount of time.</i></p><p>Many AI safety researchers consider fine-grained interpretability to be a promising research direction for reducing AGI x-risks. For example, Eliezer Yudkowsky\u2014one of the founders of the AI safety field\u2014has remarked that the interpretability agenda is \"exceptional in the field,\" because he thinks it is one of the few research directions in the field that is \"<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2021/11/11/discussion-with-eliezer-yudkowsky-on-agi-interventions/\">on a pathway to anything important at all</a>.\"</p><p>But this may be false. Due to computational irreducibility, achieving fine-grained interpretability of AGI-scale models may be intractable in the absence of an unrealistically large amount of time and of computational resources.</p><p>A cautionary tale is provided by the <a href=\"https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/\">Human Brain Project</a>, which aimed to achieve a causally accurate predictive model of a brain. Why did the Human Brain Project <a href=\"https://mindmatters.ai/2020/12/why-did-the-human-brain-project-crash-and-burn/\">crash and burn</a>? Because computational irreducibility imposed a hard limit to the scientific upside of the project.</p><p>This was predictable, to the point where a year into the $1.6 billion project, almost a thousand neuroscientists\u2014who could have gotten salaries for long periods of time by participating in the project\u2014instead selflessly boycotted it as a waste of scarce scientific resources. That year, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/07/human-brain-project-researchers-threaten-boycott\">reported</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cCentral to the latest controversy are recent changes made by Henry Markram, head of the Human Brain Project at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology in Lausanne. The changes sidelined cognitive scientists who study high-level brain functions, such as thought and behaviour. Without them, the brain simulation will be built from the bottom up, drawing on more fundamental science, such as studies of individual neurons. The brain, the most complex object known, has some 86bn neurons and 100tn connections.</p><p>\u2018The main apparent goal of building the capacity to construct a larger-scale simulation of the human brain is radically premature,\u2019 Peter Dayan, director of the computational neuroscience unit at UCL, told the Guardian.</p><p>'We are left with a project that can't but fail from a scientific perspective. It is a waste of money, it will suck out funds from valuable neuroscience research, and would leave the public, who fund this work, justifiably upset,' he said.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And the project did in fact crash and burn. To this day, progress on achieving a causally accurate model of the brain remains marginal at best.</p><p>Anthropic plans to rely on <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html\">interpreting large-scale models at the circuit level</a>. Given the hard bounds on predictability imposed by the phenomenon of computational irreducibility, the Human Brain Project\u2019s waste of $1.6 billion and years of researchers\u2019 time provides a cautionary tale for Anthropic on its strategy for how to use its <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/announcement\">$580 million funding</a>. This is because the complexity and computational irreducibility of AGI-scale models likely imply that achieving a fine-grained causal understanding of AGI-scale models will require an extremely large amount of time and computational resources, just like for neuroscience.</p><p>To be clear, a fine-grained causal understanding may be theoretically achievable given enough time and computational resources. A more optimistic reference case is provided by gene-editing, where scientists\u2014through immense trial and error\u2014have obtained a nontrivial ability to make <i>a priori</i> predictions based entirely on genomic code data. But even this scientific problem is largely unsolved. Because the inherent predictability of the genome-environment system may be low, even gene-editing strategies that scientists are comparatively confident in today will almost certainly come with <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aax2941\">unforeseen side effects</a> arising from extremely complex and unpredictable epigenetic dynamics.</p><p>A counterargument is that researchers have more ready access to internal data for neural nets than they do for neuroscience, and that this advantage can be a game-changer. However, this advantage does not seem to address the core issue of computational irreducibility, which seems likely to be an inevitable consequence of using deep learning rather than lower-complexity paradigms (like software design by a human software engineer). Given that the core issue of computational irreducibility exists, it seems plausible that easier access to internal data will only result in a moderate increase in the rate of solving neural-net interpretability compared to the rate of solving neuroscience interpretability. This would imply that the challenges of solving neuroscience, and the prematureness and resource waste of the Human Brain Project, are apt cautionary tales for a safety plan based on fine-grained interpretability of AGI-scale neural nets, even if Anthropic\u2019s brilliant, well-meaning, and well-funded researchers are the ones carrying out this safety plan.</p><p>Computational irreducibility implies that achieving a fine-grained causal understanding of a large-scale model will realistically require patient trial-and-error, in the precise environment in which the model is set to run. Mechanistically interpreting large-scale models is unlikely to provide a reliable safety plan, since it probably cannot efficiently yield the necessary predictions.</p><p>And since it is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13353\">likely</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683\">easy</a> to make a large-scale model <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aaai.12064\">accidentally dangerous</a>, an unprecedented security mindset is probably needed, both from a moral perspective and from the perspective of avoiding a movement-wide credibility risk for EA. This is especially true for Anthropic, a for-profit corporation whose credibility is intertwined with that of the EA movement, and whose $580 million Series B funding was famously raised by lead investor <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/announcement\">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (another movement-wide credibility risk that has recently blown up, even likely rising to the <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/186175/criminal-charges-against-sbf-on-the-table-after-ftxs-epic-collapse\">point of fraud</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>If Anthropic is publicly blamed (fairly or not) for causing a future AGI disaster, then this may cause a substantial credibility loss for the EA movement as a whole. Combined with the one caused by Sam Bankman-Fried, the credibility of the EA movement\u2014on AI safety matters and in general\u2014may not be able to recover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>2. Eliciting Latent Knowledge from fine-grained internal data may be intractable if researchers only have a short amount of time.</i></p><p>See Point 1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>3. Coarse-grained models of AGI systems (e.g., game theory) have a realistic chance of efficiently making robust predictions out-of-distribution, but these predictions will be limited in scope.</i></p><p>The theory of computational irreducibility can explain why success cases in out-of-distribution predictions of complex systems\u2014in biology, economics, and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-020-00395-8\">neuroscience</a>\u2014have generally arisen from <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.074105\">coarse-grained information</a>. Of course, a necessary condition for a coarse-grained model of a system to yield robust predictions is that the model is based on decently correct first principles.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when coarse-grained models based on decently correct first principles can yield robust predictions, however, these predictions then necessarily turn out to be quite limited in scope. To quote <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo4343149.html\"><i>Mathematical Models of Social Evolution</i></a> by McElreath and Boyd:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSimple formal models can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena. In most cases, these predictions are qualitative. We might expect more or less of some effect as we increase the real-world analogue of a particular parameter of the model. For example, a model of voter turnout might predict that turnout increases in times of national crisis. The precise amount of increase per amount of crisis is very hard to predict, as deciding how to measure \u201ccrisis\u201d on a quantitative scale seems like a life's work in itself. Even so, the model may provide a useful prediction of the direction of change. These sorts of predictions are sometimes called comparative statics. And even very simple models can tell us whether some effect should be linear, exponential, or some other functional form. All too often, scientists construct theories which imply highly nonlinear effects, yet they analyze their data with linear regression and analysis of variance. Allowing our models of the actual phenomenon to make predictions of our data can yield much more analytic power. In a few cases, such as sex allocation, models can make very precise quantitative predictions that can be applied to data.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The tone of the last sentence is arguably too optimistic. The cases in which coarse-grained models can correctly make precise quantitative predictions, like Fisher\u2019s principle of sex allocation, are <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804060115\">extremely rare</a>. Fisher\u2019s principle that most sexually reproducing species produce 50% male and 50% female offspring has been called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/286141\">probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology</a>\u201d because it makes such a precise quantitative prediction, which tends to be the exception in the field, not the norm. And even when such precise predictions are possible, they are likely to then necessarily be quite limited in scope: sex allocation strategy is one of countless many phenotypic dimensions that are relevant for a given biological agent. Most aspects of phenotype are probably subject to a high level of inherent unpredictability due to computational irreducibility. This is why the best we biologists and economists can do for robust prediction usually just consists of comparative-statics predictions or functional-form predictions that are subject to significant information loss.</p><p>The above lesson has the following implication. When developing safety plans for AGI-scale models, complexity is likely to be the enemy of security. Assuming a realistic amount of time and computational resources, simple plans for AI safety based on coarse-grained models (e.g., limiting the action space of the AGI, based on game theory/mechanism design) are the ones that have a realistic chance of working in a robust, generalizable manner. And the fact that simple safety plans are insufficient to quickly provide for-profit AGI corporations with everything they want\u2014an AGI that is simultaneously safe and economically useful\u2014should not be used as a source of motivated reasoning that these plans can be magically improved on by a strategy of interpreting fine-grained internal data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>: I am grateful to Spencer Becker-Kahn, Michael Chen, Johannes Gasteiger, Harrison Gietz, Gwern, Adam Jermyn, Arun Jose, Jonathan Mann, Xavier Roberts-Gaal, and Luke Stebbing for providing very valuable feedback on this draft.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Peter S.

The 2015-16 Zika epidemic that started in South America, and which was particularly severe in Brazil, proved otherwise. This is when it became clear that Zika was linked to horrific birth defects. Zika has since earned its place on the<a href=\"https://www.who.int/activities/prioritizing-diseases-for-research-and-development-in-emergency-contexts\">&nbsp;<u>WHO priority pathogen list</u></a>.</p><p>To briefly review the basics of Zika:</p><ul><li>The Zika virus is a flavivirus, in the same family as dengue fever, yellow fever, and Chikungunya, among others. Flaviviruses are RNA viruses, which generally lack genomic proofreading ability and are thus more prone to mutation.</li><li>Zika infection sometimes causes Zika fever, though asymptomatic cases are very common. Zika fever is usually very, very mild, and direct deaths are extremely rare.&nbsp;</li><li>Zika is much more of a concern if you are pregnant \u2014 in about 7%<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdmj0vbe3srk\"><sup><a href=\"#fndmj0vbe3srk\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;of infections during pregnancy, the virus infects a fetus and causes serious, even fatal, birth defects. These defects, which most frequently include microcephaly, are referred to as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS).&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Zika is also thought to increase the risk of miscarriage. A 2018&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082723/#:~:text=Zika%20virus%20(ZIKV)%20infection%20in,few%20clinical%20signs%20of%20infection.\"><u>study</u></a> found that 26% of nonhuman primates infected with Zika experienced fetal loss, at least 2.5 to 5 times more frequently than non-Zika infected ones.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7cs7wc29o85\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7cs7wc29o85\">[3]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li><li>Zika primarily spread through mosquitos, but can also be spread sexually, especially via semen. This trait makes it stand out among other related viruses like dengue fever, wherein sexual transmission appears to be much rarer.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgieixshcyh\"><sup><a href=\"#fngieixshcyh\">[4]</a></sup></span></li></ul><h2>Zika Bad, an Overview</h2><p><i>The burden of Zika is serious, but&nbsp; far from a primary existential risk \u2014 There are several conceivable scenarios wherein ZIKV mutates and becomes much more dangerous \u2014&nbsp;The nature of Zika makes targeted vaccination highly tractable \u2014&nbsp;There is no vaccine or antiviral, nor advanced candidates</i></p><h3>Public Health&nbsp;</h3><p>At present, the risk Zika poses to public health is significant, but lower than many other infectious diseases, primarily due to the very low death rate and the relatively low rate of CZS in infected pregnancies. CZS is tragic, to be sure \u2014 you can read the heart wrenching stories of the families raising some of the thousands of children with CZS in Brazil&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/health/zika-children-research.html\"><u>here</u></a> \u2014 but the total number of cases due to the epidemic was relatively low, estimated in the low thousands.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefueqb0nf9c1m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnueqb0nf9c1m\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;One review in 2021 estimated an average of anywhere from roughly 10,000 to 80,000 DALYs per year between 2010 and 2019, spiking with the 2015-16 epidemic and its aftermath.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx8e5vqgd9g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx8e5vqgd9g\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>At present, there is no approved antiviral for Zika, nor any clearly leading candidate in advanced trials. Rapid vaccination of people with childbearing potential/intent in a given area of an outbreak could be relatively straightforward and prevent most suffering caused by the disease, likely more so than an antiviral medication. Testing experimental medical products in pregnant volunteers is much more complicated ethically and legally.</p><h3>Biosecurity</h3><p>There are several ways Zika could change and become significantly more concerning beyond its existing ability to cause birth defects and wreak havoc on local economies.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.8b00004\"><u>Xia, Xie, Shan &amp; Shi 2018</u></a> offers a useful outline of three hypotheses as to why Zika became more dangerous in the runup to the most recent epidemic, discussing mutations that apparently increase infectivity in mosquitos, increased neurovirulence in mouse fetal models, and increased immune evasion ability.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreful5gjdepmqb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnul5gjdepmqb\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A recent gain-of-function study (cue obligatory booing) demonstrated that a single mutation can lead to greatly increased infectivity and immune evasion in mice.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmam3jq12xeo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmam3jq12xeo\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><p>That Zika virus can be sexually transmitted is also concerning: while not thought to be common compared to mosquito transmission, one can imagine serial human sexual transmission chain of during an outbreak \u2014without any intervening mosquitos \u2014&nbsp;especially since so many infections are asymptomatic. Such a chain could give the virus the opportunity to adapt specifically to humans. A gain-of-function study (again, obligatory booooo) in 2021 demonstrated that adaptation happened very quickly in serial mouse-to-mouse transmission, and the virus became much more deadly.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpq1g8mqs99b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpq1g8mqs99b\">[9]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Zika human challenge trials</h2><p><i>Post-epidemic, Zika still circulates globally and is expected to return, at the very least because population immunity will begin to wane \u2014 In the US, human challenge trials (HCTs) &nbsp;were rejected, during the epidemic \u2014 HCTs are now the only feasible way to test vaccine candidate efficacy; field trials are impossible given the currently low transmission rates \u2014&nbsp;An HCT at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore has since been approved, and is now recruiting</i></p><p>Human challenge trials were proposed in the US during the epidemic in 2016, but an ethics panel convened by the NIH rejected the proposal, causing a bit of a stir. (There\u2019s a&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>piece on it<i>&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/health/zika-study-ethics.html\"><u>here</u></a> \u2014&nbsp;one NIH researcher called it \u201creally insulting\u201d and another leading flavivirus researcher said it \u201cslammed the door on progress\u201d.) Part of the reasoning was that the virus was circulating at high levels at the time, making large-scale field trials feasible.&nbsp;</p><p>But within a year, transmission of Zika had collapsed; field trials for vaccine candidates completely failed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9ks3wrljgbr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9ks3wrljgbr\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Funding and interest for Zika vaccine research dried up as well. Yet it is generally believed that Zika will make a comeback, however, as immunity in particularly hard-hit areas naturally wanes, or as it finds new pockets of flavivirus-naive populations to infect.&nbsp;</p><p>So, to review: we have a disease with exceptionally low mortality rates in adults, but that can be devastating during pregnancy, to say nothing of the economic impacts. The disease is generally expected to return en force some day. It is also entirely possible that when it does, it will have evolved in ways that make it even dangerous. But we can\u2019t test vaccines or treatments in the field right now.&nbsp;</p><p>In a perfect world, we\u2019d have at least a few promising vaccine candidates lined up from human challenge trials. They could immediately be deployed among a population at the sign of the next outbreak, from which wider efficacy could be confirmed. Regrettably, we do not live in a perfect world.</p><p>The rejection of challenge trials in 2017 and the Covid-19 pandemic mean that we are much further behind. But rejoice!

A systematic review in 2021 found a Zika fever case fatality rate of 2.3 per 100,000, and a 2019 systematic review found a rate of 2.0 per 100,000. The majority of deaths occurred in the elderly or those with significant comorbidities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdyphw9t6n5j\"><sup><a href=\"#fndyphw9t6n5j\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;No one over the age of 40 is eligible for the Johns Hopkins study, and those with conditions that would or would likely make them more at risk for complications (e.g. HIV infection, history of neurological conditions) are excluded. A complete list of these conditions are under \"Exclusion criteria\" in the ClinicalTrials.gov <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05123222\">record</a>. Staff will go over these criteria with you and also run some tests to establish you are healthy enough for the trial before enrolling you.</p><p><strong>Congenital Zika Syndrome&nbsp;</strong>\u2014&nbsp;extremely low risk. The study requires that you agree to two forms of birth control if you are of childbearing potential, e.g., agreement to use a condom plus use of an IUD or hormonal birth control. For exclusively homosexual females, only one form of birth control is required. If you do get pregnant, there is approximately a 7% chance that the fetus is born with CZS. The study will conduct pregnancy tests prior to enrollment.</p><p><strong>Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome&nbsp;</strong>\u2014&nbsp;extremely low risk. Zika has been associated with neurological disorders, primarily Guillain-Barr\u00e9, post-infection. GBS is an autoimmune disorder affecting nerve cells, causing muscle weakness, and in the most severe cases, paralysis or death.</p><p>&nbsp;A 2018 review of previous outbreaks suggested that there are about 2 cases for every 10,000 Zika infections; the risk of GBS in general has been found to be lower in females and higher with age (but data was not robust enough to determine if this holds true for Zika-induced GBS).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9i53rw75cbj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9i53rw75cbj\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Noticeable GBS symptoms typically developed between 5 and 12 days after Zika infection symptoms arose.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx43aepf47o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx43aepf47o\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Most people recover from GBS. A systematic review in 2020 found that approximately one-fifth of those with Zika-linked GBS required intensive care, including mechanical ventilation, and that the death rate was up to 4.6% (22 deaths out of 475 cases).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx43aepf47o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx43aepf47o\">[16]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Other neurological conditions</strong> \u2014 extremely low risk. Zika has also been associated with cases of other neurological disorders besides GBS, primarily transverse myelitis<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa5eqfajf764\"><sup><a href=\"#fna5eqfajf764\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and meningoencephalitis.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref40szdkr0rr8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn40szdkr0rr8\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These conditions affecting the central nervous system can be serious, but occur with even lesser frequency than Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. I have been unable to ascertain a solid risk rate or death rate for these, probably due to the infrequency of these cases.</p><h3>Future pregnancies</h3><p>If you want to some day have biological children, don't worry. There is no evidence that women who have completely recovered from the virus have an elevated risk of adverse outcomes if they become pregnant. Zika harms the fetus by infecting nervous system cells and causing cell death during crucial stages of development.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0ba7krhnv5c\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0ba7krhnv5c\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Current evidence does not indicate that previous infection alters fertility or poses a risk to future pregnancies.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa98qu6ra1zu\"><sup><a href=\"#fna98qu6ra1zu\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><p>Zika RNA can be detected in some bodily fluids for several weeks after infection, however. Thus, health authorities recommend The US CDC thus recommends waiting two months post-infection before trying to become pregnant (see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/zika/about/questions.html\"><u>CDC</u></a>) and the UK NHS recommends waiting three months (<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/zika/\"><u>NHS</u></a>). The study will periodically measure Zika levels in participants\u2019 bodies for 90 days following infection. In other words, by the end of the study period, you'll be able to be sure whether or not there's any Zika left in your blood.&nbsp;</p><h3>Inconvenience</h3><p>Ultimately<strong>,</strong> the biggest cost to you would be time and productivity; even if you do get symptoms, they might not be serious enough to interfere with remote work. It is certainly possible you find the environment productive in at least some way, though.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/covid-19-uk-challenge-trial-vaccines\"><u>According</u></a> to a site staff member for hVivo, which ran early Covid-19 challenge trials in the UK, many Covid-19 challenge trial participants (who stayed in individual isolation rooms as opposed to dorm-like facilities) were able to take up those \u201clittle projects that in normal life you never get a chance to do\u201d \u2014&nbsp;like trying to learn an instrument, starting a book, or writing essays. Still, 16 days in the same place is a lot to ask, and you will need to take time out of your day to go to pre- and post-challenge appointments as well.&nbsp;</p><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>Zika is a bad disease for which we need a vaccine, and challenge trials will be critical in finding good vaccine candidates. While the life-saving is downstream, one can very reasonably say they'll have helped save lives &nbsp;by participating in the Hopkins trial.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I really love the idea of participation in challenge trials as a humanitarian, charitable act. Challenge trial recruitment is slow and can be quite the bottleneck in testing, and being able to claim even a tiny sliver of credit for a vaccine translates into substantial human life saved over the years. I think that\u2019s pretty cool. Media tends to be fairly fascinated by challenge trials and speaking with participants, so a handful of EAs in a \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 exotic trial like this could create some very positive coverage of challenge trials and perhaps even EA as a movement.</p><p>Plus, you get paid.&nbsp; (Do note that while death is far from certain in this trial, taxes still are: income tax <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/17407745221105896\">still applies to research compensation</a>, unfortunately.)</p><p>We have one volunteer who has signed up for screening already, and a staff member,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6jgf4aebrj7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6jgf4aebrj7\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which is great!
