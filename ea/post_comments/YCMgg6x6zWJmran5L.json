Two possible downsides of this are:</p><ul><li><strong>You might miss a few good options accidentally. </strong>Maybe the places to work as a software engineer are pretty obvious, but this won't always be the case. For example, maybe someone looking to build career capital in policy won't be aware of all of the good options available, including individual think tanks or other organisations that do impactful policy work. I work at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) which surprisingly many people aren't aware of (I met Will MacAskill one time and he hadn't heard of it!) - but it's got a pretty good reputation and soon after I joined the CBI <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/felicity-burch-87aa8915/?originalSubdomain=uk\">someone left to become Executive Director of the Centre for Data Ethics &amp; Innovation</a>, a pretty high impact and EA-relevant role. Furthermore I don't <i>think</i> the role she came from at the CBI was a directly high impact role (by EA lights), so the role she came from would have been excluded from 80K's job board under your preference. In short, I doubt everyone is automatically aware of all good career capital roles.</li><li><strong>It might be annoying to have loads of career alert emails when you could see them all in one place. </strong>I quite like getting the email from 80,000 Hours reminding me to look at the job board and then seeing everything in one place. Makes life kind of easy! I don't 100% rely on the 80K job board, but if the 80K job board covers all bases then one could rely on it guilt-free, and it might make life easier for them.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "T3qPbJgG3E9dEd5xH", "user": {"username": "jackmalde"}}, {"_id": "hEM7f36eHkXHxMGK8", "postedAt": "2022-09-21T21:43:16.332Z", "postId": "YCMgg6x6zWJmran5L", "htmlBody": "<p>I think you meant to reply to Yonatan Cale and not me?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "4PPzFhrgNmrHMzbym", "user": {"username": "jackmalde"}}, {"_id": "QCjhKNg7K97goyp8C", "postedAt": "2022-09-21T22:57:43.362Z", "postId": "YCMgg6x6zWJmran5L", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>This is a much simpler problem that I'm happy to help with</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just flagging that you're referring to the problem of \"getting career capital as a SW engineer\" and not \"getting career capital\", which is in general much harder.</p>\n<p>Though the problem you are talking about is in my opinion somewhat more complex than you think.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "pugqqtmHxGvF6y4sY", "user": {"username": "Guy Raveh"}}, {"_id": "EhdfPqwAjnzDwkh54", "postedAt": "2022-09-21T22:58:40.369Z", "postId": "YCMgg6x6zWJmran5L", "htmlBody": "<p>And you're right.
