It is chosen for a specific set of practical reasons - having brand recognition, being a nice round number, and being used by religious groups.\"</p></blockquote><p>In the comment you refer to, I was arguing that you misunderstood criticisms that target the % of donation EA requires. Specifically, any % is arbitrary on normative grounds: if you have a duty of beneficence towards the global poor, it is unclear why it would discharge at 10%, 12%, 18%, 90% and so on. There are indeed practical reasons to choose 10% over others, but they do not solve the normative problem. Normatively, EA chooses an arbitrary number. Scott Alexander has a decent discussion of this point here: https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/</p><blockquote><p>2. If the 10% community standard is all that's preventing a subset of current pledgers from redirecting 20% of their annual giving to the opera instead of GiveWell, are we really pleased that the 10% community standard is having that effect?\"</p></blockquote><p>I do not currently believe the amount of donors that you would sway by offering them the opportunity to donate X% to Givewell and Y% to other charities is large. Notably, this is already possible with the current pledge: you offer some sort of official badge of approval for the Y%.</p><blockquote><p>3. And our critics most often criticize our donation standards as preventing them from donating to secular causes, such as alma maters, political movements, the arts, and so on. Showing them that there is a way to include these interests in their giving, while still saving lives in a way that can be demonstrated with cost-benefit analysis in the manner of Effective Altruism seems to be a promising strategy to me.</p></blockquote><p>Somewhat more meta: I think you fundamentally misunderstand the nature of most criticism levied at the EA. I think most individuals are not criticizing that they won't be allowed to donate to anything else. Rather, they criticize that EA focuses on specific charities/careers/volunteering over others. For example, they disagree that a banker doing earning to give does more good than a social worker (an example that was central in your last post). Or they disagree that EA says Malaria is more efficient than e.g. the local political fundraiser because the latter provides benefits that are hard to quantify, yet huge. I take it to not be typical that someone thinks <strong>\"EA is correct in their appraisal, yet I want to have their approval to donate 2% to something that is not effective\"</strong>. Your proposal is orthogonal to the concerns of critics of EA: you offer them approval to donate to a cause that is explicitly second-rate in the ranking of donations of the pledge. You also don't offer a reason for EA to believe these donations will do most good outside of EA being able to trick more people into doing a pledge, or the public looking more favorably upon us. This strikes me as a transparent move that will likely backfire significantly.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm happy to continue this conversation, but I think a more direct conversation may be more productive than continuing via Forum-Post &amp; Comments.

The one you point out comes from EA\u2019s ideological opponents. That doesn\u2019t mean they are bad, wrong, or that their lives revolve around some sort of other political activism.

Here, the barrier isn\u2019t an organized ideology incompatible with EA.

But it\u2019s also because I think EA can benefit from kicking the tires of its central ideas. It helps us maintain a culture of open-mindedness, and it also exposes where an apparent community consensus and cogent framing of an issue in fact needs work.

I think that, on a substantial the margin, a 2/8 message would be <i>more</i> effective in <i>many</i> circumstances. I think a sophistated EA take would be that the real goal is to find a substantial yet isustainable level of giving to effective causes, one that is tailored to the individual's material situation and the constituency of their <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf\">moral parliament</a>.</p><p>For people who haven't encountered this complex bundle of ideas and aren't going to give us a huge amount of time before writing us off, a 2/8 message gestures at subtlety of thought, implying moral parliamentarian ideas, the idea of distinguishing effective causes from personal passions, the idea of a substantial habit of charitable giving.</p><p>A 10% message hits the latter two points, but implies that we're trying to frame the personal passions of the target of our giving appeal as unworthy targets of charitable giving. This is indeed the direct implication of the idea that altruistic efficiency follows a power law distribution - ineffective charities are massively worse than the best, and we lose huge value on the margin when we direct funds and energies to suboptimal causes.</p><p>But this totalizing view is one of the major reasons why even people who see the sense of cost-benefit calculations resist thinking in this manner. The implications are profoundly destabilizing if you don't moderate them. So we moderate them. But when you get hit with that realization that there's a whole community of people whom you haven't met, who think in terms of cost/benefit altruistic calculations, and that the straight-line calculation is that you ought to give everything to a narrow band of super-effective causes and live on the level of the global poor, that borks the brain and causes people distance themselves.</p><p>A 10% standard addresses many of those concerns and is much better than the straight-line calculation by protecting people from utilitarian ravages and promoting movement growth. But its limit is that it seems to imply that symbolically, every other area in life is valueless and that our aim is to reduce the amount of non-EA charitable giving you engage in to zero. This is a bad argument but one that people reliably seem to come up with, because people aren't all mathematically literate or careful reasoners the first time they encounter an idea. A 2/8 message addresses this specific way that the thought process and conversation can go wrong by saying: \"Yes, your passion causes <i>are</i> valuable and we <i>do</i> approve of them, and you <i>can</i> keep giving to them, and that <i>is</i> a positive thing that you do. We are <i>also</i> asking you to recognize the sheer magnitude of clear, unambiguous good you can do by donating to things like X-risk prevention or malaria bednets and to really step up your donating in order to support these causes.\" Putting hard numbers on it gives people a sense of the proportions we might consider appropriate as a community standard, which is why \"2%/8%\" and not just the qualitative description is a necessary part of the message, just as \"10%\" is necessary rather than \"a very substantial level of giving.\"</p><blockquote><p>I struggle to come up with a rationale that gives someone the green checkmark of moral approval for giving 8% to effective causes + 2% for music for predominately rich people (i.e., opera) but denies the checkmark for just the 8% to effective causes.</p></blockquote><p>I originally meant to include a metaphor that I think is a helpful reframing of the idea of a community standard/line in the sand/Schelling point, but apparently I never worked it into the main post.</p><p>I think of a community standard not as a rigid number that's a pass/fail, but an elastic tether. We have anchored it at 10%. Obviously, for a solid earner in a country like the USA, being at 9% is a little worse, 11% a little better, but we don't encourage you to \"stretch the standard\" all the way up to 50% (because it can set an intimidating or extremely demanding-sounding image of what our standard is and provoke a sense of being not good enough in ways that are bad for community growth) or all the way down to 0%. But a little variability around 10% really doesn't matter much. The idea of the \"elastic\" standard is that it resists further deformation the further you try and move away from it. Having elasticity built into the standard makes it a better standard because it emphasizes the ways our community embraces flexibility and personal fit whlie still having actual, meaningful standards.</p><p>So yeah, full agree, no \"green checkmark\" mentality.

That's not about trying to manipulate people; it is seeing if the way things are being communicated faithfully conveys the community's beliefs.
