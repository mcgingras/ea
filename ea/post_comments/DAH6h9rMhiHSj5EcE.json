So, if we want people to take AI X risks seriously, there may be public relations incentives to push our guesses slightly higher. Depending on one's model of public outreach, that could be seen as deceptively manipulative, or as a helpful and honorable 'nudge' to overcome a common cognitive bias.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}]
