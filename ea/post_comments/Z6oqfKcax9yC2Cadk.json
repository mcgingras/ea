This is based on wider reading and listening and thinking and experiencing, which I have been doing for years. I agree that their arguments are often sloppy and there are areas other than hiring in which they're weaker than they admit. Your claim that \u2018they also usually provide no evidence or arguments for their claims except their personal experience\u2019 is wrong as it stands. They provide evidence for some of their claims, which I've linked in my section on why Manager Tools is a decent authority. (Note that I wrote \u2018a decent\u2019, not \u2018the ultimate\u2019 \u2013 epistemic humility.) I wish they would provide evidence for other claims, too. And the bulk of each podcast/whitepaper is made up of arguments for their claims, spotty though they might be at times. Personal experience can be a valid support for arguments, too, if it's believable that you have a lot of it. It is believable that MT has a lot of personal experience (and data) about hiring, which I also point out in my section about them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I do think I'm fairly transparent and indicate levels of confidence to some degree, perhaps in a different way than you're used to. I don't have time to read and digest the full Reasoning Transparency article. But if I look at the top recommendations:\n<ul>\n<li>\u2018Open with a linked summary of key takeaways.\u2019 \u2013 That's the title in my article.</li>\n<li>\u2018Throughout a document, indicate which considerations are most important to your key takeaways.\u2019 \u2013 With some squinting that's the table of contents in my article.</li>\n<li>\u2018Throughout a document, indicate how confident you are in major claims, and what support you have for them.\u2019 \u2013 I do indicate my support (Manager Tools) and why I think it's a support. I am quite confident in my main claim and in the main supporting claims. Note also that I don't write that outsourcing hiring is terrible, but that you need to be careful. And I don't write \u2018Hirely will cause you to make a bad hire\u2019, but that they put you at risk of making a bad hire. Among others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I think I've refuted part of your claim about personality tests in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z6oqfKcax9yC2Cadk/be-careful-with-outsourcing-hiring?commentId=fjAoh49baju6o7GPu\">other comments</a>. Added 2022-10-22: Even if Big Five assessments can predict some things well, I would expect that to only be the case when they're not gamed. The one I know can easily be gamed. (Eg. just answer \u2018very accurate\u2019/\u2018very inaccurate\u2019 to all the question that sound like pushing up/down the conscientiousness score.) And an important part of hiring is keeping out people that make themselves look better than they are.</li>\n<li>Expanded 2022-10-23: Some of the arguments against the \u2018bad\u2019 hiring advice had already been addressed in my article. Eg.: I point out that the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screen is a flawed filter and needs to be supplemented or replaced, depending on the situation. I briefly argue why it's okay to take a lot of time interviewing. There is also an easy fix for anchoring/groupthink in the interview results capture meeting (as well as other, more subtle, reasons to do it): Ask people to send you their recommendations and justifications before the meeting.</li>\n<li>Added 2022-10-19, edited 2022-10-23: In general, the items about \u2018inaccurate or bad advice\u2019 have common-sense arguments for and against them. (If anyone wants me to write any of them out, let me know.) It would come down to analysing Manager Tools' (unfortunately non-public) data as well as the research you're referring to. I would expect \u2018traditional hiring\u2019 when done right to work roughly equally well to whatever good EA orgs and leading tech firms do. My default expectation when people say that the \u2018traditional way to do X is bad\u2019 is that it actually works well when done right, but that it has a bad image because it got corrupted over time/is usually done mediocrely.</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": "DkEER5fvDS8DCbdkf", "user": {"username": "rmoehn"}}, {"_id": "yKRanzBDJz6rYy7ps", "postedAt": "2022-10-18T15:26:01.134Z", "postId": "Z6oqfKcax9yC2Cadk", "htmlBody": "<p>Oh crap, my bad, should've looked closer!

Also, I think there is not just evidence against, but also evidence for epistemic integrity in my article. That should factor into how \u2018skeptical\u2019 readers ought to be. Examples: The last paragraph of the introduction. The fact that I edit the article based on comments once I'm convinced that a comment is correct. The fact that I call out edits and don't just rewrite history. The fact that it's well-structured overall (not necessarily at the paragraph level), which makes it easy to respond to claims. The fact that I include and address possible objections to my points.</p>\n<p>Addendum: I would explain the high incremental validity by the fact that a GMA test barely measures conscientiousness and integrity. In fact, footnote \u2018c,d\u2019 mentions that \u2018the correlation between integrity and ability is zero\u2019. But conscientiousness and integrity are important for job performance (depending on the job). I would expect much lower incremental validity over structured interviews or work samples. Because these, when done well, tell a lot about conscientiousness and integrity by themselves.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "yKRanzBDJz6rYy7ps", "user": {"username": "rmoehn"}}, {"_id": "tQJYP69vqfxMcMQWS", "postedAt": "2022-10-18T23:13:42.264Z", "postId": "Z6oqfKcax9yC2Cadk", "htmlBody": "<p>It turns out that the article was mass-downvoted by throwaway accounts.

From the authority of Manager Tools. In order for those arguments to be convincing, I need to establish that Manager Tools is reliable. That's why I write how their guidance leads to success etc. Now, arguments from authority tend to be weak (see also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority</a>). If I had the time, I would write out all the arguments properly, gather data etc. But I don't have the time, unfortunately. Also, it's not crucial for my main point, particularly my original main point. My original main point is that Hirely does bad work (they're hopefully doing better now \u2013 that's why I half-assedly repurposed the article) and one can be convinced of that without being convinced by each and every sub-point.</p>\n<p>The hyperlink thing is to comply with my own demand from an old LessWrong post: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ytStDZ7BaC23GvGPb/please-give-your-links-speaking-names\">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ytStDZ7BaC23GvGPb/please-give-your-links-speaking-names</a> It wasn't that much extra work because I wrote a little Clojure script to transform one Markdown file into another.</p>\n<p>As to the summary up-front: Recently I try to structure articles in a way that the title and the table of contents can be read as the summary.
