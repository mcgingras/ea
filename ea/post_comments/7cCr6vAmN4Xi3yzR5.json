Faster growth rates means more money means more AIs researching new technology means even faster growth rates, and so on ...</p></blockquote><p>I think this is by far the most plausible conjecture as to how growth rates could explode in the future. But I still think there are good reasons to be skeptical of such an explosion. For one, an AI-driven explosion of this kind would most likely involve a corresponding explosion in hardware (e.g. for reasons gestured at <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/why-does-hardware-grow-like-algorithmshtml\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\">here</a>), and there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to doubt that we will see such an explosion.</p><p>Indeed, growth rates are <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#The_fastest_supercomputers_and_other_hardware_measures\">declining</a> across various hardware metrics, and yet here we are not just talking about growth rates in hardware remaining at familiar levels, but presumably about an explosion in these growth rates. That seems to go against the empirical trends that we are observing in hardware, and against the impending end of Moore's law that we can predict with reasonable confidence based on theory.</p><p>Relatedly, there is the point that explosive economic growth likely would imply an explosion in energy production, but it is likewise doubtful whether progress in software/computation could unleash such an explosion (as argued <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#Global_economic_growth\">here</a>). More generally, even if we made a lot of progress in both computer software and hardware, it seems likely that growth would become constrained by other factors to a degree that precludes an economic growth explosion (Bryan Caplan makes similar points in response to Hanson's <i>Age of Em</i>; see point 9 <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/06/whats_wrong_in.html\">here</a>; see also Aghion et al., <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/AJJ-AIandGrowth.pdf\">2019</a>, p. 260).</p><p>Moreover, as mentioned in an earlier comment, it is worth noting that the decline in growth rates that we have seen since the 1960s is not only due to decreasing population growth, as there are also other factors that have contributed, such as certain <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#Many_key_technologies_only_have_modest_room_for_further_growth\">growth potentials</a> that have been exhausted, and the consequent <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2021/06/07/reasons-not-to-expect-a-growth-explosion/#rates-of-innovation-and-progress-in-science-have-slowed-down\">decline</a> in innovations per capita.</p><blockquote><p>3. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/modeling-the-human-trajectory/\">Modeling the Human Trajectory</a></p></blockquote><p>One thing to notice about this model is that it conflicts with the historic <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#An_unprecedented_decline_in_economic_growth_rates_across_doublings\">decline in growth rates</a>. In particular, the model is an <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2021/06/07/reasons-not-to-expect-a-growth-explosion/#three-objections-in-brief\">ever worse fit</a> with the observed growth rates of the last four decades. Roodman himself <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/modeling-the-human-trajectory/#2-capturing-the-randomness-of-history\">notes</a> that his model has shortcomings in this regard:</p><blockquote><p>... recent global growth has been slower and steadier than the model predicts from previous history. ... Nevertheless, I think it is a virtue, and perhaps an inspiration for further work, that this rigorous model can quantify its own shortcomings.</p></blockquote><p>(Perhaps also see Tom Davidson's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HgbAmhaAhky8SxPiv/some-thoughts-on-david-roodman-s-gwp-model-and-its-relation\">reflections</a> on Roodman's model.)</p><p>In other words, the model is not a good fit with the last 2-3 doublings of the world economy, and this is somewhat obscured when the model is evaluated across standard calendar time rather than across doublings; when looking at the model through the former lens, its recent mispredictions seem minor, but when seen across doublings \u2014 arguably the more relevant perspective \u2014 they become rather significant.</p><p>Given the historical data, it seems that a considerably better fit would be a model that predicts roughly symmetric growth rates around a peak growth rate found ca. 1960, as can be gleaned <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#An_unprecedented_decline_in_economic_growth_rates_across_doublings\">here</a> (similar points are made in Modis, <a href=\"http://www.growth-dynamics.com/articles/Singularity.pdf\">2012</a>, pp. 20-22). Such a model may be theoretically grounded in the expectation that there will be a point where innovations become increasingly harder to find. One would expect such a \"peak growth rate\" to occur at some point a priori, given the finite potential for growth (implying that the addition of a limiting factor that represents the finite nature of growth-inducing innovations would be a natural extension to Roodman's model). And empirical data then <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#An_unprecedented_decline_in_economic_growth_rates_across_doublings\">tentatively suggests</a> that this peak lies in the past.

Indeed, machines/external tools have been (part of) the state-of-the-art at some tasks for millennia (e.g. in harvesting), and computers and robots in particular have been the state-of-the-art at various tasks relevant to growth for decades (e.g. in technical calculations and manufacturing).

I don't expect a critical point at which growth rates suddenly explode because the machines themselves are already doing such a large share of the heavy lifting, and an increasing proportion of our key bottlenecks to growth are (already) their bottlenecks to faster growth (which must again be distinguished from claims about absolute room for growth; there may be plenty of potential for growth in various domains without there being an extremely fast way to realize that potential).</p><blockquote><p>When you have two different technologies A and B where A works better now, but B is getting better faster than A, then there will predictably be a big jump in the use of B once it exceeds A</p></blockquote><p>Not if B is gradually getting better than A at specific growth-relevant tasks, and if B is getting produced and employed roughly in proportion to how fast it is getting better than A at those specific tasks.
