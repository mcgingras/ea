By relying on standards related to consumers' right to information, this organization could develop and promote standard reporting methods, auditing systems, transparency rankings of companies and governments, and improved labelling and traceability of animal products.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>In recent years, significant advancements in farm animal welfare have been achieved through the concerted efforts of numerous organizations and individuals. These efforts have encompassed a wide range of interventions, including the improvement of housing systems, breeding practices, bans of particularly harmful procedures, and the development of new animal welfare legislation and standards.</p><p>Despite these achievements, the path to securing a good life for farmed animals remains a long one. There is not only a need for additional reforms and their expansion into multiple geographies, but also for the assurance of their effectiveness in promoting animal welfare. Here we argue that the creation of mechanisms for increased transparency in the production chain is critical in this regard.</p><p>Not uncommonly, producing companies find ways to circumvent reforms or exploit loopholes in enforcement, as evidenced by widespread violations of animal welfare legislation in the European Union (examples are available <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.3920/978-90-8686-784-4_60\"><u>here</u></a>, <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/do-countries-comply-with-eu-animal-welfare-laws\"><u>here </u></a>and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32325918/\"><u>here</u></a>). Even when enforcement is effective, &nbsp;compliance with specific requirements may not necessarily translate into tangible welfare improvements. For example, abolishing practices leading to physical alterations such as tail docking in pigs or beak trimming in laying hens - band-aid solutions to the issues of tail biting and injurious pecking, respectively - may lead to poorer welfare if other management and housing measures are not simultaneously implemented to reduce the stress that triggers those behaviors. Similar issues may arise with the removal of antibiotics from the supply chain or changes in housing conditions without simultaneous adjustments in other practices.</p><p>A promising approach in this context is a focus on the monitoring and report of meaningful welfare outcomes. It is at the animal level that the effectiveness of welfare policies should work, hence where monitoring is most needed. For example, setting maximum thresholds for outcomes such as the prevalence of diseases, fractures, and other injuries, as inspected at the slaughter line by independent auditors, would leave less room for evading welfare advancements.</p><p>This approach, however, depends on companies having transparency about their operations. Transparency is fundamental in ensuring that practices align with actual welfare outcomes. Transparency is also crucial to bridge the gap between consumer preferences for ethically produced animal products and the reality of industrial agricultural practices. For example, the absence of clear labeling on animal products frequently leads to consumer confusion, hindering choices that are consistent with ethical values.</p><p>The imperative for increased transparency in animal welfare practices mirrors the foundational principles of organizations like <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en\"><u>Transparency International</u></a>. Since its establishment, Transparency International has been globally recognized in the fight against corruption by using a strategic approach to making corruption more visible and difficult to conceal, setting a precedent for how sector-specific transparency organizations can drive systemic change. Similarly, adopting a model inspired by Transparency International in the realm of animal welfare could be transformative, increasing the efficacy of existing and future welfare initiatives. By fostering accountability and shining a light on the actual conditions and treatment of animals within the production chain, increased transparency - or at least pressure towards it - could promote adherence to standards and encourage the ongoing enhancement of welfare practices by subjecting companies to independent audits and public oversight.</p><p>The establishment of an organization dedicated to enhancing transparency in farm animal welfare could significantly benefit from leveraging existing standards related to consumers' right to information. Numerous international frameworks and guidelines establish principles for non-misleading consumer information. These standards could serve as a basis for developing standard reporting practices, auditing mechanisms, transparency indexes, <a href=\"https://www.animallaw.info/article/giving-slaughterhouses-glass-walls-new-direction-food-labeling-and-animal-welfare\"><u>transparent labeling schemes</u></a>&nbsp;and improved traceability within the livestock industry.</p><p>The call for increased transparency in animal welfare practices also poses a challenge for the industry to openly oppose; opposing transparency could inadvertently imply that there are aspects of their operations that would not withstand public scrutiny.</p><h1><strong>Potential Areas of Work</strong></h1><p>The proposed areas of work below are initial ideas meant to initiate a discussion on increasing transparency in animal production. These suggestions are not exhaustive or detailed but are intended to encourage further exploration and development of strategies in this area.</p><p><strong>Creation of a Transparency Index to rank companies by their commitment to transparency in the production chain</strong>. Such an index could be used in sourcing policies, investment portfolios (to reduce image risks), and other areas. It could include reports on (1) the company\u2019s policy for unannounced animal welfare audits by accredited and independent third parties; (2) the number of annual assessments of animal-based indicators of welfare conducted by independent third parties at the farm and abattoir levels, and any direct or indirect association of inspectors with the company; (3) the methods for the choice of the facilities inspected, their representativeness within production chain, the proportion of animals assessed within each facility inspected, and the proportion of facilities inspected; (4) whether outcomes of audits are publicly available and include all indicators assessed, (5) the existence and coverage of video monitoring systems (farms, culling areas, transport and abattoirs), including access for inspection by independent auditors.</p><p><strong>Development of Standard Reporting Practices and Auditing Mechanisms</strong>: development of uniform reporting frameworks for key animal welfare indicators, enabling consistent data collection and benchmarking across producers and regions, and the establishment of independent auditing processes to evaluate compliance with animal welfare standards.</p><p><strong>Stockmanship Transparency</strong>: creation of initiatives or mechanisms to disclose stockmanship ratios and qualifications, providing insights into what is typically a limiting factor to ensure animal welfare.</p><p><strong>Transparent Labeling</strong>: develop and support initiatives for clear, standardized labeling on animal products that provide consumers with transparent information about welfare conditions.</p><p><strong>Improved Traceability</strong>: develop mechanisms for improved traceability of animal products.</p><p><strong>Transparent Sourcing Policies</strong>: Encourage retailers and food companies to adopt transparent sourcing policies that clearly outline their standards for animal welfare and their compliance mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Legislative Advocacy</strong>: Advocacy for laws mandating transparency in animal welfare, including the public sharing of welfare outcomes and audit results.</p><p><strong>Independent Welfare Monitoring at the Slaughter line</strong>: regular monitoring of key health outcomes is already a standard practice for food safety purposes. This existing framework could be co-opted and expanded to include the collection of key parameters related to animal welfare. This approach has been previously advocated by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174017300037\"><u>Temple Grandin</u></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Educational Campaigns: </strong>design campaigns using relatable and easily understandable metrics of animal welfare to enhance public awareness. For instance, conveying the \"<a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/\"><u>time in pain</u></a>\" that animals endure during the production of certain products, or presenting hard data on the incidence of various welfare issues within the production chain, could make the abstract concept of animal welfare more tangible for consumers.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Digital Transparency Tools</strong>: Leverage digital platforms and tools to provide consumers with accessible, detailed information about the welfare standards of products, potentially including QR codes or apps linked to detailed welfare information.</p>", "user": {"username": "cynthiaschuck"}}, {"_id": "CjRyhCovMTwGxMFvF", "title": "AI Policy Insights from the AIMS Survey", "postedAt": "2024-02-22T19:17:15.088Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Edited by Jacy Reese Anthis, Spencer Case, and Michael Dello-Iacovo.

The U.S. public is generally opposed to the development of AI sentience and human-AI integration.</u></a></p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>2023 was a pivotal year for AI development. OpenAI\u2019s November 2022 release of ChatGPT sparked massive public interest in AI. By February 2023, ChatGPT had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\"><u>100 million monthly active users</u></a>. This fueled a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-new-ai-search-engine/\"><u>race</u></a> to produce advanced large language models (LLMs), the architecture behind ChatGPT. Microsoft launched&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/bing-chat\"><u>Bing Chat</u></a> in February 2023.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/gpt-4\"><u>GPT-4</u></a> was released in March 2023. Google released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\"><u>Bard</u></a> on March 21, followed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.google/discover/palm2/\"><u>PaLM 2</u></a> in May. In July 2023, Meta released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/llama/\"><u>LLama 2</u></a>. The accessibility of this new generation of AI models to the public increased their use of chatbots and LLMs for routine administrative work, coding, video games, social media content, and information searches such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine. Prior to these developments there was public concern about AI in domains like social media, surveillance, policing, and warfare, but the rapid proliferation of easy-to-access LLMs amplified worries about AI safety and governance.&nbsp;</p><p>The release and subsequent popularity of these models galvanized researchers to study the risks they pose to human extinction. Prominent AI researchers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html\"><u>Geoffrey Hinton</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8kHgaLYamxQdE2zk7/yoshua-bengio-how-rogue-ais-may-arise\"><u>Yoshua Bengio</u></a> joined a chorus of voices including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-expert-max-tegmark-warns-that-humanity-is-failing-the-new-technologys-challenge-4d423bee\"><u>Max Tegmark</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/\"><u>Eliezer Yudkowsky</u></a> calling attention to the risks from rapid expansion of frontier AI systems without appropriate safety protocols or socio-political preparation.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, these AI developments renewed attention to an issue long debated in philosophy, computer science, and cognitive science:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07103\"><u>AI sentience</u></a>. Blake Lemoine, who had been an engineer working on Google\u2019s LLM,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/\"><u>LaMDA</u></a>, speculated that LaMDA&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/\"><u>was self-aware</u></a>. This alerted the public to the near-future possibility of living with sentient AIs, although scientists and philosophers generally would not agree LaMDA is sentient. As LLMs are trained on larger portions of human language and history, their behaviors have become more complex, prompting increased interest in the possibility of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/key-questions-for-digital-minds\"><u>digital minds</u></a> and a need for research on public perceptions of digital minds.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sentience Institute tracks U.S. public opinion on the moral and social perception of different types of AIs, particularly sentient AIs, in the nationally representative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aims-survey\"><u>Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS)</u></a> survey. In 2023, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aims-survey-supplement-2023\"><u>supplemental</u></a> AIMS survey was conducted on responses to current developments in AI with a focus on attitudes towards AI safety, AI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/existential-risk/existential-risk/\"><u>existential risks</u></a> (x-risks), and LLMs. With advanced AI systems like ChatGPT becoming more accessible to the public, it is crucial for policymakers to grasp the public's perspectives on certain issues, such as:</p><ul><li>The pace of AI advancement</li><li>When advanced AI systems will emerge</li><li>Catastrophic and existential risks to humanity and moral concern for AI welfare</li><li>Human-AI integration, enhancement, and hybridization</li><li>Policy interventions such as campaigns, regulations, and bans</li></ul><p>This would empower policymakers to:</p><ul><li>Gauge the level of policy assertiveness needed to align with public concerns.</li><li>Craft policies that are viable given public acceptability.</li><li>Build trust in governance by addressing risks that resonate with the public's concerns.</li></ul><p>We highlight five specific insights from the AIMS survey:</p><ol><li><strong>The U.S. public is seriously concerned about the pace of AI development.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li><i>49% believe the pace of AI development is too fast.</i></li></ul></li><li><strong>The U.S. public seems to expect that very advanced AI systems will be developed within the next 5 years.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li><i>The median predictions for when Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Human-Level Artificial Intelligence (HLAI), and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) will be created are 2 years, 5 years, and 5 years.</i></li></ul></li><li><strong>The U.S. public is concerned about the risks AI presents to humanity, including risks of extinction, and concerned about risks of harm to the AIs themselves.</strong><ul><li><i>48% are concerned that, \u201cAI is likely to cause human extinction.\u201d&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>52% are concerned about \u201cthe possibility that AI will cause the end of the human race on Earth.\u201d&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>53% support campaigns against the exploitation of AIs.</i></li><li><i>43% support welfare standards that protect the wellbeing of AIs.</i></li><li><i>68% agree that we must not cause unnecessary suffering for LLMs if they develop the capacity to suffer.</i></li></ul></li><li><strong>Specific policy tools designed for increasing AI safety are supported by a majority of the U.S. public.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li><i>71% support public campaigns to slow AI development.&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>71% support government regulation that slows AI development; when asked instead about opposition, 37% oppose it.</i></li><li><i>63% support banning the development of artificial general intelligence that is smarter than humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>64% support a global ban on data centers that are large enough to train AI systems that are smarter than humans.&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>69% support a six-month pause on AI development.&nbsp;</i></li></ul></li><li><strong>The U.S. public is generally opposed to the development of AI sentience and human-AI integration.</strong><ul><li><i>70% support a global ban on the development of sentience in AIs.&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>71% support a global ban on the development of AI-enhanced humans.&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>72% support a global ban on the development of robot-human hybrids.</i></li><li><i>59% oppose uploading human minds to computers (i.e., \u201cmind uploading\u201d).</i></li></ul></li></ol><h1>1. The U.S. public is seriously concerned about the pace of AI development.</h1><p><i>Key AIMS finding: 49% believe the pace of AI development is too fast.</i></p><p>In 2023,&nbsp;<strong>49% of AIMS respondents believed that AI development is too fast</strong>. Only 2.5% thought that AI development is too slow, 19% were uncertain, and 30% believed the pace of development is fine. Alongside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theaipi.org/poll-shows-overwhelming-concern-about-risks-from-ai-as-new-institute-launches-to-understand-public-opinion-and-advocate-for-responsible-ai-policies/\"><u>the Artificial Intelligence Policy Institute\u2019s (AIPI) poll result</u></a> that 72% of Americans prefer slowing down the development of AI and 8% prefer speeding it up (and 72% and 15% in the version of that question with more detail), there is clear evidence of the U.S. public\u2019s support for slowing AI development.&nbsp;</p><p>Leading AI experts are also concerned about the pace of AI development. An open letter advocating for pausing the development of AIs more powerful than GPT-4 spearheaded by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org\"><u>Future of Life Institute</u></a> was signed by over 33,700 experts. An&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/faq\"><u>open statement</u></a> by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai\"><u>Center for AI Safety</u></a> (CAIS) attracted a wide range of prominent signatories to its simple statement that, \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>To explain the survey and real-world evidence of widespread concern, we would place the factors that drive public opinion and expert concern into four categories: science fiction and mass media, past issues, risks of rapid integration into human socio-political institutions, and the problematic behavior of current AI systems.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>On science fiction:&nbsp;</strong>Public opinion on AI is presumably&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/62/3/562/5077057\"><u>shaped</u></a> by the many famous portrayals of dangerous AI in science fiction, such as&nbsp;<i>The Terminator</i> and&nbsp;<i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. Nonexperts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1320645111\"><u>get most of their information</u></a> about science concepts from mass media. Narratives and narrative-style mass media increase comprehension and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010028577900056\"><u>recall</u></a>, and are engaging and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/mass-media-propaganda-and-social-influence\"><u>persuasive</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>On past issues:&nbsp;</strong>There have already been clear societal harms from earlier generations of AI. For example, social media recommender algorithms have played a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/technology/misinformation-integrity-institute-report.html\"><u>significant role</u></a> in the vast spread of misinformation and disinformation. AIs deployed in other contexts (e.g., healthcare, judicial sentencing, policing) have exhibited bias, which is partly a result of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3457607\"><u>disparities</u></a> embedded within their training data. The ethical deployment of AI also has been questioned given some uses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2023/repressive-power-artificial-intelligence\"><u>repress</u></a> populations lacking protections against these abuses.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>On rapid integration:&nbsp;</strong>Awareness of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258\"><u>foundation models</u></a>\u2019 (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL-E) powerful capabilities is quickly spreading among the public, industry, and elites in powerful institutions. For example, the U.S. General Services Administration&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=applied-ai-challenge\"><u>held a competition</u></a>&nbsp;to find the best ways to integrate AI into government agencies. Although the integration of AI into organizational decision-making can yield benefits (e.g., efficiency), it presents risks as well. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ppmg/article-abstract/4/3/244/6218935\"><u>Young et al. (2021)</u></a>, we proposed that the risks from automating tasks within organizations include AI exuberance, quantification bias, and organizational value misalignment. As AIs become more capable, they may be able to complete more general sets of tasks and may be used before they are effective substitutes for the nuances of human judgment. This is particularly challenging for holding governments democratically accountable and can set the stage for increases in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sk.sagepub.com/books/unmasking-administrative-evil\"><u>\u201cadministrative evil,\u201d</u></a> which we view as the infliction of unnecessary suffering in public administration. For example, a worthy non-traditional applicant to a social benefits program might be denied because an AI makes decisions in a way tuned to the more common, traditional applicants and lacks the nuance to correctly categorize the non-traditional applicant.<u> </u><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/preparing-for-the-non-existent-future-of-work/\"><u>Job loss</u></a> is another risk of organizational restructuring based on increased awareness and use of AI. Organizational restructuring that puts job performance evaluation, monitoring, and hiring or firing decision-making in the purview of AIs rather than humans is opposed by a majority of Americans, according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/\"><u>Pew Research Center</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/04/08/how-americans-see-automation-and-the-workplace-in-7-charts/\"><u>American workers</u></a>&nbsp;expect automation to shape the future of work for the worse. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/12/20/Automation-Skills-and-the-Future-of-Work-What-do-Workers-Think-48791\"><u>workers in general, and especially in emerging markets</u></a>, feel more positive than negative about automation and job loss.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>On problematic behavior:</strong> AI capabilities have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6300942/ai-progress-charts/\"><u>significantly increased</u></a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/brief-history-of-ai\"><u>many dimensions</u></a>, and they are exhibiting more evidence of having mental faculties that constitute&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/key-questions-for-digital-minds\"><u>digital minds</u></a>.

Some generative AI behaviors challenge assumptions that AIs will be benign tools that are completely under human control. The pace of AI development suggests a race to the bottom as AI labs work to increase the capacities of AIs and publicly release their models in the marketplace to gain first mover advantages and a stronger reputation.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>2. The U.S. public seems to expect that very advanced AI systems will be developed within the next 5 years.</h1><p><i>Key AIMS Finding: The median predictions for when Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Human-Level Artificial Intelligence (HLAI), and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) will be created are 2 years, 5 years, and 5 years.</i></p><p>Three thresholds of AI development have particularly captured the attention of experts and forecasters: (1) Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), (2) Human-Level Artificial Intelligence (HLAI), and (3) Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). AIMS respondents forecasted about the emergence of these advanced AIs, providing a novel third perspective. The AIMS survey data suggest that the median U.S. adult expects AI to first become general in its capabilities and shortly thereafter to show human-level capabilities and superhuman intelligence. The U.S. public seems to expect these changes soon.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) timelines:</strong>&nbsp;The modal estimate for when AGI will be created is 2 years from 2023. Thirty-four percent of the U.S. public believes that AGI already exists, and only 2% believe AGI will never happen when asked, \u201cIf you had to guess, how many years from now do you think that the first artificial general intelligence will be created?\u201d&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Human-Level Artificial Intelligence (HLAI) timelines:&nbsp;</strong>The modal estimate for when HLAI will be created is 5 years from 2023.&nbsp;Twenty-three percent of the U.S. public believes that HLAI already exists, and only 4% believe it will never happen when asked, \u201cIf you had to guess, how many years from now do you think that the first human-level AI will be created?\u201d&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) timelines:&nbsp;</strong>The modal guess for when ASI will be created is 5 years from 2023. Twenty-four percent of the U.S. public believes ASI already exists, and only 3% believe it will never happen when asked, \u201cIf you had to guess, how many years from now do you think that the first artificial superintelligence will be created?\u201d&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Definitions were not supplied for these terms. Instead, the AIMS survey relied on the general public\u2019s understanding of and intuition about the meanings of these terms in order to create a baseline of data that can be built on in the future as discourse evolves. Many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/artificial-sentience-terminology\"><u>AI terms</u></a> have no agreed upon definition among experts, forecasters, or the general public. Even with a particular definition of capabilities, there is significant disagreement among researchers on what empirical evidence would show those capabilities.</p><p>With these qualifications in mind, the public\u2019s timelines are shorter than both current prediction markets and recent expert surveys (see below), both of which have intimated specific definitions and received more attention. The public\u2019s expectations matter insofar as they signal what people care about and whether or not there would be public support for regulation or legislative change. Public opinion has been documented as having a substantial impact on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/106591290305600103\"><u>policymaking</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/scotus\"><u>Supreme Court decisions</u></a>. In the context of AI, if people expect AGI, HLAI, or ASI to emerge in the next 5 years, policymakers should expect greater public support for AI-related legislation in the near future. The short timelines may also be reflected in policymakers\u2019 personal timelines, also increasing their prioritization of AI issues.</p><p>Forecasters offer one of the other more frequently cited timelines to advanced AI.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/ai/\"><u>Metaculus</u></a>, one of the most prominent forecasting platforms, hosts ongoing predictions for AGI. As of December 2023, the ongoing predictions from the Metaculus community put&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/\"><u>AGI in August 2032</u></a>, or 9 years from 2023, though there is much to be contested in how it operationalizes AGI, and it is unclear what incentives Metaculus users have for accurate forecasts. Nonetheless, at face value, this is notably 4x longer than the U.S. public\u2019s median timeline. Other Metaculus predictions forecast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/\"><u>weak AGI in October 2026</u></a> (close to the 2 years to AGI expected by the public) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/9062/time-from-weak-agi-to-superintelligence/\"><u>ASI 2 years after that</u></a> (i.e., in approximately 12 years; yes, this implies ASI 4 years before AGI, even though scholars typically consider AGI to be weaker than ASI). This is just one example of the challenges with forecasting such events in practice, but we nonetheless include these estimates for context.) Ongoing predictions about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/\"><u>weakly general AI systems</u></a> put weak AGI emergence in March 2026, approximately 3 years from 2023, and very close to the U.S. public\u2019s expectation for AGI. Another Metaculus question suggests a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/384/humanmachine-intelligence-parity-by-2040/\"><u>95% chance</u></a> of \u201chuman-machine intelligence parity before 2040,\u201d which could be considered an HLAI prediction for comparison to the AIMS results, though, as another example of the qualification necessary with such estimates, this operationalization only requires that a machine could pass a Turing-like test with three human judges, which could occur even if, say, 50 such tests are run, and one set of judges happen to be easily persuaded.&nbsp;</p><p>Question framing and terminology in questions shape the answers of experts and the general public alike. Metaculus forecasters\u2019 varying timelines in response to the differently framed questions about weak AGI are a case in point. With the framing of our survey (i.e., just sharing terms with no explanation), the U.S. public expects AGI first then HLAI and ASI at approximately the same time, but the wording of the Metaculus questions suggest HLAI is easiest, followed by AGI then ASI.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to Metaculus and public timelines, other surveys include the three covered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/ai-timelines\"><u>Roser (2023)</u></a>, which are also documented in Figure 1.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>2018:</strong> One-hundred and sixty-five AI experts were asked when AI systems will collectively be able to accomplish 99% of tasks that humans are paid to do at or above the level of a typical human.

A majority, 70% of respondents, indicated their desire to see more research on minimizing risks of AI systems.</p><h1>3. The U.S. public is concerned about the risks AI presents to humanity, including risks of extinction, and concerned about risks of harm to the AIs themselves.</h1><p><i>Key AIMS Findings: 48% are concerned that, \u201cAI is likely to cause human extinction.\u201d 52% are concerned about \u201cthe possibility that AI will cause the end of the human race on Earth.\u201d 53% support campaigns against the exploitation of AIs. 43% support welfare standards that protect the wellbeing of robots/AIs. 68% agree that we must not cause unnecessary suffering for LLMs if they develop the capacity to suffer.</i></p><p>AI development towards more capable, generally skilled, intelligent systems is concerning to both the U.S. public and AI experts. Fast AI development brings significant risks to humanity and to the general existential trajectory of humanity and AIs. Additionally, the ongoing harms that the unreflective use of current AI systems bring to society (e.g., data privacy, discrimination in healthcare diagnosis) may be exacerbated by development that is too fast. Moreover, humans face threats to their long-term survival and potential to build a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/%20s13347-020-00421-8\"><u>harmonious</u></a>, integrated human-AI society\u2014which may include various hybrid or uploaded beings. We believe the U.S. public is accurately detecting the presence of potential long-term catastrophic risks (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/simulations-and-catastrophic-risks\"><u>simulations and suffering</u></a>) and four&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12001\"><u>near-term catastrophic risks</u></a> that AI and ML safety researchers have recently classified: malicious use, AI race, organizational risks, and rogue AI. Current frontier AI models pose these not mutually exclusive risks and already enact harms across the first three.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Malicious use:&nbsp;</strong>Future intentional malicious uses, for example by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/risk-factors-for-s-risks/#Malevolent_actors\"><u>malevolent actors</u></a>, including governments, terrorists, and profit-seeking corporations, are an ongoing and long-term risk. Even seemingly neutral uses of LLMs such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/india-religious-chatbots-1.6896628\"><u>Gita chatbots</u></a> that interpret ancient religious texts can incidentally spread misinformation and provoke violence.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>AI race:&nbsp;</strong>The AI arms race to produce and release increasingly capable and powerful LLMs and other advanced AI systems may directly lead to an ignorance of public and expert concerns. The corporations and governments engaged in the AI arms race seem at risk of overlooking the negative externalities of AI development that are passed on to the public. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xFotXGEotcKouifky/worlds-where-iterative-design-fails\"><u>unbounded iterative AI development strategies</u></a> threaten public harms from interactions with AI systems that haven\u2019t been properly vetted. The public is concerned about this dynamic. More people distrust than trust the companies building LLMs. Only 23% of respondents in the AIMS supplemental survey trusted LLM creators to put safety over profits, and only 27% trusted AI creators to control all current and future versions of an AI. The public has additional reason to worry about this dynamic because corporations and governments have shifted harms onto them in other contexts, particularly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/paying-the-cost-of-climate-change/\"><u>climate change</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Organizational risks:&nbsp;</strong>Another category of risks that frontier AI systems pose are organizational risks. These risks stem from unsafe or unsecure organizational cultures, environments, or power structures.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Organizational risks include outcomes such as catastrophic accidents that destroy the organization, sensitive information about the AI or AI safety tests being leaked to malicious actors, and a lack of any safety testing due to a lack of concern for AI safety. Hendrycks and colleagues (2023) highlighted that (1) catastrophes are hard to avoid even when competitive pressures are low, (2) AI accidents could be catastrophic, (3) it often takes years to discover severe flaws or risks, and (4) safety washing can undermine genuine efforts to improve AI safety.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Rogue AI:&nbsp;</strong>Rogue AI risks occur when a misaligned or unaligned AI model has significant autonomy to make decisions and act with little human oversight. In this context, advanced AIs could deliberately alter themselves to take control over their own goals, act on their initial misalignment in an unexpected way, engage in deception, or exhibit goal drift as a result of adapting to changes in their environments. Rogue AIs may lack inner alignment or outer alignment. That is, AI systems can be misaligned both with their instructions and with human values.</li></ul><p>In addition to concern about AI risks to humans, the U.S. public showed surprisingly high concern for the welfare of AIs in the AIMS supplemental survey. The majority of Americans supported campaigns against the exploitation of AIs and agreed that we must not cause unnecessary suffering for LLMs with the capacity to suffer. Forty-three percent of Americans supported welfare standards that protect the wellbeing of robots or AIs. This suggests that the public is concerned with ensuring a broadly good future, in which humans survive and thrive, and in which the welfare of AIs is taken seriously. Critically, the U.S. public perceives some moral obligations towards AIs already, supporting recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563222001947\"><u>empirical</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00260-1\"><u>theoretical</u></a> perspectives on the extension of moral consideration to at least some AIs.</p><h1>4. Specific policy tools designed for increasing AI safety are supported by a majority of the U.S. public.&nbsp;</h1><p><i>Key AIMS Findings: 71% support public campaigns to slow AI development. 71% support government regulation that slows AI development; when asked instead about opposition, 37% oppose it. 63% support banning the development of artificial general intelligence that is smarter than humans. 64% support a global ban on data centers that are large enough to train AI systems that are smarter than humans. 69% support a six-month pause on AI development.&nbsp;</i></p><p>AI experts and the U.S. public are concerned about the pace of AI development and the possibility of catastrophic outcomes for humans and AIs alike. Nevertheless, AI experts, prediction markets, and the public expect even more powerful and human-like AI systems to be developed in the near future. Given this, what, if anything, should be done about it?</p><p>We need a toolkit of strategies to address the complex interests involved in the promotion and development of safe AI. Early in 2023, FLI prominently called for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\"><u>pausing</u></a> the development of training frontier models significantly more capable than current models. This letter asked AI labs to implement a 6-month voluntary pause on large-scale experiments until we better understand current frontier model behaviors. In the days following its publication,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/\"><u>Yudkowsky (2023)</u></a> argued that the pause letter understates the problem, \u201cIf somebody builds a too-powerful AI, under present conditions, I expect that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter.\u201d Yudkowsky further suggested treating the development of AI like the development of nuclear weapons, a call echoed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\"><u>CAIS</u></a>. Even before the now-famous \u201cpause letter,\u201d policy experts were calling for bans on harmful applications of AI, compensation for those harmed by AI, licensing regimes to limit the spread of harmful AIs, and strict liability of AI companies for the harms caused by their products. These calls have intensified. Acting on them both through research and legislation is necessary, although legislation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/04/15/172377/laws-and-ethics-cant-keep-pace-with-technology/\"><u>tends to lag</u></a> behind actual development.</p><p>The AIMS supplemental survey data and other survey datasets suggest that the U.S. public is broadly supportive of a variety of safety policies that protect humanity from the development of powerful, advanced, and potentially uncontrollable frontier AI models. More than two-thirds of the U.S. public supported pausing AI development (69%) and public campaigns advocating slowdowns (71%). This level of support for regulation is even more striking given that the same AIMS data showed the least amount of trust placed in the governmental part of the AI ecosystem when compared to companies, engineers, AI output, training data, and algorithms.</p><p>The U.S. public supports outright bans on the development of some technologies. More than half of respondents (63%) supported banning the development of AGI that is smarter than humans. More than two-thirds (69%) supported banning the development of sentient AIs and 64% supported a ban on data centers that are large enough to train AI systems that are smarter than humans. Banning the development of a particular technology is typically considered a punitive and blunt tool, but it\u2019s a tool that the U.S. public is willing to consider when it comes to the development of advanced AI technologies and a relatively simple proposal on which to elicit public opinion. This suggests that the public may be more open to disruptive interventions than commonly assumed.</p><h1>5. The U.S. public is generally opposed to the development of AI sentience and human-AI integration.</h1><p><i>Key AIMS Findings: 70% support a global ban on the development of sentience in robots/AIs. 71% support a global ban on the development of AI-enhanced humans. 72% support a global ban on the development of robot-human hybrids. 59% oppose uploading human minds to computers (i.e., \u201cmind uploading\u201d).</i></p><p>As more complex, capable, and intelligent AIs emerge, some experts anticipate radical developments in: (1) de novo artificial sentience, and (2) a closer coupling with humans, leading to AI-enhanced humans or cyborgs (e.g., robot-human hybrids).&nbsp;</p><p>Artificial sentience comes with a host of conceptual and terminological difficulties. The Sentience Institute has begun examining some of these challenges:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/assessing-sentience-in-artificial-entities\"><u>Ladak (2021)</u></a> evaluated potential methods to evaluate sentience in AI systems, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/artificial-sentience-terminology\"><u>Pauketat (2021)</u></a> considered the terminology of artificial sentience, providing definitions for \u201cartificial sentience\u201d<i>&nbsp;</i>and referencing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2017.00060/full\"><u>Graziano\u2019s (2017)</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scirp.org/(S(czeh2tfqw2orz553k1w0r45))/reference/referencespapers.aspx?referenceid=2216579\"><u>Reggia\u2019s (2013)</u></a> definitions of \u201cartificial consciousness\u201d:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Artificial sentience</strong>:&nbsp;<ul><li>\u201cartificial entities with the capacity for positive and negative experiences, such as happiness and suffering\u201d</li><li>\u201cthe capacity for positive and negative experiences manifested in artificial entities\u201d&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Artificial consciousness:</strong><ul><li>\u201ca machine that contains a rich internal model of what consciousness is, attributes that property of consciousness to itself and to the people it interacts with, and uses that attribution to make predictions about human behavior.

This remains a challenging and unanswered question. Regardless of the conceptual challenges associated with \u201csentience\u201d and \u201cconsciousness,\u201d the U.S. public is opposed to the development of artificial sentience in this context. A majority of those surveyed in AIMS (70%) supported a global ban on the development of sentience in robots or AIs.</p><p>Leading AI and consciousness experts are also concerned about the creation of sentient AI. An&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amcs-community.org/open-letters/\"><u>open letter</u></a> by the Association for Mathematical Consciousness Science in 2023 called for the inclusion of consciousness research in the development of AI to address ethical, legal, and political concerns. Philosopher Thomas Metzinger has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/METASA-4.pdf\"><u>called for a moratorium</u></a> until the year 2050 on the development of \u201csynthetic phenomenology\u201d based on the risk of creating new forms of suffering.</p><p>AI-enhanced humans and robot-human hybrids are likely to span a continuum. On one end are humans who are not integrated with any AI or robotic components. On the other end are the disembodied AIs that are not integrated with any human components or directly physical capabilities. This continuum could include current cases such as humans who use AI-powered assistive devices to hear or move (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.soundly.com/blog/best-ai-hearing-aids\"><u>AI-powered hearing aids</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://livingwithamplitude.com/artificial-intelligence-prosthetic-technology/\"><u>AI-powered prosthetic limbs</u></a>). Science fiction is filled with examples of AI-enhanced humans and robot-human hybrids (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093870/\"><i><u>Robocop</u></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/\"><i><u>Battlestar Galactica</u></i></a>) that exemplify physically integrated human-AI/robotic systems. These systems could manifest in other ways, such as AI tools on smartphones to extend our limited cognitive capacities (e.g., extended memory capacity, increased processing speed for calculations) and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/borislavmarinov/2022/08/16/saber-brings-mass-adoption-of-military-exoskeletons-one-step-closer-to-reality/\"><u>robotic exoskeletons</u></a> designed for soldiers. Similarly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://researchfeatures.com/rethinking-consciousness/\"><u>mind uploads</u></a>, a possible future technology achieved through methods such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/whole-brain-emulation/\"><u>whole brain emulation</u></a>, might also be classified as human-AI hybrids or AI-enhanced humans. We found that over half of Americans (59%) opposed mind uploading.</p><p>Like with artificial sentience, there is no general consensus for the definitions of \u201cAI-enhanced humans\u201d and \u201crobot-human hybrids.\u201d It is unclear what the general public has in mind when they respond to questions asking about integration, enhancement, and hybridization. Without imposing any particular definition, the AIMS supplement survey showed that 71% of Americans support a global ban on the development of AI-enhanced humans and 72% support a global ban on the development of robot-human hybrids. Presumably, the general public is thinking about the futuristic cases of integration and hybridization rather than AI-powered assistive devices like hearing aids or prosthetic limbs when they endorse bans on integrative technologies. We should scrutinize public support for bans on integrative technologies because this might reflect a generalized perceived risk of all advanced AI technologies. It might also arise from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/the-importance-of-artificial-sentience\"><u>substratist</u></a> prejudice and fears over substrate-based contamination. More research is needed before policy directives are made.</p><p>People may have developed something of a precautionary principle towards advanced, and the advancement of, AI. People may be responding to threats to human distinctiveness and acting to preserve their perceived ownership over faculties like sentience that are viewed as distinctly, or innately, human. Threats to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103123000215\"><u>human distinctiveness</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-07486-005\"><u>uniqueness</u></a> might also provoke fears that advanced AIs, sentient AIs, or human-AI hybrids will supersede&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2022.1017677/full\"><u>human control</u></a> and change&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-021-09579-2\"><u>human autonomy</u></a>. In parallel to these threats, concern over advanced AI technologies may stem from a form of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/status-quo-bias-psychological-definition-4065385\"><u>status quo bias</u></a> in which humans prefer to maintain their current situation, regardless of whether change would be harmful or beneficial.</p><p>In an AI landscape that is rapidly evolving, public opinion provides policymakers with an important anchor point. The AIMS survey offers insights into the U.S. public\u2019s perspective at this critical juncture for AI governance. Policymakers need to act decisively, but thoughtfully, to implement policies that address the public's pressing concerns regarding advanced AI. Policymakers need also be aware that public opinion shapes policymaking and the acceptance of those policies. If policies appear too lenient or extreme compared to public opinion, backlash could occur that harms progress towards effective governance and building a harmonious human-AI future. Policymakers need to strike a balance between assertive risk mitigation and maintaining public trust through transparency, democratic process, and reasonable discourse.</p>", "user": {"username": "Janet Pauketat"}}, {"_id": "uxofehpkFrzgqqqPj", "title": "Survey for EAs: help us build better models of the community's priors!", "postedAt": "2024-02-22T18:43:08.622Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Many thanks to Spencer Greenberg, John Bargh, Lucius Caviola, Josh Lewis, and Philip Gubbins for their helpful and constructive feedback in the development of this survey.</i></p><p><i><strong>UPDATE 3/9</strong>: Thanks to broad participation from the community, this and associated surveys have has raised approximately $12,000 for high-impact charities.

These are genuine unpaid recommendations for books I have read that are <strong>useful and provide practical subject knowledge</strong>.</p><p>Final Note: I use AI law / policy / regulation under the umbrella term 'AI Governance' fairly widely here because they overlap very heavily in terms of coverage. Your definitions may vary.</p><h1>General Introductory Books</h1><h2><i>Books which are useful for those just starting</i></h2><h3><strong>Title</strong>: 'Robot Rules: Regulating Artificial Intelligence'</h3><p><strong>Jurisdiction</strong>: UK-centric, but EU application considered also (NA too to a limited degree)</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: \u00a321</p><p>One of the best starting points for those new to the regulation of AI is \u2018Robot Rules\u2019 by Jacob Turner. This is for several reasons - it is written for those merely interested in regulatory challenges with AI and not for experts (so the text is very readable and relatively jargon-free), and it is focused primarily on the day-to-day regulatory challenges and does not concern itself with more esoteric risks. It is also exploratory and descriptive (in that it details the what and why of regulatory challenges) but is not prescriptive and does not seek to propose answers. This is actually a good thing for an introductory text.</p><p>The book is quite big so there\u2019s a lot of information there, and is still very up to date. Legal concepts like agency are explained clearly for the lay-person too which is useful for non-law readers, but it does go into lots of detail about exactly why AI poses novel challenges to law which is useful for law readers. A great middle ground, and probably the best starting point in my opinion.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Title:</strong> 'Politics and Policy-Making in the UK'</h3><p><strong>Jurisdiction:&nbsp;</strong>UK</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: \u00a325</p><p>This is a fantastic introduction to policy-making in the UK, and gives great background in this area. Perhaps most importantly it was released in 2023, and therefore includes policy-making post-Brexit and post-Pandemic which is something older books couldn\u2019t have predicted. In all, this is a super readable book that gives a modern, up to date understanding of how UK public policy works via both a practical and theoretical framework. It is not AI-specific, but does give a good overview of the mechanisms by which AI policy is created both in hard procedural and softer influence terms.</p><h3><strong>Title</strong>: 'Regulating Artificial Intelligence in Industry'</h3><p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Global</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> \u00a340</p><p>This book gives a broad range of introductory discussions from various experts in-industry on how AI regulation is undertaken in their industries and how the law guides that. Industries include aviation, government, energy, military, and more. This is a very, very important area of knowledge for anyone interested in AI Governance from a practical standpoint. One of the major failure points I see in AI governance or policy ideas/projects/proposals is a lack of realistic implementation chance in-industry due to various factors. A good understanding of this is foundational for exploring governance.</p><h1>More Detailed / Advanced Books</h1><h2><i>Books which are useful for more advanced readers (existing knowledge of law and policy, or patience required to learn on the go)</i></h2><h3><strong>Title</strong>: 'Advanced Introduction to Law and Artificial Intelligence'</h3><p><strong>Jurisdiction</strong>: Global</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: \u00a320</p><p>Edited by Woodrow Barfield and Ugo Pagallo (both big names in the law of AI), this book delves into how various jurisdictions and regimes deal with major issues in this area such as autonomous vehicles or the risks of increasingly complex AI systems. It compares regimes from UK, EU, and NA as well as further afield such as China, India, and Russia. It\u2019s laid out simply by section, and is fantastic for referring to when you need information on AI law and regulation in a specific area such as human rights, intellectual property, criminal law, etc.</p><p>It is lighter on detail somewhat than some other tomes, but this is to further the readability which it achieves well. It is a reference more than an educational tome. The reason it is in the more detailed / advanced section of this list is because it does not explain any of the legal terms, and assumes a basic level of legal literacy (eg. law student level). It is perfectly readable by a normal reader who is prepared to Google any terms or ideas that are new to them.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Title:</strong> 'The Cambridge Handbook of the Law of Algorithms'</h3><p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Global</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> \u00a360 - \u00a3180 (depending on availability and retailer - no idea why)</p><p>First things first this book is massive. Even by law standards. I brought this on a plane to read once and it didn\u2019t fit on the folding tray without bending it downwards and sliding off. I\u2019m also fairly sure if I put it in my suitcase it would have taken me over my weight allowance! At just under 800 pages long and A4 in size, with what appears to be around size 10 text, it is easy to be put off or intimidated - yet the book is surprisingly readable despite its detail. Edited by Woodrow Barfield (from the previous book in this list), this one includes a lot of very detailed essays and explorations by leading legal scholars in various AI law and policy fields from the UK, EU, NA, Asia, and the wider world.</p><p>The book is written for legal scholars in an international manner, and so despite being quite readable (effort has obviously been made to keep the book readable for second language readers) there is a deep exploration of legal concepts in many areas which means to get the full value you either need a basic level of legal literacy or be willing to be patient with yourself and learn as you go.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><u>Specialist Areas</u></h1><h2>Areas of specialist AI governance application which differ from the legal 'norms'</h2><h3><strong>Title:</strong> 'The AI Wave in Defence Innovation'</h3><p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Global</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: \u00a330</p><p>This very detailed book looks at AI specifically within a Defence context - ie military uses of AI. It is very recent and so comes after the initiation of the Russo-Ukrainian War and the Israel-Hamas War so takes account of how these have accelerated AI in military contexts too.</p><p>The book goes into a lot of detail on how various nations and groups of nations are advancing and deploying AI, as well as the various theories around how AI will impact the future of warfare and vice-versa. It\u2019s very neutral and balanced, and a fantastic introduction for someone interested in AI Risk from a military perspective. Much research of this kind and depth is not public so it\u2019s great to have a publicly available round-up of technologies and policies by experts in military technology matters.</p><p>A lot of academic research into AI risk in warfare suffers from a lack of understanding of the industry itself and how technology procurement and development in the military sphere works - so this book is great for plugging those gaps. It usefully covers military industry as well, and how that fits into the greater governance puzzle.</p><h3>Title: 'Artificial Intelligence, Computational Modelling and Criminal Proceedings'</h3><p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> EU (but core concepts relevant globally)</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> \u00a3110</p><p>This book covers how AI and computational modelling impact various stages of procedure in the investigation and adjudication in criminal law. It focuses almost entirely on EU law (particularly ECHR case law) but is a fantastic guidebook on how AI simultaneously impacts and is impacted by not just AI legislation and policy but how AI is impacted by non-AI policy in the legal system.</p><p>Only really useful for UK-based folks if their area of specialism is criminal law OR have a deep interest in AI in investigative/adjudicative procedure, but very useful for EU folks.</p><h1><br><u>Honourable Mentions</u></h1><h2>Books which could not be placed into above categories, but deserve highlighting</h2><h3><strong>Title</strong>: 'The Oxford Handbook of AI Governance'</h3><p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Global</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> \u00a3142</p><p>This is an \u2018honourable mention\u2019 because this book looks great&nbsp;<strong>but I haven\u2019t read it</strong> (which is a criteria for this list). I intend to buy it at the end of this month, and may add it to the list post-read in the appropriate category. From the description and from the authors of the essays it looks like it will be high quality and cover many important areas in some good depth. The cost however is very prohibitive for many people. It is worth noting that I had a bit of a cheapskate snuffle and some of this book is available in pdf form via your academic institution for free - though it is always preferable to reward the contributors by purchasing when possible.</p><h1><br>Summarising Remarks</h1><p>I have no idea if this style of post is useful for anyone (I am trying to experiment with more useful ways of conveying some of this information) so do let me know.</p><p>I may compile a further list of sources we use in frontline AI legislation / safety / governance 'on the job' or more specialised in-industry materials depending on how useful this post is to people. It may be useful for those aiming to go into practical regulatory roles.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "AI Law"}}, {"_id": "X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78", "title": "From salt intake reduction to labor migration: Announcing top ideas for the AIM 2024 CE Incubation Program", "postedAt": "2024-02-22T14:45:08.333Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>TLDR: </strong>In this post, we announce our top four charity ideas to launch through our August 12-October 4, 2024 Incubation Program.

Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and are among the top ten contributors to years lived with disabilities. There is good evidence that reducing the amount of sodium people consume in their diets can reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems. Therefore, several countries have successfully reduced the sodium intake of their population, for example by setting sodium limits, which led to the food industry reformulating certain high-salt products. We think that an organization advocating and assisting in implementing these policies could cost-effectively improve the health of millions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Facilitating international labor migration via a digital platform</h2><p>Migrating abroad for work can bring huge financial benefits to people experiencing poverty. Millions of people every year try to tap into these benefits by applying for temporary jobs in higher-income countries. However, the market for matching candidates with jobs is often highly inefficient and riddled with misinformation, putting candidates at financial and personal risk. In many countries, it can cost candidates several years\u2019 worth of salaries to secure a job abroad. Fraud is also highly prevalent, leading to candidates often failing to migrate and instead ending up in debt. This charity will build a semi-automated digital platform that combines a job board, transparent information on how to migrate, and low-cost personalized support with the process. We expect this platform to have multiple effects: lowering recruitment fees, lowering the risk of fraud, enabling the migration of lower-income individuals, improving job satisfaction, and potentially increasing the overall number of migrants. This work is currently highly neglected, and our models indicate that a charity like this could achieve very high cost-effectiveness.</p><h2>Ceramic filters for improving water quality</h2><p>In 2022, at least&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water#:~:text=Microbiologically%20contaminated%20drinking%20water%20can,000%20diarrhoeal%20deaths%20each%20year.\"><u>1.7 billion people</u></a> worldwide used drinking water sources contaminated with feces. This leads to waterborne disease, which is a common cause of diarrhea and death in children in low-income settings. Studies show that the use of ceramic filters reduces episodes of diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries by an estimated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09603120600641474\"><u>34</u></a>-<a href=\"https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/79/5/article-p696.xml\"><u>71</u></a>%. This new organization will provide these ceramic water filters for free to families without access to clean drinking water. This intervention is expected to be similarly cost-effective as other water quality interventions (such as in-line chlorination), yet it does not need as much existing infrastructure, such as water piping or reliable supply chains, and as such, can reach people in more deprived areas.</p><h2>Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) groups</h2><p>In 2020, out of the 135 million births worldwide there were approximately 1.4 million stillbirths, 2.4 million neonatal deaths, and 300,000 maternal deaths. Most of this burden occurs in low and middle-income countries. Community-based interventions represent a promising approach better suited for rural populations, where access to institutional healthcare is poor, and mortality rates are often higher. PLA groups are facilitated self-help groups that use a specific framework to guide member participants in identifying, executing, and evaluating the most promising solutions to their problems. Meta-analysis of many randomized studies suggests that running a PLA group reduces maternal mortality by 49% and neonatal mortality by 33% amongst all births in the entire community that the group serves. Based on this evidence, it is the only community-based newborn and maternal health intervention that the WHO recommends. Yet few countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden is highest, have implemented this intervention. An organization focused on training facilitators and running these groups in rural villages would be highly cost-effective, with a large potential for positive externalities.</p><h1><strong>One-page Summaries &amp; Full Reports</strong></h1><h2>Advocacy for salt intake reduction</h2><p><strong>Sodium (usually consumed as table salt) is a silent killer. Each year, diets high in salt contribute to&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://ihmeuw.org/6brx\"><strong><u>millions of deaths</u></strong></a><strong> due to cardiovascular disease</strong>. The burden of cardiovascular diseases related to sodium consumption is expected to grow due to dietary changes, aging populations, and lifestyle changes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Limiting salt consumption levels is regarded as a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/2023-04/Chronic%20Dieseases%20Manuscript%20230211_0.pdf\"><strong><u>cost-effective way</u></strong></a><strong> to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases at a population level</strong>. We recommend that a new nonprofit organization should focus on advocating for sodium policies and assisting food producers to reformulate their products in line with safe limits. We think interventions of this type are promising because they affect the choices available to consumers and, as such, do not rely on individual behavioral changes to reach a large scale.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A new nonprofit organization could combine advocacy and technical assistance to lead the State and food producers to cooperate and reduce the level of sodium in popular high-salt foods.</strong> Complementary interventions, such as front-of-pack labeling and fiscal approaches, may support these goals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is a high-risk, high-reward intervention.</strong> We estimate that nonprofits have successfully led to food reformulation,&nbsp; direct policy change and correct implementation in around ten percent of their advocacy attempts. It may take multiple attempts and careful targeting for a new organization to achieve change. Yet given the cost-effectiveness of this intervention, this low-success scenario is still worth pursuing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall, there is evidence of a reduction in sodium intake due to reformulation</strong>, based on primarily observational longitudinal studies documenting the reduction of sodium consumption following reformulation interventions. This is not very high-quality evidence but it is in line with expectations for an evidence base of policy in this space. Experts largely agreed with our conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our speculative cost-effectiveness model and other CEAs in the literature suggest that sodium advocacy is highly cost-effective</strong>. Our modeling suggests that in Indonesia, this intervention may avert 866 DALYs for every USD 1,000 spent (about $1 per DALY). In Georgia, it may avert 13.8 DALYs for every USD 1,000 spent (about $72 per DALY).</p><p><strong>Overall, we believe this is an idea worth recommending for incubation.&nbsp;</strong>We are excited by the potential leverage that policy work can have and the possibility of a charity that could have a huge outsized impact on people\u2019s lives and health and address a growing global problem.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:38.3%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/lax7l9suhop4jxmgm2gn\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/l3uxxj2ublpylfdfupc7 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/ypki5srosglj7qbf4juz 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/brzuqq9cy23a3zj90esd 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/xk1ukwbqsf1zjlgoycgm 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/tr8awswixybwvfh91grn 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/brphs09t17uom5c6526v 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/e5fdzclvfgujabsx1oxn 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/quhowe1h5dk4wclia1qf 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/mg7ygulry0susixffsay 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/bqhhj49lkgf0e6fbptsw 1414w\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_9854756972aa4565be43a4df6206dc12.pdf\"><strong>[READ THE FULL REPORT]</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h2>Facilitating international labor migration via a digital platform</h2><p><strong>International labor migration has the potential to create&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20220258\"><strong><u>large financial returns</u></strong></a><strong> for workers and their families.</strong> While permanent migration is often not legally possible for citizens of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), temporary labor migration \u2013 also known as guest work \u2013 is highly prevalent. LMICs in regions such as South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Africa collectively send millions of workers every year to richer countries in neighboring regions, such as countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Malaysia, or Singapore. Where the migrant workers are not exploited, temporary worker migration leads to an increase in consumption and well-being for the workers and their families. Given that this form of migration is temporary, legal, and tied to specific job vacancies, it also tends to be highly beneficial to the residents of the destination countries.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, this type of migration is a complex, risky, and often costly process for the migrants.&nbsp;</strong>Potential migrants typically learn about and get access to job opportunities via networks of intermediaries who often exploit the information and power asymmetries to charge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.migrationdataportal.org/themes/migrant-recruitment-costs\"><u>exorbitant fees</u></a>. Moreover, they may have an incentive to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mideq.org/en/resources-index-page/mediated-migration-literature-review-migration-intermediaries/\"><u>underinform or misinform their clients</u></a>, resulting in migrants accepting jobs with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/504291627493488985/pdf/Temporary-Migration-for-Long-term-Investment.pdf\"><u>lower-than-expected salaries</u></a> and worse working conditions. Individuals who start the application process but fail to migrate often suffer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/content/qt6574658k/qt6574658k.pdf\"><u>huge losses</u></a> and sink their families into debt.</p><p><strong>This charity will create a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d service to support potential migrants, avoiding exploitation and reducing the costs of migration.&nbsp;</strong>The service will take migrants through the process of learning about working abroad, finding the right job, and fulfilling the necessary requirements for successful migration. It will achieve this by creating a digital platform featuring a job board paired with free, transparent information on the practicalities and pros &amp; cons of migrating, personalized one-to-one support (via a call center), and recommendations to high-quality third-party services.</p><p><strong>Additionally, this charity could work directly with employers in destination countries to create new migration opportunities that wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise.&nbsp;</strong>Based on expert interviews, we believe there are countries with legal immigration quotas that are not being filled and employers looking to hire migrant workers but not having good channels through which to do so. Given the large financial returns to working abroad, this could significantly increase the charity\u2019s impact and cost-effectiveness. However, such expansion might be complex and costly to undertake, so we haven\u2019t factored it into our main models.</p><p><strong>This topic has been relatively neglected by nonprofits.&nbsp;</strong>Although the harms caused in the process of guest work migration have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/unpd_egm_200507_p01_philmartin.pdf\"><u>long been known</u></a> to governments and international organizations, we are not aware of any organizations implementing a digital app or similar information-based solutions to this problem at scale. While this means that the proposed solution is relatively understudied, we believe that all of the proposed activities are tractable.</p><p><strong>This charity has the potential to be very cost-effective</strong>. Even if it only reduces the cost of migrating \u2013 and doesn\u2019t create additional migration \u2013 we estimate it could achieve income benefits equivalent to 22 doublings of consumption per $1000 spent for a charity operating in Nepal. If the charity also managed to create additional migration, it could achieve income benefits equivalent to 87 doublings of consumption per $1000 spent (note, if we adjusted the above numbers based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit#\"><u>GiveWell\u2019s 2020 moral weights,</u></a> this would be equivalent to $105 per DALY and $26 per DALY, respectively). Finally, if the charity adopted a social enterprise model and charged its successfully-migrating users a modest $50 fee, it could be even more cost-effective.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall, we believe this is an idea worth recommending for incubation.&nbsp;</strong>We are excited about this idea. It offers a scalable way of transforming the livelihoods of people experiencing poverty and addresses a decades-old problem with a modern solution.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:41.6%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/kv1a4j5d0iyn5ya2wipp\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/wvtrfwl3bueospbmra06 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/at6evgu72tu5mntlcm1j 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/tln5fvy1sym3ykhvnnrw 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/ktpbkk4t8vb1tqtezcck 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/athzq2b4zhlnxov15mz1 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/qzu2d35ym2kcsuxwiycw 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/qonlbuuxn5ny3gklob2g 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/xjw7lrdwz8szyvgeobku 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/iilnx3r2iixevlvp6f7e 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/m5lbi8ppzl7ifsteebrx 1414w\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_7c1919b5f90742b99ef54564cd751885.pdf\"><strong>[READ THE FULL REPORT]</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h2>Ceramic filters for improving water quality</h2><p><strong>In 2022,&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/proportion-using-safely-managed-drinking-water?tab=chart&amp;country=~OWID_WRL\"><strong><u>one in four</u></strong></a><strong> people did not have access to clean drinking water</strong>.

These studies find that the use of these filters can reduce episodes of diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries by an estimated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09603120600641474\"><u>34</u></a>-<a href=\"https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/79/5/article-p696.xml\"><u>71</u></a>%. In 2019 alone, diarrheal disease&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ihmeuw.org/6bf3\"><u>is estimated</u></a> to have killed 1.5 million people, which is more than tuberculosis or malaria. 0.5 million of these deaths were in children under the age of 5.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There is room for a new organization working in the space</strong>. Most existing filtration efforts are small and locally-led. This means that there are many countries and regions that are not covered by existing work and would benefit greatly from a new charity providing free filters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This intervention is expected to be highly cost-effective and can reach people in more deprived areas.</strong> It is expected to be similarly cost-effective as other water quality interventions (such as chlorination) with an average estimated cost-effectiveness of $77 per DALY (ranging from $15-$118 depending on the country modeled), yet it does not need there to be as much existing infrastructure such as water piping or reliable supply chains, and as such can reach people in more deprived areas.</p><p><strong>There are a number of considerations and uncertainties that founders working on this idea would need to work through.&nbsp;</strong>Different water treatment solutions affect different pathogens. Ceramic water filters stop bacteria and protozoa but not viruses, whereas chlorination kills bacteria and viruses but not protozoa. This means that in some cases where there is a higher prevalence of viruses, it would be more appropriate to use chlorination rather than ceramic filters. Founders should consider the burden caused by different pathogens when choosing a location to work in. Also, this intervention may need an RCT fairly early on. The current evidence base only measures the reduction in episodes of diarrhea from ceramic water filter use, so it would be beneficial to demonstrate more directly the effect on child mortality.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall, we believe this is an idea worth recommending for incubation.&nbsp;</strong>Addressing the burden of unclean drinking water is a global health priority.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We think that the provision of free ceramic water filters will significantly aid in achieving this goal at a low cost and can reach populations that might be missed by existing water quality interventions, such as chlorination.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:39.77%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/wekv5f4cychxfeofrxvo\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/ck3sbm5g61krxnsjzgrb 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/p1sr6qokyyqxzx0siiby 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/iwfzvinx4ag3lnz0aaok 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/cvqbrgfya7st2hlrawov 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/kk9iimjtvu7rltompopc 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/xxfvlmr7lsoomfhzdqxo 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/v9kf6y2htqyervirpek3 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/hprfe2mo2ryi33m1ze8b 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/w5bobvggau2ydrqv8k7q 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/xmuiy6lxn219jboy3wmn 1414w\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_98362d974b1942aab99c4dc66d6e828c.pdf\"><strong>[READ THE FULL REPORT]</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h2>Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) groups</h2><p><strong>Maternal and neonatal disorders are significant causes of global mortality.&nbsp;</strong>In 2020, out of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-births-per-year\"><u>135 million births</u></a> worldwide, there were approximately&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00195-X/fulltext#:~:text=Maternal%20mortality%2C%20stillbirths%2C%20and%20neonatal%20mortality%20are%20major%20global%20health,million%20neonatal%20deaths%20in%202020.\"><u>1.4 million stillbirths and 2.4 million neonatal deaths</u></a>.

Over 90% of maternal deaths occur in these regions \u2013 Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, in particular, account for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-maternal-deaths-by-region\"><u>68% and 19% of these deaths</u></a>, respectively.</p><p><strong>Community-based interventions represent a promising approach that is better suited for rural populations</strong>, where access to institutional healthcare is poor. There is often a significant difference between mortality rates in rural and urban areas, and access to care is much worse in rural areas.</p><p><strong>Participatory learning and action (PLA) groups are a simple yet well-evidenced community-based intervention that could be promising to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths</strong>. It involves holding facilitated group meetings for women of reproductive age, particularly pregnant women, to foster local strategies that enhance care-seeking behaviors and adopt preventive health practices for better maternal and newborn health. PLA groups are facilitated to develop their own solutions to health challenges. Common solutions that the groups develop include pooling community funds into an emergency fund, community bicycle ambulance services, and community-based health campaigns.</p><p><strong>Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of PLA in reducing neonatal and maternal mortality.</strong> A meta-analysis conducted by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60685-6/fulltext\"><u>Prost et al. (2013)</u></a>, which included seven trials involving approximately 119,000 births, found that when &gt;30% of all pregnant women participated in groups, PLA reduced maternal mortality by 49% and neonatal mortality by 33% amongst&nbsp;<strong>all births in the community</strong>. In such cases, pregnant women who did not participate also benefited from the group-led solutions.</p><p><strong>In addition to maternal and neonatal mortality, we are also excited by the potential positive externalities that PLA groups may have.</strong> There is weak evidence that PLA groups could benefit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20207411/\"><u>maternal mental health</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202562\"><u>family planning</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30588343/\"><u>under-five child health</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/714007\"><u>community resilience to crop failures</u></a>, and individual and community agency.</p><p><strong>PLA is estimated to be highly cost-effective.&nbsp;</strong>The groups can be extremely low-cost to run. Our cost-effectiveness analysis estimated that hiring community workers to run PLA groups full-time would cost ~$20-$70 per DALYs averted. This is equivalent to ~14-47 DALYs per $1000 spent.</p><p><strong>Although the maternal and neonatal space is not as neglected, this is a relatively neglected intervention within the space</strong>. Growing attention and funding are devoted to maternal and neonatal health, and the burden is slowly decreasing. However, this intervention has only been implemented in about 15 countries, with few at scale.</p><p><strong>Experts are excited by the prospect of a new nonprofit implementing this intervention.&nbsp;</strong>GiveWell has been interested in funding this intervention as they think it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/PLA-MNH\"><u>meets their bar for cost-effectiveness</u></a>. However, they\u2019ve been finding it challenging to find implementation partners.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.womenandchildrenfirst.org.uk/technical-assistance\"><u>Women and Children First</u></a>, the pioneer of the intervention, serves a technical assistance role and is excited to support a potential CE-incubated charity.</p><p><strong>There are some challenges and remaining uncertainties regarding the intervention.</strong> The new nonprofit would have to work out how to recruit pregnant (or soon-to-be pregnant) women, as reaching a sufficient percentage of them is crucial for effect size. Maintaining a high level of cost-effectiveness as the organization scales might also be a challenge. There is also a weak concern about the external validity of the intervention, as most of the RCTs were conducted in South Asia, although the RCT with the highest effect size on neonatal mortality was from Malawi.</p><p><strong>Overall, we believe this is an idea worth recommending for incubation</strong>. A new organization focused on running and scaling PLA groups for maternal and neonatal health will likely be highly cost-effective.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:36.25%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/mh6hspdbskdkvrue3vvm\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/sleaps3ugr1lzga6hfyo 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/nvbvmhobzxyikwqwpyo1 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/u0jhjnuy2w7ogsq8fni2 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/zulmipzcd4l5nahqnrbc 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/hnclfuyh5kt5p8cfbpwj 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/avhgfvo2x7muho9faxzf 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/ykvgifxi8wx4x0v3r1qv 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/vvogjzqdpwpdanue0on3 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/ky4c4cfrqo00o1gq6hti 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/X65Lxnd4hbGpuMq78/xty9xyysvcherdj885v3 1414w\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_e4707b83ae454fb68a837f20e805f7db.pdf\"><strong>[READ THE FULL REPORT]</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Cause areas for February-March 2025 Incubation Program</strong></h2><p>You can now also apply (using the same form) to the February-March 2025 Incubation Program that will focus on:&nbsp;<strong>Expert-sourced neglected interventions in the areas of Global Health and Development and Farmed Animal Advocacy.</strong></p><p><strong>How to apply</strong><br>To apply, fill out the <a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/240282852958365\">[APPLICATION FORM]</a>, which should only take around 30 minutes.

A <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047\">new bill in California\u2019s state legislature</a> would codify this practice as a legal requirement, and clarify the legal liability faced by developers whose AI systems cause unreasonable risks or critical harms to public safety. (Note: The bill was <a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/20240208-senator-wiener-introduces-legislation-ensure-safe-development-large-scale-artificial\">co-sponsored</a> by the Center for AI Safety Action Fund.)&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the world\u2019s leading AI developers and cloud compute providers are located in California. This means the state has significant direct control over AI development, and it could serve as a testing grounds for policies that might later be adopted nationally or internationally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Safety and security protocols for advanced AI models. </strong>This bill would require developers of certain leading AI models to adopt safety and security protocols. This requirement only applies to models that may surpass the capabilities of all models previously established as safe. Models that will not exceed the performance of known safe models are exempt from these requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific requirements include cybersecurity measures to \u201cprevent theft, misappropriation, malicious use, or inadvertent release or escape of the model weights.\u201d Securing model weights against theft might require multi-year efforts to build air-gapped data centers and insider threat detection programs, argued a recent RAND <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WRA2849-1.html\">report</a>. Additionally, developers would need to implement the capacity to fully shut down their models in the event of an emergency. More broadly, they would need to implement best practices as developed by industry, academia, and standard-setting organizations such as NIST.&nbsp;</p><p>Developers would not be allowed to release any model that poses an \u201cunreasonable risk\u2026 that an individual may be able to use the hazardous capabilities of the model\u201d to cause a \u201ccritical harm.\u201d Critical harms are defined to include the creation or use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons and cyberattacks, as well as causing specific economic damages of greater than $500M.</p><p><strong>Compliance will be self-certified by AI companies and spot-checked via lawsuits.</strong> AI companies would be asked to self-certify that all of these requirements have been implemented faithfully. The bill also creates a new state office within the California Department of Technology called the Frontier Model Division which would gather information about corporate compliance with the law.&nbsp;</p><p>If there is evidence that a company has violated the law, the Attorney General of California would be able to sue in civil court. Judges could fine companies for up to 30% of model development costs for violations. Moreover, if there is \u201can imminent risk or threat to public safety,\u201d companies could be ordered to temporarily shut down or permanently destroy their models.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill contains a variety of other provisions, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Cloud compute providers would need to conduct Know Your Customer (KYC)&nbsp; screenings for clients seeking large quantities of compute</li><li>Companies would be required to report incidents of concerning AI behavior</li><li>California would establish a new public computing cluster called CalCompute</li><li>Whistleblowers would be protected from retaliation by their employers, though the bill would not create the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower#:~:text=The%20Commission%20is%20authorized%20by,30%25%20of%20the%20money%20collected.\">positive incentives for whistleblowing</a> that exist in other industries</li></ul><p>Overall, the bill would serve to codify commitments to safety that some companies have already made. This is important because AI companies face strong commercial incentives to go back on their commitments to public safety. For example, OpenAI transitioned from a non-profit to a for-profit, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/microsoft-lays-off-an-ethical-ai-team-as-it-doubles-down-on-openai/\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/18/facebook-parent-meta-breaks-up-its-responsible-ai-team.html#:~:text=Meta%20has%20disbanded%20its%20Responsible,according%20to%20a%20Meta%20spokesperson.\">Facebook</a> fired their responsible AI teams. The bill has important limitations: Compliance with the law would be self-certified by companies, and it would only apply to AI developers in California. But it represents a significant step towards legal liability for AI developers that cause catastrophic harm.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information, check out <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047\">the bill\u2019s text</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/landmark-ai-regulations-proposed-california/story?id=107095465\">ABC News</a>, or <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-the-proposed-california-sb-1047\">this blog post</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Precedents for AI Policy: Healthcare and Biosecurity</h2><p>AI presents unique challenges, but policymakers can draw lessons for AI governance from other regulatory regimes.

Similar proposals have been made by US Senators <a href=\"https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/the-landscape-of-us-ai-legislation\">Elizabeth Warren, Lindsay Graham, Michael Bennett, and Peter Welch</a> for the governance of AI and other digital platforms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FSAP-style oversight</strong><i><strong>.</strong></i> Another <a href=\"https://www.iaps.ai/research/federal-select-agent-program\">paper</a> draws lessons for AI regulation from the CDC\u2019s Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP). FSAP regulates work involving dangerous pathogens and toxins. Entities performing such research must obtain licenses from the CDC (for human pathogens) and follow biosecurity and biosafety regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly to the FDA, FSAP regulates even the earliest stages of the use of hazardous biological agents. FSAP employs many technical experts in biosecurity, suggesting that governments can effectively regulate complex technical domains.&nbsp;</p><p>The paper points out significant actions taken by FSAP. As of 2016, it had suspended or revoked licenses for at least 10 entities (out of a total of around 300) for violating federal standards. This suggests that risky behavior involving dangerous pathogens would have occurred by default.&nbsp;</p><p>One drawback of FSAP\u2019s approach is their reliance on \u201cchecklists\u201d and other formulaic regulations. They regulate a specified list of toxins and pathogens already known to be dangerous, but they do not attempt to anticipate new risks from new pathogens. A <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688906.pdf\">GAO report</a> found that \u201cthe program\u2019s reviews may not target the highest-risk activities, in part because it has not formally assessed which activities pose the highest risk.\u201d The paper recommends that AI regulators go further than FSAP and adopt strong \u201crisk based\u201d and anticipatory regulation.&nbsp;</p><h2>Enforcing the EU AI Act</h2><p>The European Union has passed its AI Act.

Wise passed away on February 15th after a long illness. He was 73 years old.</p><p>An innovative scholar and groundbreaking expert on animal law, Wise founded and served as president of the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), the only nonprofit organization in the US dedicated solely to establishing legal rights for nonhuman animals. As the NhRP\u2019s lead attorney, he filed historic lawsuits demanding the right to liberty of captive chimpanzees and elephants, achieving widely recognized legal firsts for his clients.</p><p>Most notably, under Wise\u2019s leadership the NhRP filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of Happy, an elephant held alone in captivity at the Bronx Zoo. Happy\u2019s case, which historian Jill Lepore has called \u201cthe most important animal-rights case of the 21st-century,\u201d reached the New York Court of Appeals in 2022. The Court of Appeals then became the highest court of an English-speaking jurisdiction to hear arguments calling for a legal right for an animal. Although the Court ultimately denied Happy\u2019s petition, two judges wrote historic dissents refuting the idea that only humans can have rights. Under Wise\u2019s leadership, the NhRP also helped develop and pass the first animal rights law in the country in 2023\u2013an ordinance that protects elephants\u2019 right to liberty.</p><p>Wise said he decided to become a lawyer after developing a deep commitment to social justice as a result of his involvement in the anti-Vietnam War movement while an undergraduate at the College of William and Mary. He graduated from Boston University Law School in 1976 and began his legal career as a criminal defense lawyer. Several years later, Peter Singer\u2019s book Animal Liberation inspired Wise to become an animal protection lawyer.</p><p>From 1985 to 1995, Wise was president of the Animal Legal Defense Fund. As Wise told The New York Times Magazine, his litigation work during this time led him to conclude that the rightlessness of animals was the fundamental barrier to humans vindicating animals\u2019 interests. This is because, under animal welfare laws, lawyers must make the case for how a human has been harmed by the animal\u2019s treatment or situation; as Wise elaborated in his writings and talks, legal injuries to animals do not matter in court because animals are unjustly considered legal \u201cthings\u201d with no rights, legally equivalent to inanimate objects, their intrinsic interests essentially invisible to judges.</p><p>In 1995, Wise launched the Nonhuman Rights Project to address this core issue facing all animals and their advocates. After more than a decade of preparation, the NhRP filed first-of-their-kind lawsuits in 2013, demanding rights for four captive chimpanzees in New York State. A year and a half later, two of the NhRP\u2019s clients became the first animals in legal history to have habeas corpus hearings to determine the lawfulness of their imprisonment.</p><p>Wise was also a leading force in the development of animal law as a distinct academic curriculum, teaching the first-ever animal law course offered at Harvard University in 2000. He remained committed to educating the next generation of animal rights lawyers throughout his career, teaching animal rights jurisprudence at law schools around the world, including Stanford Law School, the University of Miami Law School, St. Thomas University Law School, John Marshall Law School, Lewis and Clark Law School, Vermont Law School, Tel Aviv University, and the Autonomous University of Barcelona.</p><p>Wise is the author of four books: Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for Animals (2000); Drawing the Line: Science and the Case for Animal Rights (2002); Though the Heavens May Fall: The Landmark Trial That Led to the End of Human Slavery (2005); and An American Trilogy: Death, Slavery, and Dominion Along the Banks of the Cape Fear River (2009). He is the co-author, with Samuel Machado and Cynthia Sousa Machado, of a graphic novel about Happy\u2019s case, Thing: Inside the Struggle for Animal Personhood (2023).</p><p>Over the course of his career, Wise published hundreds of animal rights articles and delivered thousands of lectures to audiences worldwide. He was also featured regularly on a wide variety of television and radio shows globally, including The Colbert Report, TED Radio Hour, NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, Morning Edition, and Fresh Air with Terry Gross, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News, Fox News, Court TV, MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, and numerous BBC radio shows.</p><p>Wise was the subject of a 2016 Emmy-nominated documentary by acclaimed filmmakers Chris Hegedus and D A Pennebaker, Unlocking the Cage. The film followed Wise and his colleagues at the NhRP as they pursued their first cases.</p><p>Wise is survived by his wife, Gail Price-Wise, his children, Roma Augusta and her husband Michael Augusta, Siena Wise, Christopher Wise, his step-daughter, Mariana Price, his brother, Robert Wise, and his canine companion Yogi.&nbsp;</p><p>Other articles and rememberances:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nonhumanrights.org/steve/\">https://www.nonhumanrights.org/steve/</a></p><p>https://aldf.org/article/remembering-animal-rights-trailblazer-steve-wise/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/02/20/steven-wise-dead-animal-rights/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/02/20/steven-wise-dead-animal-rights/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://law.lclark.edu/live/news/52969-the-lasting-legacy-of-steven-m-wise-1950-2024\">https://law.lclark.edu/live/news/52969-the-lasting-legacy-of-steven-m-wise-1950-2024</a></p><p><a href=\"https://whalesanctuaryproject.org/remembering-steven-m-wise/\">https://whalesanctuaryproject.org/remembering-steven-m-wise/</a>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Tyner"}}, {"_id": "bPgqCqjd3iddjeGuA", "title": "African Heads of States Ban Donkey Skin Trade", "postedAt": "2024-02-22T19:20:39.734Z", "htmlBody": "<p>African Union Heads of State, during their gathering in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the 37th Ordinary Session of the African Union Assembly, successfully placed a ban on the Donkey skin trade following the proposal that was made by the Specialised Technical Committee for Agriculture, Rural Development, Water, and Environment in November 2023.</p>", "user": {"username": "abilibadanielbaba11@gmail.com"}}, {"_id": "Nuo6t9x5Hxrr6KdGw", "title": "Request* for Biosecurity project assistance", "postedAt": "2024-02-21T18:20:00.245Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I am looking for people to help/give feedback on a biosecurity project.</p><p><strong>Salary:</strong> none</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Remote (Global)</p><p><strong>Application:</strong> email me at <a href=\"mailto:wesreisen2@gmail.com\">wesreisen2@gmail.com </a>saying you'd like to help, preferably with some details on what you'd expect to do, as well as what you're good at.

Alonso; Cian Hamilton (Welfare Footprint Project)&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1><p>In assessing animal welfare, it would be immensely beneficial to rely on a cardinal metric that captures the overall affective experience of sentient beings over a period of interest or lifetime. We believe that the concept of Cumulative Pain (or Pleasure, for positive affective states), as adopted in the <a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/\">Welfare Footprint framework</a>, aligns closely with this ideal. It quantifies the time spent in various intensities of pain and has proven operationally useful, providing actionable insights for &nbsp;guiding cost-effective interventions aimed at reducing animal suffering.</p><p>However, it does not yet offer a unified metric of suffering, as it measures time spent in four categories of pain intensity. While we anticipate this complexity will persist for some time\u2014given the current challenges in equating pain intensities\u2014we believe the discussion on the possibility of integrating these four categories is necessary and valuable. We are thus sharing this document here to contribute in this discussion and elicit feedback and criticism to help us improve our approach. &nbsp;We apologize for the academic tone of the text, initially written with an academic paper in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h1><ul><li>The perceived unpleasantness of pain, as subjectively rated on pain intensity scales, escalates disproportionatelly with these ratings, suggesting that experiences of more severe unpleasantness feel disproportionately worse compared to their placement on a typical scale.</li><li>Determining the exact form of the relationship, however, is still challenging, as insights from human pain studies are limited and difficult to apply to animals, and designing experiments to address this issue in animals is inherently challenging.</li><li>Intensity weights are likely dynamic and modulated by multiple factors, including interspecific differences in the perception of time. The very relationship between pain aversiveness and intensity ratings may change depending on the experience\u2019s duration.</li><li>Currently, the uncertainty associated with equivalence weights among pain intensity categories is orders of magnitude greater than the uncertainty related to other attributes of pain experiences, such as their prevalence or duration.</li><li>Given these challenges, we currently favor a disaggregated approach. Disaggregated estimates can currently rank most welfare challenges and farm animal production scenarios in terms of suffering.</li><li>In the case of more complex trade-offs between brief severe pain and longer-lasting milder pain &nbsp;we suggest two approaches. First, ensuring that all consequences of the welfare challenges are taken into account. For example, the effects of long-lasting chronic pain extend beyond the immediate experience, leading to long-term consequences (e.g., pain sensitization, immune suppression, behavioral deprivation, helplessness, depression) that may themselves trigger experiences of intense pain. &nbsp;The same may happen with experiences of brief intense pain endured early in life. Second, once all secondary effects are considered, we suggest examining which weights would steer different decision paths, and determining how justifiable those weights are. This approach allows for normative flexibility, enabling stakeholders to rely on their own values and perspectives when making decisions.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Pain, both physical and psychological, is an integral aspect of life for sentient organisms. Pain serves a vital biological purpose by signaling actual or potential harm or injury, prompting individuals to avoid or mitigate the cause of pain [1]. It varies in intensity (where intensity denotes the unpleasantness or aversiveness experienced by an individual, not intensity of physical stimuli), from a mild annoyance to an excruciating agony, and duration, from fleeting moments to persistent, long-lasting conditions. This diversity in the intensity and duration of pain also serves the adaptive purpose of guiding priorities [1,2]: while an acute, sharp pain demands immediate attention, a chronic, dull ache reminds individuals of a lingering issue that, though not urgent, can also have multiple and serious consequences if not attended to.</p><p>While the function of pain as a biological alarm system is clear, its implications on overall well-being are more complex. Does a short-lived yet intense agony compromise well-being more than a prolonged but more moderate discomfort? For instance, farmed animals endure brief yet harrowing experiences, such as surgical castration without anesthesia or some slaughter practices, which are intensely painful but relatively quick. Contrast this with the more moderate, but continuous discomfort of being in an overcrowded space over several months.&nbsp;Both situations detrimentally affect welfare, but understanding which causes more distress, or if they can even be directly compared, is needed to make informed choices that prioritize welfare effectively [3].</p><p>In their quest to maximize fitness, organisms often operate on heuristic principles, prioritizing immediate or more intense threats based on simple rules of thumb, rather than a comprehensive evaluation of all potential consequences over a longer time frame [4]. This might mean, for instance, giving priority to pain of higher intensity, everything else being equal. However, in the realms of human and animal welfare, the goal is often to establish a metric that considers overall welfare over longer time frames, enabling the prioritization of actions that minimize suffering without burden shifting.</p><p>Within the Welfare Footprint framework [5], the intensity (unpleasantness) of negative affective experiences (referred to as \u2018pain\u2019 for simplicity) is categorized into four levels (Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling, and Excruciating) and welfare loss, or \u2018suffering\u2019, is expressed as total time spent in each intensity category (\u2018Cumulative Pain\u2019).&nbsp;In this way, the method adopts a pragmatic stance by expressing outcomes across pain intensities over time without conflating them into a single metric. By doing so, it acknowledges the challenges and inherent uncertainties involved in comparing different pains across their dimensions, at the same time offering actionable, evidence-based results that can be used for the pursuit of different priorities (e.g., those prioritizing the relief of the worst kinds of preventable suffering&nbsp;can focus only on estimates of time in Disabling and Excruciating pain). Still, considering that this research area holds scientific and practical value, our focus here is to &nbsp;contribute to discussion in this direction.</p><p>We start by approaching the prioritization dilemma that may arise in the presence of &nbsp;a trade-off between brief and intense suffering versus longer lasting suffering of a milder intensity. One way to investigate this question would be to explore, quantitatively, the aversiveness caused by different levels of pain intensity, and how these differences can be offset by varying durations. How long must an individual endure an annoying or hurtful discomfort for it to be equivalent to a few hours of disabling pain? Or more generally, how do intensity and duration relate? &nbsp;In other words, is it possible to convert categories of pain unpleasantness from an ordinal to a ratio scale?</p><p>Experimentally ascertaining whether severity or duration has a greater impact on the welfare of animals presents many challenges [6,7]. Although many studies have assessed pain intensity in animals and non-verbal human subjects (typically through the use of observational pain scales that score behaviors such as muscle tension, posture, head position and facial expressions), these studies are silent with respect to the trade-off between the intensity and duration of pain. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rLiCjrAv9D8chCoG5/dimensions-of-pain-workshop-summary-and-updated-conclusions\">During a workshop organized by Rethink Priorities</a> [8], experts convened to discuss potential experimental strategies for evaluating this question. Several barriers were identified, including the difficulties in ensuring external validity given the impossibility of replicating the severity and duration of animal experiences, the hidden nature of affective states [9], the fact that animal behavior and preferences will not necessarily align with their long-term welfare interests, and the lack of sensitive and specific biological markers of cumulative affect [8].</p><p>Given the complexities of studying pain in non-human animals and the common evolutionary role of pain in sentient beings, an attractive approach is to pivot towards human studies. Humans share fundamental neurological and physiological systems with other animals, and have the capacity for self-reporting, which greatly simplifies data-collection. Despite the potential for bias in self-reporting [10], understanding how humans navigate this trade-off, or at least the degree to which the most intense pains are perceived as more aversive compared to lesser ones, may provide a valuable starting point.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, we start by reviewing the extent to which empirical evidence in human studies could be potentially used in welfare prioritization when trade-offs between intensity and duration are present.</p><h2><strong>Potential Insights from Human Preferences</strong></h2><p>In the domain of human research, various efforts exist to quantify the relationship between states of well-being. This is especially pronounced in global health, where understanding the impact of different health conditions, as determined by their severity and duration, is crucial for defining resource allocation policies.</p><p>Accordingly, health metrics such as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) integrate in a single cardinal scale the time spent in a health state with the severity of the state, or its \u2018disability weight\u2019, which varies from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death) [11]. Inferences of disability weights can be conducted in different ways, from paired comparisons of preferences for hypothetical health conditions, to assessment of the time one would trade from perfect health to avoid a particular health state [12]. In all cases, however, estimates are derived from multiple dimensions of health states (e.g., mobility, level of functioning, anxiety and depression, pain, and self-care), many of which are not necessarily associated with affective experiences, but rather with cultural and social perceptions of the states evaluated that are not relevant to animals. Also, participants in these studies often judge health states they have not personally experienced, relying instead on their perception of what the experience might feel like, leading to multiple potential biases [10].</p><p>One potentially promising strategy would thus involve conducting extensive surveys where participants from diverse backgrounds, who experienced the events evaluated, make comparisons between painful (affective) experiences of varying intensities and durations. This was the approach adopted by the Qualia Research Institute in a study&nbsp;that asked participants to quantitatively compare their most extreme negative experiences relative to each other [13,14]&nbsp;. Most participants rated their most intense painful experience as at least three times more intense than the second most intense [14]. The results resembled what one would expect if the subjective experience of pain were scaled in a logarithmic manner, with large differences between intensities.&nbsp;Still, biases that cause people to recollect experiences (especially extreme ones) very differently from how they were perceived at the time were not addressed. These effects can be so large that they may wash out the real effects of the nature of experience [10,15]. A famous example of such a bias is the Peak-End rule [16], namely the consistent observation that the peak of an experience and how it ends play important roles in determining how the experience is remembered. For example, if a painful procedure is prolonged by adding a period of less intense pain, it is retrospectively evaluated as less painful, even though it entailed more overall pain [17,18].</p><p>Given these constraints, in the next section we focus on studies that directly assess pain severity perceptions from participants currently experiencing or having recently undergone specific painful conditions.</p><h2><strong>Direct Evaluation of Pain Severity: Insights from Firsthand Experiences</strong></h2><p>Upon reviewing the literature, we found that studies directly assessing pain severity perceptions from participants currently experiencing or having recently undergone specific painful conditions are surprisingly scarce. In an assessment of low back pain [19], patients were asked the number of years in each state they would exchange for resolution of their symptoms. All patients were willing to trade a disproportionately larger number of years to avoid a more severe pain state. Specifically, the perceived aversiveness of back pain increased non-linearly with severity (ratio severe to mild pain = 12:1). Another study used a similar methodology with chronic pain patients [20], estimating the disutility&nbsp;of mild, moderate and severe chronic pain as, respectively, 0.04, 0.14, and 0.26 in a paper test, and as 0.16, 0.26, and 0.27 when interviewed face to face.</p><p>The observation that disproportionately longer durations are required to compensate for increases in pain intensity once more suggests that the aversiveness of pain increases super-linearly with intensity (i.e., high-intensity pain is disproportionately more unbearable than moderate pain).&nbsp;However, in all cases the aversiveness of the chronic conditions evaluated may have been to some extent confounded with simultaneously occurring disabilities and socio-cultural ramifications of pain, unlikely to be present in non-human species. We therefore searched for studies evaluating instances of acute pain. Two studies were found.&nbsp;One examined pain intensity experienced by women during labor or recently after delivery [21]. The authors report a preference for moderate pain (level 5 out of 10) for two hours over extreme pain (10/10) for 1 hour. Additionally, a prolonged but mild pain episode (18 hours at 1/10 intensity) was favored over an intense but shorter bout of pain (2 hours at 9/10). Although the methodology does not enable establishing the numerical equivalence among pain ratings, an intensity scored as level 10 was perceived as being more than twice as bad as one scored level 5, as was a score 9 perceived as worse than 9 times as bad as a score of 1.</p><p>The second study investigated postoperative pain and cancer pain [22]. Here, the relationship among seven categories of pain (2: just noticeable, 3: weak, 4: mild, 5: moderate, 6: strong, 7: severe, 8: excruciating) was best described by a power function of the form y=0.99*x^2.99 for patients with postoperative pain and a power function of the form y=1.1*x^2.14 for patients with chronic cancer pain, where x corresponds to the pain category (1 to 8) and y the&nbsp;perception of intensity/distress. This translates into a perception of intensity for the seven categories of respectively 1, 8, 25, 62, 122, 210, 333 and 496 (postoperative pain) and 1, 5, 12, 21, 34, 51, 71 and 94 (cancer pain).</p><p>We find that the latter studies are possibly the most informative on the potential temporal equivalence among pain intensity levels. In addition to being exclusively focused on pain, they were the only studies assessing painful conditions by patients experiencing the pain. We find it unlikely that the most intense pain experienced is of an Excruciating nature as defined in the Welfare Footprint framework, since this category is by definition associated with extreme and unbearable pain, not tolerated even if for a few seconds (a definition which does not coincide with the description of the patients in the studies above). But if the most intense pain, as evaluated in these studies, corresponded to the \u2018Disabling\u2019 category, the equivalence between Annoying and Disabling pain would be best represented by a ratio of &nbsp;approximately 1 to 94-496.</p><h2><strong>Empirical Evidence and Theoretical Challenges</strong></h2><p>The observation that pain's aversiveness escalates super-linearly with intensity coincides with findings from experiments in psychophysics, a discipline that investigates the relationship between the physical intensity of stimuli and their subjective perception [23]. Research in this area indicates that as the intensity of physical stimuli increases, their perceived aversiveness grows exponentially [24]. For instance, as the intensity of an electric shock rises, perception of the pain grows at an accelerating rate, so the hardest shock can feel over 3,000 times worse than the mildest [25]. Likewise, in humans exposed to contact temperatures between 43\u00b0C and 51\u00b0C, the worst pain was judged to be 4,000 to 25,000 times more intense than the mildest pain [26-27]. The non-linear nature of pain perception is further illustrated by G\u00f3mez-Emilsson [13]&nbsp;through examples such as the Scoville scale (a scale that measures the spicy heat of chili peppers in heat units)&nbsp;and the KIP scale to&nbsp;rate cluster headaches, both assumed to be logarithmic in nature.</p><p>These findings are also aligned with evolutionary reasoning. Intense pain demands immediate cognitive prioritization, putting other functions on hold to ensure that, in the presence of potentially fatal threats, an organism's primary objective is the mitigation of the pain source. By making the experience of intense pain overwhelmingly aversive, organisms are compelled to take swift action, increasing the odds of survival. Additionally, the threat to an organism\u2019s survival is likely to increase exponentially with the severity of the harm. For example, while minor injuries are typically manageable and heal, critical thresholds can be crossed with harms of greater severity, overwhelming the body\u2019s compensatory capacities. Severe injuries can lead to blood loss, organ failure, or infections, each exponentially increasing the risk of mortality. Moreover, the energy required for recovery from severe injuries can rapidly deplete the body\u2019s reserves, reducing the ability to withstand additional threats and creating a cycle of increased susceptibility to further harm. Inflammatory and immune responses can also become detrimental with more severe harms, as excessive inflammation can damage healthy tissues and lead to a feedback loop that accelerates the impoverishment of welfare. These responses are also consistent with the observation that higher pain intensities have a disproportionately larger impact on human functioning than lower pain intensities [28,29].</p><p>Nonetheless, defining this relationship's precise nature remains fraught with uncertainty. In addition to empirical evidence being surprisingly scarce, unpleasantness weights are&nbsp;likely dynamic and modulated by multiple contextual factors. For example, whether pain is delivered in short bursts or continuously seems to play a pivotal role in determining its relative unpleasantness [30].&nbsp;In general, the perceived aversiveness of pain will be modulated by a myriad of factors that include its type, anatomical distribution, attentional states, anticipation, past experience and fear [29,31\u201333].</p><p>Other layers of complexity are also present. For example, pain itself might distort an individual's perception of time [34]. Does enduring a certain level of pain for a shorter duration feel longer than a lesser pain endured for the same period? Similarly, relative weightings between categories of pain could vary among species. The ratio of how much worse 'Excruciating' pain is compared to 'Annoying' pain may differ for an insect, a fish, a cow, or a human [35,36], particularly in the presence of species-specific differences in the subjective perception of time [34,37,38]. In fact, the very relationship between the aversiveness of pain and its intensity may itself change depending on the duration of the experience.&nbsp;With no data to understand how this happens, the extent to which extrapolating from short to long intervals is valid is unclear, speaking against the use of fixed equivalence levels among pain intensity levels.</p><p>The non-linear nature of the relationship between pain aversiveness, as measured on ordinal scales, and its corresponding aversiveness in a ratio scale, also means that even small errors in estimates of more severe pain have disproportionately larger effects in aggregated estimates of time suffering. To see this, consider the example in Table 1. Disabling pain is used as a reference, hence hypothetical equivalence factors represent the time needed in the other intensity categories that would make them as unpleasant as Disabling pain. As shown, there is a striking disparity in the contributions of different pain intensity categories to the final aggregated estimate. If Excruciating pain is assumed to be 10 to 1,000 more aversive than Disabling pain, estimates of time in Excruciating pain would account for over 90% of the aggregated estimate. Naturally, any imprecision in the estimated time in Excruciating pain would have a major impact on the aggregated results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Table 1.&nbsp;Hypothetical weighting schemes: time units in each pain intensity category needed to make the experience as unpleasant as one time unit of disabling pain</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Category</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Estimated time in pain at each intensity</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Hypothetical Equivalence with Disabling pain</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Time in Disabling- equivalent pain</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Contribution of time in each intensity to aggregate estimate (%)</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Annoying</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>10 minutes</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1/(100 to 1,000)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>0.6 to 6 sec</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>0.001 to 0.0094%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Hurtful</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>10 minutes</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1/(5 to 100)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>6 sec to 2 min</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>0.020 to 0.094%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Disabling</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>10 minutes</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>10 minutes</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>0.10 to 9.42%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Excruciating</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>10&nbsp;minutes</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>10 to 1,000</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1.6 to 166.6 h</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>90.45 to 99.88%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Aggregate Estimate: time in Disabling-Equivalent Pain</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:3.6pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1.8 to 167 hours</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These observations could also lead to the conclusion that efforts on preventing cases of intense suffering should possibly dominate most utilitarian calculations [13]. However, while the nature&nbsp;of reactions to intense pain is shaped to be overwhelming and disproportionate, prolonged suffering of more moderate intensities is not necessarily less detrimental to overall welfare. In fact, enduring moderate pain over an extended period will typically affect an individual's health and quality of life in a manner that exceeds what might be expected based on duration alone. For example, chronic pain can alter pain pathways and &nbsp;make other pain experiences more intense, both by exacerbating the pain experience and reducing the threshold for future pain [39]. Likewise, chronic pain is associated with alterations in neurochemical and hormonal levels, reducing the ability to cope with stress and making individuals more vulnerable to disease [40]. Long-lasting pain can also lead to anxiety, depression, and helplessness, and prevent, partially or completely, positive affective experiences. Finally, experienced durations of moderate pain are often many orders of magnitude longer that those associated with intense pain.</p><p>In light of the complex interplay and cumulative impacts of chronic and acute experiences on overall well-being, comprehensive assessments of welfare that encompasses the effects derived from these experiences is essential for making informed decisions between interventions aimed at alleviating short-term intense suffering versus long-term moderate suffering. For example, in deciding between investing into banning experiences such as bodily mutilations or some slaughter methods versus longer-term issues such as high stocking density or confinement, an investigation of all the consequences of these practices would be required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Potential practical approaches</strong></h2><p>Effective resource allocation and prioritization among sources of suffering requires finding ways to quantify their burden in a comparative way. In the Welfare Footprint framework, the cumulative load of negative affective experiences endured by animals are quantified using a biologically meaningful metric: time spent in pain of four intensities. This granulated view of suffering is clear and intuitive and can be traced back to evidence, aiding resource allocation and decision-making processes targeting different priorities. Currently, disaggregated estimates can also rank most welfare challenges and farm animal production scenarios in terms of suffering</p><p>Yet, challenges arise when this (or other metrics) are asked to balance the intensity and duration of suffering. Foremost among these is the uncertainty associated with equivalence factors, which are needed for converting time spent in different intensity levels to a common metric. So far, these factors are not empirically substantiated, and carry high levels of uncertainty.</p><p>Additionally, with aggregate estimates of time suffering, references to the actual experiences of animals are lost. While estimates of 10 minutes in Excruciating or Disabling pain are readily understandable by any audience, aggregate estimates of time in pain do not have an intuitive meaning. For example, it is not clear if a long time in Disabling-equivalent pain is dominated by experiences of chronic or acute suffering, or some combination thereof. Likewise, there is also an ethical puzzle regarding the validity of balancing different levels of suffering [41]. For example, aggregate estimates of time in pain in a population with individuals enduring intense pain could be similar to that of a population where no individual suffers intense pain, but a larger fraction of individuals experience milder pain for a sufficiently long time. The extent to which extreme suffering concentrated in fewer individuals can be compensated by milder suffering in a large number of individuals is unclear.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, the seemingly straightforward concept of a weighting system between pain intensities is still riddled with limitations. Until equivalences in the dimensions of pain are better understood, we favor a disaggregated approach. In its current form the Welfare Footprint framework can rank most events, scenarios and systems. Where difficult trade-offs are present, the framework can be extended further by examining which weights would steer different decision-making paths, and then determine whether such a weight is scientifically justifiable.</p><p>We illustrate&nbsp;this possibility by considering estimates of Cumulative Pain, at each intensity, for some of the most common welfare challenges commercial chickens experience over their lives, including slaughter (Table 2).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Table 2.

distressing pain that takes priority over most behaviors (drastic reduction of activity and inattention to other stimuli); <sup>(3)</sup>&nbsp;extreme level of pain that would not normally be tolerated even if only for a few seconds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The table shows that for an intervention that reduces extreme forms of suffering during slaughter (chiefly Excruciating pain) to be favored over one that averts less-intense suffering (including problems such as lameness in fast-growing broilers, chronic hunger in breeders or behavioral deprivation in caged hens), Excruciating pain would need to be perceived as being many orders of magnitude worse than Disabling or Hurtful pain. For instance, the average broiler stunned with electrical parameters set to reduce carcass damage (i.e., less effective at causing loss of consciousness, row \u2018B\u2019 in Table 2) endures about 70 seconds of Excruciating pain, while lameness causes, on average, 1,384,200 and 1,591,920 seconds of Hurtful and Disabling pain, respectively (\u2018D\u2019). To justify prioritizing improvements in electrical stunning parameters over enhancements in lameness based solely on the reduction of suffering, the aversiveness of Excruciating pain would need to be perceived as approximately 3,000 times more severe than Disabling pain, or over 14,000 times more severe when considering the Disabling and Hurtful pain together. When comparing the most severe outcomes\u2014birds that are scalded alive during slaughter ('C') against those suffering from the most severe form of lameness, with a gait score of 5 at the time of slaughter ('E')\u2014the perceived aversiveness of Excruciating pain would need to be about 13,000 times greater than that of Disabling pain to justify a focus on stunning reforms over lameness improvements. Similarly, for interventions aimed at enhancing stunning parameters ('B') to be deemed more beneficial to welfare than those targeting the mitigation of chronic hunger in fast-growing female broiler breeders ('F'), the aversiveness of Excruciating pain would need to be considered over 300,000 times worse than that of Disabling or Hurtful pain.</p><p>In determining the plausibility that Excruciating pain is several orders of magnitude more averse than pain intensities that are still very distressing (such as Disabling pain), it is also necessary to consider that estimates of the welfare impacts of the farm-level harms described, such as lameness, behavioral deprivation and chronic hunger, do not include their secondary effects. For example, in the case of chronic hunger, secondary effects emerging from feed restriction include aggression, higher incidence of feather pecking, skin lesions, foot pad lesions, disrupted resting, impaired immunity and long-term consequences for the welfare of offspring (meat chickens) through epigenetic effects [43]. In the case of lameness, by-products include a greater risk of infection, dehydration, contact dermatitis, the frustration to perform highly motivated behaviors and sleep disruption [43]. Should these effects be considered, they would require an even higher aversiveness ratio for Excruciating pain compared to Disabling and Hurtful pain.</p><p>While these observations align with the view that interventions targeting prolonged suffering may warrant prioritization absent evidence that the welfare impact of intense brief pains exceed more moderate pains by orders of magnitude [7], we suggest that in case of difficult trade-offs decisions should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering species-specific pain responses, context of decision, and full range of welfare effects associated with the intervention. For instance, while the secondary effects of intense suffering at slaughter does not have lasting secondary effects due to the immediacy of death, intense brief suffering at early life (e.g., bodily mutilations) are likely to have multiple and profound welfare consequences, such as heightened pain sensitivity and reduced stress resilience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>References cited</strong></h2><p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melzack R, Wall PD.

The fellowship organized in Mexico in 2022 demonstrated to me the benefits for people from underrepresented communities and the impact on their careers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, given the process of the recent <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aPZT66Byw8mCHNnPx/coworking-space-in-mexico-city\">coworking space proposal in Mexico</a> (not by Mexicans), my impression is that the needs of the local community are not being heard, but maybe I am not understanding which should be the most important thing to take into account, and my bias as a local is too high.</p><p>My impression is that the opinion of the locals was not taken into account, which makes me feel very uncomfortable. So, I have several questions that I believe need discussion and may help me to understand the situation better</p><p><br><strong>1. Should EA local members be involved in the decision-making process for establishing and operating what could be the only space in Mexico for contact with the international community, or could this be decided solely by foreign individuals?</strong><br><strong>2. Should the establishment of new coworking spaces take into account their positive impact on local EA communities, or is it considered too costly and \"distracting\"?</strong><br><strong>3. How important is it to consider local culture and context when choosing the most suitable space?</strong><br><strong>4. For foreigners potentially interested in working in Mexico for a few months, could a space with 20% less comfort and design change your decision?</strong></p><p>Regarding the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aPZT66Byw8mCHNnPx/coworking-space-in-mexico-city\">coworking space proposed in Mexico</a>, there have been prior discussions and many of us locals find it unsuitable for work as it is located in a gentrified neighborhood where local people face constant discrimination (This coworking space in particular has to also incidents reported).&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, it is a space with many amenities and is popular among some EAs who visit Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p>As the director of an organization in Latin America, with all staff members from Mexico and students from various parts of Latin America, I am interested in the cost of that particular space. Is it accessible for Latin American organizations, or are the prices prohibitive to our budget and priorities, thereby preventing us from working in a space alongside other organizations and EA-aligned individuals? Given the current public prices for the proposed coworking, I would have to allocate at least twice as many resources as I currently do and cut the budget from another area.</p><p>Furthermore, from the perspective of external optics, I am unsure if I would be comfortable with my organization being located in that workspace, as it could affect our collaborations with public entities like UNAM (the most important university in Mexico and the second in Latin America) and potentially invite negative criticism like those recently seen at EAGx LATAM and in some Spanish-language media outlets.</p><p>I understand that the AI Fellowship is not targeted at people from Mexico and uses this space to prioritize the needs of its program. However, proposing it as the coworking space in Mexico raises the questions mentioned above, and<strong> I would appreciate a broader community perspective to make the best decisions</strong>. I believe that there are other good options that allow us locals to be included.</p>", "user": {"username": "Sandra Malagon"}}, {"_id": "FFpSstnhNWFmxKoEZ", "title": "Big Picture AI Safety: teaser", "postedAt": "2024-02-20T13:09:27.270Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I have been busy interviewing AI safety experts about their \"big picture\" of the existential AI risk landscape: what's going to happen with AI, how might things go wrong, what should the AI safety community be doing, and how does their work fit in with that.</p><p>In the end I will have responses from around 20 experts, from DeepMind, Anthropic, Redwood, FAR AI, and others.</p><p>Some examples of questions I asked were:</p><ul><li>what will the first human-level AI look like?</li><li>how could AI bring about an existential catastrophe?</li><li>what are the most promising research directions in AI safety?</li><li>what are the biggest mistakes the AI safety community has made?</li></ul><p>The results will be published in the form of a post or sequence summarizing the results, probably transcripts of the conversations, and maybe audio recordings (would people be interested in transcripts and/or recordings?)</p><p>Pre-register your predictions of the most common responses to these questions <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/euanmclean/according-to-19-ai-safety-experts-w-d5502228b55a\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/euanmclean/according-to-19-ai-safety-experts-w-524bc5e87b85\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/euanmclean/according-to-19-ai-safety-experts-w\">here</a>!</p><p>This work was funded by <a href=\"https://far.ai/\">FAR AI</a>.</p>", "user": {"username": "EuanMcLean"}}, {"_id": "QmGrLryaamTbqmDks", "title": "How to prepare for a world of GPT-5 and beyond?", "postedAt": "2024-02-21T07:15:33.568Z", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7FC8DpGr9jKYBDtG8/what-skills-careers-and-experiences-should-young-eas-pursue\">This </a>post talks about which skills to develop, but what investment and lifestyle chooices can you make to prepare for a world where basically the vast majority of current human labour is automated?

My approach is deeply flawed as it fails to account for many variables, but allowed me to make a reasonable estimate in about 15 minutes.

I didn\u2019t attempt a cost-effectiveness range as it would take longer.&nbsp;</p><p>But where to find these sick people who might be cost-effectively helped? We planned to identify poor rural farmers who had life-threatening treatable illnesses, who were unlikely to be treated unless we paid for it. So I asked a couple of our OneDay Health managers to be on the lookout for sick people who presented to our &nbsp;Health Centers, while I also kept an eye out in the health center where I work as a doctor - <i>people who could die without treatment that they couldn\u2019t afford.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Finding people to \"cost-effectively\" help turned out to be harder than expected. Over a 2 month period we identified three young girls to help, while we decided not to help in another 5 or so cases. These are the stories people we tried to help\u2013 feel free to skip the BOTEC sections if you aren\u2019t into that!</p><h3><br><strong>Lamunu \u2013 age 9</strong></h3><p>Even for a hardened doctor, Lamunu\u2019s photo was tough to look at. She showed up in our Health center with about 30% of her body burned after falling into a fire. She had spent 10 days in an ill-equipped government hospital and she continued deteriorate. Her father ran out of money and took her home, before arriving one of our health centers (which can't treat burns) as perhaps desperate last-ditch effort. Her burns were infected, she was malnourished and everybody involved knew that she probably wasn\u2019t long for this world.</p><p>I happen to live 500 meters away from the best burns unit in Northern Uganda at St. Mary\u2019s hospital Lacor so I thought we might be able to help. We paid for her with herfather to take a 5 hour bus ride to Lacor hospital, and supported the family with hospital fees and some food.<br><br><strong>Cost effectiveness BOTEC?</strong><br><br><strong>Chance of help without us?</strong><br>10%. \u2013 I couldn\u2019t really conceive how this would have happened, given my specific connection to the burns unit and the poor village she came from</p><p><strong>Long term quality of life compared to the average person if survives?</strong><br>70% - This is very hard to judge, but with the disfiguration and scarring, she would have a hard time socially and she would have moderate physical disability&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chance of survival without help?</strong><br>10% - Probably conservative, its hard to imagine a scenario where she survived at home, given how quickly she was deteriorating</p><p><strong>Chance of survival with help?</strong><br>25% - Although the situation looked dire, she had already survived a couple of weeks and the condition was treatable. She would need nutritional support, fantastic wound care and skin grafts. In a high-income country hospital with all the resources in the world, I would predict her chance of survival at over 70%. In retrospect her chances were probably better than 25% - the Lacor hospital care was even better than I expected.<br><br><strong>Cost of treatment</strong><br><strong>$600 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Of this we paid only 300 dollars (transport from Soroti, hospital bill, some food). The other half is the estimated cost of her treatment bourne by the wonderful Lacor Hospital which looked after her. This hospital is over 50% donor funded, so this 300 dollars reflects their contribution.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref78gbcz164me\"><sup><a href=\"#fn78gbcz164me\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>The calculation...</strong><br><br><strong>$600</strong><br><strong>____________</strong><br><strong>0.9 x 0.7 x (0.25-0.10) &nbsp;=</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>$6349 estimated to save a life&nbsp;</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvpwqujg3h3s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvpwqujg3h3s\">[3]</a></sup></span><br><br><strong>The result</strong><br>Over the first couple of weeks she recovered surprisingly well, while still remaining very sick.

After she stabilized, she was booked for a skin graft surgery which could solve her underlying problem. On the day of surgery she was wheeled into the operating theatre where they discovered she had high fever and so delayed the surgery until her infection cleared.</p><p>The infection never cleared, and she tragically died two days later. <i><strong>Hearing about her death hurt badly \u2013 as it should.

Her mother struggled to breastfeed her (surprisingly rare here in Uganda) and she had been feeding her a mixture of what little mil her mother managed, plus cows milk to supplement. This didn\u2019t help at all. Sunday had severe malnutrition, the worst I have seen with a nasty chest infection to boot. Her mother knew she was in a bad state, but didn\u2019t comprehend just how sick she was. Fortunately there was an NGO malnutrition treatment center in nearby Soroti town, which had a good reputation. The mother was so poor that she didn\u2019t even have the money to transport the kid to the center. To my surprise though the malnutrition center was completely free, and recommended they keep the kid for a minimum of 6 weeks until she improved.</p><p><br><strong>Cost-Effectiveness BOTEC</strong></p><p><strong>Chance of getting help without us</strong><br>50% - This is a hard one, as if her mother had realized that she could just go into Soroti town and drop the kid off at the treatment center, she might have managed to raise the transport money eventually, but it seems very unlikely given she hadn\u2019t already for many months.</p><p><strong>Survival chance without treatment</strong><br>60% - In good treatment centers here, severe malnutrition mortality rates are 10-20%, but I doubled this worst case as she was at home, not In a malnutrition center. In retrospect given how dire the situation was, this seems too conservative and maybe 40-50% would have been a better estimate</p><p><strong>Survival chance after treatment</strong><br>80%. - As this was one of the worst cases of malnutrition I\u2019ve seen, I put this probability at the worse end of mortality in malnutrition centers</p><p><strong>Quality of life after successful treatment</strong><br>75% of normal - Although she likely will have some form of developmental delay, most kids with severe malnutrition do surprisingly well long term after successful treatment</p><p><strong>Cost</strong><br>Only $300. Of this we contributed $100 to the mother for transport to and from the malnutrition facility a few times and, then made a $100 donation to the treatment center. I\u2019ve estimated the cost of treatment at the center at around $200 in total<br><br><strong>The Calculation...</strong><br><br><strong>$300</strong><br><strong>_____________</strong></p><p><strong>0.5 x (0.8-0.6) x 0.75 = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimated $4000&nbsp;to save a life</strong></p><p><strong>The result</strong><br>The treatment center did an amazing job and to cut a long story short she gained weight, got healthier and went home. A few months later she is still growing well and thriving, a great result. Given that malnutrition treatment is already a GiveWell target, this likely being the most cost-effective intervention shouldn\u2019t be a surprise.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Angel \u2013 Age 7</strong></h3><p>Angel didn\u2019t tick the boxes the same way the first two girls did. From minute one she pulled on my heart strings from the moment she walked into my consultation office and if I\u2019m honest I would probably have helped her regardless, cost effectiveness be damned. A bright eyed seven year old girl, born with a 99.99% perfect body. But the tiny defect was a disaster, a mere 5 millimeter membrane which was enough to block her aortic valve in her heart.</p><p>Enough to make her heart not work properly<br>Enough to stunt her growth so she was only 15kg at age 7<br>Enough to ruin a full and fulfilling life</p><p>Five years ago in Uganda there was no heart surgery available, so the rich politicians and business people would fly their kids to India to get operations while everyone else had no option.<br><br>I was struck by the injustice of it all \u2013 in my birth country of New Zealand the operation would have been done 5 years ago. And enraged by the absurdity of the situation \u2013 a physical membrane of just a few millimeters standing between a girl and her happy and fulfilling life. At first the Mulago heart institute quoted $4,500 US dollars for the operation, before we bargained them down to $2800 on the basis of Angel\u2019s extreme poverty. <i>This is as close as I\u2019ve ever come to literally bargaining for someone\u2019s life.&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>My (probably biased) BOTEC</strong></p><p><strong>Chance of getting operation without us</strong><br>10% (probably optimistic)</p><p><strong>Probability of survival within 10 years without operation</strong><br>10% - Her heart failure is worsening, and I\u2019m worried about a timeline of months rather than years.</p><p><strong>Chance of operation success and a normal-ish life expectancy afterwards</strong><br>60% - About 2<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6716322/#:~:text=Despite%20successful%20resection%20of%20subaortic,4%2F27)%20requiring%20reoperation.\">0% of aortic membranes recur after surgery</a> in high income countries, which I arbitrarily increased to 40% given likely poorer outcomes in this case She doesn\u2019t however have many features which increase risk or recurrence.

Even discussing my experience feels off, given the immense suffering of all the sick kids and their families. Despite the obvious emotional roller coaster, the process was probably net-\u201cfuzzy\u201d-positive overall while coupled with enormous discomfort. What right do I have to make these kind of decisions? Why did I do 100x better than these wonderful people in the lottery of life? <i>Also the reality of valuing of one real, hurting, living, desperate. beautiful, hurting, precious, human at only $5500 seemed not just morally wrong but almost abhorrent. </i>I don\u2019t think many would disagree with me that a human life should be <i>or even \u201cis\u201d objectively</i> worth far, far more. Its also &nbsp;easier to be two or three steps removed from a donation. And also easier to switch our donations from World Vision to mosquito nets, than to deny someone you talked to potentially life saving treatment just because the theoretical cost is $10,000 not $5500.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Complexity, problems and downsides</strong></p><ul><li>I didn\u2019t account for the value of my time or emotional energy into any of these calculations. Although gained energy and a sharpened sense of purpose through this experiment, if I\u2019m honest there was probably a small net drain on my overall time and energy&nbsp;</li><li>Risk of \u201cSavior Complex\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqem8vz2zw6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqem8vz2zw6\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;formation, where I feel proud or superior to others because of these \u201cgood works\u201d. Its interesting that this dangerous mind-state may well be more likely to form helping individuals in a less cost-effective way than it would giving money to highly effective charities<br><br>Alternatively there's the chance of negative external perception where I\u2019m accused of being a lone-ranger White Savior. For deciding from my privileged and literally white Ivory tower who might live and die, without consulting local people on what they think about this whole initiative. I\u2019m aware there is a pretty reasonable \u201cPlaying God\u201d critique here with a couple of people making important decisions about who to help based on deeply flawed and loosely calculated BOTECs\u2026</li><li>Feeling Guilty and Overwhelmed at times \u2013 almost the opposite of the Savior Complex. Guilt from denying people help that didn\u2019t meet our bar, and a litle overwhelmed by the pressure and responsibility.</li><li>Bad decision making ,due to bias from personal connections \u2013 see Angel\u2026 Its almost impossible to stay objective when dealing with real people in real time and sometimes in person.</li><li>I was surprised how few cases emerged that seemed likely to be super cost-effective. This made this trial take a bit longer than I had hoped and made me less positive about similar projects being viable in the long term.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>A Charity which cost-effectively helps individual sick people?</strong></h3><p>As well as our intention to make our own close-to-home donations more cost-effective, I had a vague idea that helping individuals sick people cost-effectively could become an effective charity. Perhaps it could be a bit like Kiva loans for effective altruists, where those who donated would know who they donated to and even the potential cost-effectiveness of each individual donation. There are many charities which pay directly for cost-effective medical care, for example fistula treatment or cataract surgery, but they are systematic entities which only treat one condition. This approach could pick up on any condition that might be cost-effective to treat, which in theory could increase the pool of people able to be helped.<br><br>After trying this on a small scale though, I\u2019m less enthusiastic. First finding cases where the life-saving cost might meet the GiveWell bar was harder than I expected. This shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise given that most charities which meet the GiveWell bar focus on prevention, which is usually more cost-effective than cure. Because identifying suitable people is tricky, the admin costs of a large scale charity might be so high as to make the work not cost-effective. Also there is a high risk of a charity along these lines being accused of \u201cPlaying God\u201d and of \u201cWhite Saviorism\u201d given that we would deny most sick kids potentially life-saving treatment. I think this criticisms doesn\u2019t hold much weight as we \u201cPlay God\u201d in a similar way every time we choose a coffee over a mosquito net, but the negative perception risk remains.</p><p>On the other hand, this was a tiny side project over a couple months in one location and as a tiny trial there's no optimisation of any aspect. There might still be a way to run a cost-effective charity which helps individuals with life-saving care.&nbsp;</p><p>There\u2019s no avoiding the strange juxtaposition between helping people we\u2019re connected to, and funding/operating cost-effective organisations. The $3100 we're using to help Angel might save an estimated 0.5 lives, while for the same amount we could treat over 1800 patients at a OneDay Health center and save perhaps a couple of lives. So on one level funding Angel\u2019s heart operation might not make logical sense, but on another level it connects us with our community, helps us love and mourn better and reminds us of the messy injustices in this strange world we're a part of. I hope I'm a better person after this wee endeavour.<br><br>We\u2019ll probably keep doing some more cost-effective life-saving giving on a slower, less intentional rolling basis. It might just be MoreGood than not doing it all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0n9ei5316o1\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0n9ei5316o1\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>There are decent arguments for a higher or lower bar, and I\u2019m keen to hear suggestions.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn78gbcz164me\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref78gbcz164me\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>You could argue against including all of this cost bourne by the hospital, but I decided to keep the calculation pretty conservative</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnvpwqujg3h3s\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefvpwqujg3h3s\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>At the time, I calculated this lower at around $4000 and just corrected it now after I realised my mistake, so it seemed more clearly cost-effectiv at the time.

Prior to that, I worked on forecasts of existential risk and the long-term future at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org\"><u>Global Priorities Institute</u></a>. Javier recently joined the forecasting team in a full-time capacity from Luke Muehlhauser\u2019s AI governance team, which was previously responsible for our forecasting grantmaking.&nbsp;</p><p>While we are just now launching a dedicated cause area, Open Phil has long endorsed forecasting as an important way of improving the epistemic foundations of our decisions and the decisions of others.

Supported by other Open Phil researchers, we plan to continue exploring&nbsp;the most plausible theories of change for forecasting.

In this post, I lay out the details of my proposed punitive damages calculation, and suggest opportunities for technical AI safety researchers to lay the groundwork for implementing this proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of my proposed punitive damages framework is for the creators and deployers of AI systems to expect to pay out damages roughly equal to the amount of harm they expect to cause. Since the law cannot hold them liable in cases where uninsurable risks are realized, this is accomplished by applying punitive damages in cases of practically compensable harms that are correlated with those uninsurable risks. That is, punitive damages would be applied in the sort of cases where, if the companies involved expected to pay out large damages awards for causing practically compensable harms, the efforts that they would tend to engage in to reduce the likelihood or severity of those harms would, by default, tend to mitigate the uninsurable risks.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, consider an AI system tasked with running a clinical trial for a risky new drug. It has trouble recruiting participants honestly and, instead of reporting this to its human overseers, resorts to some combination of deception and coercion to get people to participate. Some of those deceived/coerced patients suffer some nasty health effects and they sue. This seems like a clear case of misalignment, and, in some sense, we got lucky that the system was willing to reveal its misalignment in a non-catastrophic way. Maybe it had narrow goals, or short time horizons, or limited situational awareness. But the people who trained and deployed it couldn\u2019t have been confident ex ante that it would go down this way. Presumably, they thought the system was aligned or they wouldn\u2019t have deployed it.</p><p>Say that training and deploying the system generated a 1 in 1 million chance of human extinction. Under my proposed framework, the defendant would have to pay out punitive damages equal to 1 millionth of the value of human extinction, across the cases of practically compensable harms correlated with that extinction risk. More generally, the share of punitive damages awarded to a plaintiff in any particular case S, would be given by the following formula:&nbsp;</p><h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S = N * C<sub>P</sub>/C<sub>T</sub>*<sub>&nbsp; </sub>E<sub>P</sub>/E<sub>A</sub></h1><p>N is the total expected practically non-compensable harm arising from the defendant\u2019s conduct, represented by the blue-shaded area in the graph below. C<sub>P&nbsp;</sub>&nbsp;is the plaintiff\u2019s compensatory damages; the harm actually suffered by the plaintiff due to the defendant\u2019s actions. Dividing this by C<sub>T</sub>, the total expected practically compensable harm caused by the defendant\u2019s actions (the area shaded in red below), gives the plaintiff's share of expected compensatory damages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yWKaBdBygecE42hFZ/ovmpf9gmcwwaiwlanxhd\"></p><p>E<sub>P&nbsp;</sub>is the elasticity of uninsurable risk with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s injury. If precautionary measures that cut the plaintiff\u2019s expected harm in half also cut the uninsurable risk in half, then the elasticity is equal to 1. If they only reduce the uninsurable risk by 10%, then the elasticity of 0.2. E<sub>A&nbsp;</sub>is the average elasticity of the uninsurable risk with respect to all practically compensable harms. So, E<sub>P</sub>/E<sub>A&nbsp;</sub>is the relative elasticity of uninsurable risk with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s injury. So, the plaintiff\u2019s share of punitive damage is equal to the total expected practically non-compensable harm, N, times the plaintiff\u2019s share of expected compensatory damages C<sub>P</sub>/C<sub>T</sub>, times the relative elasticity of the uninsurable risk with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p><p>If juries are able to approximately implement this formula, then reductions in the practically compensable harm, C<sub>T</sub>, would only be rewarded to the extent that they reduce the total expected harm N + C<sub>T</sub>. Measures that reduce C<sub>T&nbsp;</sub>without reducing N would lower the defendant\u2019s expected compensatory damages, but would not reduce their expected punitive damages payout unless they are able to eliminate any practically compensable damages. By contrast, measures that reduce N would be rewarded even if they do not reduce C<sub>T</sub>.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, in order to implement this formula, we will need credible estimates of the various parameters. Juries routinely estimate plaintiff\u2019s compensatory damages in tort cases, so that doesn\u2019t present any novel issues, and estimating the total expected compensatory damages should also not be too difficult. Presumably, once a system has revealed its misalignment in a non-catastrophic way, it will be pulled off the market, and the risks associated with any modified version of the model would be addressed separately. So this is really just a matter of estimating how much legally compensable harm the system has actually done.&nbsp;</p><p>Estimating the total expected practically non-compensable harm, N, and the elasticity parameters, E<sub>P</sub> and E<sub>A</sub>, presents greater challenges. In the paper, I suggest that model evaluations could be used to appraise specific potential causal pathways that could produce an uninsurable catastrophe.</p><p>\u201cFor each pathway, one set of evaluations could estimate the probability that the system is capable of instantiating that pathway. Another set of evaluations could estimate the conditional probability that the system would take that pathway, should it be capable of doing so. The sum of the expected harm across these catastrophic misalignment and misuse scenarios would then represent a lower bound estimate of N, the uninsurable risks generated by training and deploying the system, since other scenarios not included in the evaluation might contribute to the total uninsurable risk. Beyond specific scenario analysis, other relevant indicators of uninsurable risk include the model\u2019s power-seeking tendencies, inclinations to engage in deception and tool use, pursuit of long-term goals, resistance to being shut down, tendency to collude with other advanced AI systems, breadth of capabilities, capacity for self-modification, and degree of alignment.</p><p>The knowledge that a practically compensable harm has happened could help model evaluators like those at Model Evaluation &amp; Threat Research (formerly part of the Alignment Research Center) and Apollo Research select catastrophic risk pathways to analyze, but their estimates of the probability of those pathways should not update based on the knowledge that the practically compensable harm event happened, since that knowledge was not available at the time the decisions to train and deploy the model were made. The fact that a practically compensable harm has occurred simultaneously raises the probability that the system was significantly misaligned or vulnerable to misuse and lowers the probability that catastrophic harm will arise from this specific system since it is now likely to be recalled and retrained. N is the expected uninsurable harm at the time that the key tortious act (training or deployment) occurred. That is, N represents what a reasonable person, with access to the information that the defendant had or reasonably should have had at the time of the tortious conduct, would have estimated to be the expected uninsurable harm arising from their conduct. There may not be one uniquely correct value of this uninsurable risk, but juries, relying on expert testimony, should nonetheless be able to select an estimate within the range of estimates that a reasonable person should have arrived at.\u201d</p><p>More work is needed to implement these suggestions, and I invite members of this community to take it up.

As printed books filled libraries and bookshops it was cheaper to do the background research required to write a new book. Decreasing the required upfront investment unambiguously decreases the optimal strength of copyright, all else equal. This upfront investment is what copyright is made to reimburse so if it decreases, copyright shouldn\u2019t reimburse as much.</p><p>In the early years of the press, before printed books had filled all the libraries, the printing press mainly changed the <i>marginal</i> cost of spreading information. The upfront research and drafting that went into a book was unchanged; notes and first drafts were still handwritten. But the marginal cost of producing an extra copy once the draft was done fell by a few orders of magnitude.</p><p>This marginal cost decrease shifts the supply curve for books outwards, lowering prices and raising the quantity demanded. This higher quantity of books lets original authors compete more closely with copying competitors because the upfront fixed costs of research can be spread out over more books, decreasing the price difference between original and knockoff copies.</p><p>For example, imagine a market for books where author-published copies and knockoffs are imperfect substitutes, so they split the market. Under the pre-press production function and demand, only 100 books are produced. Say 10 come from the author and the other 90 come from copiers. If the author wants to recover their upfront investment, they have to price their books higher than the marginal cost of production by one tenth of their fixed cost. Depending on the elasticity of demand for author-published copies, this price hike might not leave them with any customers.</p><p>After the press, books are far cheaper to produce so the equilibrium quantity rises to 10,000. If the market shares of author-published copies and knockoffs stay the same, the author will sell 1,000 copies. Recovering their investment now only requires adding one thousandth of their fixed cost to the price of each book, a much more competitive price compared to the copied version. With smaller price differences, the little advantages that author versions have, e.g authenticity, warm-glow from contributing to public goods, or first-mover advantage, can more easily justify the author\u2019s higher prices.</p><p>So decreases in the fixed and marginal costs of producing information seem to lower the optimal strength of copyright: The upfront investment is cheaper and authors don't need as much help competing with copiers when the market size is big.</p><p>But the printing press didn't just change costs, it also made author copies and knockoffs better substitutes. Knockoffs could be made faster so the first mover advantage of authors wasn\u2019t as valuable and the printing press decreased transcription errors so copies were more reliable. When two goods become closer substitutes, changes in the price of one have larger effects on the quantity demanded of the other. In this case, both goods are decreasing in price at the same time and the net effect depends on the relative size of price changes and the elasticities of demand for author originals vs knockoffs.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4bc154-86d2-4345-a19b-725286437777_1436x953.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z766eMZavaTuCqGqL/gyhw6kyaa9evyottwqck\" alt=\"undefined\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z766eMZavaTuCqGqL/jrt0t8xmaepqfo3hhv1w 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z766eMZavaTuCqGqL/ktalv27rw9mcgspnpawu 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z766eMZavaTuCqGqL/nx0q5nwaixicwtmddhez 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z766eMZavaTuCqGqL/gyhw6kyaa9evyottwqck 1456w\"></a></p><p>Empirically, this seemed to balance out in favor of authors and massively increased their production of books. Despite the initial lack of copyright protection (<a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/no-copyright-law-the-real-reason-for-germany-s-industrial-expansion-a-710976.html\"><u>or perhaps because of it</u></a>), the printing press made it easier than ever to make a living writing and selling books without the subsidy of an appointment at a university or monastery.</p><h3>Copyright before and after the internet</h3><p>Most of the major information technology innovations after the printing press follow the same pattern of massively decreasing the marginal and fixed costs required to produce information but also making author published originals and copies closer substitutes.</p><p>This pattern reaches its zenith in text on the internet. It\u2019s never been cheaper to research, write, and publish something that millions of people can read. But it\u2019s also never been cheaper to copy text with perfect fidelity and post it somewhere else. So should text on the internet have longer or shorter copyright than text in books in the 16th century?</p><p>I'm honestly not sure, but I suspect modern copyright is far too long for two reasons.</p><p>1.) Empirically, the of exploding rates of content production we saw with the printing press has held with all following information technologies as well, even in areas with weak copyright. It seems that lots of people (including me) are willing to put hours of effort into content that they post on the internet for free. Billions of hours of high effort and quality content are available for free on Youtube. The generosity and <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\"><u>patronage</u></a> of a few <a href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/\"><u>thousand true fans</u></a> is often enough to subsidize the fixed costs of creation for the rest of us.</p><p>2.) Our current copyright regime is based on <a href=\"https://fee.org/articles/concentrated-benefits-and-diffused-costs-explain-the-persistence-of-tariffs/\"><u>concentrated-benefits-diffuse-costs</u></a> attacks from special interests rather than anything like this optimal tradeoff so it seems unlikely that we\u2019ve got it right, and the bias is towards overly strong copyright.</p><p>More of our economy is information goods than ever and this is only accelerating. Generative AI will continue this centuries long trend. The upfront cost of creating a beautiful video or piece of music will fall further along with the marginal cost of spreading it, while the substitutability of copies will increase. Better understanding the effects of this type of technological change is important and growing more so by the day.</p><p>See also, <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/maximumprogress/p/when-should-copyright-get-shorter?r=awlwu&amp;utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;comments=true&amp;commentId=49573652\">Gwern's useful comments on this post</a></p>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm", "title": "Solution to the two envelopes problem for moral weights", "postedAt": "2024-02-19T00:15:53.003Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Summary</h1><p>When taking expected values, the results can differ radically based on which common units we fix across possibilities.

Uncertainty about animal moral weights is about the nature of our experiences and to what extent other animals have capacities similar to those that ground our value, and so empirical uncertainty, not moral uncertainty (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/solution-to-the-two-envelopes-problem-for-moral-weights#Welfare_in_human_relative_terms\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>I revise the account in light of the possibility of multiple different human reference points between which we don\u2019t have fixed uncertainty-free comparisons of value, like pleasure vs belief-like preferences (cognitive desires) vs non-welfare moral reasons, or specific instances of these.

This lasted until around December 2023, and some arguments here were originally going to be part of a piece <i>strongly against</i>&nbsp;such comparisons for cross-species moral weights, which I now respond to here along with positive arguments for comparisons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>I credit Derek Shiller and Adam Shriver for the idea of treating the problem like epistemic uncertainty relative to what we experience directly.

It\u2019s not entirely clear how to create a single \u201ccommon metric\u201d for adjudicating between two views. Consider:</p><ul><li>Comparison method A: say that \u201ca human life improved\u201d is the main metric valued by the human-centric worldview, and that \u201ca chicken life improved\u201d is worth &gt;1% of these (animal-inclusive view) or 0 of these (human-centric view). In this case, a &gt;10% probability on the animal-inclusive view would lead chickens to be valued &gt;0.1% as much as humans, which would likely imply a great deal of resources devoted to animal welfare relative to near-term human-focused causes.</li><li>Comparison method B: say that \u201ca chicken life improved\u201d is the main metric valued by the animal-inclusive worldview, and that \u201ca human life improved\u201d is worth &lt;100 of these (animal-inclusive view) or an astronomical number of these (human-centric view). In this case, a &gt;10% probability on the human-[centric] view would be effectively similar to a 100% probability on the human-centric view.</li></ul><p>These methods have essentially opposite practical implications. Method A is the more intuitive one for me (it implies that the animal-inclusive view sees \u201cmore total value at stake in the world as a whole,\u201d and this implication seems correct), but the lack of a clear principle for choosing between the two should give one pause, and there\u2019s no obviously appropriate way to handle this sort of uncertainty. One could argue that the two views are \u201cphilosophically incommensurable\u201d in the sense of dealing with fundamentally different units of value, with no way to identify an equivalence-based conversion factor between the two.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk6ajqmreh7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk6ajqmreh7\">[1]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>For example, if one thinks there\u2019s a 50% chance that one should be weighing the interests of chickens 1% as much as those of humans, and a 50% chance that one should not weigh them at all, one might treat this situation as though chickens have an \u201cexpected moral weight\u201d of 0.5% (50% * 1% + 50% * 0) relative to humans. This would imply that (all else equal) a grant that helps 300,000 chickens is better than a grant that helps 1,000 humans, while a grant that helps 100,000 chickens is worse.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/wzfxqm3zdpxercfmf4la\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/yygjyiioprfrrwgbyhx5 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/qolntlkkmtsfoa9np91g 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/zl3fuigwwbepfwp1iavw 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/nzdjjnjoxbgezjfpnbtl 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/np9y2on1cqjlqcyv1ush 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/okgftnti0ovsd25knett 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/gnbvu0nruta6mzlrlb5j 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/a8yn5wax6xv8xcd4nnb6 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/id69cde9dzsmovtb1wtt 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/L4Cv8hvuun6vNL8rm/mbuholktki0eudizalaq 995w\"><figcaption>Credit: DALL\u00b7E</figcaption></figure><p>We can define random variables to capture these statements more precisely via a formalization with expected values.

There is, however, still moral uncertainty in deciding between hedonism, desire theories, preference views and objective list theories, and between variants of each, among other things.</p><p>Despite later warning about two-envelopes effects in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2jTQTxYNwo6zb3Kyp/preliminary-thoughts-on-moral-weight\"><u>Muehlhauser, 2018</u></a>, one of Muehlhauser (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/2017-report-on-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood/#id-664-illusionism-and-moral-patienthood\"><u>2017</u></a>)\u2019s illustration of how he understands moral patienthood is based on his own direct experience of pain:</p><blockquote><p>What are the implications of illusionism for my intuitions about moral patienthood? In one sense, there might not be any.<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood%23footnote360_ysw75lx\"><sup><u>360</u></sup></a>&nbsp;After all, my intuitions about (e.g.) the badness of conscious pain and the goodness of conscious pleasure were never dependent on the \u201creality\u201d of specific features of consciousness that the illusionist thinks are illusory. Rather, my moral intuitions work more like the example I gave <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/2017-report-on-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood/#consciousnessdefined\"><u>earlier</u></a>: I sprain my ankle while playing soccer, don\u2019t notice it for 5 seconds, and then feel a \u201crush of pain\u201d suddenly \u201cflood\u201d my conscious experience, and I think \u201cGosh, well, whatever this is, I sure hope nothing like it happens to fish!\u201d And then I reflect on what was happening prior to my conscious experience of the pain, and I think \u201cBut if that is all that happens when a fish is physically injured, then I\u2019m not sure I care.\u201d And so on.</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s the still poorly understood \u201cwhatever this is\u201d, i.e. his direct experience, and things \u201clike it\u201d that are of fundamental moral importance and for which he\u2019s looking in other animals. Conscious pain <i>according to specific theories</i>&nbsp;are just designed to track \u201cwhatever this is\u201d and things \u201clike it\u201d, but almost all theories will be wrong. The example also seems best interpretable as an illustration of comparison method A, weighing fish pain relative to his experience of pain spraining an ankle.</p><p>The relevant moral reasons are or derive directly from these direct experiences or appearances, and the question is just when, where (what animals and other physical systems) and to what extent <i>these same (kinds of) appearances and resulting reasons</i>&nbsp;apply. <i>Whatever this is</i>&nbsp;that we\u2019re doing, to what extent do others do it or something like it, too? All of our views and theories of the value of welfare should already be or should be made human-relative, because the direct moral reasons we have to apply all come from our own individual experiences and modest extensions, e.g. assuming our experiences are similar to other humans\u2019. As we find out more about other animals and the nature of human welfare, our judgements&nbsp;about where other animals stand in relation to our concept and direct impressions of human welfare \u2014 the defining cases \u2014 can change.</p><p>So I claim that we have direct access to the grounds for the disvalue of <i>human</i>&nbsp;suffering and <i>human</i>&nbsp;moral value, i.e. the variable&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"H\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.057em;\">H</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;in the previous section, and we understand the suffering and moral value of other beings, including the (dis)value in chickens as&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"C\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.045em;\">C</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;above, relative to humans.

They may totally lack the grounds to which we assign moral value, e.g. they may not be capable of suffering at all, even though I take it to be quite likely that they can suffer, or moral status could depend on more than suffering. Then, we aren\u2019t even fixing the moral weight of a chicken at all, if it can be 0 with nonzero probability and nonzero with nonzero probability. And because of the possible division by 0 moral weight, the expected moral weights of humans and all other animals will be infinite or undefined.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx8zzy1zzung\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx8zzy1zzung\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It seems such a view wouldn\u2019t be useful for guiding action.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7mdd9uxn8w6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7mdd9uxn8w6\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><p>Similarly, we wouldn\u2019t normalize by the moral weights of any other animals, artificial systems, plants or rocks.</p><p>We have <i>the most direct access</i>&nbsp;to (some) <i>human</i>&nbsp;moral reasons, can most reliably understand (some of) them and so typically theorize morally relative to (some of) them. How we handle uncertainty should reflect these facts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Finding common ground</h2><p>How intense or important suffering is could be quantified differently across theories, both empirical theories and moral theories. In some cases, there will be foundational metaphysical claims inherent to those theories that could ground comparisons between the theories. In many or even most important cases, there won\u2019t be.</p><p>What common metaphysical facts could ground intertheoretic comparisons of value or reasons across theories of consciousness as different as Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory and Attention Schema Theory? Under their standard intended interpretations, they have radically different and <i>mutually</i>&nbsp;exclusive metaphysical foundations \u2014 or basic building blocks \u2014, and each of these foundations is false, except possibly one. Similarly, there are very different and mutually exclusive proposals to quantify the empirical intensity of welfare and moral weights, like counting just-noticeable differences, functions of the number of relevant (firing) neurons or cognitive sophistication, direct subjective <i>intrapersonal</i>&nbsp;weighing, among others (e.g. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/welfare-range-estimates\"><u>Fischer, 2023</u></a>&nbsp;with model descriptions in the tabs of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i_I23qXtuGtpk4spFi2NmK6ReCiFXL6QGBd2KfGzulY/edit\"><u>this sheet</u></a>). How do the numbers of relevant neurons relate to the number of just-noticeable differences across <i>all possible</i>&nbsp;minds, not just humans? There\u2019s nothing clearly <i>inherent</i>&nbsp;to these accounts that would ground intertheoretic comparisons between them, at least given our current understanding. But we can look outside the contents of the theories themselves to <i>the common facts they\u2019re designed to explain</i>.</p><p>When ice seemed like it could have turned out to be something other than the solid phase of water, we would be comparing the options based on <i>the common facts</i>&nbsp;\u2014 the evidence or data \u2014 the different possibilities were <i>supposed</i>&nbsp;to explain. And then by finding out that ice is water, you learn that there is much more water in the world, because you would then also have to count all the ice on top of all the liquid water.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref33lzaxwn2yj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn33lzaxwn2yj\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If your moral theory took water to be intrinsically good and more of it to be better, this would be good news (all else equal).</p><p>For moral weights across potential moral patients, the common facts our theories are designed to explain are those in human experiences, our direct impressions and intuitions, like how bad suffering <i>feels</i>&nbsp;or <i>appears to be to us</i>. It\u2019s these common facts that can be used to ground intertheoretic comparisons of value or reasons, and it\u2019s these common facts or similar ones for which we want to check in other beings or systems. So, we can hold the strengths of reasons from these common facts constant across theories, if and because they ground value directly on these common facts in the same way, e.g. the same hedonistic utilitarianism under different theories of (conscious) pleasure and unpleasantness, or the same preference utilitarianism under different theories of belief-like preferences. And in recognizing animal consciousness, like finding out that ice is water, you could come to see the same kind of empirical facts and therefore moral value in some other animals, finding more of it in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Multiple possible reference points</h1><p>However, things aren\u2019t so simple as fixing the human moral weight across theories. We should be unsure about that, too. Perhaps a given instance of unpleasantness matters twice as much as another given belief-like preference, or perhaps it matters half as much, with 50% each. We get the two envelopes problem here, too. If we were to fix the value of the unpleasantness, then the belief-like preference would have an expected value of 50%*0.5 + 50%*2 = 1.25 times as great of the value of the unpleasantness. If we were to fix the value of the belief-like preference, then the unpleasantness would have an expected value of 50%*0.5 + 50%*2 = 1.25 times as great of the value of the belief-like preference.</p><p>We\u2019re uncertain about which theory of wellbeing is correct and how to weigh human unpleasantness vs human pleasure vs human felt desires vs human belief-like preferences vs human choices vs objective goods and objective bads (and between each). The relative strengths of these different corresponding reasons are not in general fixed across theories. &nbsp;Therefore, the strengths of our reasons can only be fixed for <i>at most one</i>&nbsp;of these at a time (if their relationships aren\u2019t fixed). And the positive arguments for fixing any specific one and not the others seem likely to be weak, so it really is plausible that none should be fixed.</p><p>Similarly, we can also be uncertain about tradeoffs, strengths and intensities <i>within the same type of welfare for a human</i>, too, e.g. just degrees of unpleasantness, resulting in another two envelopes problem. For example, I\u2019m uncertain about the relative intensities and moral disvalues of pains I\u2019ve experienced.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk18oztzy0nr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk18oztzy0nr\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In general, people may use multiple reference points with which they\u2019re familiar, like multiple specific experiences or intensities, and be uncertain about how they relate to one another.</p><p>There could also be non-welfarist moral reasons to consider, like duties, rights, virtues, justifiability and reasonable complaints (under contractualism), special relationships, and specific instances of any of these. We can be uncertain about how they relate to each other and the various types of welfare, too.</p><p>So, what do we do? We could <i>separately</i>&nbsp;fix and normalize by <i>each</i>&nbsp;possible (typically human-based) reference point, a <i>specific moral reason</i>, use intertheoretic comparisons relative to it, e.g. the expected value of belief-like preferences (cognitive desires) in us and other animals relative to the value of some particular (human) pleasure.

I will discuss this further in another piece, but defend it briefly here. If conscious hedonic states or conscious felt desires count as or ground belief-like preferences, as I discussed in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare%23More_on_unification\"><u>a previous piece</u></a>, then chickens probably do have belief-like preferences. Rats and pigs also seem to be able to discriminate <i>anxiety</i>&nbsp;from its absence generalizably across causes with a learned behaviour, like pressing a lever when they would apparently feel anxious.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4do3fhosx87\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4do3fhosx87\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Perhaps the same would hold for chickens (it hasn't been studied in birds, as far as I know). Perhaps they can generalize this further to unpleasantness or aversion, which would constitute their concepts of bad and worse. The strengths of animals\u2019 belief-like preferences would be a separate issue, but <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Belief_like_preferences\"><u>interpersonal comparisons of belief-like preferences in general may be impossible</u></a>&nbsp;(or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHoBmBsfaDLQzBGfN/increasingly-vague-interpersonal-welfare-comparisons\"><u>extremely vague</u></a>), even between humans, so it wouldn\u2019t even be clear that any given human has <i>more</i>&nbsp;at stake for belief-like preferences than the typical farmed chicken, or vice versa, of course. There could be no fact of the matter.</li><li>Do chickens have important rights or do we have important duties to them? Yes, according to Regan (<a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?vid%3D9780520243866%26redir_esc%3Dy\"><u>1983</u></a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120428171934/http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/philosophy/animals/regan-text.html\"><u>1989</u></a>) and Korsgaard (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198753858.001.0001\"><u>2018</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/on-the-value-of-people-and-animals\"><u>2020</u></a>), the former modifying the Kantian position and the latter extending Kantian arguments to other animals and further claiming general interpersonal incomparability in <a href=\"https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/on-the-value-of-people-and-animals\"><u>Korsgaard, 2020</u></a>. Furthermore, even if we did recognize duties only to rational beings who can recognize normative concepts like Kant originally did, as above, their conscious hedonic states and felt desires or generalizable discrimination could qualify as or ground their normative concepts. Other animals are also plausibly rational to <i>some extent</i>, too, even if minimal.</li><li>Should our actions be justifiable to chickens, real or hypothetical trustees for them (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv134vmrn\"><u>Scanlon, 1998</u></a>, p.183), or idealized rational versions of them? If yes, then chickens could be covered by contractualism, and what\u2019s at stake for them seems reasonably large, given points 1 and 2 and their severe suffering on factory farms. See also the last two sections, on contractualist protections for animals and future people, in <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/\"><u>Ashford and Mulgan, 2018</u></a>.</li><li>Could the capacity to mount reasonable complaints be enough to be covered under contractualism? Can chickens actually mount reasonable complaints? If yes to both, then chickens could be covered by contractualism. Chickens can and do complain about their situations and mistreatment in their own ways (vocalizations i.e. gakel-calls, feelings of unpleasantness and aversion, attempts to avoid, etc.), and what makes a complaint reasonable could just be whether the reasons for the complaint are strong enough relative to other reasons (e.g. under the Parfit\u2019s Complaint Model or Scanlon\u2019s modified version, described in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv134vmrn\"><u>Scanlon, 1998</u></a>, p.229), which does not require (much) rationality on the part of the complainant. Severe suffering, like what factory farmed chickens endure, seems like a relatively strong reason for complaint.</li><li>How do virtues guide our treatment of chickens? The virtues of compassion, beneficence and justice seem applicable here, given their circumstances.</li><li>Do we have any special obligations to chickens? We \u2014 or chicken farmers, at least, and perhaps as consumers indirectly \u2014 are responsible for their existences and lives, like we are for those of our companion animals and children.</li></ol><p>See also the articles by Animal Ethics <a href=\"https://www.animal-ethics.org/ethical-theories-nonhuman-animals/\"><u>on the status of nonhuman animals under various ethical theories</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.animal-ethics.org/animal-interests/\"><u>the weight of animal interests</u></a>.</p><p>However, many of the comparisons here probably do in fact depend on comparisons across moral theories, e.g. Kant\u2019s original animal-unfriendly position vs Regan and (perhaps) Korsgaard\u2019s animal-friendly positions. The requirement of (sufficient) rationality for Kant\u2019s reasons to apply could be an inherently moral claim, not a merely empirical one. If Regan and Korsgaard don\u2019t require rationality for moral status, are they extending <i>the same</i>&nbsp;moral reasons Kant recognizes to other animals, or grounding different moral reasons? They might be the same intrinsically, if we see the restriction to rational beings as not changing the nature of the moral reasons. Perhaps the moral reasons come first, and Kant mistakenly inferred that they apply only to rational beings. Or, if they are different, are they <i>similar enough</i>&nbsp;that we can identify them anyway? On the other hand, could the kinds of reasons Regan and Korsgaard recognize as applying to other animals be far far weaker than Kant\u2019s that apply to humans or incomparable to them? Could Kant\u2019s apply to other animals directly with modest probability anyway?</p><p>Similar issues could arise between contractualist theories that protect nonrational (or not very rational) beings and those that only protect (relatively) rational beings. I leave these as open problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Objections</h1><p>In this section, I describe and respond to some potential objections to the approach and rationale for intertheoretic comparisons of moral weights I\u2019ve described.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conscious subsystems</h2><p>First, it should be human welfare standardly and <i>simultaneously accessed for report</i>&nbsp;that we fix. There could be multiple conscious (or otherwise intrinsically morally considerable) subsystems in a brain to worry about \u2014 whether inaccessible in general or not accessed at any particular time \u2014 effectively multiple moral patients with their own moral interests in each brain. Our basic moral intuitions about the value of human welfare and the common facts we\u2019re trying to explain probably do not reflect any inaccessible conscious subsystems in our brains, and in general would plausibly only reflect conscious subsystems when they are actually accessed. So, we should normalize relative to what we actually access. It could then be that the number of such conscious subsystems scales in practice with the number of neurons in a brain, so that the average human would have many more of them in expectation, and so could have much greater expected moral weight than other animals with fewer neurons (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/do-brains-contain-many-conscious-subsystems\"><u>Fischer, Shriver &amp; St. Jules, 2023</u></a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vbhoFsyQmrntru6Kw/do-brains-contain-many-conscious-subsystems-if-so-should-we\"><u>EA Forum post</u></a>)).</p><p>In the most extreme case, we end up separately counting overlapping systems that differ only by a single neuron (Mathers, 2021) or even a single electron (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/what-if-we-contain-multiple-morally-relevant-subjects/97D3D98A4573E128C7CB763FA1E06008\"><u>Crummett, 2022</u></a>), and the number of conscious subsystems may grow polynomially or even exponentially with the number of neurons or the number of particles, by considering all connected subsets of neurons and neural connections or \u201cconnected\u201d subsets of particles.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd8kpuvyb7ch\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd8kpuvyb7ch\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Even a small probability on an aggressive scaling hypothesis could lead to large predictable <i>expected</i>&nbsp;differences in total moral weights <i>between</i> humans, and could give greater expected moral weight to the average whale with more neurons than the average human (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons\"><u>List of animals by number of neurons - Wikipedia</u></a>). With a small but large enough probability to fast enough scaling with the number of neurons or particles, <i>a single whale could have more expected moral weight than all living humans combined</i>. That seems absurd.</p><p>In this case, how we decide to individuate and count conscious systems seems to be a matter of moral uncertainty. Empirically, I am pretty confident that both the system that is my whole brain is conscious and that the system that is my whole brain excluding any single neuron or electron is conscious. I just don\u2019t think I should count these systems separately to add up. And then, even if I should assign some non-negligible probability that I should count such systems separately and that <i>the same moral reasons</i>&nbsp;apply views on counting conscious systems \u2014 this would be a genuine identification of moral reasons across different moral theories, not just identifying the same moral reasons across different empirical views \u2014, it seems far too fanatical if I prioritize humans (or whales) because of the tiny probability I assign to the number of conscious subsystems of a brain scaling aggressively with the number of neurons or electrons. I outline some other ways to individuate and count subsystems in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vbhoFsyQmrntru6Kw/do-brains-contain-many-conscious-subsystems-if-so-should-we?commentId=pAZtCqpXuGk6H2FgF\">this comment</a>, and I would expect these to give a number of conscious subsystems scaling at most roughly proportionally in expectation with the number of neurons.</p><p>There could be ways to end up with conscious subsystems scaling with the number of neurons that are more empirically based, rather than dependent on moral hypotheses. However, this seems unlikely, because the apparently valuable functions realized in brains seem to occur late in processing, after substantial integration and high-level interpretation of stimuli (see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/btTeBHKGkmRyD5sFK/open-phil-should-allocate-most-neartermist-funding-to-animal?commentId=fRBq6KvgQEcztru7M\"><u>this comment</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/do-brains-contain-many-conscious-subsystems\"><u>Fischer, Shriver &amp; St. Jules, 2023</u></a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vbhoFsyQmrntru6Kw/do-brains-contain-many-conscious-subsystems-if-so-should-we\"><u>EA Forum post</u></a>)). Still, even a small but modest probability could make a difference, so the result will depend on your credences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Unresolvable disagreements</h2><p>Second, it could also be difficult for intelligent aliens and us, if both impartial, to agree on how to prioritize humans vs the aliens under uncertainty, if and because we\u2019re using our own distinct standards to decide what matters and how much. Suppose the aliens have their own concept of <i>a-suffering</i>, which is similar to, but not necessarily identical to our concept of suffering. It may differ from human suffering in that some functions are missing, or additional functions are present, or the number of times they\u2019re realized differ, or the relative or absolute magnitudes of (e.g. cognitive) effects differ. Or, if they haven\u2019t gotten that far in their understanding of a-suffering, it could just be the fact that a-suffering <i>feels different</i>&nbsp;or <i>might</i>&nbsp;feel different from human suffering, so their still vague concept picks out something potentially different from ours. Or vice versa.</p><p>In the same way chickens matter relatively more on the human-relative view than chickens do on the chicken-relative view, as above from <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/#id-111-handling-uncertainty-about-animal-inclusive-vs-human-centric-views\"><u>Karnofsky, 2018</u></a>, humans and the aliens could agree on (almost) all of the facts and have the same probability distributions for the ratio of the moral weight of human suffering to the moral weight of a-suffering, and yet still disagree on expected moral weights and about how to treat each other. Humans could weigh humans and aliens relative to human suffering, while the aliens could weigh humans and aliens relative to a-suffering. In relative terms and for prioritization, the aliens would weigh us more than we weigh ourselves, but we\u2019d weigh them more than they weigh themselves.</p><p>One might respond that this seems too <i>agent-relative</i>, and we should be able to agree on priorities if we agree on all the facts, and share priors and the same impartial utilitarian moral views. However, while consciousness remains unsolved, humans don't know what it's like to be the aliens or to a-suffer, and the aliens don't know what it's like to be us or suffer like us. We have access to different facts, and this is not a source of agent-relativity, or at least not an objectionable one. Furthermore, we are directly valuing <i>our own</i>&nbsp;experiences, human suffering, and the aliens are directly valuing <i>their own</i>, a-suffering, and if these differ enough, then we could also disagree about what matters intrinsically or how. This seems no more agent-relative than the disagreement between utilitarians that disagree just on whether hedonism or desire theory is true: a utilitarian grounding welfare based on human suffering and a utilitarian doing so based on a-suffering just disagree about the correct theory of wellbeing or how it scales.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Epistemic modesty about morality</h2><p>Still, perhaps both we and the aliens should be more epistemically modest<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvh6txtwe7sa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvh6txtwe7sa\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;about what matters intrinsically and how, and so give weight to the direct perspectives of the aliens. If we try to entertain and weigh all points of view, then we would need to make and agree on genuine intertheoretic comparisons of value, which seems hard to ground and justify, or else we\u2019d use an approach that doesn\u2019t depend on intertheoretic comparisons. This could bring us and the aliens closer to agreement about optimal resource allocation, and perhaps convergence under maximal epistemic modesty, assuming we also agree on how to weigh perspectives and an approach to normative uncertainty.</p><p>Doing this can take some care, because we\u2019re uncertain about whether the aliens have any viewpoint at all for us to adopt, and similarly they could be uncertain about us having any such viewpoint. This could prevent full convergence.</p><p>On the other hand, chickens presumably don\u2019t think at all about the moral value of human welfare in impartial terms, so there very probably is no such viewpoint to adopt on their behalf, or else only one that\u2019s extremely partial, e.g. <i>some</i>&nbsp;chickens may care about <i>some</i>&nbsp;humans to which they are emotionally attached, and many chickens may <i>fear or dislike</i>&nbsp;humans. Chickens\u2019 points of view therefore wouldn\u2019t grant humans much or any moral weight at all, or may even grant us <i>negative</i>&nbsp;overall weight instead. However, the right response here may instead be <i>against moral impartiality</i>, not against humans in particular. Indeed, most humans seem to be fairly partial, too, and we might partially defer to them, too. Either way, this perspective doesn\u2019t look like the chicken-relative comparison method B from <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/#id-111-handling-uncertainty-about-animal-inclusive-vs-human-centric-views\"><u>Karnofsky, 2018</u></a>&nbsp;that grants humans astronomically more weight than chickens.</p><p>How might we get such a perspective? We might <i>idealize</i>: what <i>would</i>&nbsp;a chicken believe <i>if</i>&nbsp;they had the capacities and were impartial, while screening off the value from those extra capacities. Or, we might consider a hypothetical impartial human or other intelligent being whose capacities for suffering are like those of a chicken, whatever those may be. Rather than actual viewpoints for which we have specific evidence of their existence, we\u2019re considering <i>conceivable</i>&nbsp;viewpoints.</p><p>I\u2019ll say here that this seems pretty speculative and weird, so I have some reservations about this, but I\u2019m not sure either way.</p><p>A plausibly stronger objection to epistemic modesty about moral (and generally normative) stances is that it can undermine whatever moral views you or I or anyone else holds too much, including the foundational beliefs of effective altruists or assumptions in the <i>project</i>&nbsp;of effective altruism, like impartiality and the importance of beneficence. I am strongly disinclined to practically abandon my own moral views this way. I think this is a more acceptable position than rejecting epistemic modesty about non-normative claims, especially for a moral antirealist, i.e. those who reject <i>stance-independent</i>&nbsp;moral facts. We may have no or only weak reasons for epistemic modesty about moral facts in particular.</p><p>On the other hand, rather than abandoning foundational beliefs, it may actually support them. It may capture impartiality in a fairly strong sense by weighing each individual\u2019s normative stance(s). Any being who suffers finds their own suffering bad in some sense, and this stance is weighed. A typical parent cares a lot for their child, so the child gets extra weight through the normative stance of the parent. Some humans <i>particularly</i>&nbsp;object to exploitation and using others as means to ends, and this stance is weighed. Some humans believe it\u2019s better for far more humans to exist, and this stance is weighed. Some humans believe it\u2019s better for fewer humans to exist, and this stance is weighed. The result could look like a kind of impartial person-affecting preference utilitarianism, contractualism or Kantianism (see also <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dQvDxDMyueLyydHw4/population-ethics-without-axiology-a-framework\"><u>Gloor, 2022</u></a>),<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7a2g7m5mpqs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7a2g7m5mpqs\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but relatively animal-inclusive, because whether or not other animals meet some thresholds for rationality or agency, they could have their own perspectives on what matters, e.g. their suffering and its causes.</p><p>If <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Belief_like_preferences\">normative stances across species, like even across humans, are often impossible to compare</a>, then the implications for prioritization could be fundamentally indeterminate, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHoBmBsfaDLQzBGfN/increasingly-vague-interpersonal-welfare-comparisons\">at least very vague</a>. Or, they could be dominated by those with the most fanatical or lexical stances, who prioritize infinite value at stake without trading it off against mere finite stakes. Or, we might normalize each individual's values (or utility function) by their own range or variance in value (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5840/jphil202011725\">Cotton-Barratt et al., 2020</a>), and other animals could outweigh humans through their numbers in the near term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Other applications of the approach</h1><p>What other intertheoretic comparisons of value could this epistemic approach apply to? I will consider:</p><ol><li>Realism vs illusionism about phenomenal consciousness.</li><li>Moral realism vs moral antirealism.</li><li>Person-affecting views vs total utilitarianism.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, realism vs illusionism about phenomenal consciousness. Illusionists deny the phenomenal nature of consciousness and the existence of qualia as \u201cIntrospectable qualitative properties of experience that are intrinsic, ineffable, and subjective\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2011.04.001\"><u>Frankish, 2012</u></a>, <a href=\"https://keithfrankish.github.io/articles/Frankish_Quining%20diet%20qualia_eprint.pdf\"><u>preprint</u></a>), introduced by Lewis (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/MindAndTheWorldOrderOutlineOfATheoryOfKnowledgeClarenceIrvingLewis\"><u>1929</u></a>, pp.121, 124-125). Realists accept the phenomenal nature of consciousness and/or qualia. Illusionists do not deny that consciousness exists.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpkavp9xsvv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpkavp9xsvv\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In section 5.2, <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0006.032/--normative-challenge-for-illusionist-views-of-consciousness?rgn%3Dmain;view%3Dfulltext\"><u>Kammerer, 2019</u></a>&nbsp;argues that if phenomenal consciousness <i>would</i>&nbsp;ground moral value if it existed, it would be an amazing coincidence for pain to be as bad under (strong) illusionism, which denies the existence of phenomenal consciousness, as it is under realism which accepts the existence of phenomenal consciousness. However, if you're already a moral antirealist or take an epistemic approach to intertheoretic comparisons, then it seems reasonable to hold the strengths of your reasons to be the same, but just acknowledge that you may have misjudged their <i>source</i>&nbsp;or <i>nature</i>. Rather than phenomenal properties as their source, it could be <i>quasi-phenomenal</i>&nbsp;properties, where \u201ca quasi-phenomenal property is a non-phenomenal, physical property (perhaps a complex, gerrymandered one) that introspection typically misrepresents as phenomenal\u201d (<a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=J8RBDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT3&amp;ots=ijnUohbGqW#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\"><u>Frankish, 2017</u></a>, p. 18), or even the beliefs, appearances or misrepresentations themselves. Frankish (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2011.04.001\"><u>2012</u></a>, <a href=\"https://keithfrankish.github.io/articles/Frankish_Quining%20diet%20qualia_eprint.pdf\"><u>preprint</u></a>) proposed a theory-neutral explanandum for consciousness:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Zero qualia</strong>&nbsp;The properties of experiences that dispose us to judge that experiences have introspectable qualitative properties that are intrinsic, ineffable, and subjective.</p></blockquote><p>These zero qualia could turn out to be phenomenal, under realism, or non-phenomenal and so quasi-phenomenal under illusionism (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2011.04.001\"><u>Frankish, 2012</u></a>, <a href=\"https://keithfrankish.github.io/articles/Frankish_Quining%20diet%20qualia_eprint.pdf\"><u>preprint</u></a>), but the judgements to be captured are the same, so it seems reasonable to treat the resulting reasons as the same. Or, we could use a less precise common ground: <i>consciousness, whatever it is</i>.</p><p>A similar approach could be taken with respect to uncertainty between <i>meta</i>ethical positions, using our moral judgements or intuitions as the common facts. Again, we may be wrong about the nature of what they\u2019re supposed to refer to or even the descriptive reality of these moral judgements and intuitions \u2014 e.g. whether they express propositions, as in cognitivism, or desires, emotions or other pro-attitudes and con-attitudes, as in non-cognitivism (<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-cognitivism/\"><u>van Roojen, 2023</u></a>), and, under cognitivism, whether they are stance-independent or stance-dependent \u2014, but we will still have them in any case. I\u2019d judge torture very negatively regardless of my metaethical stance. Even more straightforwardly, for any specific moral realist stance, there\u2019s a corresponding subjectivist stance that recognizes the exact same moral facts (and vice versa?), but just interprets them as stance-dependent rather than stance-independent. Any non-cognitivist pro-attitude or desire could be reinterpreted as expressing a belief (or appearance) that something is better.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefez3y7sviu1l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnez3y7sviu1l\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This could allow us to at least match identical moral theories, e.g. the same specific classical utilitarianism, under the different metaethical interpretations.</p><p>Riedener (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0953820819000165\"><u>2019</u></a>) proposes a similar and more general constructivist approach based on epistemic norms.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefao6pw4ks3iu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnao6pw4ks3iu\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;He illustrates with person-affecting views vs total utilitarianism, arguing for holding the strengths of reasons to benefit existing people the same between <i>welfarist</i>&nbsp;person-affecting views and total utilitarianism,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw0g3x0c7iu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw0g3x0c7iu\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which would tend to favour total utilitarianism under moral uncertainty. However, if we\u2019re comparing a <i>Kantian</i>&nbsp;person-affecting view and total utilitarianism, he argues that we may have massively misjudged our reasons other than for beneficence between the two views. So the comparison is more complex, and reasons for beneficence could be stronger under total utilitarianism, while our other reasons could be stronger under Kantian views, and we should balance epistemic norms and the particulars to decide these differences.</p><p>To be clear, I\u2019m much less convinced of the applications in these cases, and there are important reasons for doubt:</p><ol><li>Realist accounts of phenomenal consciousness are designed primarily to explain our <i>actually (allegedly) phenomenal</i>&nbsp;properties, which illusionists deny, while illusionism is designed primarily to explain our <i>beliefs</i>&nbsp;about consciousness or quasi-phenomenal properties that lead to them, so realist and illusionist accounts disagree about what is to be explained. That phenomenal properties are in practice or even by physical necessity quasi-phenomenal could be incidental to a realist, hence philosophical zombie (p-zombie) thought experiments (see <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/ENTRIES/zombies/\"><u>Kirk, 2023</u></a>&nbsp;for a standard reference). If a moral position directly grants moral value to phenomenal properties <i>in virtue of being phenomenal</i>, then this is <i>not</i>&nbsp;a common ground with moral positions that instead grant moral value to quasi-phenomenal properties in virtue of being quasi-phenomenal or to the resulting dispositions. That being said, I think moral positions should generally not ground value on phenomenal consciousness specifically, but instead on <i>consciousness, whatever it is</i>.</li><li>Similarly, moral realists take <i>actually (allegedly) stance-independent moral facts</i>&nbsp;as fundamental, which to them may not derive from (actual, hypothetical or idealized) moral judgements or intuitions, which are <i>stances</i>&nbsp;that could differ between people, while subjectivists and non-cognitivists seem to take our (actual, hypothetical or idealized) moral judgements or intuitions as fundamental. That moral judgements and intuitions are evidence about and sometimes track stance-independent moral facts isn\u2019t enough for a moral realist, because they could be mistaken. There does not seem to be a common ground for granting moral value between these positions.</li><li>Those holding apparently welfarist person-affecting views may disagree that total utilitarianism is designed to explain the same kinds of reasons or facts as their views are. They may understand their moral reasons in ways similar to a Kantian or contractualist or otherwise reject (standard conceptions of) axiology, but also deny act-omission distinctions and see in others the same kinds of reasons they have to promote their own interests. It\u2019s not preference satisfaction or even welfare <i>per se</i>&nbsp;that matters, but that things go better or worse according to the preferences, points of view, ends or normative stances of individuals who have them.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj4v95vtl0p8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj4v95vtl0p8\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And merely possible people don\u2019t (actually) have them.</li></ol><p>In each of the above cases, one view takes as fundamental and central <i>measures or consequences</i>&nbsp;of what the other view takes as fundamental and central.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefibix12qti5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnibix12qti5\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This will look like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\"><u>Goodhart\u2019s law</u></a>&nbsp;to those who insist it\u2019s not these measures or consequences that matter but what is being measured or the causes. Those holding one of the pairs of views could complain that the others are <i>gravely</i>&nbsp;mistaken about what matters and why, so Riedener (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/abs/constructivism-about-intertheoretic-comparisons/BA4EC20C823C830E3D52A12E3B52E9C2\"><u>2019</u></a>)\u2019s conservatism may not tell us much about how to weigh the views. The comparisons seem less reasonable, and we could end up with two envelopes problems again, fixing one theory\u2019s fundamental grounds and evaluating both theories relative to it.</p><p>On the other hand, while not every pair of theories of consciousness or the value of welfare will agree on common facts to explain, many will. For example, realists about phenomenal consciousness will tend to agree with each other that it\u2019s (specific) phenomenal properties themselves that their theories are designed to explain, so we could compare reasons across realist theories. Illusionists will tend to agree that it\u2019s our beliefs (or appearances) about consciousness that are the common facts to explain, so we could compare reasons across illusionist theories. And theories of welfare and its value are designed to explain, among other things, why suffering is bad or seems bad. So, many reason comparisons can be grounded in practice, even if not all. And regardless of the reasons and whether they can be compared across all views, the common facts from which comparable reasons derive are based on human experience, so our moral views are justifiably human-relative.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnk6ajqmreh7\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefk6ajqmreh7\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Karnofsky (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/#id-111-handling-uncertainty-about-animal-inclusive-vs-human-centric-views\"><u>2018</u></a>) wrote:</p><blockquote><p>In this case, a &gt;10% probability on the human-inclusive view would be effectively similar to a 100% probability on the human-centric view.</p></blockquote><p>I assume he meant \u201chuman-centric view\u201d instead of \u201chuman-inclusive view\u201d, so I correct the quote with square brackets here.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn5r88kjgoi3c\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref5r88kjgoi3c\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathbb{E}[1/X] = 1/\\mathbb{E}[X]\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-ams-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

Rats further generalized between various pairs of anxiety(-like) states, like those induced by PTZ, drug withdrawal, predator exposure, ethanol hangover, \u201cjet lag\u201d, defeat by a rival male, high doses of stimulants like bemegride and cocaine, and movement restraint.</p><p>However, Mason and Lavery (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2022.788289\"><u>2022</u></a>) caution:</p><blockquote><p>But could such results merely reflect a \u201cblindsight-like\u201d guessing: a mere discrimination response that need not reflect underlying awareness?

In other words, I\u2019ll propose a form of <i>constructivism about IRCs</i>. If I\u2019m right, IRCs are not facts out there that hold independently of facts about morally uncertain agents. They hold in virtue of being the result of an ideally reasonable deliberation, in terms of certain epistemic norms, about what you ought to do in light of your uncertainty.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>So very roughly, these norms suggest that without any explanation, you shouldn\u2019t assume that you\u2019ve always systematically and radically misjudged the strength of your everyday paradigm reasons. And they imply that you should more readily assume you may have misjudged some reasons if you have an explanation for why and how you may have done so, or if these reasons are less mundane and pervasive. This seems intuitively plausible. But Simplicity, Conservatism and Coherence might be false, or not quite correct as I\u2019ve stated them, or there might be other and more important norms besides them.<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;My aim is not to argue for these precise norms. I\u2019m happy if it\u2019s plausible that <i>some</i>&nbsp;such epistemic norms hold, and that they can constrain the IRCs or ought-judgements you can reasonably make. If that\u2019s so, we can invoke a form of constructivism to ground IRCs. We can understand truth about IRCs as the outcome of ideally reasonable deliberation \u2013 in terms of principles like the above \u2013 about what you ought to do in light of your uncertainty. By comparison, consider the view that truth in first-order moral theory is simply the result of an ideal process of systematizing our pre-theoretical moral beliefs.<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;On this view, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s some independent Platonic realm of moral facts, and that norms like simplicity and coherence are best at guiding us towards it. Rather, the principles are first, and \u2018truth\u2019 is simply the outcome of the principles. We can invoke a similar kind of constructivism about IRCs. On this view, principles like Simplicity, Conservatism and Coherence are not justified in virtue of their guiding us towards an independent realm of ought-facts or IRCs. Rather, they help constitute this realm.</p><p>So this provides an answer to why some ought-facts or IRCs hold. It\u2019s <i>not</i>&nbsp;because of mind-independent metaphysical facts about how theories compare, or how strong certain reasons would be if we had them. It\u2019s simply because of facts about how to respond reasonably to moral evidence or have reasonable moral beliefs. Ultimately, we might say, it\u2019s because of facts about <i>us</i>&nbsp;\u2013 about why we might have been wrong about morality, and by how much and in what way, and so on.</p></blockquote></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnw0g3x0c7iu\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefw0g3x0c7iu\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Riedener (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0953820819000165\"><u>2019</u></a>) writes:</p><blockquote><p>According to TU, you have all the reasons that you have according to PAD \u2013 reasons to benefit existing others \u2013 but also some additional reasons beyond them.

It can cause both an acute, and chronic hepatitis (liver infection). It is transmitted via body fluids (blood, saliva, semen or vaginal fluid) from an individual with an active viraemia (HBV circulating in the blood). Transmission can occur horizontally (from person to person) or vertically (from mother to child). Neonates and infants are most susceptible to progress to chronic infection when exposed to HBV, this most commonly occurs during delivery to a mother with active hepatitis B. Acute hepatitis B rarely requires specific treatment and is cleared in that majority of immunocompetent adults. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) risks progressing to cirrhosis (liver scarring and failure), and CHB related liver cancers, which account for the majority of the burden of disease associated with hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a vaccine preventable illness, delivered as a 3-4 dose regimen with a \u2018birth-dose\u2019 given to a neonate soon after delivery. Treatment in the form of anti-viral medications are available to suppress viral replication in those with established CHB, this prevents complications but rarely cures the disease.</p><p>Approximately 316 million people were infected chronically with HBV in 2019. There were approximately 331 000 deaths from HBV related cirrhosis, and 192 000 deaths from HBV related liver cancer.<sup>1</sup> Hepatitis B resulted in approximately 18.2 million DALYs in 2019.<sup>2</sup> The World Health Organisation in 2022 set a goal of elimination of AIDS, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections by 2030. WHO has additionally focussed on a \u2018triple-elimination\u2019 initiative, focussing on the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis, HIV and HBV, given their shared modes of transmission and epidemiological risk factors.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Importance</strong></h1><h2><u>What is the natural history of Hepatitis B?</u></h2><p>Infection with HBV is virologically and immunologically complex. Infection can be conceptually delineated by a range of serological, virological&nbsp; and biochemical factors into phases of illness. Individuals exposed to HBV may develop an acute phase of the illness, related to viral replication in the host\u2019s hepatocytes (liver cells). Clinically this may manifest as an acute hepatitis (presenting with liver pain, fever and jaundice), or may cause a mild non-specific illness. Acute illness is typically self-limiting with only supportive treatment required. There is a ~1% risk of acute illness progressing to acute liver failure.<sup>3</sup> Acute liver failure has a mortality of 65-85%.<sup>4</sup></p><p>CHB is defined as serological positivity &gt;6 months after disease onset. Chronic infection causes morbidity and mortality by two main mechanisms, increasing the risk of cirrhosis, and HBV related liver cancers. Approximately 15-40% of those with untreated CHB will progress to cirrhosis or liver cancer.<sup>5</sup> Development of cirrhosis and liver cancer is a result of prolonged viral replication and an associated inflammatory response. Cirrhosis and liver cancer take approximately 10-20 years to develop.<sup>4</sup> Treatment with anti-viral medication and viral suppression reduces the risk of complication from chronic infection significantly.&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;</u></p><p>Not all individuals exposed to HBV will go on to develop CHB. The risk of progressing to CHB after exposure is inversely related to age at time of first exposure.<sup>6</sup> Neonates have an 40-90% risk of progression if born to a Hep B positive mother (can be &gt;95% if mother is HBeAg positive), children &lt;6 have an approximate 30% risk, and healthy adults have a risk of approximately &lt;5%.<sup>7</sup> It is postulated that approximately 35-50% of all CHB cases worldwide are due to mother to child transmission.<sup>8</sup></p><p>The exact mechanism of vertical transmission is not entirely clear. Intrapartum or peripartum (during or around the time of delivery) is thought to be the predominant mechanism by which HBV is transmitted from mother to child. There may be a smaller role on intrauterine transmission (during pregnancy, prior to delivery). There is insignificant evidence to suggest transmission via breast milk.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Hepatitis B requires serology for diagnosis. There are a range of serological markers tested for which can help clinicians differentiate current infection, past or cleared infection, vaccination, or susceptibility if exposed. If chronic infection is suspected further investigation including viral load and genotyping can be performed, as well as investigation for complication of disease. Rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) is emerging as an easy to interpret, cheap and quick alternative to serological testing in resource constrained settings. Specificity for RDTs is 98.3 to 99.3%, and sensitivity is &gt;99% for HBsAg.<sup>9</sup> Whilst only providing information on HBsAg status (presence or absence of HBV in the blood), they offer an accessible alternative to formal serology in resource constrained settings.&nbsp;</p><h2><u>What is the burden of Hepatitis B worldwide?</u></h2><p>Based on available seroprevalence data, it is estimated that 4.1% (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 3.7-4.5%) of the global population had chronic Hep B infection in 2019. The rate varied widely across regions. The WHO Western Pacific region had a prevalence of 7.1% (95% UI 6.3 to 7.9), the African region had a prevalence of 6.5% (5.8 to 7.3). The European region had a prevalence of 1.1% (95% UI 1.0 to 1.2). Seroprevalence of children under 5 globally was 1.0% (95% UI 0.8 to 1.2). All WHO regions had an under 5 seroprevalence of &lt;1%, except the African region at 2.7% (95%UI 2.2 to 3.2).<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p><p>HBV was responsible for approximately 18.2 million DALYs in 2019.<sup>2</sup> Of these, 70% were attributable to 10 countries (in order: China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Egypt, Thailand, South Korea, Bangladesh, Myanmar). HBV related disease (acute hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer related to Hep B) was responsible for approximately 555 000 deaths (95% UI 487 000 to 630 000) in 2019. HBV related cirrhosis was responsible for 59.6% (95% UI 50.3 to 70.6) of deaths, HBV related liver cancer was responsible for 34.6% (95% UI 29.2 to 40.4) and acute Hep B was responsible for 5.9% (95% UI 4.3 to 8.1) of Hep B related deaths.<sup>6</sup></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/cghjwbsdtlrllxra5ubc\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/p8coanlguvkla9tfuuwu 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/fomys0ynbrnmyptsd2qy 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/vkzj7aitvxpsbbto5qkr 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/fbfqmwhk0ykml0ryqyfp 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/b6vf6zgocuntt76gtdfp 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/dy9bzw6c95zdggtplmqs 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/gfef1qcsjebz70mna0ow 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/dnyqsr6nggiesy20lxze 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/hws71a2vy7jsfbpwajln 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/lswukbu47ewnjpflpfuw 941w\"><figcaption>Taken from:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(22)00124-8/fulltext#sec1\">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(22)00124-8/fulltext#sec1</a></figcaption></figure><p>Overall rates of chronic Hep B are improving.

Prevention includes vaccination, and post-exposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin. Treatment of chronic infection is with anti-viral medications, which are usually continued lifelong.</p><h3><i>Prevention</i></h3><p>Hepatitis B vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis with HBV immunoglobulin are both effective means of preventing CHB in infants born to HBV positive mothers. Compared to placebo, full course HBV vaccine reduced the risk of CHB in infants by approximately 72% (Risk Ratio 0.28 95% CI 0.20 to 0.40). There was no difference between 3 or 4 dose regimens. There was no difference between HBeAg positive or HBeAg negative studies included in the review. HBV immunoglobulin alone (i.e. without vaccination) reduced risk of transmission by 50% (RR 0.50 95% CI 0.41 to 0.60). Combination vaccination and HBV immunoglobulin significantly reduced the occurrence of HBV in infants by 92% (RR 0.08 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17).<sup>13</sup></p><p>Treatment with anti-viral medication of women with HBV (peripartum antiviral prophylaxis) is strongly recommended. Anti-viral treatment reduced the risk of CHB in infants born to mothers who were HBsAg positive by 70% (RR 0.3 95% CI 0.3 to 0.4).<sup>14</sup></p><p>Vaccination against HBV is highly cost effective. One study from The Gambia found a cost of $47 USD (2002 USD) per DALY averted.<sup>15</sup> A modelling study which investigated the costs associated with a cold temperature chain outreach vaccine delivery model to improve acquisition of birth-dose vaccination found a cost of $0.15 to $79.72 per DALY averted from the delivery model.<sup>16</sup> Little cost-effectiveness data is available for HBV immunoglobulin. Given it is a blood product that requires significant infrastructure and expertise at a high cost, its cost-effectiveness is unlikely to be competitive with vaccination.</p><p>A high-quality modelling study published in <i>The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology</i> found scaling up peripartum antiviral prophylaxis to all HBsAg positive women could avert approximately 13.5 million DALYs (95% UI 12.3 million to 14.1 million) by 2100. Of these, approximately 8.3 million DALYs would averted in the African region. The cost per DALY averted ranged from $985 USD (95%UI 878 to 1128) in the African region, to $6587 USD (95% UI 5511 to 7730) in the European region.<sup>17</sup></p><h3><i>Treatment</i></h3><p>Treatment of CHB is complex and guidelines vary internationally with regards to timing and choice of commencing anti-viral medication. Generally, treatment is lifelong, with &lt;1% of individuals clearing chronic infection and being able to successfully remain off anti-viral medications.<sup>18</sup> Treatment with commonly used anti-viral medications (e.g. entecavir and tonofovir disoproxil fumarate) can achieve viral suppression in &gt;90% of cases.<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;</p><p>The cost effectiveness of anti-viral treatment varies depending on context. One cost-effectiveness modelling study found a cost of $14 590 USD per QALY gained from treatment in all HBsAg positive patients in China.<sup>20</sup> An economic analysis from The Gambia found a cost of approximately $511 USD per QALY gained from community based screening and treatment.<sup>21</sup></p><h1><strong>Neglectedness</strong></h1><h2><u>Current funding</u></h2><p>The morbidity and mortality associated with hepatitis B is largely preventable through prevention and treatment efforts. Despite improvements in rates of hepatitis B, it remains the cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hepatitis B can be considered a neglected tropical disease insofar as it:</p><ul><li>Has the majority of morbidity and mortality borne by low- and middle-income countries where resources are inherently constrained and directed to competing health concerns such as HIV and malaria.</li><li>Disproportionately impacts populations affected by poverty, causing morbidity and mortality including stigma and discrimination.&nbsp;</li><li>Relatively neglected by research (i.e. resource allocation not in keeping with burden of the disease)</li><li>Amenable to broad control, elimination or eradication by applying public health strategies.<sup>22</sup></li></ul><p>A review of expenditure on infectious disease research in the UK from 1997 to 2013 found 0.7% of total expenditure allocated to hepatitis B, 13.9% allocated to malaria, and 17.5% allocated to HIV. This is incommensurate with the relative burden from each of the respective diseases.<sup>23</sup></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/djtsagr53lznl3yqbwcg\" alt=\"A diagram of a diagram of a company\n\nDescription automatically generated with medium confidence\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/toby8q3u0nioqa3l0zpf 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/k2fm6vkuh7efxo5cvxmx 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/ordojvm42rlszendpb41 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/oau9yimzbr6y3jimpd9j 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/goi47iqsjxp4vxx8fcde 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/vecsq6ierbrry6jkkqdv 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/fukt3u5poctl3b2w369r 1400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/qz6ndrsiamhvi80vwa8s 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/d9jjlxjmmswsi674sdb3 1800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LdxFdomAnW56vYxaK/axinfbk5zdf89mvmielg 1984w\"><figcaption>Taken from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5628785/</figcaption></figure><p>More anecdotally, when conducting an initial search on Medline for a recent systematic-review on interventions to improve screening for maternal HIV, syphilis and HBV, a sensitive search approach yielded 1 288 results for HIV, 457 results for syphilis, and only 160 results for hepatitis B.

Jackson Wagner, the first author of this post, has written the script. &nbsp;Writer, the second author, has given feedback.</i></p><p><i>Below, you can find the script of the video.</i></p><hr><h2>Introduction</h2><p>When you think about ways to help people in developing countries, you probably think of international aid -- providing medical supplies, or coordinating disaster relief, or even just giving cash, like we discussed in our recent video about global poverty.&nbsp; These things are great, and this kind of charitable aid saves lives every day.&nbsp; But there\u2019s something a little curious here, because these interventions AREN\u2019T what helped the world\u2019s most prosperous countries succeed in the first place.</p><p>Up until the 1700s, essentially the entire population of the planet lived in poverty.&nbsp; That started to change during the industrial revolution, when humanity developed more efficient, mechanized ways of producing goods and capturing energy.&nbsp; Hundreds of millions of people were able to live better lives thanks to economic growth -- learning to use technology to more efficiently grow food, make clothes, and get from place to place.</p><p>The overwhelming importance of economic development remains true in modern times -- by far the greatest ongoing reductions in poverty and suffering are coming not from international aid projects, but from development, as low-income countries find new ways to do things more efficiently&nbsp; and climb the ladder of technological advancement.</p><p>For example, in the year 1960, Singapore was a poor and undeveloped country, producing only $428 per citizen.&nbsp; Today, Singapore\u2019s economy has grown by many times, to around $83,000 per person.&nbsp; Concurrently, Singaporeans\u2019 life expectancy has climbed from 65 years to 85 years, and the literacy rate has jumped from 57% to 97%.&nbsp; That\u2019s an incredible amount of progress within a single lifetime.</p><p>Almost every country on earth has made some economic progress over the past few decades, but unfortunately only a few have succeeded as spectacularly as economic-development superstars like Singapore, or South Korea.&nbsp; There are hundreds of millions of people still living on just a few dollars per day, like Singaporeans in 1960.&nbsp; So, why do some countries grow more quickly than others?</p><p>One important factor is the quality of a country\u2019s institutions: Can the local court system make fair and speedy decisions, or do cases take years to resolve while working through a system mired in corruption?&nbsp; Can the local government efficiently build infrastructure for electricity, roads, and public transit?&nbsp; Are elections trustworthy?&nbsp; Can people be confident that their savings and investments are secure?</p><p>Trying to improve a nation\u2019s existing institutions can thus be a powerful way to boost development and reduce poverty, but it can also be very difficult.&nbsp; When a system has been around for a long time, there will always be a lot of entrenched interests who benefit from the status quo and like things the way they are.&nbsp; But if you want to reform a broken institution, there\u2019s no avoiding this kind of long, arduous political struggle, right?</p><h2>The idea of charter cities, and the town of Itana</h2><p>Well, in 2009, nobel-prize-winning economist Paul Romer proposed a new strategy.&nbsp; He argued that going through the painstaking process of fighting for incremental changes from within the existing system might not always be a country\u2019s best choice.&nbsp; Sometimes, it might be easier to start from scratch, developing an entirely new city with a new legal code and new institutions, inspired by the best international examples.</p><p>Charter cities, Romer said, would be like a nation within a nation.&nbsp; They\u2019ll still need to follow their mother country\u2019s constitution, criminal code, and international treaties, but should otherwise be given the freedom to design their own legal code to encourage the growth of new industries -- setting their own immigration rules, tax codes, business regulations, civil court systems, and more.&nbsp; The way that the city holds elections, the structure of its government, and the way it provides public services could all be designed based on the playbook of success stories like Singapore.</p><p>There aren\u2019t many charter cities that exist today, but for a real-world example, let\u2019s look at \u201cItana\u201d, a small charter city project being spearheaded by the Nigerian entrepreneur Iyinolowa Aboyeji.&nbsp; Itana is a town being built near Lagos, designed to attract talented tech workers from across Africa to found their own new companies or work remotely for employers overseas.&nbsp; Of course, in order to realize that dream, Itana is going to need a stable supply of electricity and a strong internet connection.&nbsp; But that\u2019s difficult in Nigeria, which has struggled for decades with electrical blackouts and grid collapses, only managing to provide power for less than eight hours out of each day.&nbsp; One of the many obstacles to better service is that the government insists power be provided very cheaply.&nbsp; It\u2019s a vote-winning policy, but it makes power companies reluctant to transmit electricity that they\u2019re forced to buy at a high price and sell at a loss.&nbsp; This is one reason Itana wants the ability to write its own business regulations -- if Itana could choose to pay a higher price for more consistent power, that could set the stage for a brighter future.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to attract talented people from across all of Africa, it would be great if Itana could write its own, town-specific immigration rules, granting visas quickly instead of having them go through an arduous, months-long process.&nbsp; And for similar reasons, it\u2019s planning to make it as easy as possible for entrepreneurs to quickly register a new business.</p><h2>Objection: why whole new cities?</h2><p>Now, some of you might be thinking -- this sounds nice, but isn\u2019t it overkill to build an ENTIRE NEW CITY, just to test out some better business regulations?&nbsp; Who would want to be the first to move there?&nbsp; It\u2019s true that this might seem drastic in places like the United states, where no new large cities have been built in the last hundred years.&nbsp; But across Latin America, Africa, and Asia, millions of people move from the countryside to urban areas each year, with the United Nations expecting 2.5 billion new city-dwellers by 2050.&nbsp; Urbanization in many countries is happening so fast that it\u2019s outpacing the ability of existing cities to build supporting infrastructure -- leading to problems with providing clean water, electricity, and other basic servicesso on.&nbsp; Lagos, for instance, is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, doubling in size over the past twenty years from eight million to sixteen million people.&nbsp; Building out infrastructure for new charter cities would help channel the power of this urbanization to create healthy, productive engines of long-term growth, rather than stressing existing megacities with continuing haphazard, unplanned sprawl.</p><h2>Objection: isn't this politically intractable?</h2><p>A bigger problem is political feasibility.&nbsp; The whole point of giving a city the ability to write its own rules is to make reform easier, but in order to get that ball rolling, you first need to find a nation willing to give away lots of their own regulation-writing authority in order to enable your charter city project.&nbsp; This isn\u2019t completely unheard of -- in many ways, charter cities are just a bigger and bolder version of \u201cSpecial Economic Zones\u201d, where a port might be granted lower tariffs or streamlined permitting for the sake of spurring industrial development.&nbsp; Nevertheless, asking for broad autonomy to create an entire city is a tall order.</p><p>Indeed, Paul Romer was originally involved in efforts to create charter cities in Madagascar and Honduras, but later abandoned both projects.&nbsp; Despite being invited by each country\u2019s president, the idea became politically controversial in both nations, and the project in Madagascar fell apart when the president\u2019s party was voted out of power.&nbsp; In Honduras, a law authorizing charter cities was passed after years of political wrangling, but Paul Romer distanced himself from the result, saying that Honduran corporate special interests had corrupted his original vision.</p><h2>Wider benefits: inspiration, competition, and experimentation</h2><p>So, charter cities are difficult to get off the ground, and since most of today\u2019s projects are still in early stages, we don\u2019t know for sure how effectively they\u2019ll boost growth.&nbsp; But these uncertainties should be weighed against the immense potential benefit -- the chance to lift millions of residents out of poverty through improved governance and sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And, it gets even better, because it\u2019s likely that the growth-boosting benefits of charter cities could spread to far more people than just the residents who move there.&nbsp; There are three main ways this could happen: inspiration, competition, and experimentation.</p><p><strong>First, seeing legal reforms work well on a small scale could inspire larger national changes.</strong>&nbsp; For example, Hong Kong\u2019s economic policies during the 20th century didn\u2019t just help the city of Hong Kong itself grow into a thriving metropolis of several million people.&nbsp; Provinces in mainland China were also inspired to imitate Hong Kong\u2019s success, and this economic liberalization eventually lifted&nbsp;<i>hundreds</i> of millions of people out of poverty.</p><p><strong>Second, is the idea that charter cities could spur \u201cgovernance competition\u201d.</strong>&nbsp; If you give people lots of options about where and how to live, people will naturally flock to the places that offer them the most freedom, safety, and prosperity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, right now, lots of people don\u2019t have many good options, and that makes it easier for governments to restrict people\u2019s rights or otherwise exploit their citizens.&nbsp; In a world with lots of charter cities, fewer people will have to put up with that kind of abuse, and would-be exploitative governments will be pressured to start treating their citizens better, lest they start losing all their best people to the city next door.</p><p><strong>Finally, experimenting with totally new types of law could bring huge benefits.</strong>&nbsp; What about going beyond just imitating the best practices of developed countries, and instead trying to do even better?&nbsp; Since charter cities are building whole new laws and institutions from a clean slate, it\u2019ll also be easier for them to experiment with radically new concepts which, if successful, could become leading examples for the whole world.</p><p>For example, Prospera is a charter city that\u2019s currently operating within a special economic zone in Honduras. They've implemented a completely novel legal framework that enables rapid innovation across industries. Alongside benefits for areas like finance and biotech, Pr\u00f3spera's legal platform enables architects to design modern, eco-friendly buildings connected by parks and walking paths, in a way that wouldn\u2019t be possible under the zoning rules of most American cities.</p><p>There are all kinds of new policy ideas that charter cities could potentially explore.&nbsp; The new-city project of Telosa is planning to base its economic system around the philosophy of \u201cGeorgism\u201d, taxing land in a way that will help fund city services while eliminating economic distortions around land use.&nbsp; A city could also try out improved ways of voting, like \u201cliquid democracy\u201d where there\u2019s no strict distinction between ordinary voters and elected representatives, or they could take inspiration from a previous video of ours, and have the city government use prediction markets to help inform important public decisions.&nbsp; All of these ideas would be considered huge, fundamental reforms to the status quo of today\u2019s rich countries.&nbsp; Trying them out on a small scale in a charter city would be much easier.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The idea of building charter cities with new legal systems to boost economic growth is strange and untested.&nbsp; Today\u2019s projects are small, with uncertain prospects.&nbsp; But consider this: two hundred and fifty years ago, the United States was small and uncertain.&nbsp; It was experimenting with a bizarre, Classical-era style of government called \u201cdemocracy\u201d, and nobody knew if it would really work.&nbsp; But over time, democracy proved so successful that countless nations around the world made the switch -- and this new system led to greater peace, faster economic growth, and more human freedom.</p><p>If some of today\u2019s charter cities are successful, then maybe the idea of semi-autonomous cities could spread across the world just like democracy did.&nbsp; A century from now, maybe the idea that promoting governance competition leads to faster growth and greater liberty, will seem just as obvious as the idea that an elected president usually provides better leadership than a dictator or a king.&nbsp; Charter cities today are focused on making life better for the people who choose to move there.&nbsp; But if we\u2019re lucky, they might also help make our entire civilization wiser, richer, fairer, and better able to navigate future challenges.</p><h2>Call-To-Action</h2><p>If you loved this video, consider checking out the website of the Charter Cities Institute to learn more.&nbsp; The Charter Cities Institute does research to understand the detailed legal frameworks and governmental best-practices that new cities can use to set themselves up for success.&nbsp; They also consult with interested governments and city developers, spreading the word about the charter cities idea and helping new projects get off the ground.</p><p>On their website, you can read their research and learn the history of development superstars like Dubai and Shenzhen.&nbsp; You can also listen to podcast interviews with the people involved in some of today\u2019s most exciting new city projects.</p><p>Another fun resource is the \u201cStartup Cities Map\u201d, where you can learn about dozens of innovative special economic zones and ambitious new-city projects underway across the developing world.</p><p>And as always, we have detailed links in this video\u2019s description, so if you want to read all about Prospera Honduras\u2019s 3D voxel-based property rights, or watch the original TED talk where Paul Romer first introduced the idea of charter cities, you can check out those links!</p>", "user": {"username": "Jackson Wagner"}}, {"_id": "7FC8DpGr9jKYBDtG8", "title": "What skills, careers, and experiences should young EAs pursue as the AI revolution looms?", "postedAt": "2024-02-19T09:40:39.740Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm a first-year psychology Ph.D. student who has become quite down about the academic path.

Since 1850, the average temperature has risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius due to carbon emissions from human activities.<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> At the current rate of carbon emissions, the global temperature is expected to rise to 4 degrees Celsius from the 1850 baseline.<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> Most of the current carbon emissions come from corporations, while a relatively small amount comes from households and individual consumption. In fact, 70% of the world's carbon emissions come from 100 corporations that rely on fossil fuels.<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a> In contrast, only 20% of carbon emissions result from households' consumption habits.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a> Considering that this figure represents the collective carbon emissions of all households around the globe, an individual's contribution to global carbon emissions makes up a minuscule and almost negligible percentage of global carbon emissions. Hence, there has been much debate over the concept of individual action on climate change and whether a change in an individual's consumption habits can make a significant impact on global carbon emissions. Many individuals have argued that a change in an individual's consumption habits to reduce his personal carbon emissions may be negligible and futile as there is little effect on global carbon emissions, considering the small amount of carbon emissions from an individual's consumption habits relative to global carbon emissions. Within the U.S., concerns about global carbon emissions and rising global temperatures have fallen. In a 2022 Associated Press poll, only 35% of American adults were highly concerned about rising global temperatures and their impact on their personal lives, a decrease from 44% when the same poll was conducted in 2019.<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a> Hence, many individuals are either ignorant or indifferent to their actions and their contributions to carbon emissions and rising global temperatures.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this debate, this essay will examine whether individuals should be morally required to change their consumption habits to reduce their contributions to global carbon emissions. This essay's thesis will argue that individuals are morally required to change their consumption habits to reduce carbon emissions and minimise the suffering and deaths caused by climate change and rising global temperatures. This essay will base its argument on Peter Singer's argument in his 1972 paper <i>Famine, Affluence and Morality.</i> Subsequently, it will explain how Singer's argument can be applied to an individual's consumption habits and his contributions to rising global temperatures. The essay will then examine objections to this thesis and offer possible responses to these objections.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter Singer's 1972 paper <i>Famine, Affluence and Morality&nbsp;</i>argues that we should prevent suffering and death if it is in our power to do so. Writing his paper in response to the suffering and deaths of 9 million individuals in East Bengal from \"lack of food, shelter and medical care,\" Singer argues that people living in affluent societies should work to prevent \"suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care.\"<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]</a> Singer arrives at such a conclusion based on three premises. The first premise that Singer raises is that \"suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care are bad.\"<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]</a> Singer argues that support for such a premise is unnecessary as this premise is uncontroversial.<a href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]</a> Singer's second premise is that \"If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.\"<a href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]</a> Singer supports this premise by raising the hypothetical example of a drowning child. He argues that if an individual walks past a child drowning in a pond, the individual is morally obligated to swim into the pond and save the child. Problems like dirtying one's clothes are insignificant compared to the child's death.<a href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]</a> Singer argues that an individual should donate as much money as possible to the Bengal refugees until the point when the donation of money will harm himself or his dependents.<a href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]</a> The third premise is that it is within our power to prevent suffering from lack of food, shelter and medical care.<a href=\"#_ftn12\">[12]</a> Singer supports this third premise by highlighting that there are effective charities like the Bengal Relief Fund that can effectively utilise the money people donate to support refugees in East Bengal.<a href=\"#_ftn13\">[13]</a> Hence, based on the soundness and the validity of this argument, Singer concludes that we ought to prevent suffering and death from a lack of food, shelter and medical care since it is within our power to do so.<a href=\"#_ftn14\">[14]</a></p><p>The premises and conclusion that Singer arrives at in his paper can be applied to the concept of individual action on climate change and whether individuals are morally required to change their consumption habits to reduce an individual's consumption habits. The premise that \"suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care are bad\" can be applied to the suffering caused by rising global temperatures due to global carbon emissions. In 2022, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its annual report highlighting that an increase in global temperatures will result in up to five times as many global heatwaves, floods, and fires. Currently, 3.3 billion people, particularly those living in developing countries, are highly exposed to the impacts of climate change and are fifteen times more likely to die from disasters caused by rising global temperatures. Furthermore, many people are also at risk of starvation due to rising global temperatures, creating problems for crop growth. People are also being displaced from their homes due to rising global temperatures, making their homes uninhabitable. By 2050, 1 billion people will be exposed to coastal flooding, and land exposed to wildfires will increase by up to 35%.<a href=\"#_ftn15\">[15]</a> Thus, the deaths and suffering caused by rising global temperatures are bad. Such a premise is considered uncontroversial.</p><p>Singer's second premise, \"If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it,\" is similarly applicable to individual action on climate change. Singer's hypothetical example that an individual who walks past a child drowning in a pond is morally obligated to swim to save the child is likewise applicable to changing one's consumption habits to reduce carbon emissions. In this case, the example is no longer hypothetical as an individual who changes his habits to reduce carbon emissions is literally saving not one but many children who are at risk of drowning from floods caused by rising global temperatures, among other disasters caused by global warming. Thus, there is strong support for the second premise. The actions an individual can take to reduce the carbon emissions of his consumption habits are simple and at little cost to the individual. These actions include switching off electrical appliances when not in use, using fans instead of air-conditioners, switching off water taps when brushing teeth and air-drying clothes in the sun instead of using a dryer.<a href=\"#_ftn16\">[16]</a> These actions may cause some discomfort and inconvenience to an individual. However, such mild discomfort and inconvenience are of much less moral importance as compared to the deaths and suffering caused by rising global temperatures. Hence, Singer's second premise is applicable to individual action on climate change as the discomfort from changing one's consumption habits to reduce one's carbon emissions is of much less moral importance than the suffering and death caused by rising global temperatures.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Singer's third premise that it is within our power to prevent suffering and deaths also applies to individual action on climate change. The average American household contributes about 24,000 pounds of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from its consumption habits. Each household can cut up to half its carbon emissions if it changes its habits to be more environmentally friendly.<a href=\"#_ftn17\">[17]</a> If everyone changes their consumption habits to reduce their carbon emissions by half, we can halve the 20% of carbon emissions from global carbon emissions that come from consumers, and global carbon emissions would fall by 10%. Furthermore, while corporations make up 80% of global carbon emissions, many of these corporations' carbon emissions are indirectly caused by consumers' consumption habits. These include corporations that produce products that households consume and corporations that transport products to households, including airlines and shipping companies. Only 10% of carbon emissions from corporations come from corporations that extract fossil fuels, while the other 90% of carbon emissions come from corporations that supply households with products they consume.<a href=\"#_ftn18\">[18]</a> Hence, if individuals were to reduce their consumption or change to consuming products that require minimal carbon emissions to produce, they would indirectly reduce the carbon emissions from corporations globally. Hence, it is within individuals' power to reduce global carbon emissions and prevent the deaths and suffering caused by global warming, providing strong support for Singer's third premise.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, this paper has argued that Singer's three premises can be applied to individual action on climate change as they have strong support and are sound when applied. Hence, because of the validity of his argument, the same conclusion that \"we ought to prevent suffering and death from a lack of food, shelter and medical care\" can likewise be applied to individual action on climate change. It would be valid and sound to argue that individuals are morally obligated to change their consumption habits to reduce carbon emissions to prevent suffering and deaths caused by rising global temperatures. Subsequently, this paper will consider and respond to objections to the conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>One objection to such a conclusion is that people are unaware of the deaths and suffering caused by rising global temperatures. Such an objection may go along the lines that there are few signs of changes in the environment in some countries, and people living in these countries are unable to observe the impacts of rising global temperatures. For example, people living in developed countries are less impacted by climate change, as compared to those living in developing countries with poor infrastructure to respond to the changing environment.<a href=\"#_ftn19\">[19]</a> Hence, people in developed countries may argue that they are unaware of rising global temperatures as they cannot observe significant environmental changes. However, people who raise these objections cannot raise such an objection and claim ignorance, considering the widespread publication of climate reports and many activist campaigns to raise awareness of changing global temperatures. Such reports and campaigns are based on empirical scientific research. Hence, individuals cannot feign ignorance over the impacts of global warming.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar vein, even if an individual is aware of the impacts of rising global temperatures, he may object to the conclusion by arguing that people impacted by rising global temperatures are not in their immediate surroundings. As the people who will suffer the worst effects of climate change live in developing countries halfway across the world or are part of future generations in decades to come, some people in developed countries may argue that it is not their business to help these people. Such an argument is based on the logic that we are only morally obligated to prevent suffering and death if they are in close proximity to us, whether geographical or time-based. However, as Singer highlights, the second premise makes no distinction based on proximity or distance. The second premise implies a principle of impartiality and universality when deciding whom we should save from suffering and death.<a href=\"#_ftn20\">[20]</a> If the child drowning in the pond is in a pond that requires an individual to swim a greater distance from the bank of the pond, he is still morally obligated to save him. Similarly, if an individual knows that a child with no experience in swimming is going to swim in a pond in two hours and will likely drown, he is also morally obligated to prevent that child from swimming in the pond. Hence, we are morally obligated to change our consumption habits to reduce our contributions to global warming, even if the people suffering from the impacts of rising global temperatures are thousands of miles away from us or will experience these impacts decades in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Another objection that people may raise to the conclusion is that even if they change their consumption habits to reduce their carbon emissions, other people around them may not change their habits to reduce their carbon emissions. Furthermore, considering how many people are required to change their consumption habits before there is a significant reduction in carbon emissions, many argue that changing their consumption habits is inconsequential or insignificant, especially in light of the small amount each individual contributes to global carbon emissions. However, as Singer raises, the number of people that can prevent suffering and death should not matter. If an individual walks past a child drowning in a pond and several people around him can also save the child from drowning, it does not change his moral obligation to save the child from drowning.<a href=\"#_ftn21\">[21]</a> Even if an individual contributes a small amount to rising global temperatures, he still contributes to suffering and deaths globally and is still morally guilty. Contributing a small amount to global suffering and death does not absolve an individual from moral guilt. An individual is morally obligated to save the child drowning in the pond even though he only saves one life. Similarly, we are also morally obligated to change our consumption habits to reduce the rise in global temperatures, even if it may only save a few more lives. Furthermore, if large numbers of people change their consumption habits to reduce their carbon emissions, corporations are more likely to respond to these changes in consumption habits by changing to more environmentally friendly production methods.<a href=\"#_ftn22\">[22]</a> Hence, individuals cannot use the excuse that their consumption habits are insignificant as contributing a small amount to global carbon emissions still makes them morally guilty of contributing to suffering and deaths from rising global temperatures. &nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, this essay has argued that individuals are morally obligated to change their consumption habits to reduce their contributions to global carbon emissions and to prevent suffering and death caused by rising global temperatures. Using Peter Singer's argument in <i>Famine, Affluence and Morality,&nbsp;</i>this essay has used Singer's three premises to support this argument. First, this essay has raised that suffering and deaths caused by rising global temperatures are bad. This essay has also argued that if it is in our power to prevent the suffering and deaths caused by rising global temperatures without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we are morally obligated to do so. This essay then demonstrated that it is within our power to prevent suffering and death caused by rising global temperatures by making simple changes to our consumption habits. Hence, this essay has concluded that we are morally obligated to change our consumption habits to reduce global carbon emissions and to prevent suffering and deaths from rising global temperatures. The essay has then highlighted that individuals cannot argue that they are unaware of the impacts of climate change due to the widespread publication of reports and activist campaigns to raise awareness of the impacts of climate change. The essay has then highlighted that individuals are morally obligated to change their consumption habits even though the suffering and deaths are thousands of miles away or are many years in the future, as the second premise does not imply any difference in whether to prevent suffering and death based on proximity or distance. Finally, the essay has highlighted that even if other individuals do not change their consumption habits, an individual is still morally obligated to change his consumption habits as his actions still contribute to suffering and death from global rising temperatures, even if he only contributes to a small quantity of it.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Bibliography</u></p><p>Borenstein, Seth. \"U.N.

If we care about impartially doing good, then we should be especially concerned to ensure that the long-term future goes well, assuming that it is within our power to do so. Most longtermists focus on humans, and largely ignore animals. This is a mistake. In this paper I will show that the basic argument for longtermism applies to animals at least as well as it does to humans, and that the reasons longtermists have given for ignoring animals do not stand up to scrutiny. I will argue that, because of their numbers, their capacity for suffering, and our ability to influence their futures, animals ought to be a central concern of longtermists. Furthermore, I will suggest that longtermism is a fruitful framework for thinking about the wellbeing of animals, as it helps us to identify effective actions that we can take in the near future that have a reasonable chance of improving the wellbeing of animals over the very long term.</p><p>In Section 1 I will lay out the basic argument for longtermism and consider some of the reasons why longtermists have neglected animals. In Sections 2 and 3 I will show that the basic argument for longtermism applies to animals and that we can use the longtermist framework to identify interventions that have a reasonable chance of making the long-term future go better for animals. More specifically, I will argue that (1) now or in the near-term future humans can act in ways that will predictably increase or decrease the scale and duration of wild animal suffering in the long term and (2) we are in an especially influential time for locking in values that can be expected to be good or bad for domesticated animals in the long term. Finally in Section 4 I will suggest some longtermist interventions for animals that might be more effective than short-term alternatives and will suggest areas for further research.</p><p>For simplicity, I will assume a hedonistic theory of animal wellbeing, though nothing I say will be incompatible with the view that there are also important non-hedonic elements related to animal wellbeing. I will assume that all vertebrates have the capacity for sentience, and hence for positive and negative welfare. Although I will not have space to argue for this, I will assume the increasingly accepted view that the majority of animals in the wild live bad lives, that is, their lives contain more suffering than positive wellbeing.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0002\"><sup>2</sup></a> On the view I will assume, the typical wild animal\u2019s life is short, contains little or no positive wellbeing, and ends in a painful death. This is because of the structural features of ecosystems, such as antagonism, scarcity, and reproductive strategies, which are consequences of evolution by natural selection. Since wild animals outnumber domesticated animals many times over, and since wild animal suffering seems to be much more persistent than the suffering of domesticated animals, I will focus more on wild animals than on domesticated ones. However, I will also consider the effects of human practices on the wellbeing of domesticated animals over the long term.</p><h2>1 The Longtermist Framework</h2><p>Arguments for longtermism have generally focused on the potential value of the long-term future, though some have also given arguments grounded in our duties to previous generations.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0003\"><sup>3</sup></a> Though the future-focused arguments differ in their precise forms, all accept some version of these three central premises: the axiological premise that the intrinsic value of good and bad things is unaffected by their location in time, the first empirical premise that the future has the potential to be astronomically large, and the second empirical premise that there are actions we can take in the present and near future that have a significant chance of making the long-term future go better or worse. Putting these premises together with a principle of beneficence we can construct:</p><h3>1.1 The Basic Argument for Longtermism</h3><blockquote><p>(P1)<i>Temporal Neutrality</i>: the intrinsic value of good and bad things is unaffected by their temporal location. An hour of intense suffering is equally intrinsically bad whether it happens tomorrow or in a billion years, and the same is true of the value of good things. We cannot discount the intrinsic value of good and bad things solely because they are in the future.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0004\"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>(P2)<i>Big Future</i>: the long-term future has the potential to be astronomically large, both in duration and the number of individuals who may ever live. Since individual lives can be very valuable or disvaluable, the long-term future has the potential to be very valuable or disvaluable.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0005\"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>(P3)<i>Beneficence Principle</i>: in general, when we can do so without too high a cost to ourselves, we ought to help others and promote positive value in effective ways.</p><p>(P4)<i>Causal Efficacy</i>: there are actions we can take in the present and near future that have a significant chance of making the long-term future go better or worse.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0006\"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>(C)<i>The Longtermist Thesis</i>: we ought to take actions which we can reasonably expect will make the long-term future go well when those actions are more effective than the short-term alternatives.</p></blockquote><p>One might accept the first three premises but reject <i>Causal Efficacy</i>. One could either claim that there are no actions that can be expected to have a positive or negative effect on the long-term future, or that we simply cannot identify such actions. <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0030\">Tarsney (2020, 6\u20137)</a> has called the latter the epistemic challenge to longtermism. It may be that given the difficulties in predicting the long-term outcomes of our actions the best we can do is try to make the near-term future go well. Longtermism might then be an interesting claim about what we ought to value, but it would tell us nothing important about what we ought to do.</p><p>Longtermists have developed several conceptual tools which in principle allow them to identify actions that can be expected to have a positive effect on the long-term future, thus securing <i>Causal Efficacy</i>. The first is the concept of a persistent state. A persistent state is a state of the universe which, if made actual, can be expected to last for a very long time, perhaps indefinitely.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0007\"><sup>7</sup></a> A clear example of a persistent state is a state in which humanity has become extinct. Once humans go extinct that state of the universe will persist indefinitely.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0008\"><sup>8</sup></a> Another example is the state in which humanity has come under the domination of a global totalitarian regime the primary goal of which is self-perpetuation.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0009\"><sup>9</sup></a> Greaves and MacAskill use the concept of a persistent state to identify possible actions we can take in the present which will have positive effects on the long-term future despite the general difficulty in predicting such distant outcomes of our actions. They argue that (i) if there are a number of persistent states which could be actualized in the future, (ii) they differ in value, and (iii) there is something we can do now which makes it more likely that the more valuable state will be actualized, then we have identified an action which can be expected to have a significant positive effect on the long-term future. And it appears that all three conditions are met in reality \u2013 there are persistent states which differ in value, and humanity can influence the chances of our ending up in these states. Human extinction for example would be persistent, much less valuable than most of the states in which humanity survives, and human beings today have some influence on the probability of our entering that state.</p><p>Related to the concept of a persistent state is the concept of value lock-in. A value lock-in is a situation in which the values of humanity (or some significant subset of our values) become so entrenched that they become difficult or impossible to change.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0010\"><sup>10</sup></a> This is important because our values are a key determinant of what the future will look like, and if we lock in a set of suboptimal values then the future may end up being much worse than it could have been. <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0025\">Ord (2020, 153\u2013155)</a> gives several examples of value lock-ins which could plausibly make the long-term future go worse. These include humanity as a whole renouncing all further technological development, permanently failing to recognize some form of harm or injustice and hence perpetuating it blindly, or permanently locking in a single fundamentalist religion. Another way in which value lock-in might give rise to a sub-optimal future would be if a super-intelligent ai took control of the world and enacted whatever values that its designers had programmed into it.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0011\"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>Prominent longtermists have generally concentrated on humans and have had comparatively little to say about nonhuman animals. <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0018\">MacAskill (2022, 208\u2013213)</a> briefly discusses the welfare of present-day animals but says little about their future. <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0008\">Greaves and MacAskill (2021)</a> do not mention animals as a possible locus of longtermist concern at all. Bostrom (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0004\">2013</a>, footnote 23) briefly mentions the possibility that human beings might have a responsibility to help suffering animals in natural environments, and <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0025\">Ord (2020, 212\u2013213)</a> argues that, if humanity survives long enough, we can prevent the natural extinction of animal species over evolutionary timescales, and even transport terrestrial animal species to other planets to prevent their inevitable extinction when Earth becomes uninhabitable. Beckstead (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0002\">2013</a>, 10\u201311) explicitly argues on longtermist grounds that it is relatively unimportant to reduce the suffering of animals on factory farms.</p><p>This neglect of animals could have serious consequences for their wellbeing over the long term. Beckstead\u2019s argument is particularly concerning. He argues that reducing the suffering of animals on factory farms is relatively unimportant compared to helping human beings, because animals, unlike humans, cannot be expected to engage in activities that will improve the long-term future (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0002\">2013</a>, 22\u201323). The assumption here is that by benefiting currently existing people we both benefit them directly and make it more likely that they will engage in socially useful activities, thus generating indirect benefits for more people in the future. These indirect benefits may compound over time, thus outweighing the initial benefit to the original people. Benefiting animals does not provide such indirect benefits. Helping humans then is like investing in capital, with the expectation that the investment will pay off in the long run. Helping animals is like a moral cul de sac \u2013 whatever resources we invest into making animal lives go better will not be returned as animals are incapable of contributing meaningfully to the value of the long-term future. This argument ignores the fact that helping animals is not necessarily only of value in the short term. Effective ways of helping animals might have long-term positive effects too. Beckstead gives the example of giving pain relief to animals on factory farms. He may be right that this is of only short-term efficacy, helping only those animals we give the pain relief to, without any positive indirect effects. Abolishing factory farming altogether or replacing animal agriculture with synthetic meats is an entirely different matter. Stopping factory farming would not only help animals in the short term, but it would also prevent the suffering of many animals into the long-term future.</p><p>Beckstead (and perhaps other longtermists) may be assuming that animal agriculture is likely to be supplanted by synthetic animal products or plant-based agriculture in the near term, and so efforts by activists to abolish it can, at best, slightly speed up this inevitable transition. If this were true, then activism might not be an effective longtermist intervention. However, the abolition of animal agriculture is not inevitable. Though we may have the technology to do so soon, such a change depends not only on our technology, but on our values, and as MacAskill points out in his discussion of the abolition of slavery (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0018\">2022</a>, 62\u201370), we cannot assume that such moral progress is inevitable. It is possible that humanity might soon perfect the technology to create \u2018animal\u2019 products synthetically, yet due to suboptimal values they might continue to engage in animal agriculture indefinitely. For example, if humanity maintains speciesist values, and if consumers prefer \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018authentic\u2019 animal products to synthetic ones, then we may continue factory farming animals indefinitely despite having the technology to do otherwise. It is also possible that we will invent new ways to exploit animals. For example, developments in the technology of xenotransplantation may make the breeding of genetically modified animals for organ transplants commonplace. It is also already possible to create genetically modified immunodeficient animals for use in medical research. These are animals in which the immune system has been deliberately impaired so that they are more susceptible to various diseases, infections, or tumor growth, and hence more useful for the scientists researching these diseases.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0012\"><sup>12</sup></a> As our gene-editing technologies become more powerful it may be possible to create many more kinds of suffering animals for use in research. Finally, it is also possible that our moral values regarding animals get worse rather than better. If that happens, then we might exploit animals in ways that are unthinkable today. We cannot simply assume that moral progress in our treatment of animals is inevitable; rather we must ensure that humanity makes this transition by promoting values that are more friendly to animals. Furthermore, as I will argue in Section 3, we may be in a particularly important time in which to try to shift human values regarding animals. If this is correct, then morally informed activism for animals may be an extremely important longtermist concern.</p><p>Ord recognizes that we may have some duties towards animals, but seems to think of these as duties to animal species rather than to individual animals, and consequently his suggestions for how to help them are potentially harmful. Ord thinks that it would be a good thing for humanity to relocate animal species to other planets to ensure their survival once Earth becomes uninhabitable. If wild animals generally lived good lives, then spreading them beyond Earth might be a good thing. However, in recent years the problem of wild animal suffering has been increasingly recognized in the animal ethics literature. It is possible that most wild animals live bad lives, and if this is the case, then spreading wildlife to other planets might cause a huge amount of suffering for a very long time. I will discuss the problem of wild animal suffering (WAS) from a longtermist perspective in Section 3.</p><p>In Sections 2 and 3 I will argue that the basic argument for longtermism applies to animals. In Section 2 I will argue that we ought to be concerned about how the long-term future goes for animals by showing that <i>Temporal Neutrality</i> and <i>Big Future</i> apply to them. In addition, I will suggest two further considerations which make it particularly important to think about the long term for animals, based on our future capacities to help wild animals and the higher stakes for animals than for humans. In Section 3 I will argue for <i>Causal Efficacy.</i> Using the longtermist concepts of persistent states and value lock-in, I will argue that there are actions that we can take in the near term which have a reasonable chance of making the long-term future go better for animals. If these arguments are successful, then the longtermist thesis applies to animals.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0013\"><sup>13</sup></a></p><h2>2 Temporal Neutrality and Big Future</h2><p>It is difficult to see how <i>Temporal Neutrality</i> could apply to the wellbeing of humans but fail to apply to that of animals. For this to be the case there would have to be some relevant difference between human and animal wellbeing that makes it rational to think that future human wellbeing is as valuable as present-day human wellbeing but the same does not hold for animal wellbeing. It is difficult to imagine a candidate difference. As we saw above, Beckstead argues that, from a longtermist perspective, it might be less important to confer benefits on currently existing animals than on currently existing people, as the latter, but not the former, can contribute to improving the long-term future. This is a difference between benefiting humans and animals, but it is not the right sort of difference to make <i>Temporal Neutrality</i> apply in one case and not the other. This is because Beckstead\u2019s argument concerns the comparative instrumental benefits of conferring intrinsic benefits on people and on animals, but what we would need is an argument that allows us to discount the value of future intrinsic benefits for animals but not for humans. Since such a difference is not forthcoming, I will assume that <i>Temporal Neutrality</i> applies equally to animals, and that we ought to be as concerned about future animal wellbeing as present-day animal wellbeing. In fact, it might be the case that <i>Temporal Neutrality</i> applies even more strongly to animals than it does to people. One might think, for example, that some of the strength of our moral obligations towards other people alive today comes from the fact that we are enmeshed in special relations of various kinds. Some people alive today are our family and friends, some are fellow citizens, some are engaged in the same projects as we are. Some of these special relations can be expected to disappear over time, thus reducing the strength of our obligations towards future people to whom we are not so specially related. It is plausible however that our duties to animals are not based on any kind of special relationships, and so their strength does not diminish over time. If this is right, then while our obligations to future people might diminish somewhat as the relations between us weaken, the same is not true of animals.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0014\"><sup>14</sup></a></p><p>It also seems likely that the <i>Big Future</i> premise applies at least as well to animals as it does to humans. At present there are around 8 billion human beings on the planet, but we are outnumbered by other sentient vertebrate animals of whom there are at the very least 10 trillion (10^13) and perhaps more than a quadrillion (10^15) (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0032\">Tomasik, 2019</a>). On conservative estimates, then, animals outnumber human beings by between a thousand and a hundred thousand to one, but the true population of animals may be orders of magnitude higher. Bristlemouth fish alone may number in the quadrillions (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0037\">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, 2019</a>). This means that most sentient individuals are nonhuman animals. If we assume that animal and human populations will remain at the same ratio in the long term, then the long-term future has the potential to contain far more animal suffering and wellbeing than human suffering and wellbeing. If we are impartially concerned with maximizing wellbeing and minimizing suffering, then we ought to be very concerned about the long-term future of nonhuman animals on the assumption that they will continue to constitute the vast majority of welfare subjects. If <i>Big Future</i> inclines us to take longtermism for humans seriously, then it should also incline us to take longtermism for animals seriously.</p><p>It might be objected here that it is unlikely that animal populations will remain at their current levels. Animal populations might decline drastically and remain at low levels for the rest of our planet\u2019s period of habitability. In fact, it seems that wild animal populations have decreased dramatically in the past 50 years, as human development has reduced the habitats for many species, and this process might continue until relatively few wild animals remain. A 2020 report by the wwf suggests that there has been a 68% decline in the average populations of monitored vertebrate species since 1970. It must be borne in mind, however, that this report is concerned specifically with biodiversity, not with animal populations generally, and the findings of the report are compatible with global animal populations staying the same or increasing. For example, the report mentions invasive species as a major cause of biodiversity loss (2020, 22, 54) but if invasive species are replacing native ones this need not cause a net decrease in animal populations. Similarly, reductions in the numbers of large animals can be more than compensated for by increases in the numbers of small animals. Other causes of biodiversity loss more clearly seem to indicate general population declines, however. Future humans might also eliminate domesticated animal populations, for example by switching from animal agriculture to plant-based or synthetic alternatives. If this happens then the <i>Big Future</i> premise is not true of animals, and so the longtermist thesis does not apply to them.</p><p>In response, we cannot simply assume that animal numbers will drop significantly and remain low indefinitely. This will depend in large part on the values and actions of human beings over the coming centuries, and these are yet to be determined. Even if one were somehow certain that humanity will eventually drive all the other animals to near extinction, in order to do so humanity itself must survive long enough. <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0025\">Ord (2020)</a> puts the risk of human extinction within the next century at about 17%. Newberry (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0022\">2021</a>, 4) cites several experts on existential risk who also put the risk at around 20% in the next 100 years. If one accepts that there is a significant risk of human extinction in the next 100 years, then in order to maintain that there is a high probability that humans will drive animal populations to near extinction one would also have to believe that they will do so relatively soon, and that animal populations will never rebound after human extinction. Secondly, as we will see in Section 3, there are some ways in which humanity could ensure a long future for animals even if animals do eventually go extinct on Earth. Thirdly, if one believes that animals generally live good lives, or that they could live good lives with human assistance, then one ought to be concerned about animal extinction too, as this might reduce total wellbeing in the long term.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0015\"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>A more fundamental point is that longtermists generally think about the size of the future in terms of expected population, rather than in terms of the most likely outcome or the median across various possible outcomes.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0016\"><sup>16</sup></a> In essence this means that they generate high and low estimates for possible future populations then weigh them according to their probabilities thereby establishing a figure for the expected population. They find that, since human populations have the potential to be truly vast, the resulting figure is also vast, even when they account for the possibility of very low populations or total extinction. As Greaves and MacAskill say:</p><blockquote><p>Even a 50% credence that the number of future beings will be zero would decrease the expected number by only a factor of two. In contrast, a credence as small as 1% that the future will contain, for example, 1 trillion beings per century for 100 million years \u2026 increases the expected number by a factor of 100.</p></blockquote><p>The same consideration applies to the animal population \u2013 since it has the potential to be very large, we would need to have an unreasonably high degree of confidence that their population would decline to zero or near-zero in order to endorse a low figure for their expected population. But, if a high expected human population is sufficient to ground longtermist concern for human beings, then a high expected population of animals ought to be sufficient to ground longtermist concern for them too.</p><p>There is one final consideration relevant to the application of the <i>Big Future</i> premise to animals. Longtermists often bolster their case by arguing that human beings might one day colonize other planets, or that we might one day create human minds on computers, all of which would multiply the possible future population enormously.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0017\"><sup>17</sup></a> If we consider such huge expansions to the human population likely, but think it very unlikely that future animal populations will be expanded in the same way, then we might be justified in thinking that the vast majority of future sentient beings will be humans (or digital human minds) and so it is much more important to ensure that the long-term future goes well for them than for animals.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0018\"><sup>18</sup></a> That is, though the absolute number of animals in the future remains large, it would be dwarfed by the human population, and thus rendered irrelevant to our longtermist decision-making.</p><p>This is of course highly speculative. There is no reason in principle however why these technologies could not also multiply animal populations. <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#CIT0031\">Tomasik (2018)</a> speculates about the possibility that future human beings might choose to create digital worlds replete with sentient digital animals, perhaps in natural settings similar to those on Earth in which they might suffer greatly. Future humans might also choose to create digital minds in order to maximize hedonic wellbeing, and since animal minds are so much simpler than human minds they might do so by creating digital animal minds rather than digital human minds. A human brain contains around 86 billion neurons, while a mouse brain contains a mere 70 million. Assuming that the difficulty of creating a digital mind increases proportionally with the number of neurons required, then a utility-maximizing would-be digital mind creator might be advised to create digital mice rather than digital people. In Section 3 I will consider the possibility that humans might one day spread wild and/or domesticated animals to other worlds. Here I will only say that this possibility is not negligible, and in fact there are some ways in which it is much easier to spread animal life than human life, and so we cannot discount the possibility that animal populations will also be multiplied across physical and digital space. It is possible therefore that animal populations will be multiplied by these technologies just as human populations might be. Even if we think this unlikely, so long as we do not think it impossible, the huge numbers involved serve to increase the expected future animal population significantly.</p><p>Of course, it is extremely difficult to make accurate predictions about far future population sizes for humans or animals. There are so many known and unknown factors that could cause the population to increase dramatically, fall to zero, or anything in between. This uncertainty may count against the plausibility of longtermism generally but is <i>not</i> an argument against including animals in the longtermist framework. To show that <i>Big Future</i> is true of humans but not of animals it is not enough to point to the uncertainty about future population sizes. Rather, it must be shown that there is an asymmetry between humans and animals which means that, while the future human population is large in expectation, the expected future animal population is not. I have argued above that there is no such asymmetry \u2013 if we believe that the expected human population is large, we should think the same about the expected animal population. Furthermore, there are some factors which give us reason to expect a large animal population rather than a large human one. For example, humans are just one species among many. We are an exceptional species, and it is likely that we have the means to survive threats to our existence which other animals do not, and so perhaps we are less likely to go extinct than other species. However, there are millions of species on the planet. Though our likelihood of going extinct might be lower than that of any other species, it is unlikely that our chances of survival are greater than those of all other species on Earth combined. It may be the case then that humans go extinct while other animals live on indefinitely, thus ensuring <i>Big Future</i> for animals, but not for us. If it is unwarranted to be confident about the size of the future human population, it is doubly so to be confident that our population will increase and the population of animals will shrink or vanish.</p><p>Finally, there are two considerations that indicate that longtermism is particularly important for animals. The first concerns our current capacity to help wild animals, which is far more limited than it is likely to be in the future if we act today to ensure that we expand that capacity. It is presently possible to help wild animals in limited ways by vaccinating them against some diseases, leaving out food supplements in times of extreme scarcity, and rescuing and rehabilitating them when they are affected by natural catastrophes. The main causes of wild animal suffering, however, are systemic features of the natural world, primarily reproductive strategies, endemic scarcity, and various forms of antagonism, including predation, which we currently have little ability to influence. In order to seriously improve the lives of wild animals we need to develop our scientific knowledge of the causes of suffering and wellbeing in diverse species of wild animals, we need to understand how the various components of the biosphere interact so that we can better predict the results of our interventions, and we need to develop the technology to intervene safely and effectively. These developments may take decades or centuries to come to fruition. Those who are concerned with animal wellbeing might therefore think that it is important to begin the research work that will allow us to significantly help wild animals in the future.</p><p>The second consideration concerns the relative stakes for humans and animals in the future. The bad futures for humans considered by longtermists often involve premature extinction, or failure to reach full technological maturity. Futures like these are only \u2018bad\u2019 compared to the positive futures which we could have, but they are not intrinsically bad. Of course, there are possible futures in which human beings suffer significantly, for example if a sufficiently bad global totalitarian regime took over, or if a super-intelligent ai came to positively value human suffering, but these futures are relatively unlikely. The most likely futures open to animals on the other hand are intrinsically bad, in the sense that they involve large amounts of suffering for large numbers of animals over very long periods. Unlike humans, who have the intelligence and technological skill to solve the problems facing them, animals seem almost helpless against the natural forces that cause them to suffer. We might say that the default state of animals is to suffer. Since the most probable long-term futures are extremely bad for animals, we have additional reason to take measures today to try to change our trajectory to avoid those futures.</p><h2>3 Causal Efficacy</h2><p>In this section I will argue that <i>Causal Efficacy</i> applies to animals. By utilizing the longtermist concepts of persistent states and value lock-in, it is possible to identify some actions that we can take today that we can reasonably expect to make the long-term future go better or worse for animals. First, I describe WAS as a negative-value persistent state which, absent human intervention, we can expect to last for a very long time. I also describe some ways in which human agency could increase the scale and persistence of WAS. Second, I argue that there is a danger that humanity might lock in values which will make the long-term future much worse for animals by spreading and perpetuating animal exploitation, and by making future people less concerned about mitigating WAS. Furthermore, if it is the case that humanity will soon expand into space, then this is a very strategically important time at which to avoid locking in bad values.</p><h3>3.1 WAS as a Negative-Value Persistent State</h3><p>On Earth trillions of animals suffer and die painfully each year as a result of purely natural processes, while a much smaller number seem to live good lives. It is likely that the vast majority of lives lived by wild animals today are bad, and plausible that aggregate welfare across all lives on Earth is also negative.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0019\"><sup>19</sup></a> Furthermore, this does not seem to be an accidental feature of life on our planet; rather it is caused by structural features of evolution by natural selection, and so WAS is likely to continue to dominate animal wellbeing for as long as life on Earth continues to be governed by those processes. In fact, since these natural harms are the predictable result of natural selection, it is reasonable to think that similar outcomes will obtain on any planet on which sentient life evolves.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0020\"><sup>20</sup></a> It is difficult to quantify just how bad WAS on Earth is, but we can make some reasonable estimates. Extremely conservatively we can say that ten trillion animals die each year after enduring only 1 minute of net suffering. This would amount to approximately 18.2 million years of experienced suffering each year across all animals on Earth. If this does not sound that bad, remember that the degree of suffering that we are talking about is high \u2013 for example, being eaten alive or dying of starvation. This estimate is highly conservative in many ways. First, it takes the lowest estimate of wild animal populations. Second, it falsely assumes that the number of deaths per year is equal to the number of animals alive at any given time, but since the vast majority of animals are small short-lived ones who breed frequently and in vast numbers, the number of deaths per year must be much higher than this. Third, it assumes only one minute of net suffering. This may be true of animals such as small fish who are quickly eaten by predators immediately after hatching, but it must be remembered that many animals also starve, or die from disease, and even those who are killed by predators must sometimes endure more than a minute of suffering from being pursued and eaten more slowly. A reasonable higher estimate would be that there are a quadrillion deaths per year. If we assume again only one minute of net suffering each, that comes to 1.82 billion years of experienced suffering per year.</p><p>If we accept these arguments, it is clear that WAS is a negative-value state. It is also a highly persistent one. Sentient animal life has existed on our planet for around half a billion years, surviving numerous mass extinction events, and life itself has survived for around four billion years. While individual animal species come and go, sentient animal life is much more robust. Given that sentient animal life has already endured so long, it is highly likely that it will endure as long as Earth is habitable, another billion years or so. And since WAS is not an accidental feature of life on our planet, but emerges predictably from necessary structural features of natural selection, it is highly likely that as long as sentient life endures, suffering will dominate wellbeing, unless humans intervene.</p><p>There are actions human beings can take in the short term that alter both the scale of WAS and its persistence. If, for example, humanity goes extinct, this could both increase the scale of WAS by freeing up more land for animals thus increasing their population, and its persistence by removing the only technologically capable animal on Earth that might one day be capable of significantly reducing WAS.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0021\"><sup>21</sup></a> Somewhat surprisingly then, humanity\u2019s continued existence might be a good thing for wild animals.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0022\"><sup>22</sup></a> It is also possible that humanity will increase the scale of WAS by spreading animal life beyond Earth.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0023\"><sup>23</sup></a> This could be done directly, by bringing wild animals with us to establish a biosphere when we colonize other planets. We could also do this indirectly, by launching \u2018directed panspermia\u2019 missions aiming to spread microbial life throughout the galaxy in the hope that some of the microbes will survive and evolve on the target planets, eventually giving rise to complex biospheres with sentient animals. Such missions are possible using current-day or near-future technology, and they would be a relatively cheap way of spreading life throughout the galaxy.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0024\"><sup>24</sup></a> It is also possible that we will spread life accidentally, for example by failing to decontaminate spacecraft originating from Earth, thus introducing terrestrial microbes to other planetary bodies where they might eventually evolve into more complex sentient life. It is very difficult to completely decontaminate spacecraft, and essentially impossible to eliminate the millions of microbes that live on, and in, human astronauts. Some scientists have already suggested that contamination of other planets is inevitable, and this should be seen not as regrettable but as a good thing, with microbes forming a first wave of colonization of other worlds.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0025\"><sup>25</sup></a></p><p>Such actions would not only increase the scale of WAS by multiplying it across other planets, but they would also make it more persistent. Though life has survived on Earth for four billion years it is still possible that some global cataclysm might eliminate life on the planet. By spreading life to other worlds we would be increasing the chances that sentient life, and hence WAS, will persist for a very long time. Furthermore, even if no extinction event occurs, our planet has a finite period of habitability. Other planets may have longer periods of habitability than our own. It is also possible that we could spread life to planets which orbit stars like our own, but at an earlier stage in their development. WAS on Earth is bad, but human action could result in WAS that is vastly greater in scale and much more persistent.</p><p>The fact that humanity can make the long-term future worse for animals is sufficient to secure <i>Causal Efficacy</i>. It is also possible, however, for us to take actions that we can reasonably expect to make the long-term future go better for animals. We know the causes of WAS, and in principle it is possible for us to systematically intervene in the natural world to mitigate the suffering endured by animals, or even to enhance animals so that they are more likely to live happy lives. We already intervene in nature on an ad hoc basis to help wild animals, albeit for anthropocentric reasons. The ultimate causes of WAS, though, are genetic \u2013 most animals have evolved to have huge numbers of offspring, the vast majority of whom will die soon after birth, and many other animals have evolved to prey upon or parasitize other animals. To eliminate WAS, then, would likely require genetic editing of wild animals. It would also require extensive understanding of the functioning of ecosystems so that our interventions do not have unintended bad consequences. The precise nature of the interventions required must be determined by scientists, and the technology and understanding required for successful interventions are likely to be decades away. We cannot know at this point whether this will be successful. It might be the case that the best we can hope to do is to mitigate WAS somewhat. On the other hand, it might be the case that future science and technology will enable us not only to greatly reduce WAS, but to ensure that most animals have good lives. When we remember just how bad WAS is, and just how long it could last, however, it should be clear that even a slim chance of success has tremendous expected value.</p><h3>3.2 Value Lock-In</h3><p>Animals, whether wild or domesticated, are almost entirely at the mercy of human beings \u2013 whatever values we have will in large part determine their futures. The values held by most human beings today are disastrous for animals. Most humans are speciesists \u2013 they think it is acceptable to sacrifice the most important interests of animals in order to satisfy the most trivial interests of humans. This is most obvious when we consider the animals we exploit for food. If humanity maintains these anti-animal values, this will likely have very bad consequences for animals, as we will continue to dominate and exploit them indefinitely. Anything we can do to undermine speciesism, and to shift humanity to more animal-friendly values can be expected to improve the long-term future for animals.</p><p>Furthermore, we may be in an especially critical period regarding the impact on the future that our attitudes to animals could have. It is not unreasonable to think that humanity might begin colonizing space within the next century.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0026\"><sup>26</sup></a> If we maintain those speciesist values which underlie our mass exploitation of animals, it is possible that we may take domesticated animals with us and multiply our exploitation of animals across other worlds. Scientists have already made proposals for establishing systems of animal agriculture off Earth, and as our spacefaring technology develops, more such proposals may be made.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0027\"><sup>27</sup></a> If there is no shift in our values regarding other animals, it seems likely that we will continue to exploit them in space if it is technologically and economically feasible to do so. On the other hand, if we change our values regarding animals before we begin colonizing other worlds, then it is unlikely that we would take animals with us to exploit, given the technical challenges and costs involved. The possibility of human expansion into space brings a greater sense of urgency to abolishing our practices of animal exploitation. If we expand into space and colonize other planets before eliminating industrial animal exploitation, then colonists are likely to bring some domesticated animals with them. Once colonies are established on other worlds, cultural differentiation may be inevitable, so that even if we subsequently renounce speciesism on Earth, colonists on other worlds may retain speciesist attitudes.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0028\"><sup>28</sup></a> If that happens, then further colonization originating from these worlds may spread animal exploitation throughout the galaxy, even if the population of Earth abandons animal exploitation.</p><p>There is an opportunity then to lock in anti-speciesist values here and now, thus significantly reducing the probability of spreading animal exploitation to other planets. If we abolish animal exploitation before we begin colonizing space, this will reduce the possibility of spreading animal exploitation beyond Earth in two ways. First, all colonists leaving Earth would start out with anti-speciesist values, and all our colonies would have to revert to speciesist values independently. Secondly, colonies would have no stocks of domesticated animals as we would not bring any with us from Earth, and so obtaining animals to exploit on colony worlds would be much more difficult. It is possible that humans will begin colonizing other worlds later this century. Given this possibility, and the strategic advantage of locking in anti-speciesist values before expansion begins, this may be the most important time to promote anti-speciesist values. After colonization it may be too late to prevent the spread of animal exploitation throughout the galaxy. The expected value of efforts to shift human values away from speciesism may be much higher now than they will be after space colonization has begun. We are at a crucial point in the history of humanity, and the values that we settle on may determine the fates of countless animals.</p><h2>4 Longtermist Interventions for Animals</h2><p>In this section I will suggest some interventions that present-day or near-future humans can take in order to increase the likelihood of the long-term future going well for animals. These suggestions are tentative, however \u2013 much more empirical research is required to determine how effective they would be. Nevertheless, they are sufficient to demonstrate that longtermism may be a fruitful framework for thinking about animal wellbeing. Some of these interventions have the potential to be highly effective, perhaps more so than the best short-term interventions, and people concerned with reducing the harms suffered by animals should consider them. Furthermore, some of these interventions are scarcely even conceivable on a more short-term focused framework. Though these suggestions for improving the long-term future for animals are highly speculative, the same is true of most longtermist suggestions for improving the human future.</p><h3>4.1 Reducing the Likelihood of Spreading WAS</h3><p>One of the easiest ways in which humanity could make the future worse for animals is by spreading wild animal life to other planets, where natural selection will almost inevitably result in mass suffering. As we saw in section three, this could be done deliberately by direct colonization or by launching directed panspermia missions, or accidentally, by contaminating other planets with microbial life. To see how bad this could be, let us imagine that we spread life to just one other planet, and that sentient life will survive there for a billion years. Taking my most conservative estimate for the amount of WAS on Earth each year and multiplying that by a billion years we get 18.2 quadrillion years of animal suffering for one planet. If there is some action we can take that reduces the chances of spreading wild animal life to one other planet by just 0.1% that action has an expected value equivalent to preventing 18.2 trillion years of suffering. I have calculated elsewhere that the annual suffering of animals we exploit for food comes to about 16 billion years every year.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0029\"><sup>29</sup></a> Reducing the probability of spreading WAS to one other planet by 0.1% has an expected value equivalent to stopping all suffering caused by exploiting animals for food on Earth for over a thousand years. One could of course question my calculations here. However, it should be borne in mind that I have been extremely conservative in my estimates of the amount of WAS experienced annually on Earth, and in my presumption that whatever action that we take to prevent the spread of WAS would only prevent its spread to one planet.</p><p>Taking the figures I have given at face value, it is at least plausible that such interventions might be more effective than most short-term ones. Of course, we will not know how effective they might be until we know exactly what form they will take, how much they will cost, and how the cost/benefit ratio compares to short-term interventions on behalf of animals, all of which must be the subject of empirical work. Tentatively I suggest the following:</p><blockquote><p>(1) strict legal controls over space technology, enforced by a suitable international body which prohibits spreading nonhuman life to other worlds, whether directly or via indirect methods such as directed panspermia, and which enforces</p><p>(2) strict decontamination procedures for spacecraft originating from Earth, whether they are scientific, exploratory, or industrial, thus lowering the risk of accidental contamination</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4.2 Reducing WAS on Earth</h3><p>It may be possible for humanity to develop the science and technology required to safely intervene in nature to remove the causes of WAS and thereby reduce the suffering of wild animals, perhaps to the point at which most animals live net positive lives. If such interventions were successful and long lasting, they could make the long-term future far better for animals. It is difficult to say exactly how good such a future might be, but I will attempt a very rough estimate. Again, taking my conservative estimate of the amount of net WAS on Earth (18.2 million years per year) we can imagine that a successful intervention program would eliminate this suffering, and replace it with the same amount of mild positive wellbeing, giving us a net of 18.2 million years of mild wellbeing distributed across all wild animals on Earth each year. If we imagine this state enduring for the remainder of Earth\u2019s period of habitability, this comes to 18.2 quadrillion years of wild animal wellbeing. Even a tiny chance of success would have a very high expected value in terms of reducing suffering and promoting positive wellbeing for vast numbers of animals.</p><p>Reducing WAS on Earth is likely to be much more difficult and costly than preventing the spread of WAS to other planets, and at this point it is not possible to say how cost-effective such interventions would be compared to other long- or short-term interventions on behalf of animals. There are some considerations which do favor an interventionist program, however. First, though likely to be expensive, most of the costs will be at the research and development stage \u2013 the interventions themselves are likely to be automated processes rather than a continual hands-on process of \u2018policing\u2019 nature. For example, gene drives can be used to spread desirable traits through the animal population, and once developed and released into the target population, the rest of the process is automatic.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0030\"><sup>30</sup></a> If we consider the costs of research and development to be fixed costs which will continue to benefit wild animals indefinitely, then such research may in fact prove highly cost-effective. Secondly, at least some interventions in nature are highly persistent in the face of natural changes, so they would remain effective for a very long time even if human beings were no longer around to maintain them.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0031\"><sup>31</sup></a> Finally, if humanity ever does manage to intervene in nature so effectively that most animals in fact have good lives, there is no reason in principle why we could not then utilize this knowledge and technology to spread happy animal life to other planets, thus multiplying the positive welfare effects across many worlds. I suggest:</p><blockquote><p>(3) investing in the research and development of the technology required to safely help wild animals on a large scale</p><p>(4) supporting efforts to reduce existential risk to humanity, since without human beings there is little prospect of WAS being eliminated</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>4.3 Shifting to More Animal-Friendly Values</h3><p>It is plausible that speciesism underlies our willingness to exploit nonhuman animals. It is unclear to what extent speciesism can be combated, and what the best methods of doing so are. The rise of veganism gives grounds for optimism though. Furthermore, research has shown that speciesism is related to other prejudices like racism and sexism; if the latter have declined over time then it might be possible to reduce the former too.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0032\"><sup>32</sup></a> Finally, several studies have shown that speciesist attitudes emerge between the ages of 11 and 18, and that they are socially acquired, and thus it seems that it ought to be possible to educate children differently so that they adopt more animal-friendly values instead.<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0033\"><sup>33</sup></a> Therefore I suggest:</p><blockquote><p>(5) promoting anti-speciesism and/or moral circle expansion<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0034\"><sup>34</sup></a></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, it is plausible that speciesism also underlies humanity\u2019s general lack of concern for WAS and resistance to the idea of intervening in nature on a large scale to reduce it, though I am not aware of any research on this question. In any case, I suspect that speciesism is only part of the explanation for our indifference to WAS. It is also likely that most people are simply ignorant of the scale and severity of WAS. I suggest:</p><blockquote><p>(6) education on WAS, and attempting to move the general public away from valuing nature in a purely holistic fashion and towards an appreciation of the value of individual sentient animals</p></blockquote><p>I do not pretend to have shown that these interventions would be effective \u2013 much more research is required to determine their feasibility and cost-effectiveness. However, they may be a promising place to begin research into longtermist interventions on behalf of animals. Furthermore, I hope that these suggestions are plausible enough that animal advocates who are not longtermists may at least consider the utility of adopting a longtermist framework when thinking about how to promote animal welfare, both because they have the potential to be effective, and because some of the proposed interventions are scarcely even conceivable within a short-termist framework.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I have argued that the longtermists\u2019 neglect of animals is a serious mistake. It may also be a mistake for animal ethicists to ignore the long-term future. The basic argument for longtermism applies at least as well to animals as it does to humans, and the longtermist framework may be a useful way of identifying highly effective interventions to improve the wellbeing of animals into the long-term future. Much more research is required to determine which interventions would be most effective, and how they compare with short-term or human-focused ones. Finally, there are many important questions relating to the long-term future of animals that I have not addressed here. For example, there may be important non-hedonic values relating to animals that we might want to promote in the long term, such as the esthetic value of biodiversity or of having a wide variety of forms of sentient happy animal life. We may also have some duties to make the long-term future better for animals which are grounded in the past. As Ord suggested, we might want to try to \u2018make amends\u2019 for our past mistreatment of animals, though by considering individual animals rather than species, and with an awareness of the scale of WAS. Or, given the hundreds of millions of years of animal suffering which were necessary for the evolution of our species, we might think that we have reason to make the future better for animals, so that, in Parfit\u2019s words, \u201cthe existence of the Universe will have been on the whole good.\u201d<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jmp/aop/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296/article-10.1163-17455243-20234296.xml#fn0035\"><sup>35</sup></a> The history of sentient life may be only just beginning, and we ought to use our influence to ensure that it goes as well as possible.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>For very valuable feedback on multiple drafts of this paper I would like to thank Guy Kahane, Jeff McMahan, and Oscar Horta.

But like all other industries that put the public at risk, AI must be regulated.

AI companies are racing to automate increasingly many human capabilities of economic and strategic relevance (a phenomenon that manifests as the rapid replacement of human occupations), with the ultimate goal being the creation of superintelligent AI that outperforms humans at most such capabilities. This is particularly concerning given that the scientific problem of how to control AI remains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/tech/hinton-tapper-wozniak-ai-fears/index.html\"><u>unsolved</u></a>. Legislative action rooted in democratic mobilization is necessary to ensure that this dangerous, unaccountable AI race does not replace us humans. Instead, AI should augment us humans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The AI industry will not make it easy for us. Money corrupts, and well-moneyed industries that cause harm to the public tend to mount sophisticated corporate influence campaigns, even to the point of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dr_park_phd/status/1712137843919737073\"><u>creating front groups</u></a> (for a detailed case, please read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06009.pdf\"><u>Park &amp; Tegmark, 2023</u></a>). These&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dr_park_phd/status/1712138137768431962\"><u>front groups</u></a> include legitimate-sounding organizations in the media sector, the research sector, and the nonprofit sector. While appearing legitimate, these front groups are designed to explicitly or implicitly silence the industry\u2019s powerless victims, by weakening efforts to bring these victims\u2019 stories to the attention of the powerful people who can protect them (the media, the governments, and the grassroots public).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On top of the EA community\u2019s existing efforts on AI safety, we at StakeOut.AI are excited to&nbsp;<strong>help inform the public about the truth</strong>\u2014the truth about AI companies\u2019 dangerous, unaccountable race towards superintelligent AI. The stakes (economic replacement leading to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2024/01/can-humanity-survive-ai/\"><u>species replacement</u></a>, with rapidly shortening&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/\"><u>timelines</u></a>) are very high. And the magnitude of what needs to be achieved on the AI governance front is so large that while some past efforts have avoided grassroots mobilization (in favor of elite mobilization),<strong>&nbsp;</strong>we at StakeOut.AI think that grassroots mobilization may be able to augment the elite-mobilization approach that has traditionally dominated the AI safety landscape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>StakeOut.AI's Theory of Change</h1><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/sGGRScGKMFdcjh9kZ/ra4wyxsrxwptvqnym7hd\"><figcaption>Our Theory of Change (ToC)</figcaption></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Our apology for not following the protocol of estimating the expected value</h1><p>Having said this, we sincerely apologize that we do not have a probability statement nor a clear cost-effectiveness analysis, as might be expected in an introductory post.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The truth is, there are no guarantees.</p><ul><li>We cannot guarantee that the global grassroots movement will create enough external pressure to compel governments to no longer ignore the voices calling for regulated AI\u2014this could potentially accelerate the law-making process and prevent further AI-driven harms.</li><li>We also cannot promise that the global grassroots movement will be the force that ultimately unites people to heed the warnings of all the experts in the field about the potential threat of human extinction by superintelligent AI\u2014this could possibly pressure governments to act quicker upon seeing just how many people care about this issue from a single petition.</li><li>Of course, we cannot claim that the correct AI laws will definitively establish safeguards with 100% certainty, deterring Big Tech companies from continuing to develop superintelligent AI\u2014there is a chance that any company can choose not to comply with the laws in the countries where they operate.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But imagine if the AI existential risk problem is truly resolved because of the right AI laws being implemented before the birth of superintelligent AI, and we can all breathe a sigh of relief. Knowing the dedication of the EA crowd, after this short break, the hardworking EAs will then look for other major problems like climate change to tackle for the greater good, putting AI-driven human extinction behind us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What we can promise you is that we will do our best to:</p><ul><li>Get the petitions signed to hit critical mass and become real pressure points</li><li>Understand to the best of our abilities which are the right AI laws to push (e.g. responsible scaling policies would probably not be a good idea, and identifying safety washing)</li><li>Bring the massive number of signatures of people who care about these issues to lawmakers who can effect change</li><li>Be consistent, use understandable language, and make similar asks when talking to policymakers to avoid causing confusion</li><li>Control the message by getting people to refer back to the movement website, discouraging the use of shortened posts on social media as the full message (being careful of the message being taken out of context)</li><li>Monitor the risk of polarization both within nations and between countries</li><li>Be on the lookout for regulatory capture in the proposed laws (which would favor big companies to keep smaller companies out)</li><li>Be careful not to misrepresent things (especially when referencing other people\u2019s papers)</li><li>Be clear about lines like even though AI is good, we cannot accidentally push effective accelerationism</li><li>Be open to collaboration and feedback from 'inside game' people, to ensure that implementing the right AI laws would be feasible</li><li>Stay connected with the latest happenings on the AI policy landscape so as not to push the 'button' before the capacity building side is ready</li><li>Set the expectation while working with policymakers that there is no single bill they can write that will solve everything all in one go. It will take lots of research and evaluation, and further amendments will be necessary so we need to keep the door open</li><li>Be upfront about caring for the multiple aspects of AI risks, not just job loss or deepfakes, etc. (so there is no bait and switch, or feelings of being tricked)</li><li>Think about the possibility of increasing the AI arms race dynamics</li><li>Consider the impact that AI could make if controlled or deployed by extremists&nbsp;</li><li>Stay true to our message no matter who we are talking to<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>We thank all feedback providers from the bottom of our hearts</h1><p>The AI industry has access to substantial amounts of money\u2014and with that money, sophisticated corporate influence campaigns designed to reduce the effectiveness of nonprofits like StakeOut.AI. Barring something like the AI industry being outlawed entirely, we at StakeOut.AI can never compete with the AI industry in terms of money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On top of this, it's actually quite daunting to witness firsthand the influence that those with power and status can exert, even within a do-good movement like EA. We have spoken to over 100 EAs individually in one-on-one situations. Many of them have voiced their support for what we are doing in these private conversations, in addition to the amazing red-teaming feedback we openly received (some shared above). <strong>We thank you from the bottom of our hearts</strong> because many of these short 30-minute conversations, and even some 20-minute conversations, were&nbsp;<strong><u>PIVOTAL</u></strong> in contributing to and shaping our nonprofit\u2019s strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, we found out that even though we want to shout our gratitude to the mountains for some of these people, we were advised by another nonprofit co-founder here in EA to \u201calways err in favor of not mentioning specific names or asking for explicit permission to mention their names.\u201d In the for-profit business world where I used to work, there have been many instances where the most groundbreaking advice came from short conversations during conferences. A nugget of wisdom dropped by someone much more experienced in a conversation as brief as 10 minutes had actually dramatically improved the direction of different business initiatives. In those instances, the providers of such advice more than welcomed the shout-out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But from what we have gathered, grassroots approaches for AI safety have been arguably considered taboo in EA during the last few years, even to the point where people fear that being seen as supporting a grassroots AI safety movement might jeopardize one\u2019s career, status, and future in EA. It's unfortunate how being associated with the strategy of grassroots mobilization can tarnish one\u2019s reputation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We fully understand that since we are not posting from anonymous accounts, we may face potential repercussions in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All that to say\u2026 Since we don\u2019t have time to directly reach out to the numerous people we want to thank for their significant contributions (and also not to put you in an awkward position by being publicly seen to support an AI safety effort opposed to the norm), <strong>we can only thank you in silence</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of you, we have successfully motivated members of the general public to put their names behind their support for the #WeStakeOutAI movement. It\u2019s also due to your support that we have received such positive feedback from the public for what we are doing - so much feedback that we haven\u2019t even had time to add onto our website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Thank you for your anonymous support</strong> as we advocate for safe AI, going against the tide in more ways than one. We are working day and night to push our community in a direction where every one of us feels like we can say the truth, rather than being pressured into silence.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>We need&nbsp;<i>your help</i> to effectively protect humanity</h1><p>We know from the FTX debacle that&nbsp;<strong>money corrupts</strong>\u2014that conflicts of interest can impair the epistemics of even very smart, very well-intentioned people in the EA community.</p><p>But we at StakeOut.AI refuse to accept this status quo as a given.

Here I\u2019ll make a proposal for a specific moral trade.</p><p>I think moral trade is an underexplored topic with significant opportunity for gains.&nbsp; The lowest-hanging fruit seems to be the synergy between animal welfare groups and climate groups.&nbsp; Both accept alternative proteins as one of the best uses of marginal funding (GFI is a top-rated charity by both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-good-food-institute/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/good-food-institute%3A-recommendation\"><u>Giving Green</u></a>).</p><h3>Proposal</h3><p>I am proposing trade between funds run by these groups.&nbsp; On one side, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/charities/giving-green-fund\"><u>Giving Green Fund</u></a>, and on the other side,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charity-fund/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators Recommended Charity Fund</u></a>.</p><p>The Giving Green Fund has distributed funds to its top charities twice.&nbsp; The first time, this past summer, each organization received $50,000, and $50,000 was saved for later.&nbsp; The second time, at the end of 2023, the funds were not evenly distributed.&nbsp; They sent $100,000 to Industrious Labs, $70,000 to Good Food Institute, and $50,000 each to Good Energy Collective, Evergreen Collaborative, and Clean Air Task Force.&nbsp; The justifications, with very transparent reasoning, are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/post/announcing-ggf-first-disbursements\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/post/giving-green-fund-2023-q3-and-q4-disbursements\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp; So while the uneven distribution may make counterfactual trust harder to build, the clarity in the process should largely counteract that effect.</p><p>The ACE fund has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charity-fund/\"><u>consistently distributed</u></a> money to top charities and standout charities, including GFI, in consistent ratios.&nbsp; Recently they\u2019ve switched to a binary recommended or not recommended status for charities, so it seems reasonable to assume that they would allocate money from the fund evenly between all of the recommended charities.</p><p>Normally high cost-effectiveness ratings would harm counterfactual trust and discourage actors from engaging in moral trade, but in this case, both funds have a fairly strong track record of systematically allocating funding, so determining the counterfactual is relatively easy.</p><p>I would advocate for both funds to redirect an additional $50,000 from their other funded nonprofits to GFI as a first moral trade.&nbsp; Both can contribute an equal amount because they have roughly equal relative cost-effectiveness estimates.&nbsp; I estimate that a 95 to 100% surplus should be generated from this trade (i.e. both worldviews will get 95 to 100% more moral value from those $50,000 than they would have gotten had they simply donated to the alternative top charity without trade).&nbsp; You can see my calculations&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPU6TP7-WSAXB3loiIBuOGWVfCqK64Bmc-LMvHMIB7A/edit#gid=1542856370\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>It may make sense to make the reallocation smaller if GFI will have difficulty absorbing the marginal funding at similar levels of cost-effectiveness (though I doubt this will be the case, since they have an 8-figure&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/810840578_201912_990_2021030217779773.pdf\"><u>budget</u></a>).&nbsp; Another consideration is whether the other top nonprofits were relying on an expected donation \u2013 it\u2019s important to avoid messing up their plans.&nbsp; Terms could also be negotiated based on up-to-date cost-effectiveness estimates of both GFI and the alternate top charities.&nbsp; For example, Giving Green may find some of ACE\u2019s other recommended charities to be somewhat effective, making the trade less valuable for them, and meaning that they donate less.</p><p>The value generated here will come from both the moral trade itself, and from the information value of attempting to conduct a moral trade.&nbsp; A writeup about the execution may encourage others to take similar actions.</p><p>Giving Green did a quick review and was fine with my posting this, but did not have time to review it in detail before the day I scheduled to post and has not endorsed the idea.&nbsp; ACE did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp; I informed both organizations that I intended to post today a week ago, on Friday, February 9.</p><p>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/quentin-mot-1\"><u>Quentin Mot</u></a> for feedback on this post.</p>", "user": {"username": "Pete Rowlett"}}, {"_id": "Rbh9xHCyej4sL9jJx", "title": "Fatebook for Chrome: Make and embed forecasts in Google Docs", "postedAt": "2024-02-16T15:59:35.712Z", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DWFRBzK3rAH3HFDZr/fatebook-the-fastest-way-to-make-and-track-predictions\">Fatebook</a> is the fastest way to track your predictions.

The first cross-cultural study between modern East Asian and Inuit populations is conducted, as an epistemically sound ethnographic analogy for paleolithic Arctic populations, and a shared set of arctic adapted personality traits is proposed- a higher than average tendency of emotional control/suppression, harmony/cohesion, indirectness, self and social consciousness, reserve/introversion, cautiousness, and perseverance/stoic endurance. The proposed candidate Arcticist traits are tested for environmental causation in modern polar personnel psychology, using decades of personality research on workers, expeditioners, and military personnel who adapt to Arctic and Antarctic environments. Consistently replicated results support causation of polar climates in necessitating the proposed Arcticist traits for adaptive success, and such traits are generalizable and predictive of adaptive success even across modern European populations that temporarily live in polar climates. A theoretical framework for the universal principles of arctic psychological adaptation is introduced, a novel methodology for testing causation and formation of psychological adaptation to post-OoA environments is proposed, and previous popular theories on the roots of Eastern psychology are reexamined in the light of Arcticism theory.</p><p>---</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theseedsofscience.org/\"><i>Seeds of Science</i></a> is a scientific journal (funded through Scott Alexander's <a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-grants-results\">ACX grants program</a>) publishing speculative or non-traditional research articles.

I am on a walk in the Mendip Hills. It\u2019s warm and sunny and the air feels fresh. With me are around 20 other people from the Effective Altruism London community. We\u2019ve travelled west for a retreat to discuss how to help others more effectively with our donations and careers. As we cross cow field after cow field, I get talking to one of the people from the group I don\u2019t know yet. He seems smart, and cheerful. He tells me that he is an AI researcher at Google DeepMind. He explains how he is thinking about how to make sure that any powerful AI system actually does what we want it to. I ask him if we are going to build artificial intelligence that can do anything that a human can do. \u201cYes, and soon,\u201d he says,&nbsp; \u201cAnd it will be the most important thing that humanity has ever done.\u201d<br>I find this surprising. It would be very weird if humanity was on the cusp of the most important world changing invention ever, and so few people were seriously talking about it. I don\u2019t really believe him.</p><h3><strong>This is going to be bad</strong></h3><p>It is mid-Summer 2018 and I am cycling around Richmond Park in South West London. It\u2019s very hot and I am a little concerned that I am sweating off all my sun cream.</p><p>After having many other surprising conversations about AI, like the one I had in the Mendips, I have decided to read more about it. I am listening to an audiobook of Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom. As I cycle in loops around the park, I listen to Bostrom describe a world in which we have created superintelligent AI. He seems to think the risk that this will go wrong is very high. He explains how scarily counterintuitive the power of an entity that is vastly more intelligent than a human is. He talks about the concept of \u201corthogonality\u201d; the idea that there is no intrinsic reason that the intelligence of a system is related to its motivation to do things we want (e.g. not kill us). He talks about how <i>power-seeking</i> is useful for a very wide range of possible goals. He also talks through a long list of ways we might try to avoid it going very wrong. He then spends a lot of time describing why many of these ideas won\u2019t work. I wonder if this is all true. It sounds like science fiction, so while I notice some vague discomfort with the ideas, I don\u2019t feel that concerned. I am still sweating, and am quite worried about getting sunburnt.</p><h3><strong>It\u2019s a long way off though</strong></h3><p>It\u2019s still Summer 2018 and I am in an Italian restaurant in West London. I am at an event for people working in policy who want to have more impact. I am talking to two other attendees about AI. Bostrom\u2019s arguments have now been swimming around my mind for several weeks. The book\u2019s subtitle is \u201cPaths, Dangers, Strategies\u201d and I have increasingly been feeling the weight of the middle one. The danger feels like a storm. It started as vague clouds on the horizon and is now closing in. I am looking for shelter.</p><p>&nbsp;\u201cI just don\u2019t understand how we are going to set policy to manage these things\u201d I explain.</p><p>I feel confused and a little frightened.&nbsp;</p><p>No-one seems to have any concrete policy ideas. But my friend chimes in to say that while yeah there\u2019s a risk, it\u2019s probably pretty small and far away at this point.</p><p>&nbsp;\u201cExperts thinks it\u2019ll take at least 40 more years to get really powerful AI\u201d she explains, \u201cthere is plenty of time for us to figure this out\u201d.</p><p>I am not totally reassured, but the clouds retreat a little.</p><h3><strong>This is fine</strong></h3><p>It is late January 2020 and I am at after-work drinks in a pub in Westminster. I am talking to a few colleagues about the news. One of my colleagues, an accomplished government economist, is reflecting on the latest headlines about a virus in China.</p><p>\u201cWe are overreacting,\u201d he argues \u201cjust as we did with SARS. The government feels like it has to look like it\u2019s doing <i>something</i>, but it\u2019s too much.\u201c</p><p>He goes on to talk about how the virus is mostly just media hype. Several other colleagues agree.</p><p>I don\u2019t respond to this. I have a half-formed thought along the lines of \u201ceven if there is only a small chance that this becomes a big pandemic, it might be worth reacting strongly. The cost of underreacting is much greater than the cost of overreacting\u201d. But I don\u2019t say this. I am a little bit reassured by his confidence that all will be well.</p><p>A few weeks later, I come home to see my housemate carrying crates of canned food to his room. He has spent a lot of time on internet rationality forums and at their suggestion has started stockpiling. His cupboard is filled with huge quantities of soup. I think that this is pretty ridiculous. My other housemates and I watch him as he lugs the crates up the stairs to his room; we look at each other and roll our eyes.</p><h3><strong>It\u2019s probably something else in your life</strong></h3><p>It\u2019s Spring 2021. I am at a dinner hosted by a friend in south London. I am talking to an acquaintance, a PhD student studying machine learning at a London university. I ask him how he has been doing.</p><p>\u201cNot very good to be honest,\u201d he says glumly. \u201cI am pretty worried about AI and no one in my lab seems to take this seriously. They all think it\u2019s science fiction. It makes me feel really lonely and a bit crazy.\u201d</p><p>He looks dejected.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the ideas though. I think this thing is actually going to kill <strong>me</strong>! It\u2019s horrifying\u201d.</p><p>I commiserate with him. It must be hard to be surrounded by people who dismiss your ideas all day. I wonder if his anxiety has more to do with lock-down-exacerbated loneliness than with the whole AI apocalypse thing.</p><p>A year later we will see each other at another party and he will tell me that he has now quit the PhD and is feeling much better. He will say that he still thinks it\u2019s likely that AI will kill him.</p><h3><strong>No-one in my org puts money in their pension</strong></h3><p>It\u2019s Summer 2022, I am at a party in central London. I am talking to an AI alignment researcher in the kitchen. He is upbeat and is excitedly talking about some ideas that might ensure the alignment of superintelligent AI with human values.</p><p>\u201cWe just need to create this small AI that we can fully understand and verify is aligned\u201d he explains \u201cand then we use that AI to validate that the super huge massive superintelligence is aligned with our values\u2026. It\u2019s a bit like creating Godzilla to fight Mega-Godzilla!\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cThat is not a reassuring metaphor,\u201d I say,&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re not super hopeful, but we\u2019re trying\u201d he states, somehow still cheerfully.</p><p>Later in the conversation, he will explain that despite the government incentive systems, no-one at his place of work takes anything above the minimum possible pension. They all doubt they will need it.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, I will wonder if I should be putting less money into my pension.</p><h3><strong>Doom-vibes</strong></h3><p>It is February 2023. I now have a vague sense of impending doom most mornings. I\u2019m not sure why. It might be the combination of my pre-existing beliefs about the difficulty of AI alignment and the holy-shit-rapid-advances vibe that OpenAI has been producing. It might be that I have been reading post after post talking about the timelines to transformative AI and the probability of doom. Or all the people talking about how AI-alignment seems really hard and how there is a now a molochian race-to-the-bottom between AI labs to produce the biggest intelligence as quickly as possible.</p><p>The doom feeling might also be the mid-winter darkness and cold, alongside my general tendency towards anxious thoughts and feelings. It could also be that I am yet to secure future funding for the project that is my current livelihood. All I know is that I regularly feel hopeless.</p><p>Each morning, I go to the window of my East London flat. Many days I look out over the rooftops and picture the swarms of kill-drones on the horizon. Maybe that\u2019s how it will happen? That, or a mysterious and terrifying pandemic? I will see my friends freaking out about it on social media one day and then a day later my partner and I will be coughing up blood. Or maybe it\u2019ll be quicker. I\u2019ll be blinded by the initial flash of the bomb, then a fraction of a second of extreme heat before the end. The fear isn\u2019t sharp, just a dull empty sense that there is no future.</p><h3>Maths might help</h3><p>It\u2019s March 2023 and I am in my flat, talking to a friend. We have agreed to meet to spend some time figuring out our thoughts on the actual risk from AI. We have both been reading a lot about it, but still feel very confused so wanted to be more deliberate.</p><p>We spend some time together writing about and discussing our thoughts. I am still very confused. I mostly seem to be dancing between two ideas:</p><p>On one side there is the idea that the base-rate for catastrophic risk is low. New technology is usually good on balance and no new tech has ever killed humanity before. Good forecasters should need a lot of evidence to update away from that very low prior probability of doom. There isn\u2019t much hard evidence that AI is actually dangerous, and it seems very possible that we just won\u2019t be able to create superintelligence for some reason anyway.</p><p>On on the other side is the idea that intelligence creation is just categorically different from other technology. Intelligence is the main tool for gaining power in the world. This makes the potential impact of AI completely historically unprecedented. And if you are able to take the perspective of smaller groups of humans (e.g. many groups of indigenous people), powerful agents unexpectedly causing sudden doom is actually<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_of_Indigenous_peoples\"><u> </u><i><u>very very</u></i><u> precedented</u></a>. Oh, and the power of these things is growing extremely fast.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d my friend asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s your probability of doom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know\u201d I sigh, \u201cone part of me is saying this is all going to be fine, things are usually fine, and another part of me is saying that this is definitely going to be terrible.\u201d I pause\u2026.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe like 20%?\u201d</p><h3><strong>A problem shared is\u2026</strong></h3><p>It is Easter 2023 and I am at my aunt's house. We have just finished a large lunch and I am sitting at the dinner table with my parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. Someone asks me what I am working on at the moment. I explain the personal career review I am doing.</p><p>\u201cI want my career to be impactful, I want to help others\u201d I explain, \u201cAnd in terms of the positive impact I could have on the world, I am really worried about the risks from advanced AI\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>My uncle asks me why I\u2019m so worried.&nbsp;</p><p>I respond:</p><p>\u201cThese orgs have many billions of dollars in funding and are building things that are unimaginably powerful, on purpose. If something much smarter than a human can be built, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a reason why it won\u2019t be, it will be massively powerful. Intelligence is what allowed humanity to become the dominant species on this planet. It\u2019s the reason we exterminate ants, not the other way around. They are building something, that in terms of raw power could be to us as we are to ants\u201d</p><p>I go on\u2026</p><p>\u201cLots of people think that this might be enough; that the main risk is that we will build a thing, it will have goals that are different to ours, and then game over. That seems possible and scary. But humans don\u2019t even need to lose control for this to go very badly. Superintelligence is a superpower, and big changes to the global structure of power can be unpredictable and terrifying. So I don\u2019t know what happens next. It might be the worst wars imaginable or AI-powered global totalitarianism. But whatever does happen seems like it has a decent chance of killing us or making life for most or all of humanity terrible\u201d.<a href=\"https://seekingtobejolly.substack.com/p/no-one-in-my-org-puts-money-in-their#footnote-1-141549354\"><sup><u>1</u></sup></a></p><p>My family shows concern, maybe some confusion, but definitely concern. It feels relieving to express. I have always been stoical about my pain and anxieties. As a child and teenager, I never wanted to bother others with my stuff. It\u2019s nice to be able to express to them that I am scared about something. Talking about the risk of AI doom feels easier than discussing my career worries.</p><h3><strong>Hope</strong></h3><p>It is June 2023. In the months prior, the heads of the leading AI labs have been talking to world leaders about the existential risks from AI. They, along with many prominent AI researchers and tech leaders have signed a <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\"><u>statement</u></a> saying that \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\u201d.</p><p>Today I am hosting an event in East London on AI governance. I have lined up 8 speakers from the UK government, think tanks and academia, and around 70 people have turned up to watch. I\u2019m proud of my work organising the event, but am feeling pretty nervous and hoping it goes well.</p><p>To inspire discussion, I have created a graph on the wall by the entrance to collect and present attendee\u2019s views on AI. The two axis are \u201c<i>how long it will be until we have Artificial General Intelligence?\u201d </i>and \u201c<i>the</i> <i>probability of AGI catastrophe\u201d</i>. As people come through the door they add a post-it note to the place on the graph that approximates their viewpoint. Most people have put their post-its in a cluster centered at a 25% chance of catastrophe in around 20 years. I stare at the second largest cluster in the top left of the graph. Several people here think there is around a 75% chance of everyone being killed in around 7 years. I think about the kill-drones. I think about the flash of the bomb. I think about whether my pension is a waste of money. I think about the unreal shock of the first days of lockdown in 2020. I feel a pang of fear in my stomach.</p><p>I look around at the crowded room of people. They are snacking on the fruit and hummus I bought and are talking eagerly. I look with some trepidation at the lectern where I will soon be standing in front of everyone to introduce the first speaker. They will be talking positively and insightfully about how we could govern advanced AI and what policies and institutions we need to ensure AI safety. Right now I focus on my breath and try to let go of the fear for a moment. I start to walk towards the front of the room. I really, really, really hope that this goes well.</p>", "user": {"username": "tobyjolly"}}, {"_id": "99KphNoXj2bQBadBa", "title": "Discord space for people with FTX clawbacks/claims request", "postedAt": "2024-02-16T08:56:01.910Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>tl:dr;</strong> there is a support group for those dealing with FTX legal proceedings on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/MEYCEerNbR\">https://discord.gg/MEYCEerNbR</a></p>\n<p>A while back, I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Q26PZFpDdxJGGTFqA/looking-for-someone-dealing-with-the-ftx-clawbacks-etc\">asked this question</a> looking for anyone navigating the FTX \"clawbacks\" and related matters.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a wide disparity in vaccine distribution. Only 26% received a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Low- and Low-Middle-income countries (LICs and LMICs), as opposed to over 80% in high-income countries (HICs). Consequently, in future pandemics, LICs and LMICs would be at higher risk due to potential delays, spanning months to years, in gaining access to first-generation vaccines that effectively target prevailing strains. This risk underscores the importance of addressing inherent limitations for global health equity. Therefore, there is a critical demand to develop intracontinental preparedness capacity against pathogens with a high potential to cause epidemics in Africa rather than depending solely on external sources.&nbsp;Generally, vaccines have demonstrated constraints, such as elevated expenses and suboptimal immune responses. In that regard, bacteriophages (phages) have been used in phage-display technology that produces vaccines by presenting the targeted antigen on the phage surface. This technology capitalizes on the intrinsic attributes of phages, including their adjuvant potential, cost-effective production, and high stability.</p><p>Phage-based vaccines, with their adaptable platform, promise substantial benefits: a swift response to diverse bacterial infections with pandemic potential; a self-adjuvant nature that enhances immune responses; an ability to display multiple antigens; genetic plasticity and stability; and cost-effectiveness for mass production. Moreover, their safe, well-understood therapeutic use in humans renders them ideal for resource-limited settings. I plan to seek further capacity to learn more about how to develop a phage vaccine. To do this, I plan to develop a phage vaccine for Salmonella typhi. This is aimed at designing and evaluating&nbsp;<strong>A Phage-based typhoid vaccine, that will provide an adjuvant-free, low-temperature dependent and needle-free alternative for typhoid fever that can be suitable for use in rural communities</strong></p><h3>Why Salmonella typhi Phage-based vaccine?</h3><p>Typhoid fever infections pose significant public health challenges, particularly among children in low and middle-income regions such as Africa, Southeast Asia (including India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), East Asia, and South America. Although antibiotic therapy has proven effective in reducing the clinical progression of enteric fever and lowering the risk of death, the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of S. Typhi has substantially impacted the efficacy of antibiotic treatments, raising considerable public health concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To address this issue, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended two licensed vaccines, namely Vi capsular polysaccharide (ViCPS) and the live attenuated oral Ty21a, since 2008 for the control of typhoid. These vaccines have demonstrated safety and cost-effectiveness in various countries (Cook et al., 2008). However, the Vi polysaccharide-based vaccine is ineffective against S. Typhi strains lacking Vi polysaccharide, and the Ty21a vaccine requires three doses with 10<sup>9</sup> bacteria for sufficient immunity. Additionally, their moderate protection (50\u201370%) makes them unsuitable for infants under 2 years of age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, WHO introduced the Vi-TT conjugate vaccine as a pre-qualified vaccine against typhoid fever, specifically intended for use in India. The newer generation of typhoid conjugate vaccines is expected to offer higher efficacy, longer duration of protection, and suitability for administration to infants and young children. Notably, the carrier proteins in these conjugate vaccines do not originate from the salmonella proteome, and limited clinical experiments are available to validate these assumptions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite numerous research efforts aimed at identifying potential vaccine candidates (VCs) that could confer long-term immunity and robust protection against Salmonella Typhi, no promising VCs for typhoid fever infection have emerged from large-scale clinical trials. Consequently, ongoing endeavours focus on the continuous identification of additional vaccine antigens capable of eliciting optimal immune responses against typhoid fever infections and antibiotic-resistant isolates.</p><h3><strong>Theory of Change:</strong></h3><p>The overall impact of the career-building activity is to develop a phage-based vaccine against Salmonella typhi that will lead to&nbsp;<strong>improved well-being and a reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with typhoid fever</strong>. &nbsp;The rationale for this is that phages require less equipment to manipulate and have been used as potent vaccine platforms. Salmonella presents a low-hanging fruit to test the practicability of adopting this technology for use in Africa, although the pathogen does not have pandemic potential, it is endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. <strong>Developing a vaccine such as this will go a long way in increasing our capacity/skill to design or formulate a vaccine against pathogen X in the face of any outbreak. It will also bring about a vibrant and active phage research laboratory in Nigeria that would have the requisite skills to manipulate phages for endemic and pandemic pathogens.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; The project aims to design a <strong>phage-based vaccine that has a broad capacity to protect against major Salmonella pathogens, has a high immunogenicity, and does not require an adjuvant or needle for administration.&nbsp;</strong>To achieve this, the project <strong>intends to apply the reverse technology 2.0 approach to identifying potential epitopes/targets for vaccine design and incorporate these targets into the phages. Evaluate them using mice under different administration processes such as drying the phages in powder to increase their longevity and administering them using water.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Rough BOTEC &nbsp;on The potential of the effectiveness of a Salmonella phage-based vaccine</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Rough BOTEC</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Deaths</td><td>Morbidity</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>How much value will a Phage-based vaccine bring to Salmonella?</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>The Burden of Typhoid in Sub-saharan Africa</td><td>1.2m&nbsp;</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">29,000</td><td>Kim et al 2003&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated success of Conjugate Vaccine</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated DALY&nbsp; of Typhoid Fever</td><td>8.1Million&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Chen et al., 2003</td></tr><tr><td>Extimated DALY&nbsp; of Conjugated Typhoid Fever Vaccine</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">1,215,000</td><td>15% DALY in an outbreak scenarion&nbsp;</td><td>Philips et al.,2023</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">4,860,000</td><td>60% if most effective</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>How effective will the Phage-based vaccine be over the conjugated?</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">5,670,000</td><td>70% because of low cold storage facility</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Probability for success</h3><p>I will put this at 40%. Phage vaccine prototypes were developed during the COVID-19 pandemic (links to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-022-00481-1\">paper 1</a>, <a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01822-22\">paper 2</a>). Phage technology is recently been developed in Africa. My lab is pioneering this. I registered a charity dedicated to phage research, the lab is open to researchers across Africa. It hopes to serve as a phage bank. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Plan A: If I get funding to visit a lab</h3><p>I am seeking support for the opportunity to learn and develop this very important skill. So. The first plan is to seek funding. If I get funded, I hope to take a sabbatical leave to learn this. &nbsp;I will be glad to talk with you and hear more about possible funding sources for this career activity.</p><h3>Plan B: If I do not get funded to visit a lab</h3><p>This is a tricky one, but I am committed to learning. When I first heard about phages, I applied to visit several labs to learn phage techniques, but no one gave me the opportunity. So I decided to go to the lab and learn it myself. I went on to become the first lab to report a phage genome in Nigeria, and in the 2 years since coming into phage research, I have emerged as one of the leading phage researchers in Nigeria and Africa. I currently co-lead the African Phage Forum.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in the event, I do not get funded to visit a lab, I shall seek funding to self-train myself in my lab.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>My next career step in building the capacity to position myself in Nigeria for the next pandemic is to seek the capacity to learn how to design phage vaccines. I plan to use Salmonella typhi as a test pathogen. &nbsp;I hope I go ahead to become successful with getting support and funding. &nbsp;I will be glad to hear about opportunities, partnerships, or getting a sponsorship. Above all, I would like to hear what you think about this project idea. &nbsp;If you like to chat, feel free to reach out to me via <a href=\"mailto:eennadi@gmail.com\">eennadi@gmail.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>References</h2><p>Chen, J., ., 2023, May.

The TL;DR here is: trying to, \"do the most good\" is a simple idea that immediately gets complicated. Putting all complexity aside for a second, I thought about how the idea first made me feel\u2014and how it still makes me feel today.&nbsp;</i></p><p>When I was seven years old, I created my own belief system so I could feel safer. I conceptualised a kind of cosmic energy referred to as <i>the Universe</i>. The Universe was only a little powerful with limited control, but as its defining feature, it really cared about me. I was a favorite. It would try to nudge things in my direction. It would check on my thoughts often and with intense interest. It would rush in when I was sad, feel awful, and try as hard as possible to help.</p><p>As far as magical cosmic entities go, this is a pretty low bar. Reading minds and encompassing the entire world is hard, but trying to nudge towards something better? Caring? I could do that. This thing I clung to as a little kid was like, really achievable. I wasn\u2019t searching for some incredibly far-reaching, life-changing meaning that would click the whole world into place. Mostly, I just needed help.</p><p>This frame has informed much of how I orient towards doing good. If I had to list three beliefs I\u2019ve regarded as true throughout my whole life, they\u2019d be: suffering is real, I don\u2019t want conscious life to suffer, and the totality of what I\u2019ve felt in my heart on this Earth has been the greatest gift and too much. And for the too much, I needed help. That\u2019s all The Universe was meant to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as a kid making up a vague religion, I never imagined a kind of mystical world where help was always coming. It isn\u2019t, we all know that\u2014at least not right now. I\u2019ve sat on the bathroom floor alone for broken days, I\u2019ve missed a friend\u2019s call because I was asleep. And completely beyond what I know are experiences of pain, every minute, in people and animals. And too often help won\u2019t come.</p><p>A five year old will die of malaria and no one will have stopped it. Humanity could just end one day and no one will have stopped it. But we can try. We can try to use our resources; and not only can we try, but we can <i>try as hard as we possibly can. </i>We can even be incredibly smart about it; rigorous; principled; creative; excited; <i>ambitious</i>. We can, in some ways, do much more than the Universe I talked to before bed every night for 10 years. I\u2019ve never felt much pressure in that, just a lot of aching hope.&nbsp;And even when I start to feel bogged down in the complexity and uncertainty that shrouds any attempts to look at the world\u2019s most pressing issues, this central hope is something I return to. We can try. And to someone, maybe even to many, maybe even to <i>somewhere around as many as possible</i>, it might matter.</p><p>When I think about why I love the idea of trying to help the most people possible, that\u2019s what comes to mind. An opportunity. In expanding moral circles and pages of research on global health interventions and pages of schemes on preventing advanced AI from wrecking the world. And of course, tons of other things I don\u2019t know about. I\u2019ve never seen good be done perfectly or \u201cright\u201d, by me or anyone else (at least not at scale), but I would like to continue trying in the \u201cmost\u201d way I\u2019ve found so far. And I\u2019d like to continue coordinating around the attempt; learning how others try. For those I love and also those I will never know. And thank you to those who try for me, for the ones I love, even if you can\u2019t know.</p>", "user": {"username": "frances_lorenz"}}, {"_id": "h8rjgvp8tacJKnKXn", "title": "Summer Internships at Open Philanthropy - Global Catastrophic Risks (due March 4)", "postedAt": "2024-02-15T21:39:06.105Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We\u2019re excited to announce that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/our-global-health-and-wellbeing-and-longtermism-grantmaking-portfolios/\"><u>Global Catastrophic Risks</u></a> Cause Prioritization team at Open Philanthropy will be hiring several interns this summer to help us explore new causes and advance our research. We think this is a great way for us to grow our capacity, develop research talent, and expand our pipeline for future full-time roles. The key points are:</p><ul><li>Applications are&nbsp;<strong>due at 11:59 PM Pacific on Monday, March 4, 2023</strong>.</li><li>Applicants must be&nbsp;<strong>currently enrolled in a degree program&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>working in a position that offers externship/secondment opportunities</strong>.</li><li>The internship runs from June 10 to August 16-30 (with limited adjustments based on academic calendars) and is paid ($2,000 per week) and fully remote.</li><li>We\u2019re open to a wide variety of backgrounds, but expect some of the strongest candidates to be enrolled in master's or doctoral programs.</li><li>We aim to employ people with many different experiences, perspectives and backgrounds who share our passion for accomplishing as much good as we can. We particularly encourage applications from people of color, self-identified women, non-binary individuals, and people from low and middle income countries.</li></ul><p><strong>Full details (and a link to the application)&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/openphilanthropy/f137c128-c784-4eaa-aa26-0263aeddae61\"><strong><u>are available here</u></strong></a><strong> and are also copied below</strong>.</p><p>We hope that you\u2019ll apply and share the news with others!</p><h1><strong>About the internship</strong></h1><p>We\u2019re looking for students currently enrolled in degree programs (or non-students whose jobs offer externship/secondment opportunities) to apply for a research internship from June - August 2024 and help us investigate important questions and causes. We see the internship as a way to grow our capacity, develop promising research talent, and expand our hiring pipeline for full-time roles down the line.</p><p>We want to support interns as team members to work on our core priorities, while also showing them how Open Philanthropy works and helping them build skills important for cause prioritization research. As such, interns will directly increase our team\u2019s capacity to do research that informs our Global Catastrophic Risks strategy and grantmaking. Ultimately, this will help us get money to where it can have the most impact.&nbsp;</p><p>\u200b\u200bWe anticipate that interns will collaborate closely with the team; at the same time, we expect a high degree of independence and encourage self-directed work.</p><h2><strong>Our internship tracks</strong></h2><p>We are hiring interns for either the Research or Strategy tracks. The responsibilities for these tracks largely overlap, and the two positions will be evaluated using the same application materials. The main difference is one of emphasis: while research track interns primarily focus on direct research, strategy track interns are sometimes tasked with working on non-research projects (such as helping run a contest or a request for proposals). You will be asked to indicate which track you\u2019d like to be considered for in the application.</p><p>Interns will work on multiple projects at different levels of depth, in the same way as full-time team members. They will report to an existing cause prioritization team member and participate in team meetings and discussions, including presenting their work to the team for feedback.</p><p>Specific projects will depend on the team\u2019s needs and the intern\u2019s skills, but will fall under the following core responsibilities:</p><ol><li>Searching for new program areas. We believe there are promising giving opportunities that don\u2019t currently fall within the purview of our existing program areas. Finding them involves blending theoretical models with concrete investigation into the tractability of new interventions to reduce catastrophic risk. Much of this research is informed by conversations with relevant experts.</li><li>Evaluating existing program areas. We pursue many different approaches to reducing catastrophic risk, and it\u2019s not always clear how these strategies compare to one another. The team\u2019s work combines backward-looking evaluation of past grants with forward-looking vetting of programmatic theories of change. Because reductions in catastrophic risk are difficult to measure, we expect the team\u2019s work to involve developing and assessing proxy indicators that are easier to analyze.</li><li>Advancing research agendas within program areas. Our program areas are often faced with a backlog of research questions and a deficit of researcher hours to throw at them. The GCR Cause Prioritization team lends research capacity to program staff who need help working through internal research agendas. These projects often involve fine-grained questions that require programmatic context.</li><li>Informing high-level strategy. Reducing catastrophic risk is a complicated business, and many of our decisions rely on complicated dynamics that are difficult to capture. For example, our cost-effectiveness bar and spending strategy will depend on when threats emerge, and which opportunities arise to tackle those threats (among many other factors). The team investigates considerations that are most crucial to our strategic decision-making.</li></ol><h2><strong>Who might be a good fit</strong></h2><p>We\u2019re open to a variety of backgrounds, but all applicants must be enrolled in a degree program at the time that they are applying, or work at an organization that offers externship/secondment opportunities. Enrolled applicants must be no more than 12 months away from graduation in an undergraduate program, or be enrolled in a graduate program.</p><p>While past interns have sometimes gone on to later full-time roles at Open Philanthropy, our internships are typically temporary positions with no assumed extension. If you have any questions about your eligibility, please feel free to reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jobs@openphilanthropy.org\"><u>jobs@openphilanthropy.org</u></a>.</p><p>You might be a good fit for this role if:</p><ul><li>[For the strategy track] You have a background in consulting or equivalent strategic experience.</li><li>[For the research track] You have a background in analytical research (including, but not limited to, having or working towards a master\u2019s or PhD).</li><li>You have a strong quantitative skill set, including the ability to incorporate uncertainty into your quantitative models.</li><li>You are comfortable building \u201cback-of-the-envelope calculations\u201d in domains in which data are sparse.</li><li>You are comfortable interviewing academics, policymakers, and practitioners across many domains.</li><li>You are excited about working in a fast-paced research environment that covers a wide range of potential research topics.</li><li>You exhibit good epistemic judgment, including a willingness to update on new information and a commitment to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/\"><u>reasoning transparency</u></a>.</li><li>You write quickly, and your prose is simple and easy to read.</li><li>You are independent, organized, and self-motivated.</li></ul><p>Prior experience in global catastrophic risks is not required.

Our plan is for the internships to run for 10-12 weeks from June 10 to August 16-30, though we\u2019re open to limited adjustments based on academic calendars. Potential interns must be available for 40 hours per week during their internships for at least the ten weeks following June 10.&nbsp;</li><li>Compensation will be $2,000 per week.</li><li>This position is remote. However, we encourage interns to attend our organization-wide \u201cTogetherness Week\u201d in San Francisco from July 15-19. Open Philanthropy will pay for flights and temporary accommodation for those attending Togetherness Week.</li><li>We are happy to consider applicants currently studying in the United States on student visas, and we will provide any supporting documentation they require to be eligible for this internship. However, we don\u2019t control who is and isn\u2019t eligible for a visa and can\u2019t guarantee approval under the applicant's student visa program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>We may be able to hire a successful applicant who lacks U.S. work authorization to work remotely abroad.</li></ul><p>We aim to employ people with many different experiences, perspectives and backgrounds who share our passion for accomplishing as much good as we can.

Despite reinvesting profits for growth, Humanitix has managed to donate significantly to charities, indicating the potential of Profit for Good (PFG) businesses.</p><p>An elephant in the room in the discussion of Profit for Good is the almost total lack of access of such firms to capital for seed costs and expansion, whereas normal, for-profit competitors can raise significant early funds in exchange for equity stakes. We are encouraged by the success of Humanitix, and the evidence that it provides.

We are interested in answering this call to action. Finding contexts in which the Profit for Good factor offers a particularly powerful competitive edge is important not just for the direct funding of charities that it could do, but also for providing critical evidence that could motivate philanthropists to further use Profit for Good firms to multiply their impact.</p><p><strong>Strategic Profit for Good Firms and a Framework for Finding Them</strong></p><p>A framework that could be used to assess the suitability of these <i>strategic</i> Profit for Good firms would be some mix of the following factors:</p><ol><li>Low or no differentiation between product or the ability to legibly provide superior products or services along a dimension valued by consumers.</li><li>High degree of profitability with a successful firm (either from high scalability or high degree of profit from individual transactions- profit limited by transaction volume).</li><li>Relatively low cost to be able to participate competitively in the market on price.</li></ol><p>BOAS, a fast vintage fashion platform, meets these criteria well because&nbsp;it operates in a high margin (80% gross margin at scale, currently at 60%) industry and they focus on just the jeans category, where they can buy and get vintage jeans donated in bulk to expand with relatively low cost before expanding in other categories.

However, we have a lot of uncertainty about which laws or policies would be most impactful (or <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/cause-selection/#section-2\"><u>neglected/tractable</u></a> relative to their impact) on housing production.</p><ol><li>What are the legal changes that appear to spur the most housing? E.g. can we estimate the effects of removing parking mandates on housing production? How do those compare to the effects of higher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_area_ratio\"><u>FAR</u></a> or more allowable units?<ol><li>Why we care: We think that permitting speed might be an important category to target, but have high uncertainty about this.&nbsp;</li><li>What we know: There are a number of different studies of the effects of changes in zoning/land use laws (e.g. see a summary <a href=\"https://yonahfreemark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Freemark-2023-Zoning-Change.pdf\"><u>here</u></a> in Appendix A), but we\u2019re not aware of studies that attempt to disentangle any specific changes or rank their importance. We suspect that talking to advocates (e.g. CA YIMBY) would be useful as a starting point.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: It seems unlikely that there have been \u201cclean\u201d changes that only affected a single part of the construction process, but from talking to advocates, it seems plausible that it would be possible to identify changes to zoning codes that <i>primarily</i> affect one parameter more than others. It also seems plausible that this is a topic where a systematic review, combining evidence from many other studies, would be unusually valuable.</li></ol></li><li>What is the elasticity of construction with regards to factors like \u201cthe likelihood of acquiring permission to build\u201d or \u201cthe length of an average permitting delay\u201d?<ol><li>Why we care: We are highly uncertain about how to best encourage more construction, and thus about where to target our grants.</li><li>What we know: there have been many recent changes to permitting requirements, such as the California ADU law that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2020/03/12/californias-new-accessory-dwelling-units-laws-what-you-should-know/?sh=33d2c1217a30\"><u>requires cities to respond to permit requests within 60 days</u></a> and a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/25/desantis-florida-reform-home-building/\"><u>new law in Florida</u></a> that requires cities to respond to permit requests quickly or return permitting fees. This <a href=\"https://www.sightline.org/2017/08/10/housing-delayed-is-housing-denied/\"><u>blog post by Dan Bertolet at Sightline</u></a> predates those changes, but is the best summary we\u2019ve seen on the impacts of permitting requirements.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one might compare projects that fall right below or above thresholds for permitting review (e.g. SEPA thresholds in Washington state), and try to understand how much extra delay projects faced as a result of qualifying for review. It could also be valuable to analyze the effects of the Florida law (e.g. a difference-in-difference design looking at housing construction in places that had long delays vs. short delays prior to the law passing).</li></ol></li><li>Does the value of new housing (in terms of individual earnings gains and/or innovation benefits) in a commuting zone or metro area vary depending on whether that housing is in the center or on the periphery?<ol><li>Why we care: Currently, estimates of this value are typically made at the level of the metro area, but it seems plausible that we should be differentiating more \u2013 e.g. putting higher values on units built in Manhattan relative to those built in Westchester.</li><li>What we know: there\u2019s a lot of work on the gradient of land/house prices with regards to transit costs across metro areas, but we aren\u2019t aware of work that explicitly tries to estimate within-metro differences (in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w31587\"><u>Card, Rothstein, and Yi (2023)</u></a>, for example).</li><li>Ideas for studying this: it should be possible to use similar designs looking at moves at a more granular level (e.g. rather than defining effects at the metro level, use changes in distance-weighted job availability). There may also be ways to directly use the land price gradient to estimate this (though in general that will also reflect amenity values).</li></ol></li><li>What are the impacts of a land value tax?<ol><li>Why we care: Some people have proposed that a land value tax could encourage land redevelopment and reduce the economic inefficiency of taxation, but we do not know how well this reflects the real-world impact of land value taxes.</li><li>What we know: Land value taxes have been used in some Pennsylvania cities, and in some countries outside the US. There has also been increasing interest in implementing a land value tax in other places (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fadfbd9e-29ca-4d53-b69a-2497cc3ed95d\"><u>this FT editorial</u></a>). See <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/does-georgism-work-is-land-really\"><u>here</u></a> for many more arguments and references related to land value taxation.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one could use a difference-in-difference design looking at when cities adopt a land value tax (or a split value tax) and examine changes in construction or other outcomes (e.g. volume of land transactions). Alternatively, one could also try a border regression discontinuity looking at differences in land transactions or other metrics at the border between a place that implements a land value tax and one that does not.</li></ol></li></ol><h2><strong>Health</strong></h2><p>Treatments now potentially within reach may extend the human lifespan and improve quality of life. We aim to support tractable and cost-effective research on the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/en/\"><u>world\u2019s most burdensome diseases</u></a>, including cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, malaria, and others.</p><ol><li>How do different components of <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics\"><u>PM 2.5</u></a> pollution differ in their impact on mortality? Should Open Philanthropy be considering the type of pollutant when modeling the harms of poor air quality?<ol><li>Why we care: Open Philanthropy makes many grants focused on <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/south-asian-air-quality/\"><u>South Asian air quality</u></a>. However, we still have a lot of uncertainty about the impacts of air pollution. One potentially important variable is the type of pollutant; it would be important for our grantmaking to know if some forms of pollution were much more impactful to reduce than others.</li><li>What we know: We know that the components of PM 2.5 pollution can <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b01658\"><u>vary substantially</u></a> by location. There has been some <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4742572/\"><u>associational work</u></a> done on this in the US context, but we are more interested in areas with high baseline PM 2.5 levels.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: there is some <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7417276/\"><u>existing data</u></a> on how the components of PM 2.5 pollution vary across India. This could be linked with mortality data for associational studies. One could also use policy changes that changed the makeup of particulate emissions in a certain area as a natural experiment.</li></ol></li><li>What has been the impact of Bloomberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.org/public-health/reducing-tobacco-use/\"><u>tobacco-focused grantmaking</u></a>? Has tobacco usage decreased in Bloomberg focus countries, and can that be causally linked to Bloomberg\u2019s involvement?<ol><li>Why we care: Open Philanthropy has made some grants attempting to influence public health regulation. We are interested in knowing how successful other philanthropists have been when making similar grants, and are particularly interested in knowing the effects of Bloomberg\u2019s anti-tobacco advocacy, which we see as one of the most focused (and promising) programs of its type.</li><li>What we know: there has been <a href=\"https://tobacconomics.org/research/\"><u>substantial research</u></a> on the effects of tobacco policy, but we are not aware of any work that focuses specifically on the effect of Bloomberg\u2019s investments.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: some of Bloomberg\u2019s grantmaking in tobacco is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R9jDrGsXKxACKxmMVi_2FJDHj-MdxJSpcO3mvCqLraw/edit#gid=1485894780\"><u>public</u></a>; one could use a variety of approaches to assess the impact of those grants (e.g. a synthetic control).</li></ol></li><li>What are the causal impacts of lead exposure on cardiovascular health?<ol><li>Why we care: we have made grants on <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/pure-earth-support-for-reducing-lead-exposure-in-low-and-middle-income-countries/\"><u>reducing lead exposure</u></a> in low-income countries in the past and are likely to make more in the future. These grants are made assuming that lead affects both health and income, but we are quite uncertain about the magnitude of the effect of either, especially on health (where we think there is less data). Better estimates of the effect of lead on health would reduce the level of uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness of these grants.</li><li>What we know: according to <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30043-4/fulltext#:~:text=Lead%20has%20long%20been%20recognised,stroke%2C%20and%20chronic%20kidney%20disease.&amp;text=The%20relationship%20between%20blood%20lead,and%20its%20cardiovascular%20risk%20implications.\"><u>epidemiological (observational) studies</u></a>, lead has negative impacts on cardiovascular health (see a helpful systematic review <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1849948/\"><u>here</u></a>). However, there is limited causal evidence on the impacts of lead on cardiovascular disease in humans; our primary evidence comes from a study that <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rdy6g/\"><u>leverages</u></a> exposure to NASCAR races to determine changes in ischemic heart disease in the elderly, but we don\u2019t know much about chronic exposure and are reluctant to rely heavily on a single study.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one might use exogenous variation in exposure to lead, such as the <a href=\"https://undark.org/2023/07/19/the-vice-of-spice-confronting-lead-tainted-turmeric/\"><u>recent removal</u></a> of lead from spices in Bangladesh, or study workers in lead-exposed industries (while taking steps to handle the \u201chealthy worker effect\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2kk7bibog6w\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2kk7bibog6w\">[2]</a></sup></span>).</li></ol></li><li>Historically, how have properties of vaccines other than their price \u2013 in particular measured efficacy and duration/waning in pre-licensure trials \u2013 affected the demand and speed of rollouts of those vaccines in South Asian and sub-Saharan African countries? What rules of thumb should we use for how an increase of, say, 10 percentage points in measured efficacy affects demand and eventual health impact?<ol><li>Why we care: Open Philanthropy invests in vaccines for a variety of illnesses, with the primary (though not exclusive) goal of reducing mortality. Having better estimates for how properties of vaccines translate to demand and eventual health impact will help us prioritize when to support \u201cgood\u201d leads in clinical trials vs. hold out longer for \u201cgreat\u201d ones.</li><li>What we know: the efficacy of vaccines for different diseases varies considerably, and improved technologies can lead to more promising candidates even for diseases where one or more products are already available.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one could interact the efficacy of a given year\u2019s vaccine (see data <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/past-seasons-estimates.html\"><u>here</u></a> for example) with propensity to get the flu vaccine to determine how this changed flu dynamics. (Though data from South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa would be even better.)</li></ol></li><li>We\u2019d be interested in a <a href=\"https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/events/precision_med_pop.htm\"><u>Mendelian randomization</u></a> study that followed people heterozygous for the sickle cell variant to estimate the long run effect of malaria on income and/or consumption.<ol><li>Why we care: Much of Open Philanthropy\u2019s grantmaking in global health R&amp;D is focused on preventing malaria in high-risk populations (as are several charities recommended by GiveWell, with whom we <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-health-development/\"><u>work closely</u></a> on global health). However, we have little causal evidence on the long-run effects of having had malaria, on either health or income. Thus, we do not have a good sense of the true (long-run) value of preventing malaria.</li><li>What we know: a Mendelian study found that the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/42/5/1390/619581\"><u>likelihood of stunting</u></a> increases with each malaria infection.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: Mendelian randomization is a technique that looks at people with different genes to determine the causal impact of genes on observable outcomes. Being heterozygous for the sickle cell variant is symptomless but protective against malaria. Thus, those with sickle cell trait are less likely to get malaria and can be compared against those without the trait to understand the long-run impacts of malaria.</li></ol></li><li>Which vaccines, and what fraction of common vaccines, have been trialed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_dose_vaccination\"><u>fractional dosing</u></a>? How often does a lower vaccine dose lead to the same or better efficacy? Which vaccines might be promising for fractional dosing research trials?<ol><li>Why we care: Open Philanthropy is interested in cost-effectively improving health. Fractional dosing has the potential to lower cost and expand coverage of vaccines. If we had better evidence on this topic, OP could know in which cases (if any) to advocate for more fractional dosing.</li><li>What we know: a fractional dose for <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(20)32520-4.pdf\"><u>yellow fever</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/08/04/2020.07.31.20163717.full.pdf\"><u>flu</u></a> appeared to be non-inferior, but fractional dosing for polio was less successful.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: we are not aware of any systematic review of fractional vaccine trials, but many such trials have been run. Studying this topic could involve simply examining data from past trials, rather than running new trials.</li></ol></li><li>Where is the <a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>Global Burden of Disease</u></a> (GBD) likely to be inaccurate? Which figures or estimates is it likely to significantly revise in the future after improving their modeling? Can we get some kind of \u2018certainty or quality of evidence score\u2019 for the individual point estimates we sometimes source from GBD? We are particularly interested in data on environmental pollutants like arsenic or lead; South Asian and sub-Saharan African estimates on mortality from rheumatic heart disease, syphilis, dengue, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis E; as well as understudied issues like fungal disease or endocrine-disrupting chemicals.<ol><li>Why we care: our estimates of the importance of a particular problem or disease are often based on GBD estimates. However, these estimates have changed substantially across editions of GBD<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefarwcvdayf9j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnarwcvdayf9j\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and can have wide error bars. We are interested in knowing the true burden so that we can appropriately estimate the importance of particular diseases/etiologies, as well as more generally understanding how reliable the GBD is for guiding our own investments in the measurement of disease burden.</li><li>What we know: as GBD covers all deaths and DALYs in the world, the team behind it necessarily spends limited time researching any one cause of DALYs. While GBD revisions attempt to address issues with previous estimates, we believe that there may still be substantial errors.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one could look for sharp changes in burden figures between the current and previous GBD studies, or examine a particular cause of death in detail and compare one\u2019s own estimates to those generated by the GBD at different levels of age or geographic aggregation.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>What drives the diffusion of medications or medical technologies across countries?<ol><li>Why we care: new medications and medical technologies can substantially improve disease burdens and make treating or eliminating an illness more cost-effective. However, different countries adopt technologies at different rates; we are interested in knowing why. Open Philanthropy might then be able to make grants to encourage adoption of particularly promising technologies in underserved areas.</li><li>What we know: it seems that <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141482\"><u>patents, price regulation</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.28.4.986\"><u>market structure</u></a> affect drug adoption.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: follow up on the approach in <a href=\"https://www.margaretkyle.net/Kyle-PharmaceuticalPriceControls-2007.pdf\"><u>Kyle (2007)</u></a>. One could extend her estimates to estimate the diffusion of FDA-approved drugs globally via patent filings and then look at predictors of diffusion: disease burden, GDP per capita, price controls, language (English vs. not), and path dependency (whether the same companies sell to the same countries repeatedly).</li></ol></li></ol><h2><strong>Migration</strong></h2><ol><li>What are migration routes with unused capacity? What are the world\u2019s open borders (particularly where one side of the open border is a low- or middle-income country)?<ol><li>Why do we care: Open Philanthropy tries to cost-effectively improve health and income. Migration is often considered to be one of the best ways to improve income; for instance, a person moving from a low-income country to a high-income country might raise their income by a factor of 50. We have previously made grants in both <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/center-for-global-development-labor-mobility-partnerships/\"><u>international</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/mercy-corps-seasonal-migration-pilot-project-and-rct/\"><u>internal</u></a> migration, and are interested in knowing whether there are underutilized migration channels whereby migrants might substantially increase their income. Our understanding is that aging populations are causing some HICs to offer more work visas than they previously offered, but that the uptake of these visas is poorly understood (and may be quite low).</li><li>What we know: there are some international borders that do not require authorization for labor migration (e.g. within the EU, or between India and Nepal). At least one such border includes a low-income country (India/Nepal \u2014 India\u2019s per capita GDP is over twice that of Nepal\u2019s), but as far as we are aware, there is no database of such borders.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: we think valuable descriptive papers could gather information on the relative usage levels of different work visas (in HICs or MICs) that could be accessible to people from LMICs, or on migration paths that don\u2019t have caps on work visas (such as India-Nepal). Limiting to the largest HICs for ease of initial study (e.g. US, Japan, Germany, France, UK) would probably still be very valuable.</li></ol></li></ol><h2><strong>Education</strong></h2><ol><li>What are the general equilibrium returns to education in LMIC settings?<ol><li>Why we care: education may be one of the best ways to increase long-run income. However, most education studies focus only on a small number of treated students; it is less clear what the general equilibrium effects are (that is, effects across an entire city/region/nation). These are important in understanding how valuable education is in raising wages \u2014 and if Open Philanthropy should consider education interventions as a cost-effective way of improving income.</li><li>What we know: this question has been examined in both <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.4.795\"><u>Indonesia</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.econgaurav.com/_files/ugd/f85d25_64263c5c13c9436f869bf67b34a6125b.pdf\"><u>India</u></a>, but re-examination of these findings has made them seem <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09036\"><u>less</u></a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11956\"><u>robust</u></a>. In addition, we continue to be surprised that there are so few studies on how large schooling expansions affect wages.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one might use other large-scale expansions of schooling, such as Ghana\u2019s free senior high school program or the Kenyan schooling expansion studied in <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.4.4.226\"><u>Mbiti &amp; Lucas (2012)</u></a>.</li></ol></li><li>What is the effect of elite policy education? How valuable are programs giving policymakers from LMICs economic policy training?<ol><li>Why we care: we think that economic growth is likely to be very important, but it isn\u2019t clear how best to produce higher growth rates through philanthropic funding. One idea would be to increase the supply of highly trained policymakers, who might be able to influence policy that affects many people.</li><li>What we know: we\u2019re not aware of work trying to measure the impact of policy training programs, such as the masters program at the <a href=\"https://cde.williams.edu/\"><u>Williams Center for Development Economics</u></a> or the <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/masters-programs/master-public-administration-international-development/what\"><u>MPA ID</u></a> at Harvard.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: if you could get access to the admissions data for a program like one of the above examples, you could compare people who were nearly admitted to those who were actually admitted to see whether the programs have an effect on career trajectories. This wouldn\u2019t prove anything directly about growth, but would provide evidence that the programs have some counterfactual effect.</li></ol></li></ol><h2><strong>Science and Metascience</strong></h2><ol><li>Do efforts to improve the rigor of social science work?<ol><li>Why we care: many of Open Philanthropy\u2019s decisions are based on social scientific work. As such, we have a vested interest in this work being reliable and replicable. Unreliable or non-replicable work might lead us to make weaker, less impactful funding decisions.</li><li>What we know: the peer review process does not seem to <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/swbmzhyg/release/8\"><u>weed out papers with signs of p-hacking</u></a>, but pre-registration may reduce <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/25152459211007467\"><u>publication bias</u></a>.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one might consider the effects of efforts like the <a href=\"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/\"><u>AEA pre-analysis plan registry</u></a> or the <a href=\"https://i4replication.org/\"><u>Institute for Replication</u></a>.</li></ol></li><li>How do scientists make decisions about allocating marginal time to applications for further funding or research? How valuable is the process of writing applications if they are ultimately unsuccessful? Is it true that scientists are \u201cwasting\u201d a lot of time writing grants?<ol><li>Why we care: we think that scientific progress is hugely important to growth and health advances. One issue in current science is that scientists spend a huge amount of time on high-stakes grant applications instead of doing science (and that the applications may be excessively long relative to what\u2019s necessary for identifying the best science). If this is true, advocating for changes to the grantmaking process might be a high-leverage opportunity for Open Philanthropy.</li><li>What we know: descriptive data suggests that scientists now spend a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02379\"><u>huge amount of their time</u></a> applying for grants, and that spending <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/5/e002800\"><u>more time</u></a> on a grant application does not increase the chance of success.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: there is valuable descriptive work to be done on this topic (e.g. surveying scientists on time use and decisions). One could also consider a quasi-experiment related to looking at people who narrowly win or lose a grant and seeing how it affects their funding applications/time use.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsmbf89kl22c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsmbf89kl22c\">[4]</a></sup></span></li></ol></li><li>How would different decision-making criteria (picking favorites vs consensus) at science funders change the kind of work that\u2019s done? How should we compare criteria, and which outcomes matter for such a comparison?<ol><li>Why we care: as above, we believe scientific progress is important to growth and health advances. Therefore, we are interested in making sure scientific funding processes work as well as possible to maximize the amount of impact per federal research dollar. If there are improvements that can be made to how science is funded, Open Philanthropy might fund advocacy for such improvements.</li><li>What we know: <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31409/w31409.pdf\"><u>Carson, Graff Zivin and Shrader (2023)</u></a> find that reviewers would prefer to prioritize papers with more variance in review scores, and that if this preference were taken into account it would likely lead to different projects being funded. A <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/nc5341ua/release/4\"><u>review of the literature</u></a> suggests that peer review of applications can identify some of the most promising ideas, but the level of signal is fairly weak.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one might look at data on past applications and see how the set of funded projects would have differed given the use of different selection criteria, such as max score or random selection (among projects over a certain level of quality). Alternatively, one could randomize within a specific RFP (so that some proposals are selected under different criteria) or randomize across RFPs (so that you can also see how various selection criteria affect the kinds of applications received). The Institute for Progress is currently <a href=\"https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-partners-institute-progress-test-new\"><u>studying this</u></a> in collaboration with NSF.</li></ol></li><li>How impactful are systematic reviews (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/\"><u>Cochrane collective reviews</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/\"><u>Campbell Collaboration</u></a>), evidence clearinghouses (e.g., <a href=\"https://pathwaystowork.acf.hhs.gov/\"><u>Pathways to Work</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.impactgenome.org/\"><u>Impact Genome Registry</u></a>), and literature reviews? Does policy or decision-making within a specific domain measurably improve when reviews become available?<ol><li>Why we care: a large share of the value of academic research comes from its ultimate impact on human decisions, but ultimate decision-makers are usually not academics who are well equipped to read and understand individual academic studies. Open Philanthropy would like to know how decision-makers use academic research, and whether there might be improvements to systematic reviews such that decision-makers could be better informed.</li><li>What we know: We know remarkably little. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122421996323\"><u>This study</u></a> argues that academic citation networks are significantly impacted by literature reviews, and suggests that they help to organize and orient fields. <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/information-accountability-and-cumulative-learning/learning-about-cumulative-learning-an-experiment-with-policy-practitioners/D31A38848D8EC08B71D6F33389F8134C\"><u>This study</u></a> finds that policymakers respond more to sets of studies finding the same thing across multiple settings than to individual studies \u2013 but the results are mixed.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: we think the rollout of evidence clearinghouses is likely pseudorandom across topics, such that measuring their impact may be tractable with difference-in-difference methods. For example, one could study outcomes across different disease categories as the Cochrane collective rolled out new systematic reviews, starting when it was founded in 1993.</li></ol></li><li>How well do prize competitions really work? What is the best way to design prize competitions to get the most useful information?<ol><li>Why we care: Open Philanthropy has occasionally run prize competitions to try and generate useful knowledge. See, for example, our <a href=\"https://www.causeexplorationprizes.com/\"><u>Cause Exploration Prizes</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/open-philanthropy-ai-worldviews-contest/\"><u>AI Worldviews Contest</u></a>. We may run more prizes in the future; as such, we would like to know how likely a prize competition is to gather useful information and how to best attract talented entrants.</li><li>What we know: <a href=\"https://www.chapman.edu/ESI/wp/Winner-Take-AllContests-Sheremeta.pdf\"><u>a 2010 paper</u></a> argues that proportional prize contests produce more total achievement, but <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/16-129_9696f84e-d322-403a-98db-6e5199222637.pdf\"><u>another paper</u></a> is less prescriptive about ideal prize structure.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: <a href=\"https://www.wazokucrowd.com/story-of-innocentive/\"><u>Innocentive</u></a> has done a lot of prize-like competitions; they might be able to share some useful retrospective data.</li></ol></li><li>What are the impacts of opening a hub or office focused on producing impact evaluations on overall research generation?<ol><li>Why we care: we believe that rigorous social scientific research is key to identifying the most impactful and cost-effective interventions and policies in developing countries, some of which we may go on to fund. We are interested in knowing cost-effective ways to produce more of said research. We have <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/innovations-for-poverty-action-ethiopian-office/\"><u>funded a new IPA office</u></a> previously, and might fund more such work in the future if we had more evidence about its impact on research, both overall and specific to the target country.</li><li>What we know: Matt Clancy, who leads our grantmaking in <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/innovation-policy/\"><u>innovation policy</u></a>, coauthored an <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/0xbyxmz4/release/2\"><u>article</u></a> on the extent to which research done in one place can be usefully applied in other places. Obstacles to this include different places having different underlying conditions, as well as evidence that policymakers prefer research conducted in their own countries. The article\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/0xbyxmz4#articles-cited\"><u>bibliography</u></a> includes many relevant sources.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Y4FQdVTcuOX026qRJy1IpG3oOu3BGch/view\"><u>Getcher and Meager (2021)</u></a> collected data on the openings of developing-country offices for NGOs interested in conducting research within said countries. One could use difference-in-difference design to look at how research production (and RCT production in particular) changes when a new office opens \u2013 does it cause an increase in total research in those countries? Is there evidence of substitution from non-RCTs to RCTs? Substitution from neighboring countries to the country with a new office? Do new offices tend to produce research on different topics from existing offices (e.g. focusing more on financial inclusion instead of agriculture)?</li></ol></li><li>What forms of research do policymakers find most persuasive or useful?<ol><li>Why we care: Open Philanthropy is often interested in influencing policy. Therefore, we want to learn about what is most likely to influence policymakers\u2019 decision-making. We are quite uncertain what types of evidence are most likely to influence policymakers, or in what venues this evidence is likely to be presented.</li><li>What we know: Policy documents cite a <a href=\"https://altmetrics.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02_submission_Fang_Dudek_Noyons_Costas-altmetrics20.pdf\"><u>relatively small number </u></a>of scientific publications. In one study, policymakers do not seem to respond to <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w30144\"><u>strength of evidence</u></a> in deciding what to implement; in <a href=\"http://evavivalt.com/wp-content/uploads/Weighing-the-Evidence.pdf\"><u>another</u></a>, policymakers cared more about external validity than internal validity; in <a href=\"https://dianamoreira.com/pdf/dm/HMRS_Submitted.pdf\"><u>another</u></a>, policymakers cared substantially about sample size.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: what evidence do central banks (and other governmental institutions) cite most often, and how does this differ from academic citation practices? Is there additional evidence on what types of evidence best persuade policymakers or are most likely to get cited as part of regulatory decisions? E.g. how do citations from a government agency (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/reports\"><u>the FTC</u></a>) compare to citations in academic work on similar topics?</li></ol></li><li>What factors drive public sector spending levels for R&amp;D, especially changes to the status quo?<ol><li>Why we care: Open Philanthropy wants to raise income levels across society. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/report-on-social-returns-to-productivity-growth/\"><u>Our previous work</u></a> has suggested that public spending on R&amp;D is one of the most effective ways for governments to increase their countries\u2019 income levels. We are thus interested in knowing how the level of public spending on R&amp;D is set, and if there are tractable ways that Open Philanthropy might advocate for this to be increased.</li><li>What we know: there is relatively little information available about the process of setting national-level priorities, but there is <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733312002168\"><u>some data available</u></a> about agenda-setting within NIH.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: we aren\u2019t sure of the best approach. Focusing on particular periods of growth in R&amp;D spending and producing case studies might yield evidence that could be explored in a quantitative way later.</li></ol></li></ol><h2><strong>Global Development</strong></h2><ol><li>How much do USAID Administrators or other senior aid staff affect division of funds? How much influence can a (senior) staff member actually have?<ol><li>Why we care: Open Philanthropy makes grants in <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-aid-policy/\"><u>global aid advocacy</u></a> and is interested in increasing both the amount and efficacy of rich countries\u2019 foreign aid. We are interested to know how much influence agency leadership has on the distribution of aid in order to benchmark how much change we should expect over different time frames.</li><li>What we know: we\u2019re not aware of any work addressing this.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: when a new Administrator is appointed, how much does the distribution of aid change across different categories? Ideally, it would be interesting to compare USAID (which is known to have many Congressional earmarks) to other countries with more flexible aid budgets.</li></ol></li><li>How differentiated are growth diagnostics? Do they have the same core recommendations a large fraction of the time?<ol><li>Why we care: we believe that sustained economic growth is one of the best ways to improve health and income. We are interested in knowing how to obtain this. Growth diagnostics are a common tool for trying to select growth-friendly policies, but we are uncertain how valuable this tool is. We are interested in knowing what additional information is gained from using growth diagnostics \u2013 how useful they are, and the extent to which this suggests that countries face common vs. distinct growth challenges.</li><li>What we know: while there are many papers on growth diagnostics, we are not aware of any evaluation of growth diagnostics across countries.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: taking a large body of growth diagnostics from a common source (e.g. the World Bank or <a href=\"https://growthlab.hks.harvard.edu/publications/policy-area/growth-diagnostics\"><u>Harvard Growth Lab</u></a>); using automated methods to measure the similarity of recommendations, compare how similar they are, and determine whether that similarity varies by base GDP (e.g. do similarly rich/poor countries have similar diagnostics?) or region (e.g. do Central Asian countries have similar diagnostics?).</li></ol></li></ol><h2><strong>Other</strong></h2><ol><li>Does social issue content in TV shows or movies change opinions? What is the value of a widely-viewed documentary?<ol><li>Why we care: many social changes \u2014 such as encouraging migration or expanding one\u2019s moral circle to include farmed animals \u2014 are often covered in widely-viewed media channels. We are interested in knowing if such coverage changes minds.</li><li>What we know: media seems to be able to influence decision-making (as with fertility in <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.4.4.1\"><u>Brazil</u></a>). <i>Blackfish </i><a href=\"https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/32674/1/pan3.10221.pdf\"><u>decreased attendance at Seaworld</u></a> and decreased the value of the company that owned the park.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: we think there is more scope to study individual documentaries or shows (did <i>Waiting for Superman</i> affect views on education? Did <i>Bowling for Columbine </i>affect views on guns?). One could also conduct meta-analyses, looking across a variety of documentaries or shows to look for common effects.</li></ol></li><li>How common are non-compete agreements outside the US? What are their effects on wages?<ol><li>Why we care: we believe that non-competes are likely to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA18128\"><u>reduce labor mobility and decrease innovation</u></a>.</li><li>What we know: there are <a href=\"https://docs.iza.org/dp16021.pdf\"><u>some surveys</u></a> on the prevalence of non-competes outside the US, but few are recent or comprehensive. Outside of <a href=\"https://docs.iza.org/dp16021.pdf\"><u>recent work in Italy</u></a>, we have little information about how prevalent non-competes are, or how harmful they are in labor markets outside the US.</li><li>Ideas for studying this: one could gather information on the prevalence of non-competes and their effects on wages in other large labor markets, like Germany, France, and Spain.</li></ol></li></ol><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fndqxtjvalak6\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefdqxtjvalak6\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Note that this list does not include purely scientific questions that would impact future OP grantmaking.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn2kk7bibog6w\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref2kk7bibog6w\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>That is, people who remain employed tend to be <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8172994/\">healthier</a> than those who stop working.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnarwcvdayf9j\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefarwcvdayf9j\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Including estimates for exactly the same timeframe \u2014 that is, the estimates aren\u2019t changing because of some change in the world.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsmbf89kl22c\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsmbf89kl22c\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f190062.pdf\">Adda et al.

By recommending people work at the big AI labs (whose explicit aim is to create AGI), do you think this creates a positive Halo Effect for the labs' brand?</strong> 80k is known as an organisation whose mission is to make the world a better place, so by recommending people invest their careers at a lab, then those positive brand associations get passed onto the lab (this is how most brand partnerships work. This point shouldn't be a crux since 80k has run partnerships in the past for their own marketing purposes).&nbsp;</p><p>Put concretely, the impact of this is that people (job seekers, investors, users of LLMs) can look at the lab in question and assume that that lab is not doing a bad thing by trying to quickly create AGI.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>2. If you think the answer to #1 is Yes (it does create a positive Halo Effect), then do you believe that there is a cost of this Halo Effect? </strong>I.e. is it bad that you're improving their brand perception among job seekers, investors, users of LLMs? (TBH, I don't think I've ever actually seen/heard anyone at 80k point at a big lab and say \"um I don't think you should make that thing that might kill everyone\", so maybe this is a non-starter?).</p><p><strong>3. If you think there is a cost, do you believe this cost is outweighed by the benefit of having safety minded EA / Rationalist folk inside big labs? </strong>This is a crux I find it hard to wrap my head around, but it is possible that everything boils down to this question. And my personal take is that if you're unsure about this then you shouldn't be creating the Halo Effect in the first place.</p>", "user": {"username": "Yanni Kyriacos"}}, {"_id": "5aTQtLRYxLeRDhyoJ", "title": "Own stock in a meat or egg company?

By contrast, we don\u2019t see similar levels of physical ill health in young people. At any point in time, something like 20% of young people are working through anxiety or depression that\u2019s seriously interfering with their lives \u2014 but nowhere near 20% of people in their 20s have severe heart disease or cancer or a similar failure in a key organ of the body other than the brain.</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, that\u2019s to be expected, right? If your heart or lungs or legs or skin stop working properly while you\u2019re a teenager, you\u2019re less likely to reproduce, and the genes that cause that malfunction get weeded out of the gene pool.</p><p>So why is it that these evolutionary selective pressures seemingly fixed our bodies so that they work pretty smoothly for young people most of the time, but it feels like evolution fell asleep on the job when it comes to the brain? Why did evolution never get around to patching the most basic problems, like social anxiety, panic attacks, debilitating pessimism, or inappropriate mood swings? For that matter, why did evolution go out of its way to give us the capacity for low mood or chronic anxiety or extreme mood swings <i>at all</i>?</p><p>Today\u2019s guest, Randy Nesse \u2014 a leader in the field of evolutionary psychiatry \u2014 wrote the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Good-Reasons-for-Bad-Feelings-audiobook/dp/B07N7PR34Q\"><i>Good Reasons for Bad Feelings</i></a>, in which he sets out to try to resolve this paradox.</p><p>In the interview, host Rob Wiblin and Randy discuss the key points of the book, as well as:</p><ul><li>How the evolutionary psychiatry perspective can help people appreciate that their mental health problems are often the result of a useful and important system.</li><li>How evolutionary pressures and dynamics lead to a wide range of different personalities, behaviours, strategies, and tradeoffs.</li><li>The missing intellectual foundations of psychiatry, and how an evolutionary lens could revolutionise the field.</li><li>How working as both an academic and a practicing psychiatrist shaped Randy\u2019s understanding of treating mental health problems.</li><li>The \u201csmoke detector principle\u201d of why we experience so many false alarms along with true threats.</li><li>The origins of morality and capacity for genuine love, and why Randy thinks it\u2019s a mistake to try to explain these from a selfish gene perspective.</li><li>Evolutionary theories on why we age and die.</li><li>And much more.</li></ul><p><i>Producer and editor: Keiran Harris</i><br><i>Audio Engineering Lead: Ben Cordell</i><br><i>Technical editing: Dominic Armstrong</i><br><i>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</i></p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><h3><strong>What are emotions for?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Randy Nesse:</strong> I asked myself: anxiety is one emotion; there\u2019s a bunch of emotions \u2014 why do they exist at all? And I went reading in my psychiatry textbook and the entire chapter on emotions was one and a half pages. That\u2019s interesting. If you study heart disease and you look up in a medical textbook about heart disease, there\u2019s 100 pages about how the heart works and what the different parts are for. So then I went looking at emotions research, and I spent a full year just reading about emotions.</p><p>And I pretty much gave up at the end of that. I thought, everybody\u2019s arguing about how many emotions there are and what each emotion is for, and there\u2019s no agreement. And I really was very frustrated. Then I went back and found what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James\">William James</a> had to say about it \u2014 you know, William James, the great psychologist. He essentially said, \u201cI\u2019d as rather read the literature on emotions again as catalogue rocks on a New Hampshire farm. There\u2019s no order, there\u2019s no categories, there\u2019s no way of making sense of it.\u201d And I thought, well, if you can be frustrated, I can be frustrated too.</p><p>So I\u2019d looked at evolutionary approaches, and most of them were saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s the function of anger? What\u2019s the function of anxiety? What\u2019s the function of depression?\u201d And I asked myself, how do these emotions come to be? And the answer is that they\u2019re suites of coordinated responses that change lots of things, physiologically and cognitively and behaviorally, to cope with a particular kind of situation that\u2019s recurred over evolutionary time.</p><p>So people who felt the hot breath of a tiger on their shoulder and the lion salivating in front of them, who experienced the emotion of awe: those genes didn\u2019t stick around at all; they became lion lunch. While people who had this coordinated response that we call a panic attack or a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response\">fight/flight reaction</a> \u2014 where they start sweating, and they run really fast, and they breathe really fast, and their heart pounds, and their muscles get tight \u2014 those people were more likely to survive. So natural selection shaped a very specialised emergency response we call a panic attack.</p><p>And all of a sudden, with that insight, which I\u2019d never quite had before, I realised that every emotion needs to be understood not in terms of its function \u2014 which was the prevailing evolutionary view and the still continuing evolutionary view by many people \u2014 but instead, in what situation is this emotion useful, or was it useful for our ancestors? This also solved one of the biggest conundrums about emotion research: are the emotions separate little entities, or are they all overlapping on dimensions? No, you think about this from an evolutionary viewpoint, and they\u2019re like overlapping boughs on a tree, because they all evolved from each other. So this made sense of emotions.</p><p>So the question is: in what situation is anxiety useful? And the answer to that is: in situations where you\u2019re in danger of losing something, it\u2019s good to have a special mode of operation that alerts you to the possible loss, where you can take preventive action and avoid that situation in the future. And the next thing that happens is, hey, is there only one kind of loss? No. You can lose your finger, you can lose your friend, you can lose your mate\u2019s fidelity, you can lose your money, you can lose your health, you can fall off a building. And this helps to explain why there\u2019s so many different kinds of anxiety. Natural selection has gradually and only partially differentiated kinds of anxiety to cope with those different kinds of possible losses.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What's the point of sadness and depression?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Randy Nesse:</strong> So this takes us back to this distinction between sadness and depression. Anxiety is protecting us against losses, as possible, and keeping us from going back in situations that cause losses. If you have a loss that causes sadness, sadness doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s useful \u2014 because, hey, the loss has already happened, what are you going to do about it? But in fact, there\u2019s a lot you can do about something if you\u2019ve lost something.</p><p>If your child has just been washed out into the surf, you can swim out after your child, you can tell other kids to get off the beach, you can prevent any of your children from ever going in the ocean again, you can get sympathy and help from other relatives. There are all these things you can do to prevent further losses immediately and further losses in the future.</p><p>And if you lose your driver\u2019s licence, you can get a different kind of wallet, so you\u2019re not as likely to lose it in the future. It\u2019s really good. If you say the wrong thing to your spouse and she won\u2019t talk to you for a week, you can learn to stop saying things like that. It\u2019s very good to feel sad and upset about making mistakes that cause losses.</p><p>Where this really becomes awful, though, is losses of a loved one. I spent three years of my life delving into a very detailed database where we looked at people who had experienced loss of a spouse. They were asked six months, 18 months, and 48 months later about all of the details, and we had a lot of information about them before they ever had the loss. And one of the questions was: is it true what we were all taught in psychiatry, that people who have ambivalent relationships need to get in touch with that ambivalence to get over their long-term grief? One of the profound findings from our research was that people who have ambivalent relationships before the loss don\u2019t have as much grief as other people: it\u2019s exactly the opposite of what we were all taught. Whoa.</p><p>Plus, the theory in psychiatry was always that delayed absent grief \u2014 people who don\u2019t grieve \u2014 really have a problem and you need to get them in touch with their grief. Or specifically, based on Freudian theory, I spent many hours upon the direction of my well-meaning supervisors trying to help people who are having bad long-term grief get in touch with their anger towards the bereaved, because Freud\u2019s idea was that suppressed anger was causing depression. I mean, everybody has anger towards everybody at some time, so you can always find something like that. But in our data, we found no hint that people who didn\u2019t grieve immediately had more grief later; it was quite the opposite.</p><p>What we really did discover that was profound in our study is that a lot of people who experienced a lot of grief at six months didn\u2019t remember anything about it at 48 months. They said, \u201cNo, grief never bothered me much.\u201d Conversely, a lot of people who didn\u2019t experience any grief initially later remembered themselves as having experienced it. For me, it taught me once again that we humans are subjective beings. And the idea that we can remember things accurately about our emotional lives? Not really; that\u2019s just not how we\u2019re designed.</p><p>But now you\u2019re going to ask me, so why the hell is there grief, which causes so much awfulness? This is an unsolved problem, Rob. Some people say it\u2019s an accident of our system for attachment. Other people say that actually it\u2019s good to grieve the loss of a loved one \u2014 to help find them if in fact they\u2019re not dead; they\u2019re just lost in the savanna someplace, and to prevent other losses. This is a very profound question at the centre of <a href=\"https://www.randolphnesse.com/articles/grief\">bereavement research</a>.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The distinction between something being good for a person vs. being good for someone's genes</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Randy Nesse:</strong> Yeah, I find this a shocking thing, Rob, and a disturbing idea. I mean, I always thought that natural selection would shape us for health and happiness and cooperation and long, happy lives. And anything different from that meant there\u2019s something wrong with the system. But once you start studying how evolution shapes behaviour-regulation mechanisms, you realise that it doesn\u2019t give a damn about us, that doesn\u2019t give a damn about anything: it\u2019s a mindless process that any genes that make individuals do things that benefit transmitting more genes \u2014 which basically means having more children and taking good care of them and getting resources to do that \u2014 any genes that make that happen will become more frequent. Any tendencies genetically to do things that make your life end sooner, or have fewer offspring, or have fewer resources, those are going to go away \u2014 and the whole system doesn\u2019t care at all.</p><p>I mean, a lot of our bad feelings are about things that have to do with reproduction. And we should pause just a moment and note that Freud was right about one thing for sure: he said that ultimately, it all comes down to sex. And it\u2019s not sex \u2014 it\u2019s reproduction. Sex is just one small part of having offspring, and taking good care of them, and raising them to a point where they can reproduce. But fundamentally, all of these systems are designed to maximise numbers of offspring and the benefits to relatives.</p><p>And a lot of times that makes us miserable. Bad things happen to our kids. Hey, that\u2019s not us, but we\u2019re wired \u2014 appropriately so \u2014 to feel really, really bad if our kids are not doing well, and we try to help them. So these are things that are built in. You don\u2019t want to change them because they\u2019ll be awful to lose that kind of feeling. For sex, it\u2019s more of a different matter. When people can\u2019t have sex, they really, really hate it. And that\u2019s prewired, I think. It\u2019d be nice to just tell yourself, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care about that, because that\u2019s about my genes and not me.\u201d But actually, that doesn\u2019t help a bit.</p><p>Striving for status, however: a lot of your work with 80,000 Hours, I think, has to do with people pursuing careers. And it\u2019s always a challenge to figure out how grand a goal to set, and what to do when you\u2019re not making progress towards a relatively grand goal.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How is it that severe depression can be really common?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Randy Nesse:</strong> This is, I think, the most important unanswered question in mood research. We need to try to understand severe depression in terms of how ordinary low mood is dysregulated. There is something called \u201ckindling\u201d at the foundation of a lot of depression research. It comes from epilepsy research, really: if you induce seizures in an animal by putting electrical probes in the brain, it makes it more easy for them to have seizures in the future with lower stimulus of a drug or electrodes.</p><p>And there\u2019s an analogy here with depression: people who have episodes of depression go into depression more likely the next time, with fewer losses and lower stimuli, and that\u2019s usually been interpreted as something in the depression harming the brain \u2014 and in fact, there are some brain changes that are associated with depression. But another evolutionary interpretation is that there\u2019s a system that adjusts how easily depression goes off, depending on what experiences you\u2019ve had. And if you\u2019ve had repeated experiences of failure, then going into the mode that\u2019s appropriate for failure more easily becomes easier.</p><p>And now we\u2019re back into the same argument as we had for panic disorder: that is, it\u2019s a positive feedback process where the more depressed you are, the more you get depressed. And guess what? In modern life, this is such a huge problem for people because you can go to your room and you can shut the door and turn off your cell phone and then lie in your bed crying, saying, \u201cHow come nobody ever calls me?\u201d Because your cell phone is turned off. Or instead of calling somebody and going out and doing something, you could sit eating junk food and watching television, and that\u2019s just like a recipe for becoming more and more depressed. And on top of that, you can not get any exercise, which is another recipe for being more depressed.</p><p>This is not an adequate explanation, I want to emphasise, Rob: the real explanation for why low mood escalates into depression needs a lot more work. But there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s been done that nobody pays attention to. A fellow named Eric Klinger, a psychologist in Minnesota, has been writing back in the 1970s about the normal sequence of events when you\u2019re not making progress towards a goal. It\u2019s quite <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eZD1IyMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">profound work</a>. He points out that the first thing you do is wait for a while, and the next thing you do is try a different strategy. The next thing you do is give up completely for a while. Next thing you do is try another strategy, and the next thing you do is completely change your goal and recognise that you\u2019re never going to reach that goal.</p><p>There\u2019s also other good research on this. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutta_Heckhausen\">Jutta Heckhausen</a> \u2014 and again, I\u2019m going to really simplify subtle social science research, and <a href=\"https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/research/wrosch-lab/research-team/carsten-wrosch.html\">Carsten Wrosch</a> is another researcher who\u2019s worked on this \u2014 showing that people who keep pursuing unreachable goals spiral into worse and worse depression. [Heckhausen] was studying women who were approaching menopause, who wanted to have a child. That\u2019s a bad situation because you\u2019re doing more kinds of IVF and other kinds of things to try to have a child. It\u2019s not working, and just spending a lot of effort and time and worry trying to make something happen that might not work. And then when many of these women reach menopause and give up on that, their depression goes away.</p><p>This whole line of research has made me change how I see patients. And it used to be that I would always encourage patients, \u201cKeep trying, never give up. Your difficulty trying to do this is because of your depression. Don\u2019t let the depression get the better of you.\u201d And as I got older and I saw that not everybody can succeed in everything they\u2019re doing in life, I started just listening more, and being more sympathetic and saying, \u201cCan we talk more about why you feel you really have to apply to medical school for a fifth time?\u201d Or to somebody else, \u201cCan we talk more about why this is the only woman for you in the world, and you feel like you shouldn\u2019t go on living unless this person will love you?\u201d</p><p>So often people are pursuing something that\u2019s very, very important and you sympathise with them. I think the key to good therapy in these situations is not just to tell them, \u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to your depression,\u201d and it\u2019s not to just tell them, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to succeed at that. Give up.\u201d The thing is to talk with them about, \u201cDo you think that\u2019s working? How much effort do you want to keep putting into this? Are there other things that would be better for you and your family than continuing to put in this effort towards getting that particular promotion or making that particular person respect you?\u201d</p><p>On the other hand, it\u2019s not simple, because we all spend our lives pursuing unreachable goals. And the people who succeed grandly very often are the people who do pursue giant goals, and fail over and over again and keep trying. So nothing is simple here.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Is mental health actually getting worse?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I very frequently hear the claim that in countries like the US and the UK, mental health is getting worse, and more people have depression and anxiety than have ever had it before. I guess the data behind that has always seemed a little bit hazy to me, because it\u2019s something that\u2019s quite hard to figure out. Do you have a take on whether that is true or not?</p><p><strong>Randy Nesse:</strong> Yeah, a lot of my work has been with epidemiologists, and I always ask them about that. It\u2019s a great example of how information transmission is distorted, because everybody wants to hear something new and dramatic and horrible. The evidence is very poor for that. People went back in one study in Canada to visit the same people 30 years later, and ask the exact same people the exact same questions: no real evidence of increased anxiety or depression.</p><p>Furthermore, Ron Kessler, who\u2019s probably the world\u2019s leading epidemiologist for psychiatry, did a study during COVID \u2014 everybody was about \u201cthe COVID epidemic of mental health disorders\u201d \u2014 and he did an actual proper study, randomly selected people asking all the right questions. And his conclusion was that there\u2019s not really much evidence for increased rates of severe disorders; maybe a little bit of mild things. But that\u2019s not to say this doesn\u2019t deserve further study.</p><p>There\u2019s also a study in the UK of young people who use social media a lot, and it looks like maybe they do have increased rates of problems. So we need to keep an eye on this kind of thing. It also looks like during the cocaine epidemic in the \u201980s and early \u201990s, there may have been increases, because so many people were wrecking their lives with cocaine and methamphetamine.</p><p>But the whole idea, I mean, people used to think that back in the good old days, these things weren\u2019t problems. There\u2019s so much more attention to them because of television advertisements for antidepressants, and outreach programmes to identify people with depression \u2014 many of them sponsored by drug companies. They can be helpful, but they also get people thinking and more comfortable revealing their symptoms in a way that makes the news media seem to find lots more depression and anxiety \u2014 when it\u2019s very hard to actually do the studies and show that that\u2019s actually increasing that much.</p><p>Which isn\u2019t to say it isn\u2019t a gigantic problem. Anxiety and depression, just by themselves, cause medical morbidity \u2014 that is, inability to go to work and early death and things like that \u2014 equal to almost all other disorders: not just mental disorders, but other disorders. These are gigantic world problems. And again, this takes us back to the core problem: Who the hell designed this thing? How come we\u2019re all so vulnerable to so much useless suffering?</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The origins of morality and the problem of simplistic selfish-gene thinking</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Randy Nesse:</strong> So the reason I wrote those articles about psychoanalysis was because of talking with one of the wonderful biologists at the University of Michigan, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._Alexander\">Dick Alexander</a>, and one of the wonderful biologists of our time, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Trivers\">Robert Trivers</a>. They had both written articles suggesting that the reason we have an unconscious is so that we can pursue our own selfish motives without knowing it, and better deceive other people and accomplish our goals. So you can tell somebody you love them passionately with a full heart, and then just have sex with them and leave the next day. That was kind of the simplistic version of the argument.</p><p>And I thought, well, that sounds awfully cynical. Not only that, but it doesn\u2019t match what I\u2019m seeing in my practice. I\u2019m seeing people who lie awake nights wondering if they accidentally didn\u2019t smile at somebody, or if they accidentally took a person\u2019s parking spot. You know, people are very sensitive. How is it possible that we have these feelings of moral obligation and shame and guilt, even towards people we\u2019re not related to? I mean, the great discovery by Bill Hamilton and George Williams of if you do things for your kin who share your genes, you can sacrifice a lot for them because they have the same genes, that\u2019s called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection\">kin selection</a>.</p><p>But I\u2019ve become fascinated by the origins of morality and very distressed by the possibility that selfish-gene thinking can make people cynical. And I\u2019ve seen it make people cynical. They say natural selection can only preserve genes that make us have more offspring, and therefore everything we do is basically selfish. Well, everything we do is basically in the interests of our genes in the long run, on the average. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re all being selfish. And in fact, selfish people don\u2019t do very well at all. The people who do best, we can tell from an evolutionary viewpoint, on average are those who have a moral sense and those who are loyal to their friends. We know this because most people are like that, and people who aren\u2019t like that don\u2019t do very well \u2014 except in large, great places where they can get away with stuff and move on to a different town another time.</p><p>So this led me to literally decades of trying to understand this. I first did what\u2019s called commitment theory and did a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Capacity-Commitment-Randolph-Nesse/dp/0871546221\">whole book on evolution and commitment</a>. But then gradually, I followed the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jane_West-Eberhard\">Mary Jane West-Eberhard</a>, an insect biologist who talks about what she calls \u201csocial selection.\u201d And her point is so simple and so profound. She says that just as individuals pick out the best potential sexual partner, creating extreme traits like a peacock\u2019s tail \u2014 and that\u2019s why the peacock\u2019s tail really drags the peacocks down, but it\u2019s beneficial to the peacock\u2019s genes, even though not to the peacock \u2014 she says that just as that happens for sexual selection, we also pick our social partners, and we\u2019re trying to find some social partner who has things to offer, like resources and integrity and caring about us and the like.</p><p>And I took that idea and ran with it, and wrote <a href=\"https://www.randolphnesse.com/articles/altruism\">several articles</a> about partner choice as the way that natural selection shapes our capacities for morality and genuine relationships that are not just exchanging favours. Because real good relationships are not just exchanging favours. Or you care about somebody, and you don\u2019t want a relationship with somebody who says, \u201cYou invited me over to dinner, so I\u2019m going to invite you over to dinner.\u201d No, that\u2019s not how it works. The way it works for most people is, \u201cI really like you. Let\u2019s have some time together.\u201d Isn\u2019t it wonderful that we\u2019re not like chimpanzees? We really have capacities for genuine morality and love and friendship. It\u2019s astounding.</p><p>And nothing about selfish-gene theory makes that untrue. We need an explanation. I think the explanation is that we are constantly trying to be the kind of person other people want to be a partner with, and there\u2019s big competition for that. There\u2019s a lot of good psychological work about competitive altruism, where people compete to be more altruistic than others, and I think there\u2019s a good reason for that.</p><p>I\u2019m going to wrap this up by going back to social anxiety and guilt. Why do people have so much social anxiety? Because being very sensitive is generally a good thing for your genes, if not necessarily for you. And why do people have so much guilt and worry so much that they might have accidentally offended somebody? Because having that moral sense really is very important. People who don\u2019t have that moral sense don\u2019t have very many friends \u2014 or at least their friends are just friends who want to get something and trade favours, instead of friends who will actually care for them when they really need help.</p><p>But I think a big reason why evolutionary psychology hasn\u2019t caught on more is because a lot of people have a simplistic version of selfish-gene theory: they think it implies cynicism and it implies everybody\u2019s just out to have as much sex as they can. But taking a step back, and looking at how natural selection shapes our capacities for morality and loving relationships, I think is the antidote that can make all of this grow in a healthy way.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "jHm7Rp2ALXk9iGkcp", "title": "AUKUS Military AI Trial", "postedAt": "2024-02-14T14:52:31.099Z", "htmlBody": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>This summary post covers some recent developments released regarding AUKUS in the AI sphere. They are reported in a fragmented manner online across the government websites of three countries and I thought I would bring them together here. Please note that all of this information is available online via Google - I don\u2019t have access to any other information than that so I can\u2019t really answer questions that you can\u2019t answer yourselves.</p><h3>AUKUS</h3><p>AUKUS is an acronym which stands for Australia (A), United Kingdom (UK), and United States (US) - the three major powers <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210927191633/https://www.pm.gov.au/media/australia-pursue-nuclear-powered-submarines-through-new-trilateral-enhanced-security\">collaborating on a number of major military projects</a> intended towards the stability of the Indo-Pacific and the wider world. The trilateral security partnership includes <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220405233228/https://www.pm.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/aukus-fact-sheet.pdf\">nuclear submarines, cyber mechanisms, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, electronic warfare</a>, and other focuses. The UK Government describes the nuclear submarines as \u2018Pillar 1\u2019 and the other <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9842/\">AI and cyber elements as \u2018Pillar 2\u2019</a> of the agreement.</p><p>AI is set to be a significant part of Pillar 2, with all three powers investing heavily in military AI. These public document disclosures have shown a focus on accelerating adoption of AI within military capability, and improving the resilience of autonomous and AI-enabled systems in contested environments, as well as mentioning defence against AI-enhanced threats.&nbsp; This is not surprising given how rapidly AI is being adopted into military technology (<a href=\"https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/fora102&amp;div=105&amp;id=&amp;page=\">according to the research available</a>). RAND released an <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3079-1.html\">in-depth report on AI and AUKUS</a> recently examining how each of the states and third parties are attempting to develop military AI responsibly.</p><h3>AI Trials</h3><p>Some AUKUS AI trials have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Codmq2PJwM\">taken place in the UK</a>, though the most recent trial took place between the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lS1H3jjWkY\">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and the UK\u2019s armed forces in Australia</a>. The intention of the trial was to identify and resolve vulnerabilities of autonomous systems in the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Though there is little information on what was tested and what the results were (for obvious reasons) it does point to a much larger co-operation on AI between governments in the military sphere than previous expected. There\u2019s no real other equivalent of this in the world, yet. It is also noticeable how much of a leading role the UK are taking, despite the comparative size of the countries - though the external view may not correlate to the internal reality.</p><p>I wonder whether there was any autonomous vs autonomous simulations or trials, especially considering we are once again entering an age of major nations at war. We have had some some robot-on-robot fighting in the Ukraine War, but this is limited mostly to drone-on-drone ramming attacks and in some instances via naval warfare - but all robotics in those instances were (as far as I'm aware) human-controlled.</p><h3>Impacts</h3><p>The trends here display a strengthening collaboration between major military powers in terms of military AI at a scale not anticipated by contemporary literature. It is also unusually public, most likely due to the sheer amount of public spending on the project and the<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-14/aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal-announced/102087614\"> criticism the project has received for its cost</a>. It is somewhat refreshing to see mention of AI Safety in there where it is loosely alluded to in terms of governance mechanisms, but those mechanisms will be largely secret from the public which makes it more difficult to analyse.</p><p>More specialist research is needed in this area to explore how this partnership will affect the wider AI Governance landscape.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Further Research</h3><p>Highly impactful future AI Governance research could look at:</p><p>&nbsp;1. How exceptions and derogations in current AI Governance regimes could influence military AI systems</p><p>2. Compliance and governance mechanisms for military-specific AI systems</p><p>3.

We spoke with 80,000 Hours to separate software and \u201cphysical\u201d engineering into two different tags, which they implemented in October 2022. This has been a huge help for the High Impact Engineers community. At that time, I set up email notifications to receive alerts when new jobs were posted to the 80,000 Hours job board using the \u201cEngineering\u201d job tag.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs0o0yzx0v2a\"><sup><a href=\"#fns0o0yzx0v2a\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Speaking with other career coaches and community builders, there is a consensus that there is a general lack of information on the landscape of \u201cEA jobs\u201d. Out of curiosity, I put this analysis of engineering jobs on the 80k job board together in ~8 hours. I expect 80k is probably in a better position to run these kinds of evaluations of the landscape of impactful jobs, but I thought that it would be helpful and of interest to the High Impact Engineers community and potentially the wider EA community to see these statistics. I focus only on jobs tagged \u201cengineering\u201d on the 80k job board, but I expect similar analyses could be made with other tags.</p><p>After putting this report together, I shared it with Conor Barnes from 80,000 Hours to review. All the notes from 80k are from his feedback, which is greatly appreciated!</p><h2>1.2 Some Caveats</h2><p>Since I received these notifications via email over the past 15 months, most of the jobs from the notifications are no longer open. This means that the \u201cType of engineering\u201d and the \u201cCountry\u201d data are the most likely to be inaccurate without access to the original job description. I have made my best guess to fill in this data according to the job titles, trying to find similar open roles at the companies, and doing general research on the organisations\u2019 websites.</p><p>I have tried not to delete these email notifications, but I may have deleted some. As a result, this data set may be incomplete. However, I don\u2019t think this detracts too much from many of the conclusions that can be drawn from this set of data.</p><p>Finally, here are some caveats on my views on the 80k job board. I\u2019m sure they would agree with me that their job board is not the definitive list of impactful jobs, or even the definitive list of EA jobs (whatever that means!). They do a great job at keeping on top of opportunities within and outside of the EA ecosystem, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there are lots of other impactful jobs that 80k might miss, or they might have a different model of impact than you do<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefov1x0aaiz3l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnov1x0aaiz3l\">[3]</a></sup></span>. As a result, I hope that readers will understand that this is&nbsp;<i>not</i> a reflection of the jobs that \u201cEA\u201d deems to be \u201cvaluable\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmvf5tdet4cm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmvf5tdet4cm\">[4]</a></sup></span>, but more an attempt to understand the opportunities advertised via 80,000 Hours and perhaps pinpoint any blind spots (for both 80k and High Impact Engineers).</p><h1>2 Analysis of Engineering Jobs on the 80,000 Hours Job Board</h1><h2>2.1 Data</h2><p>I gathered the data on engineering jobs from the notification emails, and the data on all new jobs and the total number of jobs were pulled from the fortnightly (now weekly!) update emails from the job board team.

The trend has remained high since, and I expect that this will continue to be the case (if not increase over time).</p><p>There are several possible reasons for this trend.</p><ol><li>80k could have increased their capacity and added more new jobs from July 2023 onwards, so the engineering jobs increased in number but the proportion of engineering jobs stayed the same.<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/zqkne76cas2q2gjbvqtz\"><i>Figure 5: Plot of the proportion of engineering jobs on the 80k job board over time</i><ol><li>As noted in section 2.2, the number of new jobs added to the job board remained relatively steady from July 2023.</li><li>This suggests to me that more attention has been given to engineering jobs specifically, or something correlated with engineering.</li></ol></li><li>I systematically deleted the notification emails from before July 2023.<ol><li>I don\u2019t believe that I have been systematically deleting the notification emails before July 2023, as I still have many of the other emails from 80k from that time period.

I think that this will help wider EA community to better appreciate and understand the role of engineering in helping to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems. I believe that as we learn more about different cause areas, we will continue to be able to engineer solutions to tackle them.</p><h2>2.4 Engineering Jobs by Cause Area</h2><p>I categorised each of the engineering jobs by their cause areas.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/s7nc60kdjma3uvpwymnw\"><figcaption><i>Figure 6: Pie chart showing the proportion of engineering jobs for each cause area</i></figcaption></figure><p>Half of the engineering jobs posted were for biosecurity, which was a larger proportion than I was expecting, but I did expect this cause area to be the largest segment. (This is explained by the push by 80k to include more technical biosecurity roles.)</p><p>The emerging technologies cause area jobs were usually somewhat related to AI safety, but I labelled them separately because they often also covered other emerging technologies like biotech or neurotech. Combining them (AI safety + emerging technologies) results in the second largest segment, but a few of the AI safety jobs labelled engineering might be better suited in the software engineering label<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefklufr3x18b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnklufr3x18b\">[6]</a></sup></span>. 80k note that they expect to be listing more opportunities in technical AI governance (e.g. compute governance), which benefit from an engineering skill set.</p><p>The lack of alternative proteins jobs was a little disappointing but understandable \u2013<a href=\"https://talist.org/job-board\">&nbsp;<u>T\u00e4list</u></a> has a comprehensive job board dedicated to alt proteins jobs, so fewer people would probably come to 80k for jobs in this industry. 80k links to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jobs.80000hours.org/?jobPk=3215\"><u>GFI alt protein database</u></a> and regularly republishes it. It\u2019s important to note that there are many engineering jobs in alt proteins, and this pie chart provides a somewhat longtermism-skewed selection of impactful jobs. 80k also mentioned that it\u2019s unclear how to prioritise amongst the many different alt proteins roles.</p><p>I was (pleasantly) surprised to see more climate change jobs appearing from around December 2023 onwards, considering that it is common in EA to encourage working on more neglected cause areas. It is much easier for engineers to work on climate change because there are more concrete bottlenecks and solutions to tackle.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefilydx6fd7ak\"><sup><a href=\"#fnilydx6fd7ak\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>I think there are more opportunities for engineers to contribute to nuclear disarmament and civilisation resilience than are shared via the 80k job board. I\u2019ve included a lot of those opportunities in our<a href=\"http://highimpactengineers.org/newsletter\">&nbsp;<u>monthly newsletter</u></a>.</p><p>In summary, the current landscape of engineering jobs on the 80k job board suggests that there is a high demand for engineers to work in biosecurity, but I think there are many missing opportunities in other cause areas.</p><h2>2.5 Engineering Jobs by Engineering Discipline</h2><p>Categorising engineering jobs by the relevant engineering discipline(s) was hard for 2 reasons:</p><ul><li>Engineering disciplines have a lot of overlap and sub-types, and I often find it hard to tell some engineering disciplines apart.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefezaxqt6ll3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnezaxqt6ll3\">[8]</a></sup></span></li><li>Jobs are often multidisciplinary.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefderrfqmlmsj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnderrfqmlmsj\">[9]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>As a result, I often assigned multiple engineering disciplines that seemed relevant to each job. A bar chart therefore shows the relative proportions of engineering disciplines better than a pie chart (because the engineering disciplines are not mutually exclusive).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/u5gsbxshjaqw1cw1xlrd\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/ljqbgijmocieac0e1ksx 141w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/zljmjaot3pzj8jgiybws 221w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/qgfhtpe6v82oaqyej27a 301w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/sqkjdek05bog8ft1wfuv 381w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/g1to2ny2va5tdvhyqst9 461w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/veebfkx6t7pxtygjuka5 541w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/yusrll4j3bluifjdmwes 621w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/r5tuz1tal7glhwbsc65a 701w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/byqgb39lcd4gb4rz4fw6 781w\"><figcaption><i>Figure 7: Bar chart showing the number of different engineering disciplines</i></figcaption></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, mechanical engineering makes up the largest proportion of engineering disciplines. This is because mechanical engineers are the most flexible in terms of their skillset and knowledge.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftnx07qy7fnq\"><sup><a href=\"#fntnx07qy7fnq\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>Since biosecurity makes up 50% of the jobs by cause area, bio(medical) engineering is in high demand. However, there are still opportunities for all kinds of engineers! I expect the proportion of electrical/electronic, materials, and potentially manufacturing engineering jobs to increase as 80k add more technical AI governance roles in the future.</p><h2>2.6 Engineering Jobs by Country</h2><p>Out of interest, I gathered data on where these jobs were based.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/A5RNKz8jHjJEDjSea/io6w0lc4lmrhxypwpt9w\"><figcaption><i>Figure 8: Pie chart showing the country locations of the engineering jobs on the 80k job board</i></figcaption></figure><p>I had to guess many of the locations of these roles using the locations of the organisations that were advertising, but I think this is fairly representative. It is sad but unsurprising that over \u00be of all the jobs are based in the US or UK, and very few (&lt;10) are based outside of the West. Even jobs in Europe are very underrepresented, despite having many organisations working on EA-aligned cause areas. This makes it difficult for our members based in places such as India, Mexico, Poland, etc. to meaningfully contribute to EA causes, or even to stay motivated. It seems unlikely that 80k has found all the impactful non-US/UK roles.</p><h1>3 Conclusion</h1><h2>3.1 Main Takeaways</h2><p>Even if the data collected here is incomplete, some meaningful conclusions can still be drawn. The current landscape of impactful engineering jobs advertised on the 80k board has a heavy skew towards biosecurity, and as a result, mechanical and bio(medical) are the most common types of engineering jobs on the job board.</p><p>Many of the jobs on the 80k board require engineers to be able to work from the US and UK, and there are also some positions based in Europe and Australia. Very few of 80k\u2019s advertised engineering jobs are based outside the West.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd21gplzejwg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd21gplzejwg\">[11]</a></sup></span></p><p>We can also conclude that people with engineering skills will continue to be needed to tackle the world\u2019s most pressing problems, whether by working directly on solutions and bottlenecks or advising policy to address challenges from emerging technologies. High Impact Engineers will continue encouraging and helping our members to plan impactful careers in these areas. If High Impact Engineers does more outreach outside of EA, reaching engineers in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries will probably be a higher priority if we want to fill these biosecurity roles; if there is a need to fill more technical AI governance roles, then we would reach out to engineers in the semiconductor industry.</p><h2>3.2 Recommendations</h2><p>This analysis shows that the engineering jobs on the 80k job board lack diversity along several axes: cause area, geographical location, and engineering discipline. As a community, we can contribute by recommending more diverse engineering jobs through this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airtable.com/app53PsYpHxJW61l3/shrEu1JyKS125SCKp\"><u>form</u></a>.</p><h2>3.3 Further Work</h2><p>If anyone can cross-reference the number of jobs with the engineering tag over time, that would help update credence in my analysis in section 2.</p><p>I will continue to collect data from the 80k emails to increase my understanding of the landscape of engineering jobs and how it will continue to change. I think 80k is in the best position to conduct these kinds of analyses, ideally also for other fields like software engineering, so that the wider EA community can understand the landscape of jobs in EA cause areas.</p><p>Other data I would be interested to gather from the 80k job board include:</p><ul><li>How many people applied for each position</li><li>How many of the candidates chosen were referred from the 80k job board</li><li>How 80k evaluate which jobs are added to the job board (note: this is answered on their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jobs.80000hours.org/faq\"><u>FAQ</u></a><u>)</u></li></ul><p>Ideally, I would have a fully integrated job board pulling engineering jobs from this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jobs.80000hours.org/\"><u>80k job board</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://talist.org/job-board\"><u>T\u00e4list job board</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/opportunities-board/\"><u>Effective Thesis job board</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ea-internships.pory.app/board\"><u>EA Opportunities job board</u></a>, and perhaps some climate change job boards like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://climatebase.org/\"><u>Climatebase</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmhvbe9h5mcj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmhvbe9h5mcj\">[12]</a></sup></span>.

Despite these increases, farmed animal advocacy remains underfunded.</p><p>We hope that this report can help us and other stakeholders to more rapidly and effectively build the farmed animal advocacy movement in Africa. We aim to use and amplify the growing momentum identified in this report and call on any individual or organisations interested in contributing to this cause to contact us and/or increase their resources and focus dedicated towards farmed animal welfare in Africa.&nbsp;</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p><strong>Industrial animal agriculture is expanding rapidly in Africa</strong>, with the continent projected to account for the largest absolute increase in farmed land animal numbers of any continent between 2012 and 2050 (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LtFjiPnj2hcHqNPEo/ticking-clock-the-rapid-rise-of-farmed-animals-in-africa\"><u>Kortschak, 2023</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Despite its vast scale, the issue is highly neglected by charitable funding.</strong> Lewis Bollard (<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/lewis-bollard-lessons-learned-in-farm-animal-welfare\"><u>2019</u></a>) estimated that farmed animal advocacy work in Africa received only USD 1 million in 2019, less than 1% of global funding for farmed animal advocacy. Farmed Animal Funders (<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/645be31efb5e013b9c6f4751/t/64cb9a7bb5b56917db63457a/1691064968896/FAF+State+of+the+Movement+Report+2021.pdf\"><u>2021</u></a>) estimated funding to Africa at USD 2.5 million in 2021, a significantly higher but still very low amount. Accordingly, activists and organisations on the ground cite a lack of funding as the main bottleneck for their work (<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fc0f83868612547ed5e8292/t/60a525b24157ab11159c1867/1621435842201/AAA_Landscape_Research_Report-Findings_From_AAA.pdf\"><u>Tan, 2021</u></a>).</p><p>Since 2021, Animal Advocacy Africa (AAA) has actively worked towards strengthening the farmed animal advocacy movement in Africa, with some focus on improving funding.&nbsp;<strong>With this report, we aim to understand the funding landscape for farmed animal advocacy in Africa in depth, identifying key actors, patterns, and trends.</strong> Notably, we focus on charitable grants and exclude any government funding that might be relevant as well. Our research aims to build transparency and enhance information on what is being done to help animals in Africa, which can help various stakeholders to make better decisions. While we focus on farmed animals, we also provide context on other animal groups.&nbsp;<strong>We hope that the findings from our analysis can contribute to funders shifting some of their resources from less neglected and potentially lower-impact projects to more neglected and potentially higher-impact ones.</strong></p><h2>Data basis</h2><p><strong>Based on the funding records of 131 funders</strong> that we suspected might have funded African animal causes in the past, <strong>we created a database of 2,136 records of grants towards animal projects in Africa</strong>. This grant data allowed us to base our analysis on real-world data, which provides an important improvement to previous research, which was typically based on self-reported surveys with funders and/or charities.</p><h2>Findings</h2><h3>Overall funding levels</h3><p>We estimate at an 80% confidence level that the funders in scope for this analysis granted a total of USD 25 to 35 million to animal-related causes in Africa in 2020. These grants had substantially increased from 2018 to 2020.</p><p><strong>Funding for animal causes in Africa shows interesting patterns that contrast, to a certain extent, with trends observed in the animal advocacy movement globally</strong> (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/why-farmed-animals/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators, 2024</u></a>). Wild animal and conservation efforts receive the most funding. Notably, the projects in this category do not follow the wild animal suffering approach typically discussed in Effective Altruism (EA), but have a more traditional conservationist focus. Working animals are the second most funded animal group, reflecting their significance in Africa. This is a strong contrast to the focus on companion animals in wealthier societies, which only receive a very minor share of funding in Africa. <strong>Farmed animals received only 1.7% of the total funding towards helping animals in Africa by the funders in scope in 2020.</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EgkZayryAnNm9iKhZ/tgunw7spjaixzauvxfav\"><figcaption><i>Share of funding to different animal groups in Africa in 2020</i></figcaption></figure><p>Based on this share, <strong>we expect the funders in scope for this analysis to have granted around USD 0.6 million to farmed animal causes in Africa in 2020</strong>, with our 80% subjective confidence interval ranging from USD 0.2 to 1.0 million<strong>.</strong></p><p>However, <strong>we observe a significant increase in funding towards farmed animals in Africa over time</strong>, particularly from 2020 onwards.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EgkZayryAnNm9iKhZ/rxywmd12wjfo08hliqzb\"><figcaption><i>Total amount granted to farmed animal projects by the funders in scope per year (only including known amounts / not estimating unknowns)</i></figcaption></figure><p>Accounting for these increases, <strong>we estimate at 70% confidence&nbsp;that total farmed animal funding for Africa was between USD 1.5 and 3 million in 2022</strong>, including unknowns such as funders not included in this analysis and the graph above.</p><p><strong>The report also reveals a strong and growing concentration of African farmed animal advocacy funding among a few major EA-aligned funders</strong>, underscoring the EA movement's crucial role for the cause.

According to Rethink Priorities (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/animal-advocacy-strategy-forum-2023-summary\"><u>2023</u></a>), in an optimal scenario, key decision-makers in the effective animal advocacy community would allocate 9.1% and 8.1% of total EAA resources respectively to Sub-Saharan Africa as well as North Africa and the Middle East. These shares are much larger than in the actual distribution, as explained above. The key decision-makers also think that \u201cexperts on the developing world or specific neglected but populous countries\u201d are the most pressing talent gap in the community. Additionally, Charity Entrepreneurship (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hpbaNabCDCfnhzc2P/ce-alert-2-new-interventions-for-february-march-2024\"><u>2023</u></a>) writes that they

animals is not clearly focused on one specific type of intervention. </strong>In 2020, the majority of funding was directed at plant-based outreach, education, and food provision programmes. Looking at the whole 2015-2022 period, we found that corporate outreach also received a substantial share of farmed animal funding, mostly dominated by cage-free campaigns. To a lesser extent, research and capacity building projects attracted significant shares as well. Political and legislative work received only a smaller share of the funding.</p><p><strong>South Africa took the leading role on the continent when it comes to farmed animal work</strong>, attracting ~65% of all farmed animal funding in 2020 and more than 30% between 2015 and 2022. This fact could be attributed to the country's more developed and industrialised economy and farming sector. This supports our perspective that most funding for farmed animal causes is aimed at addressing current industrial animal agriculture instead of preventing its emergence, the cause that we are focusing our efforts on (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LtFjiPnj2hcHqNPEo/ticking-clock-the-rapid-rise-of-farmed-animals-in-africa\"><u>Kortschak, 2023</u></a>). Kenya also received a substantial share of funding towards farmed animal work in Africa. Apart from these two clear leaders, Benin, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe were further noteworthy recipient countries.</p><p><strong>We found 83 organisations that received some funding for farmed animal work in Africa by the funders in scope in 2015-2022.</strong> Notably, our own organisation, Animal Advocacy Africa, despite being relatively new and small, has received a significant share of total African farmed animal funding. This highlights the low overall funding levels in this sector.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EgkZayryAnNm9iKhZ/fdc7rw5j1sozvqhagsc0\"><figcaption><i>Top ten organisations in Africa by funding amounts for farmed animal work between 2015 and 2022</i></figcaption></figure><p><strong>We have had interactions with most of the organisations in the top 30 farmed animal grant recipients.</strong> Some have been part of our capacity-building programme, others only took part in our pilot programme, while others only engaged with us in other capacity (e.g. for research purposes). <strong>We played a role in some organisations securing significant grants in the farmed animal space and suspect that our work at least somewhat contributed to the increase in funding towards farmed animal advocacy in Africa.</strong></p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>The findings from this report aim to encourage funders to shift more of their resources to farmed animal work in Africa.</p><p>Overall, <strong>we hope that this report can help us and other stakeholders to more rapidly and effectively build the farmed animal advocacy movement in Africa.

This could have quite severe consequences.</p><p>I would worry about ads on the main website; the risk of people brushing off 80k\u2019s key ideas and advice because they\u2019re served right alongside ads seems too high.</p><p>Likewise, it seems the podcast wouldn\u2019t make enough money to offset this risk: I crudely estimate that, if 80k podcasts ran a 60-second ad every hour in 2022, it would\u2019ve generated roughly $12,000 that year:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZmox0G910jw7I9jCoDC6vowz_PcrHRfFoW04G59XMA/edit\"><u>80k estimates</u></a> its podcast had 81,700 subscribers in 2022.</li><li>The cost per 1,000 listeners for a 60-second podcast ad is estimated at $25 (according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advertisecast.com/podcast-advertising-rates\"><u>AdvertiseCast</u></a>).</li><li>In 2022, the 80k podcast published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4663/how-long-will-it-take-to-listen-to-every-episode-of-the-80000-hours-podcast-released-in-2020/\"><u>60.46 hours</u></a> of content.</li><li>Putting these together, if subscribers listened to 10% of the podcast episodes in 2022, and 80k ran a 60-second ad every hour, it would\u2019ve made roughly $12,000 that year.<ul><li>This is a simple and very rough estimate, but I suspect it isn\u2019t off by an order of magnitude.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The newsletter is a special case, though: it would likely make more revenue than podcast ads (six figures per year), and distrust coming from newsletter ads seems less likely than distrust coming from website ads (by my intuition). After all, could one ad in each newsletter meaningfully alter people\u2019s views? Even if it\u2019s tastefully sized and placed at the end? It seems newsletter subscribers trust 80k enough that one ad per newsletter won\u2019t significantly disillusion them\u2014they\u2019re intrigued enough to have subscribed.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I\u2019m not saying newsletter ads are a sure-fire success. Even if the probability of increased skepticism is small, its harms might be significant enough to offset ~six figures of increased effective philanthropy every year.</p><p>However, I think 80k should consider it. Ideally, someone should estimate the probability it undermines people\u2019s trust in 80k. I would have done this myself if I could, but I couldn\u2019t find any helpful research or surveys\u2014relevant research tends to focus on viewers\u2019 trust in advertisers, not the platform that serves ads (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417420306618\"><u>here\u2019s an example</u></a>). <strong>Perhaps surveying 80k\u2019s newsletter subscribers could be informative</strong>, although survey respondents might be less likely than the average person to&nbsp;eschew 80k because of ads. It\u2019s uncertain, but ads might be an unconventional path to meaningful impact.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9rlvcqbvfz\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9rlvcqbvfz\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BktHvCqZ5yoNbA9iC/roviwwmyqxffnzimavko\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BktHvCqZ5yoNbA9iC/epegdank1wlaqvbuhs50\"></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnh0fzjvbg048\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefh0fzjvbg048\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><img style=\"width:51.31%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BktHvCqZ5yoNbA9iC/ghja4kpcbxmo6aqxbbrr\"><img style=\"width:50.82%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BktHvCqZ5yoNbA9iC/nlpn7vgrvu9tjkovje6p\"></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnxzbuerc8e8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefxzbuerc8e8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BktHvCqZ5yoNbA9iC/gul4vhpss3i8asbqociv\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BktHvCqZ5yoNbA9iC/whazzrna5sj8ippvbawz\"></p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "NicholasNicholas"}}, {"_id": "GaCRw4fj9FEhQxnQ4", "title": "Meta EA Regional Organizations (MEAROs): An Introduction", "postedAt": "2024-02-20T19:00:39.003Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Thank you to the <strong>many</strong> MEARO leaders who provided feedback and inspiration for this post, directly and through their work in the space.</i></p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>In the following post, I will introduce MEAROs\u2014Meta EA Regional Organizations\u2014a new term for a long-established segment of the EA ecosystem. I will provide an overview of the roles MEAROs currently serve and a sketch of what MEAROs could look like and could accomplish if more fully resourced. Though MEAROs have existed as long as EA itself, I think the concept has been underdefined, underexplored, and consequently underutilized as a tool for solving the world\u2019s most pressing problems. I\u2019m hopeful that giving MEAROs a name will help the community at large better understand these organizations and prompt wider discussion on how to strategically develop them over time.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>By way of background, I have worked full-time on a MEARO\u2014<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.nyc/\">Effective Altruism New York City</a>\u2014since August 2021. In my role with EA NYC, I consider my closest collaborators not only the direct&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.nyc/our-team\"><u>EA NYC team</u></a> but also the leaders of other MEAROs, especially those who likewise receive&nbsp;a portion of their organization funding through <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/community-building-grants\"><u>Centre for Effective Altruism\u2019s Community Building Grants (CBG) Program</u></a>. As I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/33o5jbe3WjPriGyAR/announcing-the-meta-coordination-forum-2023?commentId=hxF7cSYAiMtsujAYz\"><u>previously</u></a> stated on the Forum, before the FTX collapse, there was a heavy emphasis on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ewCdRr2ZBkrwXMaoX/making-community-building-a-more-attractive-career-path-1\"><u>making community building a long-term and sustainable career path</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0v1ke4k7nale\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0v1ke4k7nale\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As a result, there are now dozens of people working professionally and often full-time on MEAROs.</p><p>This is a notable and very recent shift: Many MEAROs were founded shortly after EA was named, or morphed out of communities that predated EA\u2122. Most MEAROs were volunteer-run for the majority of their existence. CEA launched the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ea-community-building-grants\"><u>CBG Program</u></a> in 2018 and slowly expanded its scope through 2022. EA NYC, for example, was volunteer-run for over seven years before receiving funding for two full-time employees through the CBG Program in Summer 2020. This has led to a game of catch-up: <strong>MEAROs have professionalized, but many in the broader EA community still think of MEAROs as volunteer-operated clubs, rather than serious young nonprofits.</strong></p><p>We also now have significantly more brainpower thinking about ways to maximize impact through the MEARO structure,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0lqko60gs14q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0lqko60gs14q\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;a topic I do not feel has been adequately explored on the Forum. (I recommend Jan Kulveit's posts from October 2018\u2014<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/a6LXyzYPtCyEZmpS6/why-develop-national-level-effective-altruism-organizations\"><i>Why develop national-level effective altruism organizations?</i></a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QofjcgYDbCxZQe8nQ/suggestions-for-developing-national-level-effective-altruism\"><i>Suggestions for developing national-level effective altruism organizations</i></a>\u2014for among the most relevant early discourse I'm aware of on the Forum.) I hope this post can not only give the broader EA ecosystem a better sense of the roles MEAROs currently serve but also open discussion and get others thinking about how we can use MEAROs more effectively.</p><h1>Defining MEAROs</h1><p><strong>MEAROs work to enhance and support the EA movement and its objectives within specific regions.</strong> This description is intentionally broad as MEAROs\u2019 work varies substantially between organizations and over time. My working definition of MEAROs requires the following characteristics:</p><h3>1. Region-Specific Focus</h3><p>True to EA values, MEAROs maintain a global outlook and are committed to solving the world\u2019s most pressing problems, but do this by promoting and supporting the EA movement and its objectives within a particular geographical area. The region could be a city, state, country, or alternative geographical unit, and the MEARO\u2019s activities and initiatives are typically tailored to the context and needs of that region.</p><h3>2. Focus on Meta-EA</h3><p>Meta Effective Altruism\u2014the branch of the EA ecosystem MEAROs sit within\u2014describes efforts to improve the efficiency, reach, and impact of the effective altruism movement itself.</p><p>Vaidehi provides a more comprehensive introduction in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Wx7LuMHbhABrtYrv9/what-is-meta-effective-altruism\"><i><u>What is meta Effective Altruism?</u></i></a>. I will share her tentative definition here:</p><blockquote><p>Meta Effective Altruism is one of the main focus areas of the Effective Altruism movement. It can include research to help direct efforts (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Wx7LuMHbhABrtYrv9/what-is-meta-effective-altruism#Global_Priorities_Research\">Global Priorities Research</a>) and efforts to build or support the EA movement and its members (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Wx7LuMHbhABrtYrv9/what-is-meta-effective-altruism#EA_Movement_Building\">EA Movement Building</a>).&nbsp; Some meta EA projects can also be focused on specific cause areas, professions or more (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Wx7LuMHbhABrtYrv9/what-is-meta-effective-altruism#Within_Cause_Meta\">Within-Cause Meta</a>).&nbsp; Typically, meta effective altruism is at least one step removed from direct impact.</p></blockquote><p>Though MEAROs may operate with an internal cause prioritization, they maintain a foundation of cause neutrality. They engage in work that spans EA causes, either by touching on multiple causes directly or by engaging in work that is cross-cause applicable.</p><h3>3. Organization Structure</h3><p>Finally, MEAROs require an organizational structure. Typically, MEAROs will be nonprofits and either independently incorporated or fiscally sponsored. They will have a board of directors, staff, and in some cases formal membership structures. This is distinguished from less formal structures, such as clubs, meetup groups, and other arrangements that are less defined, less stable, and more susceptible to fluctuations over time.</p><p>In addition to creating greater stability, establishing an independent, registered organization is a prerequisite for many of the services MEAROs provide and is key to the project of building a global EA infrastructure within regions.</p><h2>Current MEAROs</h2><p>As noted, MEAROs can exist at different levels of geographical units. Notably, some national MEAROs are involved in substantial regional coordination. An example of this is the Nordic Council, which consists of a representative from each Nordic-Baltic national group. More typically, MEAROs are specific to a country (such as EA Germany or EA Philippines) or a city (such as EA NYC or EA Berlin). In some cases, the boundaries and scope of a MEARO are still being decided, as in the case of the Bay Area of California, where several different regional organizations are currently in development and may merge. In other cases, a MEARO may change in scope over time, such as when EA London expanded and rebranded as EA UK or when a university club expands into a MEARO to encompass its home city.</p><p>At present, <a href=\"https://data.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">CEA\u2019s Community Building Grants (CBG) Program</a> funds twelve national MEAROs, two city MEAROs, and EA Anywhere, a community for people interested in effective altruism to connect, regardless of geographic location.</p><p>The EA Infrastructure Fund is the other leading MEARO funder. Though EA Funds lists grants in its <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/grants?sort=round\">public database</a>, I had difficulty creating a comprehensive list of MEARO grantees because some recipients are listed as individuals, rather than as organizations. I would love a more accessible and comprehensive public listing.</p><p>Other MEAROs may operate without formal or institutional funding.</p><h3>MEARO Size</h3><p>Current MEAROs operate with very small teams. Most CEA-funded MEAROs operate with just two full-time staff. Some operate with only one full-time employee. MEAROs with four or more staff are considered large.</p><p>This presents challenges. As <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/jan_kulveit?from=post_header\">Jan Kulveit</a> noted in<i> </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QofjcgYDbCxZQe8nQ/suggestions-for-developing-national-level-effective-altruism\"><i><strong>Suggestions for developing national-level effective altruism organizations</strong></i></a><strong>:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Personal resources</strong></p><p>A dedicated group of approximately 5 people seems sufficient for creating a national-level organization. It is possible to found something with an even smaller team of 2 or 3 people, but in that case, the initial focus should probably be on attracting more co-founders (usually via a network of personal connections).</p><p>The current sample is small, but it seems that smaller teams suffer from more significant variance in energy over time; for instance, if people are exhausted after an event and catching up with their other work, it may be hard to utilize newly generated interest or engage newcomers.</p></blockquote><h3>Inter-MEARO Relationships</h3><p>By and large, MEARO staff are a loose team of sorts. We are in regular communication with each other, we have a shared and evolving sense of what MEAROs are and can be, and our strategic approaches intertwine and are mutually reinforcing. We essentially function as extended colleagues in a niche profession that feels very distinct, even from other \u201con the ground\u201d meta-EA community building (such as professional or university groups). There is a distinct zeitgeist among MEAROs. I have been consistently amazed by how MEARO leaders seem to independently land on the same conclusions and strategic directions as our peers across the globe, \u201cmultiple discovery\u201d if you will. This spirit is not captured in the larger EA discourse, from the Forum to conversations I have with non-MEARO community leaders. And this MERAO zeitgeist is evolving rapidly.</p><h1>MEARO Value (Present)</h1><p>MEAROs currently serve a variety of functions, some of which are unique to MEAROs and some of which overlap with work in other parts of the EA ecosystem. These functions are often less obvious but can have a profound impact on individuals, organizations, and the trajectory of EA as a whole.</p><p>For a quicker skim, EA Germany offers an outline of their foundational programs in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zxSdBkN6cggkE8vv6/ea-germany-s-strategy-for-2023#Foundational_Programs\"><u>this Forum post</u></a>. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/a6LXyzYPtCyEZmpS6/why-develop-national-level-effective-altruism-organizations\"><i>Why develop national-level effective altruism organizations?</i></a> also offers this brief summary:</p><blockquote><p>From a functional perspective, they fulfill a variety of roles such as translation, localizing effective altruism in their country, creating talent pipelines, representing effective altruism in interactions with local institutions and media, and incubating EA-aligned projects. From a structural perspective, in some cases, they form a layer in between central organizations and local groups.</p></blockquote><p>I want to highlight functions many MEAROs serve that may be less visible to the average EA community member. This list is far from comprehensive and I encourage comments covering ground I've missed. The categories I use are also not definitive and there are likely better ways of grouping MEAROs' work.</p><h2><strong>1. Regional Representation of EA</strong></h2><p>MEAROs play an outsized role in shaping the perception of EA in entire regions because they are often the first point of contact with EA for people within their region. Some examples of this include representing EA at events; representing EA to other (non-EA) organizations, governments, and reporters; regional media and communications work more broadly; and translating EA materials into the local language.</p><h3>A. Media</h3><p>Journalists interested in covering EA often turn to MEAROs because they are a legible part of the EA ecosystem. For non-English publications, MEARO materials in the local language may be particularly accessible. In lieu of a robust, global, and regionalized EA press office, MEAROs serve a crucial function in representing EA well to global media. <a href=\"https://archive.is/UxMio\">This Dutch coverage</a> of EA Netherlands last year is one example. MEARO staff are often able to access media training and are well-positioned to coordinate with EA organizations and with CEA's communications team, leading to more polished and intentional comms.</p><h3><strong>B. Translations</strong></h3><p>Around <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266808/the-most-spoken-languages-worldwide/\">81%</a> of the world does not speak English, and only <a href=\"https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-many-people-speak-english-and-where-is-it-spoken#:~:text=Out%20of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20approximately%207.8%20billion%20inhabitants%2C%201.35%20billion%20speak%20English.%20The%20majority%20aren%E2%80%99t%20native%20English%20speakers%2C%20however.%20About%20360%20million%20people%20speak%20English%20as%20their%20first%20language.\">4.6%</a> of the global human population are native English speakers. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/F7qzoWhiCTK8KpuTM/the-privilege-of-native-english-speakers-in-reaching-high#Poor_inclusion_of_non_native_English_speakers_means_missed_perspectives\">Poor inclusion of non-native English speakers comes at a cost.</a> The translation of EA materials into local languages plays a significant role in both who is exposed to EA ideas and how they are exposed. Open Philanthropy explains their excitement about translation work <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CqYHPLCJaFdLn8gp6/open-phil-is-seeking-bilingual-people-to-help-translate-ea\">here</a>. MEAROs are among the groups best positioned to translate EA materials into their local language in a high-fidelity and, perhaps, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jYm3CKTYWYbfruGza/considerations-for-ea-content-localisation\">localized</a>, fashion. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cTfEv6zAakfyxrbQu/ea-content-in-french-announcing-ea-france-s-translation\">EA France's translation work</a> is one of many examples.</p><h3>C. Other Channels</h3><p>MEAROs often fill a gap in EA representation, from relationship-building with non-EA organizations, to presentations to non-EA audiences, to government relations. Arguably, in many cases it would be better for another entity to serve this role in place of the MEARO, but where there is no better choice, MEAROs are poised to fill the need.</p><h2><u>2. Regional Infrastructure</u></h2><p><u>MEAROs identify community-level infrastructural needs and create and operate systems to address those needs. This lightens others\u2019 loads and helps multiply the impact of others\u2019 work.</u></p><h3>A. EOR Services</h3><p>Many national MEAROs offer employer-of-record services, enabling the legal employment of people working for EA projects or on EA grants. These services can be career-determining, as individuals may otherwise be forced to decide between pursuing an impactful job opportunity or staying in their country of residence. EOR services can also provide a greater sense of stability and normalcy for those funded by personal grants.</p><h3>B. Fiscal Sponsorship</h3><p>MEAROs also sometimes offer an adjacent service, providing fiscal sponsorship for local projects. Fiscal sponsorship saves time, money, and overhead for highly engaged EAs by shouldering the operational burden, such as receiving grants for local groups, paying invoices, and managing accounting. Fiscal sponsorship can also make donations to newer and smaller projects tax-deductible.</p><h3>C. Office Spaces &amp; Coworking</h3><p>Separately, some MEAROs have established and overseen the operation of in-person offices and coworking spaces, such as EA Sweden\u2019s office space in Stockholm and EA Netherlands\u2019 office in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effectiefaltruisme.nl/office/\"><u>Amsterdam</u></a>. Jonathan Michel, who previously oversaw Oxford\u2019s Trajan House, details the impact of office spaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pXrDmqDA63Wrffxmo/my-job-ea-office-manager\"><u>here</u></a>. MEARO-operated office spaces offer unique value distinct from cause-specific or organization-specific offices. They create local infrastructure and community hubs, and enable professionals from all over the world to engage in impact projects from their current location. In places where a dedicated office does not exist, MEAROs sometimes coordinate coworking in alternative venues.</p><h2><u>3. Community Building and Sustenance</u></h2><p>MEAROs oversee a variety of programs designed to support individuals, organizations, communities, and projects.</p><h3>A. Individualized Support</h3><p>MEAROs support individuals at all stages of their impact journeys. Whether a newcomer, a prospective career-switcher, an EA professional, or an organizer, MEARO staff provide free, personalized support and guidance. Some examples of this include fellowships and educational programming, networking and direct introductions to professionally relevant contacts, knowledge-sharing calls and training, career advising, donor advising, and much more.</p><h3>B. Group Support and Incubation</h3><p>Relatedly, MEAROs often provide local group support and group incubation. This might include groups within universities, workplaces, and smaller geographic areas (as in the case of national MEAROs that support city-level MEAROs). This might also include cause-specific groups, groups focused on a particular profession, or affinity groups (such as a space for underrepresented genders in EA or EA parents).</p><h3>C. Community Health</h3><p>The collective well-being of a community is multifaceted and requires care, thoughtfulness, and energy to cultivate and sustain, and in some cases may require culture-specific understanding. Many MEAROs have a dedicated community health contact who serves as an additional resource alongside\u2014rather than a replacement for\u2014CEA\u2019s community health work. By having multiple point people available, we hope to offer our community members more options for reporting and addressing their concerns, as well as a consistent, familiar, local resource.</p><h3>D. Event Programming</h3><p>MEAROs are also the driving force behind in-person EA event programming. This might include large-scale events, such as retreats, annual meetings, or EAGx conferences. This may also include smaller events, such as speaker presentations, socials, networking events, reading and discussion groups, or subcommunity events. For many in the EA community, MEARO-led events are the primary way they first meet others in their local EA community.</p><h2>4. Knowledge Management &amp; Thought Leadership</h2><p>MEAROs are afforded a unique birds-eye view of the EA ecosystem due to the nature of their work. As a result, MEAROs are positioned well to identify gaps in the ecosystem and mechanisms for filling these gaps, and to serve as a buffer between and connector for EA institutions and individuals in their regions.</p><h3>A. Coordination and Knowledge Hubs</h3><p>MEAROs act as knowledge hubs, connecting people to ideas/knowledge, resources, and people. For example, many EA organizations ask MEAROs for recommendations when hiring and MEARO staff often track individuals in our networks who may be good candidates for job opportunities. MEAROs also connect organizations to event spaces, collaborators, prospective funders, and other resources.</p><h3>B. Operational Infrastructure</h3><p>MEAROs oversee community-level infrastructure, such as CRMs, Slacks, newsletters, websites, job boards, and knowledge management systems, facilitating seamless communication, knowledge sharing, and networking within the community.</p><h3>C. Thought Leadership</h3><p>More broadly, due to the functions and positioning described above, MEAROs are particularly well-positioned to serve as thought leaders for their region and the community as a whole, and to engage a diversity of individuals and organizations in strategy-setting and coordination.</p><h1>MEARO Value (Potential)</h1><p>Due to their early stage, small team size, and constrained funding,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefijr2l9hx3i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnijr2l9hx3i\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;MEAROs are currently only harnessing a fraction of their potential. The following are ideas that have not been sufficiently explored, but that I want to share here to prompt conversation and encourage more brainstorming. Some of these might be bad ideas. Maybe even <i>very</i> bad! But determining that should be a discussion the broader EA community can weigh in on.</p><h2>1. Scaling Up of Everything Described Above</h2><p>The ways MEAROs currently provide value are highly scalable. MEAROs are young and their teams are small, meaning further resourcing could significantly expand the reach and impact of any number of their current functions. What would it look like if existing career advising scaled to coordinated programming with a hundred universities' career centers? What would regional representation of EA look like if MEAROs employed dedicated, experienced communications teams that could be proactive, rather than predominantly responsive? What partnerships could form with more funding for high-quality events designed to forge relationships with non-EA institutions? MEAROs' existing programming is highly absorbent and currently only reaching a fraction of its full potential.</p><h2>2. Contextualization Research and Innovation Labs</h2><p>A year ago, Luis Mota Freitas introduced the concept of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bv2rnSYLsaegGrnmt/researching-priorities-in-local-contexts#The_two_meanings_of_local_priorities_research\">contextualization research</a> to describe local priorities research that seeks to \"identify the course of action that would maximize impact at a global level, given specific local resources.\" MEAROs could oversee contextualized global priorities research, i.e. research into how someone in their specific regional&nbsp;context with specific resources can best contribute to a given cause area. MEAROs could operate in partnership with universities, think tanks, and industry experts. EA Israel, for example, has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BLqJdZAgsvyWX7fug/local-charity-evaluation-lessons-from-the-maximum-impact\"><u>already begun work in this vein</u></a> and could do substantially more if more fully resourced.</p><h2>3. Educational Programs</h2><p>Educational requirements differ dramatically across regions, but some requirements overlap with EA values. For example, here in New York, <a href=\"https://www.animallaw.info/statute/ny-education-%C2%A7-809-instruction-humane-treatment-animals#:~:text=1.%20The%20officer,not%20given%20therein.\">a humane education law</a> requires instruction in \"every elementary school under state control or supported wholly or partly by public money of the state\" in \"the humane treatment and protection of animals and the importance of the part they play in the economy of nature as well as the necessity of controlling the proliferation of animals which are subsequently abandoned and caused to suffer extreme cruelty.\" Developing and integrating EA concepts into school curricula could be a long-term strategy to embed altruistic thinking at an early age. MEAROs could work with educational authorities to pilot EA programs in schools, ranging from primary to higher education.</p><h2>4. Corporate Partnerships</h2><p>MEAROs could collaborate with corporations to align their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives with EA principles. This would not only provide additional funding for EA-aligned projects but also help embed effective altruism in the business sector. This could occur in conjunction with existing workplace/professional groups, but at a large scale with greater coordination.</p><h2>5. Increased Collaboration with Global EA Entities</h2><p>MEAROs could initiate or participate more actively in global EA projects, bringing a regional perspective and resources to larger-scale initiatives. This could include collaborative research projects, joint fundraising campaigns, or global awareness programs.</p><h2>6. Public Awareness Campaigns</h2><p>MEAROs could undertake more extensive media and PR campaigns to raise public awareness about anything from effective giving to AI regulations. They could also play a key role in shaping the narratives about the border community. This could involve creating media content, engaging with journalists, or running public awareness campaigns on social media. This could look like anything from a Giving What We Can ad campaign on the London Tube to a billboard for <i>The Precipice</i> in Times Square.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I'm hopeful this post will prompt new discussions about MEAROs, new ideas about MEAROs' potential, and more effective use of MEAROs as vehicles for good going forward. Due to length, this post is an overview, not a comprehensive summary. I particularly invite comments (1) covering ground I've missed and (2) ideas for the future of MEAROs. What should the MEARO ecosystem look like in 2030? What is currently neglected that MEAROs would be well-positioned to take on? I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p><p>Thank you for reading and considering these questions!</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0v1ke4k7nale\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0v1ke4k7nale\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>\u201cCommunity Building\u201d is a heavily nebulous term, as James Herbert of EA Netherlands discusses in detail&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Cve3s6C5kxow6ScQQ/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-community-building\"><u>here</u></a>.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0lqko60gs14q\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0lqko60gs14q\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Generally, people afforded the opportunity to work on something full-time will have more opportunities to evaluate, strategize, assess, and innovate than those working on the same project a few hours a week.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnijr2l9hx3i\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefijr2l9hx3i\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The status of MEARO funding will be covered in a subsequent post and I will link to it here when it is published.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Rockwell Schwartz"}}]
