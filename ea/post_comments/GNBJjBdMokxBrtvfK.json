(I felt conflicted about wild animal welfare as a cause area and part of the reason I was ready to leave RP when I did to do moratorium organizing is that I had lost confidence that WAW was tractable. My work that is public was on the best interventions within the cause area, which were way lower impact than, say, farmed animal welfare, so in EA absolute impact terms I think that work can only be so good.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "AHSorcShM8Dn5B4da", "user": {"username": "Holly_Elmore"}}, {"_id": "9Jyv6LDk9NaLKWNnM", "postedAt": "2023-07-17T21:27:21.583Z", "postId": "GNBJjBdMokxBrtvfK", "htmlBody": "<p>And I also appreciate Austin\u2019s vote of confidence and don\u2019t think he did anything <em>wrong</em> hyping us, even if he finds it prudent to do things differently in the future</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "AHSorcShM8Dn5B4da", "user": {"username": "Holly_Elmore"}}]
