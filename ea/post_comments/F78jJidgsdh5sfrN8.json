It's great if the funding comes from institutions or individuals who are willing to support research topics. I think it would be <em>really bad</em> though if the funding was taken from any standard EA donations without previously attempting to get the funding via existing public grants and institutions (and even in that case, it would still be bad given the comparative impact of such a camp and alternative ways of providing <em>effective</em> charity. I am all for research, but primarily via non-EA research funds which are numerous for topics such as this one - i.e. we should strive to fund EA research topics from general research related funds as much as possible).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "YYf7xri9jWkWNeTnp", "user": {"username": "Dunja"}}, {"_id": "bymTyJtBLj8tvLRMS", "postedAt": "2018-06-17T12:10:44.186Z", "postId": "F78jJidgsdh5sfrN8", "htmlBody": "<p>If it would cost the same or less time to get funding via public grants and institutions, I would definitely agree (i.e. in filling in an application form, in the average number of applications that need to be submitted before the budget is covered, and in loss of time because of distractions and 'meddling'  by unaligned funders).</p>\n<p>Personally, I don't think this applies to AI Safety Camp at all though (i.e. my guess is that it would cost significantly more time than getting money from 'EA donors', which we would be better off spending on improving the camps) except perhaps in isolated cases that I have not found out about yet. </p>\n<p>I'm also not going to spend the time to write up my thoughts in detail but here's a summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI alignment is complicated \u2013 there's a big inferential gap in explaining to public grantmakers why this is worth funding (as well as difficulty making the case for how this is going to make them look good)</li>\n<li>The AI Safety Camp is not a project of an academic institution, which gives us little credibility to other academic institutions who would be most capable of understanding the research we are building on</li>\n<li>Tens of millions of dollars are being earmarked to AI alignment research by people in the EA community right now who are looking to spend that on promising projects run by reliable people.

However, I'd also like to see the objective assessment of effectiveness (as in <em>effective altruism</em>) concerning such research attempts. To do so, you would have to show that such research has a comparatively higher chance of producing something outstanding than the existing academic research. Of course, that needs to be done in view of empirical evidence, which I very much hope you can provide. Otherwise, I don't know what sense of &quot;effective&quot; is still present in the meaning of &quot;effective altruism&quot;.</p>\n<p>Again: I think these kinds of research camps are great <em>as such</em>, i.e. in view of overall epistemic values. They are as valuable as, say, a logic camp, or a camp in agent-based models. However, I would never argue that a camp in agent-based models should be financed by EA funds <em>unless</em> I have empirically grounded reasons that such a research can contribute to effective charity and prevention of possible dangers better than the existing academic research can.</p>\n<p>As for the talent search, you seem to assume that academic institutions cannot uncover such talents. I don't know where you get this evidence from, but PhD grants across EU, for instance, are precisely geared towards such talents. Why would talented individuals not apply for those? And where do you get the idea that the topic of AI safety won't be funded by, say, Belgian FWO or German DFG? Again, you would need to provide empirical reasons that such systematic bias against projects on these topics exists.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the EA community wants to fund reliable project initiators for the topic of AI safety, why not make an open call for experts in the field to apply with project proposals and form the teams who can immediately execute these projects within the existing academic institutions? Where is this fear of academia coming from? Why would a camp like this be more streamlined than an expert proposal, where a PI of the given project employs the junior researchers and systematically guides them in the given research? In all other aspects of EA this is precisely how we wish to proceed (think of medical research).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "bymTyJtBLj8tvLRMS", "user": {"username": "Dunja"}}, {"_id": "TCv7KHyfQDBjgJdJE", "postedAt": "2018-06-18T23:09:49.356Z", "postId": "F78jJidgsdh5sfrN8", "htmlBody": "<p>For more on the thinking behind streamlined non-mainstream funding, see <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/hits-based-giving\">https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/hits-based-giving</a></p>\n<p>I don't think academia is yet on the same page as EA with regard to AI Safety, but may well be soon hopefully (with credibility coming from the likes of Stuart Russell and Max Tegmark).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "7eSZjZHXjPqrNMcyW", "user": {"username": "Greg_Colbourn"}}, {"_id": "3DvBNoSBcicKuxSgn", "postedAt": "2018-06-18T23:14:40.286Z", "postId": "F78jJidgsdh5sfrN8", "htmlBody": "<p>But this is not about whether academia is on the same page or not; it's about the importance of pushing the results via academic channels because otherwise they won't be recognized by anyone (policy makers especially).

If there is a decent methodology to address the given objectives, even if the issue is controversial, this doesn't mean the project won't be financed. Alternatively, if you actually know of decent project applications that have been rejected, well let's see those and examine whether there is indeed a bias in the field.\nFinally, why do you think that academia is averse towards risky projects?! Take for instance ERC schemes: they are intentionally designed for high-risk/high-gain project proposals, that are transformative and groundbreaking in character.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "TCv7KHyfQDBjgJdJE", "user": {"username": "Dunja"}}, {"_id": "DDfjnENdbCwhy7MfK", "postedAt": "2018-06-18T23:51:27.668Z", "postId": "F78jJidgsdh5sfrN8", "htmlBody": "<p>There is an analogy with speculative investing here I think - for something to be widely regarded as worthwhile investing in (i.e. research funded by mainstream academia) it has to already have evidence of success (e.g. Bitcoin now).
