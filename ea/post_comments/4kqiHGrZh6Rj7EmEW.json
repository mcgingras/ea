Giving is a cheerful act not a punishing and resentful event.   Agree.   From my perspective giving means leaving behind self interest and receiving the satisfaction in invisibly giving and witnessing the development of others.   I say invisibly because much of my giving through online forums is not experienced in a face to face encounter.  We may receive a thank you or an updated report but we are not there to see first hand the results.  Yet this type of giving frees myself from the false pride I could receive through potential accolades.  This is because it is not about me but it is about us as humans and us as a community helping each to feel safe, secure, happy and fulfilled.  In these cases, I am choosing to focus more on the lives of others and not my own.  And consequently it allows me to see more clearly the value in others and to be a distance observer of their growth.  I think it helps me remember there are those who live in poverty and in a small way I can help.   </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jan"}}, {"_id": "3Dw2bxZJKifZXQWm6", "postedAt": "2018-10-26T19:46:34.742Z", "postId": "4kqiHGrZh6Rj7EmEW", "htmlBody": "<p>Somehow this doesn\u2019t sit right with me.

I think daily we have to both accept and challenge our limits to give, and to expand the diversity and difficulty of activities that nourish ourselves.  I did something difficult for me the other day:  in my upstate bungalow colony (21 of use share a communal property with individual residences), the governing board cleared a black raspberry bush that gave me a lot of berries and a lot of joy, without my knowledge or consent.  Rather than fume, I sent a thoughtful response, which resulted in me leading an effort ($100 budget) to replace the plants.  A bunch of us found some end-of-season plants, and seven of us worked together to gather compost and recreate this garden patch better than ever.  THIS is what I want more of in my life.  Yet I offered only condemnation and annoyance to the woman who huffily came over and tried to keep me from playing fetch with my dog in a dog park (like most everyone else) because it was against city park regulations.  I hope someday to be the person who can attempt to engage constructively with someone who offended and annoyed me as much as this woman.  Yet spending time stewing in being disappointed in myself will not enable me to become that person.  I have to grow my capacity for perspective-taking and concern for the well-being of others, and I can only do this by maintaining my own capacity to engage positively with myself and with the world, which I can only do through nourishing activities, some of which consume resources and benefit only myself (or others only via market transactions).
