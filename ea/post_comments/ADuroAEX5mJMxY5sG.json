I'm not persuaded.  A more persuasive argument: there's a danger that our hypothetical woman aborts her fetus, gets rich, and then uses her developing powers of rationalization to find some reason not to give very much money to charity.</p>\n<p>Thought experiment: Let's say instead of being a woman, we're dealing with a female android.  Unlike humans, androids always know their own minds perfectly, never rationalize, keep all their promises, etc.  The android tells you in her robotic voice that she's aborting her android fetus so she can make more money and save more lives, and you know for a fact that she's telling the truth.  Does your answer to her stay the same?</p>\n<p>Another thought: Maybe the reason you feel that this attitude is repugnant is because it sounds hypocritical.  In that case, it might be useful to distinguish between preferences and advocacy.  For example, maybe as an EA I would prefer that non-EA women carry their unwanted fetuses to term for the reasons you outline.  But that doesn't mean that I have to start protesting at abortion clinics.  If someone came to me and asked me whether they should carry their baby to term or not, it seems reasonable for me to respond and say \"Well, what are your opportunity costs like?  Where will the time and energy raising your baby be spent if you choose to abort it?\" and listen to her before giving my answer.</p>\n<p>In fact, I would argue that endorsing many universal moral principles, such as \"don't abort fetuses\", \"don't eat animals\", and \"borders should be open\", effectively amount to compartmentalization--the very thing you wrote this essay against.  The real world is complicated.  Our values are complicated.  Simple principles like \"don't eat animals\" are intuitively appealing and easy for groups to rally around.  But, inconveniently, the world is not simple and our moral principles will conflict.  When our moral principles conflict, we should have a process for resolving those conflicts.  I'm not sure that process should favor simplicity in the result.  In the context of discussing a single principle, the way you discuss your \"don't abort fetuses\" principle here, it's easy to compartmentalize and avoid letting the \"replaceability\" principle in to the \"don't abort fetuses\" compartment.  I wonder whether if your essay had been about replaceability instead of abortion, you would have come to the opposite conclusion.  In other words, I wonder if humans have a bias towards letting moral conflicts resolve in favor of whichever moral principle is most salient.  That seems suboptimal.</p>\n<p>Another thought: If women are morally obligated to carry unwanted babies to term, are they also obligated to pump out as many babies as possible during their fertile years?  Personally, the idea that the two cases are different strikes me as status quo bias.

I was anti-choice before I became an EA.  EA has actually pushed me to believe, on a rational level, that abortion is of utilitarian value in many cases (though the population ethics are a bit unclear).  However, on a visceral level I still find abortion deeply distasteful and awful.  So I still &quot;oppose&quot; abortion, whatever that means.  I think as an EA, it's okay to have believies (as opposed to beliefs) that are comforting to you, as long as you don't act on them.  Many political issues fall into this category.  Since I don't vote on the issue of abortion and will probably not become accidentally pregnant, my believy isn't doing any harm.  </p>\n<p>Believies:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsouvVdoJQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFsouvVdoJQ</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Lila"}}, {"_id": "QZCCxSbozepdBCcgA", "postedAt": "2015-01-01T22:00:31.384Z", "postId": "ADuroAEX5mJMxY5sG", "htmlBody": "<p>I've just skimmed this, so sorry if any of these points are covered already.</p>\n<p>(1) On the moral uncertainty argument: I think people tend to overlook the fact that abortion can be morally obligatory according to utilitarianism. If having a child will divert the time and financial resources of people away from more effective causes then, especially if we consider the expected far future impact of those resources, someone can be strongly morally obligated to have an abortion. In general, it seems like utilitarianism is going to tend to have pretty strong recommendations either for or against abortion in a given case, depending on the particulars of that case. In cases where someone is morally obligated to have an abortion according to utilitarianism, we have a case of disagreement between moral theories and not a case of moral dominance under uncertainty. I still think that it means we should think that abortion is worse in most cases than it is typically considered, but it seems worth noting that this isn't a simple dominance case as is sometimes assumed.</p>\n<p>(2) On the QALY assessment of abortions: People have mentioned that this sort of calculation seems to entail that women should consistently get pregnant and adopt out the children throughout their fertile years. One issue here is that it's the additional QALY benefit or loss of having children compared with what the person would have done that should be considered when we try to determine how morally good it is for people to have children. And it seems like a lot of people have the ability to move more QALYs with their resources and time than would be created by having children (either by giving to effective causes, or by convincing or paying someone else to have a child). I think it's very implausible that EAs should have children instead of using those resources elsewhere. Of course, it's less clear in the case of non-EA people. But then I think &quot;if you're not going to spend your money and time more morally, then you're morally obligated to have children whenever they are able to&quot; is a view that it would probably be damaging to publicly endorse. </p>\n<p>(3) We might be worried about how the moral uncertainty argument applies in other cases. For example, homosexual acts seem to be mildly morally good on utilitarian views, but according to a lot of religious moral theories, homosexual acts are very morally bad (and very few moral theories say that they are morally good to the same degree). Does this mean that homosexual acts are a potentially prohibited under moral uncertainty? Perhaps not, but it seems worth noting that using the moral uncertainty arguments to argue against acts like abortion might lead people to this kind of example, so it's worth having something to say about them.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Amanda_MacAskill"}}, {"_id": "wzsTGpQ4kwDtfSbrL", "postedAt": "2015-01-01T23:03:24.160Z", "postId": "ADuroAEX5mJMxY5sG", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't think this is a fair restriction on commentary for this sort of article, especially since you go into the example in such detail.

A few examples of the latter:</p>\n<p>1) One may think that human life is uniquely sacred. Yet perhaps one might find this belief challenged (among other ways) by folks interested in animal welfare, and instead of setting humans on a different moral order to other animals, rather they should be on a continuum according to some metric that 'really' explains moral value (degree of consciousness, or similar). Although fetuses may well remain objects of moral concern, they become less sacrosanct, and so abortion becomes more conscionable.</p>\n<p>2) As Amanda alludes to, consequentialist/counterfactual reasoning will supply many cases where abortion becomes permissible depending on particular circumstances, especially where one lives in a world where QALYs are relatively cheap (suppose Sarah wants to continue her pregnancy, but I offer to give \u00a320,000 to AMF if she has an abortion instead - ignoring all second-order effects, this is likely a good deal; more realistically, one could include factors like expected loss-of-earnings, stigma, etc. etc.). If one's opposition to abortion is motivated by deontological concerns, a move to teleological ways of thinking may lead one to accept that there will be many cases when abortion is morally preferable. </p>\n<p>3) Total views and replaceability could also be supportive, if Sarah anticipates to be in a better position to start a family later (so both her and the child stand to benefit), then the problem reduces to a different number population problem (imagine a 3x2 table - Sarah gains some QALYs by aborting over adopting, the 'current fetus' loses some QALYs by abortion, yet the 'counter factual' fetus gains even more QALYs by abortion, as it will be broad into existence and has - ex hypothesi - a better life than the current fetus would have). So the choice to abort (on the proviso to have a child in better circumstances) looks pretty good. (You are right to note there are other corrections, but they seem less significant).</p>\n<p>The all-things-considered calculus is unclear, but it is not obvious to me the 'direction of travel' after contemplating EA-related principles is generally against abortion, and I would guess even an 'EA perspective' constructed from the resources you suggest would not be considered a conservative view. It may be that the inconvenience and risk of being pregnant would be insufficient to justify an abortion by the lights of this 'EA perspective', but most women who had an abortion had weightier concerns motivating them - concerns the 'EA perspective' might well endorse as sufficient justification in the majority of cases abortions have actually occurred. </p>\n<p>There might be a regression to the mean issue where the considerations found compelling by-the-lights of one perspective will generally look less compelling when that perspective changes (so if one was 'pre-EA' strongly in favour of a liberal view on abortion, this enthusiasm would likely regress). There's also a related point that one should not expect all updates to be psychologically pleasant, and they're probably not that much more likely to comfort our prior convictions as to offend them. But I'm not sure the object-level example provides good support to the more meta considerations.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Gregory_Lewis"}}, {"_id": "BgLKM8PLo99s6EAG2", "postedAt": "2015-01-03T11:38:33.075Z", "postId": "ADuroAEX5mJMxY5sG", "htmlBody": "<p>I certainly think we should be wary when discussing immigration: we should be aware that discussing it in detail could be destructive (eg alienate people with particular political affiliations entirely), and that it seems intractable.

On the other hand, the harm I was trying to describe in the case of abortion is far greater than immigration. While I would expect there to be somewhat few readers of the blog sufficiently emotionally attached to one view on immigration that they would experience a somewhat careless discussion of it as distressing, I would expect there to be decidedly more so on abortion. If abortion seemed a more tractable issue, it would likely still be worth having the discussion, but trying to be careful in the language used (just as when comparing the effectiveness of charities, it's important to be sensitive to the suffering relieved by charities which are <em>comparatively</em> ineffective). But given the current state of things, it doesn't seem worth it. This is compounded by the fact that effective altruism in general is sometimes seen as somewhat male dominated, and the people likely to be put off by insensitive-seeming discussion of abortion are likely to be disproportionately women.

If, like Dale, you're really interested in this topic, it's probably worthwhile to work through some of these original sources. But some of the general issues are that compartmentalising means treading an uncommon path, which means that you have fewer footsteps to follow in, which means that you'll end up with weird and incorrect beliefs a lot of the time. It's also very likely that decompartmentalising - letting some beliefs affect all areas of decision-making - will lead to fanaticism - overvaluing certain beliefs.</p>\n<p>It's kind-of a timeless question in rationality. But the growing consensus I'm discovering is that decompartmentalisation should be matched with what Anna calls 'safety features' - how to know when you have strange beliefs, and when to backtrack, when to think more, when to get friends to review your opinions, when to cede to the majority viewpoint, et cetera. Basically, I think that we need to work to put safety measures onto our thinking, and share these around the effective altruist community.</p>\n<p>Other posts about problems with consequentialism and rationality include <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/2aa/virtue_ethics_for_consequentialists/#more\">Virtue Ethics for Consequentialists</a> and the less relevant but also interesting <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/fyb/ontological_crisis_in_humans/\">Ontological Crises</a> though they're less directly relevant.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "yxBtr5f7JmdPog9Fd", "postedAt": "2015-01-04T07:09:58.126Z", "postId": "ADuroAEX5mJMxY5sG", "htmlBody": "<p>Good point.

This satisfies certain facts of pregnancy, such as that twins can form after conception and we don't consider each twin part of a single &quot;person&quot;, but rather two &quot;persons&quot;.  Thus, I am inclined to think that personhood cannot begin at conception.  On the other hand, infanticide arguments notwithstanding, it seems clear to me that a mature baby both one second before, and one second after it is born, is a person in the sense that it is a viable human being capable of feeling conscious experiences.</p>\n<p>I've also considered the neuroscience research that suggests that fetuses in the womb as far back as 20 weeks in are capable of memorizing the music played to them.  This along with the completion of the Thalamocortical connections at around 26 weeks, and evidence of sensory response to pain at 30 weeks, suggest to me that the fetus develops the ability to sense and feel well before birth.</p>\n<p>All this together means that my nuanced view is that if we have to draw a line in the sand over when abortion should and shouldn't be permissible, I would tentatively favour somewhere around 20 weeks, or the midpoint of pregnancy.  I would also consider something along the lines of no restrictions in the first trimester, some restrictions in the second trimester, and a full ban in the third trimester, with exceptions for if the mother's life is in danger (in which case we save the mother because the mother is likely more sentient).</p>\n<p>Note that in practice the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester, and many doctors refuse to perform late-term abortions anyway, so these kinds of restrictions would not actually change significantly the number of abortions that occur.</p>\n<p>That was my thinking before considering the EA considerations.

If we generously assume every instance of post partum depression is 'major' and 'severe', and generously assume it lasts for 3 years, we get 3<em>0.1</em>0.655 = 0.1965 QALYs. As we were generous on both multiplicative assumptions, it's plausible the true number is much much lower.

There are strong non-religious arguments for its being wrong to abort a baby, but not very many at all for homosexuality being wrong. It seems that most of the disagreement about homosexuality comes from disagreement about whether Islam is true, which is a factual disagreement, not a moral disagreement. As such, moral uncertainty is much more important for the (im)morality of aborting fetuses than for homosexuality.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "nZ3v5vegRvjX63ivv", "user": {"username": "Dale"}}, {"_id": "K5WcbRweBpwTbRzYy", "postedAt": "2015-01-12T04:07:50.529Z", "postId": "ADuroAEX5mJMxY5sG", "htmlBody": "<p>I had another thought as well.
