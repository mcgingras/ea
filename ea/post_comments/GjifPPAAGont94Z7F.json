I think often when we say things like this, we imagine a neat symmetrical normal distribution around the average, but you can't simultaneously have a neat normal distribution around both of these numbers! Perhaps you'd need to look more into where the numbers are coming from to get a better intuition for which shape of distribution is more plausible.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "BenMillwood"}}, {"_id": "FwFupeYb5eWoJxkt2", "postedAt": "2024-03-13T19:54:07.239Z", "postId": "GjifPPAAGont94Z7F", "htmlBody": "<p>A very minor request: could you edit the title of your post to change \"CEA\" to \"cost effectiveness analysis,\" simply to reduce ambiguity and confusion with \"Center for Effective Altruism?\"</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "jlemien"}}, {"_id": "9DCkqmtX7uEhDtQuo", "postedAt": "2024-03-17T15:29:32.113Z", "postId": "GjifPPAAGont94Z7F", "htmlBody": "<p>\ud83d\udc4d</p>", "parentCommentId": "FwFupeYb5eWoJxkt2", "user": {"username": "edoarad"}}, {"_id": "xLqqJv6h2mCzMtZmH", "postedAt": "2024-03-17T15:30:01.394Z", "postId": "GjifPPAAGont94Z7F", "htmlBody": "<p>Exactly!</p>", "parentCommentId": "ZzeA88AGRmvpHnHjs", "user": {"username": "edoarad"}}]
