Here's another thing people can do to expose themselves to more perspectives:</p>\n<p>When I ran HCEA, we pretty frequently had group dinners with other student groups. Mostly they would ask us questions about effective altruism and we would ask them questions about what they thought about it. I think these dinners were great for exposing HCEA to a broad range of perspectives, and they weren't too much trouble to set up.</p>\n<p>(They were also great for recruiting and publicity--we were amused to note this year that during the annual atheist-Christian debate, one of the few things the two sides could agree on was that HCEA was awesome!)</p>\n<p>If you're a non-student EA, you can do a similar thing by having your local EA group meet up with other local organizations (e.g. religious organizations, social justice groups, global poverty groups, etc.--though finding them might be a bit more challenging). If you want to get super advanced you could even offer to give a talk on effective altruism to the group, although that requires more prep and you need to be careful not to proselytize.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ben_Kuhn"}}, {"_id": "7dLwtddrYMzko5SYv", "postedAt": "2014-12-30T19:31:43.765Z", "postId": "7oEMDW8gSZ4DTpg8d", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm not an effective altruist and don't think I ever will be one. I'm here only out of curiosity and intellectual entertainment. Perhaps this allows me to give you an honest &quot;outside&quot; perspective. My main reasons for not donating 10% of my income or make other similar commitments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>I am instinctively too egoistic and I don't like the cognitive dissonance from being a little altruistic, but not as much as I reasonably could be. I feel best when I &quot;play for my own side&quot; in life, am productive to get only what I want and don't think about the suffering of others. I feel better when I don't care, and I prefer feeling better over caring. They say giving makes happy, but I find it brings me no equivalent pleasure.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Society and the law already demand a great deal of altruism and (what they think of as) morality from me. Some of it in the form of taxes, some of it in the form of restrictions on what I can do, some of it in the form of implicit status attacks. Of course, I get a lot in return, but subjetively it doesn't feel balanced. Perhaps if I were richer or had higher life satisfaction, I might be more generous in addition to what is already demanded.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In many morally relevant domains, there is a discrepancy between what I feel is important and what people in general feel is important. In addition, I have given up on convincing people through value talk. Most people will never value what I value, and vice versa. There are no cost-effective ways to change these discrepancies, and even though EA is a multi-domain endeavor, it is ultimately about empowering humanity to fulfill its preferences, half of which are more or less opposed to mine.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Psychologically, uncertainty cripples my motivation. I am not an &quot;expected utility maximizer&quot;. But in EA, certainty of impact and scope of impact are somewhat negatively correlated. And where positive effects are really certain, I expect the most cost-effective ground will eventually be covered by the EA movement without me, and I'd rather other people pay than me (donor's dilemma).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are the core reasons why I have decided against EA in my personal life. It does not preclude small donations or ethical consumption, both of which I make, but it makes me recoil from real commitments, unless I have an unexpected windfall or something.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Nicholas_Bregan"}}, {"_id": "8KWptPBqwFoF6cjFR", "postedAt": "2014-12-31T03:48:37.008Z", "postId": "7oEMDW8gSZ4DTpg8d", "htmlBody": "<p>Do you remember any of the questions/reactions you got from the non-EA students at those dinners?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "biqMtGeR8FfGSNHAq", "user": {"username": "ruthie"}}, {"_id": "4CW6uhDCccSSG3kDj", "postedAt": "2014-12-31T11:27:08.589Z", "postId": "7oEMDW8gSZ4DTpg8d", "htmlBody": "<p>Good post.
