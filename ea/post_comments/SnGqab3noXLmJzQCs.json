Even the Animal Welfare Approved certification doesn't have any requirements about what do with male chicks, it simply states that they can be \"removed\" from the AWA system (meaning, I think, transferred off-farm and then no certification-related requirements apply to them anymore, so they're probably just macerated as usual. :( )<br><br>Re: hen feed and insects, I think that the \"natural forage\" that these farms refers to means that chickens forage for bugs in the ground.

Most of my uncertainty comes from lack of knowledge of chicken psychology (is being outdoors but in a large flock of 20k birds a lot less stressful than being indoors in a large dense flock, or about the same? Does beak trimming cause chronic pain or frustration as the hens can't forage as well?)</p><p>One specific consideration with Vital Farms is that their practices vary by farm: they're a collective of small farms nationwide, and it seems that they have different subgroups of farms that adhere to different standards.
