For example, while a pause might be bad due to hardware overhang, it might be good to call for a pause, because it will force companies to try harder on safety.

Or does it make it harder by making &nbsp;a pause look like a policy pushed by extreme radicals?</li><li>Will pause advocacy negatively affect the reputation of AI Safety as a research field or show that AI Safety experts <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief-in-belief#:~:text=Belief%20in%20belief%20is%20a,drives%20your%20anticipation%20of%20experience.\">really believe</a> in x-risk (\"if you actually think we're going to die, why aren't you protesting on the street?\").</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How effective is advocacy generally?</strong></h3><ul><li>Is AI fundamentally different from other issues with social movements?</li><li>Does <a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/\">the research</a> reliably show that advocacy does work?</li><li>Does EA\u2019s reputation (elitism, tech bros) make it harder to advocate for a pause?</li><li>If some AI protest movement will inevitably arise over the next few years, how valuable is it to be the founder?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Is pause advocacy more robust to safety-washing than other efforts?</strong></h3><ul><li>Can anyone else call out regulation that claims to make AI safer but doesn't reduce x-risk? Can activists do this while recognizing regulation that is actually good?</li><li>Is communicating a specific policy ask worse than communicating a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jiYLFomPPePy85eN8/ai-pause-governance-advocacy-might-be-net-negative\">real understanding</a> of the problem?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Is Pause advocacy worth the time of the AI Safety community (assuming it is useful)?</strong></h3><ul><li>Will employers discriminate against protestors when hiring?

Despite lower public and philanthropic interest in recent years, the risk of nuclear war persists. The outcome of a nuclear exchange of any kind would be disastrous, even if the exact consequences are difficult to model. A large nuclear exchange poses a risk of collapse of civilisation or perhaps even human extinction, via nuclear winter and vulnerability to subsequent threats.</p><p>Thankfully there are strategies to mitigate these risks. The pursuit of these strategies has led to wins such as a dramatic reduction in nuclear stockpiles since the height of the Cold War. Engineers can leverage their technical expertise to promote these strategies through:</p><ul><li>Research, e.g. through analysis of satellite data</li><li>Technical work, e.g. through improving verification technologies for arms control</li><li>Policy, e.g. through programs that train STEM professionals on global security to provide advice for policymakers</li></ul><p>There are several areas of work that engineers should avoid when trying to reduce the risks posed by nuclear weapons. These include improving missile defence systems, advancing nuclear arms capabilities and doing work that poses significant information hazards (e.g. publishing technical information on weapons).</p><h2>Uncertainty</h2><p>The content of this article is largely based on research by <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/\">Nuclear Threat Initiative</a>, and the <a href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/\">Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation</a>. Although funders, experts, and decision-makers <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tRbCjvm4cuuzm95Mv/nuclear-risk-and-philanthropic-strategy-founders-pledge\">face deep uncertainty</a> about the effectiveness of different interventions, we feel reasonably confident that the recommendations in this article are robust.</p><h1>Cause area overview</h1><h2>Risks from nuclear war</h2><h3>Likelihood of nuclear war</h3><p>Though tensions between large nuclear powers and global weapons stockpiles have decreased since the height of the Cold War, risks of nuclear war persist. Nuclear powers have avoided nuclear use after World War II by adapting strategies of deterrence, where a nuclear power\u2019s arsenal is used to deter other powers from being the first to use their own. Maintaining stable deterrence has become crucial and is dependant on factors such as each actor credibly making use of their weapons, having a second strike capability, and that each actor is vulnerable to a strike for another.</p><p>Today there are several destabilising factors that are a cause for concern:</p><ul><li>Nuclear escalation from ongoing conflicts and potential future conflicts, such as in Ukraine, Taiwan, or Kashmir.</li><li>China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/CMPR/\">expansion of its nuclear arsenal</a> and the unprecedented issues of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/29/how-will-america-deal-with-three-way-nuclear-deterrence\">three-way deterrence</a>\u201d between Russia, China, and the United States</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HuQtr7qfB2EfcGqTu/technological-developments-that-could-increase-risks-from-1\">Technological advancements</a> including cyber warfare, artificial intelligence, missile defence systems and advanced delivery systems.</li><li>National warning systems that are vulnerable to malfunction or human error, causing nuclear retaliation to a non-existent oncoming strike.</li><li>Internal political instability or poor political leadership leading to first nuclear use.</li></ul><p>Due to the complex nature of the problem, the likelihood of nuclear use is extremely difficult to estimate. Estimates of the probability of a nuclear conflict between the U.S. and Russia (the most destructive of any two nation conflict) &nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221016195056/https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PAYa6on5gJKwAywrF/how-likely-is-a-nuclear-exchange-between-the-us-and-russia-1\">range between 0.01% and 2.21% per year</a>. Assuming the level of risk remains constant, this would imply the likelihood of nuclear war between these powers to be 10\u201385% in the next 100 years.</p><h3>Outcomes of nuclear war</h3><p>Any use of nuclear weapons would be devastating to the receiving nation and would be highly destabilising to international relations. Today there are \u201clow yield\u201d, \u201ctactical\u201d or \u201cbattlefield\u201d weapons <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60664169\">that leaders have considered deploying</a> in <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/education-center/glossary/#:~:text=Conventional%20weapons%3A%20Weapons%20and%20military%20equipment%2C%20including%20small%20arms%20and%20light%20weapons%2C%20tanks%2C%20artillery%20rockets%2C%20aircraft%2C%20torpedoes%2C%20mines%20and%20cluster%20munitions%20that%20do%20not%20use%20biological%20agents%2C%20chemical%20agents%2C%20nuclear%20explosives%2C%20or%20kinetic%20energy%20weapons%20to%20damage%20targets.\">conventional conflicts</a>.

These deaths would result from both the initial blast and deaths from nuclear fallout in the following weeks.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/Z3RzNEzJyzo\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3RzNEzJyzo\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/\">Rethink Priorities</a> conducted <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk/\">in-depth research</a> into the risks from nuclear weapons. They predict a nuclear exchange between Russia and the US would have the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk/p/MsJvzmYLMpsdJBb6C\">highest potential of harm</a> due to three factors: 1) the size of the countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals; 2) the size of the countries\u2019 populations; and 3) the probability of the given nuclear exchange scenario. Nuclear exchanges between India and Pakistan, and China and either the US, India, or Russia would likely be the next most devastating.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk/p/FfxrwBdBDCg9YTh69\">this model</a> created by Rethink Priorities, the number of people that would likely be killed directly by nuclear detonations during a US-Russia nuclear exchange is about <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk/p/FfxrwBdBDCg9YTh69\">51 million</a>. This would absolutely be devastating, but it\u2019s important to keep <a href=\"https://www.animal-ethics.org/scope-insensitivity-failing-to-appreciate-the-numbers-of-those-who-need-our-help/\">scope sensitivity</a> in mind when trying to understand how important the threat of nuclear war is in comparison to other pressing problems. (To put that figure into context, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/spanish-flu-largest-influenza-pandemic-in-history\">more than 50 million people died</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/1918-flu-pandemic\">Spanish flu pandemic of 1918\u20131919</a> and civilisation has continued). Current prevailing work on preventing nuclear war overlooks scope sensitivity, and focusing on the most devastating risks is one key way that people new to the field of preventing nuclear war can add value.</p><p>However, an all-out thermonuclear war between the US and Russia be a civilisation-ending events if the high estimates of probability and severity of the climate effects of nuclear winter are true.</p><p><strong>Nuclear winter</strong></p><p>The aftermath of nuclear war also poses potentially serious risks. Huge fires from a large nuclear exchange <a href=\"https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/9713/2013/acp-13-9713-2013.pdf\">could send particulate matter into the atmosphere, which would block incoming sunlight.</a> This would lower temperatures globally <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6774726/\">for up to a decade and reduce global rainfall by about 15-30%.</a> Reduced photosynthesis and thermal energy could lead to ecosystem disruption, <a href=\"https://www.ippnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ENGLISH-Nuclear-Famine-Report-Final-bleed-marks.pdf\">agricultural collapse</a> and mass starvation.</p><p>Estimates of the likelihood and extent of nuclear winter effects are disputed. Some contemporary literature asserts that <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JD027331\">more modest climatic effects would be felt,</a> which would not lead to mass death. It must be kept in mind that the models and empirical data sets in this field are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/475037b\">limited and uncertain.</a> While we should perhaps no longer think that a large exchange would most likely lead to extreme nuclear winter, its possibility should not be entirely discounted.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/KzpIsjgapAk\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzpIsjgapAk\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>All-out nuclear wars are disproportionately worse than highly limited nuclear exchanges due to climate dynamics, threshold effects, and the possibility of societal collapse. This <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tRbCjvm4cuuzm95Mv/nuclear-risk-and-philanthropic-strategy-founders-pledge\">Founders Pledge</a> report tentatively concludes that \u201c<i>not all wars would lead to nuclear winter, but larger wars are more likely to lead to severe climate change, and threshold effects amplify the superlinear cost of this</i>.\u201d</p><p>Even in the absence of a nuclear winter, a world after a large-scale nuclear war may be extremely vulnerable to subsequent extinction risks. This includes pandemics, biological warfare (see our page on <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/how-engineers-can-have-impact-working-in-biosecurity\">Biorisk and Biosecurity</a>), artificial intelligence, and other risks that might wipe out humanity or reduce us to a number too small to effectively rebuild.</p><h2>Mitigation of Risks</h2><p>There are various strategies for mitigation of the risks above. Many of these are primarily&nbsp;framed as policy interventions, but pursuing these strategies requires people with technical expertise. Due to the present situation of deterrence, many of these interventions aim to improve the outcome of a nuclear exchange without having a destabilising effect. Some have proven effective and have led to wins such as a dramatic reduction in nuclear stockpiles since the height of the Cold War.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nuclear-warhead-stockpiles?stackMode=absolute\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div data-owid-slug=\"nuclear-warhead-stockpiles\" class=\"owid-preview\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nuclear-warhead-stockpiles?stackMode=absolute\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</iframe></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></figure><p>Figure 1: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons\">Our world in data, Estimated nuclear warhead stockpile 1945 to 2022, Roser et al.

In discussions of nuclear weapons, disarmament consists of reducing, limiting, or abolishing nuclear weapons, generally through <a href=\"https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-22092.pdf\">international treaties and agreements</a>.</p><p>Disarmament efforts have been extremely successful in reducing the overall risks of nuclear war, reducing current arsenals to a fifth of what they were a half-century ago. As successful disarmament efforts reduce the severity of outcomes in an all-out exchange, it is the best strategy for reducing the severity of the worst possible nuclear outcomes.</p><p>Some disarmament efforts include the aim of reducing weapon yields. However, low-yield weapons <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/tactical-nuclear-weapons/\">can be seen as a lesser escalation and have fewer controls on their use</a>, potentially making nuclear use more likely. These weapons would still be similar in yield to those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and may prompt further escalation.</p><p>Efforts to reduce weapon yield therefore remain somewhat controversial, despite reducing overall nuclear capabilities. We believe they are likely net positive as low-yield weapons would cause less destruction in a large nuclear exchange and many of the mechanisms of nuclear escalation remain uncertain.</p><h3>Non-proliferation</h3><p>Nuclear non-proliferation efforts focus on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. Non-proliferation efforts have had mixed success, with the number of nuclear armed countries rising significantly since the inception of nuclear weapons.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nuclear-weapons-proliferation\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div data-owid-slug=\"nuclear-weapons-proliferation\" class=\"owid-preview\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nuclear-weapons-proliferation\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</iframe></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></figure><p>Figure 2: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons#:~:text=1%20of%205-,Nuclear%20powers%20and%20proliferation,Pakistan%2C%20Israel%20and%20North%20Korea.\">Our world in data, Number of countries that consider, pursue, or possess nuclear weapons, Roser et al. (2022)</a></p><p>The likelihood of a nuclear exchange is thought to be greatly increased when more actors with conflicting priorities possess nuclear capabilities. Therefore successful non-proliferation efforts would reduce the chances of a nuclear exchange occurring.</p><p>The vast majority of nuclear firepower is held by the United States and Russia. As non-proliferation is not directly aimed at reducing the likelihood or severity of nuclear exchanges between these powers, this intervention may not be effective in reducing the risks from the largest possible nuclear exchanges. However, reducing the destabilising effects of creating additional nuclear powers may be relevant in reducing the chances of a US-Russia exchange.</p><h3>Banning nuclear testing</h3><p>Test ban treaties such as the <a href=\"https://www.ctbto.org/our-mission/the-treaty\">Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty</a> aim to eliminate the full scale testing of nuclear weapons. Though some nuclear powers have not formally pledged to ban testing, international norms against testing has led to very few tests being carried out since the end of the Cold War.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:981.406px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/g7gr23guutbkqzeonnmt\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/jjglbohpehmxqnbcdrfv 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/waudquahbqjedqhwshig 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/fltsuvdugcqohf3ryt7m 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/tfpzfhhuniprukkuwzdf 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/vvb7pn4hkfbpi8gq9waw 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/cp9gwdbux3tbcygtdrwg 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/sl36mbylc345toeryhw4 2500w\"></figure><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:476.469px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/pmkv8ffpy44axze9mtk2\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/olckd56ebkinqqflkx59 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/ikdyuixlr3vimquhsizb 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/be2xeik3f8udm8fnfiz8 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/ohtbxrxpq97qel3vxfd9 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/ghoxma6w3zh27cu5ctoz 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/lm10wjszrpgruhtvoh28 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/oymvp1hhhil7oaxpg6oi 2500w\"><figcaption>Figure 3: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-nuclear-weapons-tests\">Wikimedia, Participation in the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (2022)</a></figcaption></figure><p>One notable exception to this is tests carried out by North Korea (DPRK), which is the only nation to have continued testing nuclear arms into the 21st century. The most recent of these tests was in 2017, however over the past few years they have also carried out many tests of their new missile technologies in close proximity to neighbouring countries.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-nuclear-weapons-tests\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div data-owid-slug=\"number-of-nuclear-weapons-tests\" class=\"owid-preview\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-nuclear-weapons-tests\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</iframe></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></figure><p>Figure 4: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-nuclear-weapons-tests\">Our World in Data, Number of nuclear weapons tests, 1945 to 2019, Roser et al. (2022)</a></p><p>Nuclear tests and tests of missile technologies are often a form of posturing and lead to rises in tension between nuclear powers. It also bears mentioning that nuclear tests are extremely harmful to local communities, sometimes causing generations of genetic disorders due to radiation exposure. Banning these tests would lead to a more stable political landscape.</p><p>Nuclear test bans are less popular among newer nuclear powers or nations pursuing nuclear arms. As established nuclear powers have data from past tests and usually have greater resources for other research such as <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/ASC_Report_Feb_2023_Lowres_3_3_23.pdf\">supercomputer simulation</a>, this puts them at a distinct advantage when expanding or modernising stockpiles.</p><h3>No first use</h3><p>Nations with a <a href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/issues/no-first-use/\">No First Use policy</a> pledge to refrain from the use of nuclear weapons, except for as a second strike in retaliation. No First Use policies create more stable international relations by eliminating the ambiguity about a nation\u2019s intentions with its nuclear arsenal.</p><p>A nation may decide to launch a first strike to maintain an element of surprise. A first strike will generally aim to destroy an adversary's military infrastructure or nuclear forces, reducing their ability to retaliate. This creates a \u201cuse or lose\u201d situation where much of the nuclear arsenal would be lost if not launched upon detection of an oncoming strike. Eliminating the option of first use is unattractive to military tacticians as it puts their nations at a distinct disadvantage.</p><p>China and India are currently the <a href=\"https://www.globalzero.org/no-first-use-faqs/#:~:text=Where%20do%20nuclear,or%20biological%20attacks.\">only two nuclear powers</a> to formally maintain a No First Use policy, adopting pledges in 1964 and 1998 respectively. Both NATO and a number of its member states have repeatedly rejected calls for adopting a No First Use policy, saying this would weaken their deterrence. Russia, Pakistan, North Korea (DPRK), and Israel have also not formally adopted a No First Use policy, although some have stated they would only deploy nuclear weapons in response to a large-scale conventional attack.</p><p>This failure of many nuclear armed nations to formally adopt a No First Use policy incentivises other nations to increase their deterrence by stockpiling or pursuing nuclear weapons programs. This impedes both disarmament and non-proliferation efforts.</p><h3>No launch on warning</h3><p>Launch on warning is a military strategy that allows the use of a retaliatory nuclear weapons strike against an opponent as soon as satellites and other warning sensors detect an incoming enemy missile.</p><p>As most intercontinental nuclear strike strategies aim to remove the adversaries\u2019 capability to launch nuclear weapons, a strike of retaliation may need to be launched before the initial strike would land. This decision would have to be made in the order of minutes. Adopting this policy strengthens the deterrence of a nuclear power by guaranteeing damage to an aggressor.</p><p>This strategy is extremely vulnerable to false alarms of imminent strike, of which there have been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident\">notable examples</a> over the relatively short history of nuclear weapons. Taking a policy of not launching on warning would avert the chances of a nuclear exchange prompted by radar malfunction or human error in data interpretation.</p><p>These policies would be difficult to enact as appearing to launch on warning is important in the deterrence of initial nuclear strikes. No countries have formally adopted a no launch on warning policy, although only <a href=\"https://fas.org/initiative/status-world-nuclear-forces/#:~:text=Status%20Of%20World%20Nuclear%20Forces%202023\">NATO countries and Russia have strategic weapons deployed</a> which would be capable of automated launch on warning.</p><h3>De-alerting</h3><p><a href=\"https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA536263\">De-alerting</a> is the introduction of reversible changes to nuclear weapons systems, in order to lengthen the time required to launch these weapons. As many weapons systems remain on \u201chigh alert\u201d in case of an oncoming strike, de-alerting has been proposed as a means to reduce the accidental or deliberate use of nuclear weapons.</p><p>De-alerting offers the opportunity for a lower buy-in form of disarmament. As the changes to the weapons systems are reversible, nations may be more likely to put them in place than to destroy existing weapons. This would reduce the chances of nuclear use while allowing nations to maintain their nuclear arsenals.</p><p>Reliable implementations of de-alerting would require intensive verification procedures. It is also very unpopular among military tacticians as it reduces a nation\u2019s deterrence threat.</p><p>It is also worth noting that de-alerting alone would not reduce total weapon stockpiles, only launch cadences. This may reduce the total number of weapons used in the largest exchanges as fewer launch facilities would be used before being struck, depending on the nature of the exchange. Policies of disarmament are preferable when possible due to their reduction of stockpiles and more straightforward ongoing verification procedures.</p><h3>No underground silos/submarines</h3><p>Nuclear silos are hardened underground facilities for housing and launching ballistic missiles. These are often solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles that are on high alert, such as the U.S.\u2019s appropriately named <a href=\"https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/minuteman-iii/\">Minuteman missile</a>. Having these missiles housed in silos means that an enemy must break each of these silos in a first strike if trying to limit the effects of a retaliatory strike. Each group of silos often takes two or more of their own ICBMs to break. To this end, <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/china-is-building-a-second-nuclear-missile-silo-field/\">nuclear powers often build many silos</a> (which aren\u2019t too expensive) and fill them with a few ICBMs (which are extremely expensive) to maximise the chances of having weapons left in a second strike.</p><p>Nuclear armed submarines (distinct from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_submarine\">nuclear powered submarines</a>) are <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/submarine-detection-and-monitoring-open-source-tools-and-technologies/\">functionally impossible to detect</a> even when operating within enemy waters, making them extremely strategically advantageous. Their nuclear ballistic missiles can be deployed even in cases where a first strike has wiped out a nation\u2019s entire land-based forces, making them an extremely effective deterrence force.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:763.859px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/p9bfosj8jbechmylv4oj\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/g1cglymdgzxdhrdsgycc 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/zhxzcztguzjd17od4sxq 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/kkghmztnqawfx2folezr 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/otrcplj79jwwvrjrfjyi 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/vmiinbfzoiuvvbhgxaje 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/lojpvm7ijj3irr1exjwu 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RbTjceYfhgAYzbBhL/jympmsh0ktwzrwswg3wv 2500w\"><figcaption>Figure 5: <a href=\"https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/the-equipment/submarines/ballistic-submarines/vanguard-class\">The United Kingdom\u2019s Vanguard class submarine equipped with the Trident nuclear missile, UK Royal Navy Press</a></figcaption></figure><p>Eliminating or reducing the number of silos would significantly reduce the impetus for stockpile build-up in other nations, as fewer weapons would need to be used to eliminate an adversary's second strike potential. Building many silos also has a destabilising effect, as it can be interpreted as a signal of a nation\u2019s intention to increase its nuclear arsenal significantly.</p><p>Nuclear armed submarines effectively present an <a href=\"https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/the-equipment/submarines/ballistic-submarines/vanguard-class\">immovable second strike threat</a>, introducing a heightened level of uncertainty and instability in international relations. Banning their use would foster greater transparency and predictability, improving trust and reducing tensions among nuclear-armed states. Submarines are also more likely to experience communication issues or to be cut off from communication with command. These communication issues may lead to misuse of their arms <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/10/27/23426482/cuban-missile-crisis-basilica-arkhipov-nuclear-war\">and have led to near misses in the past.</a></p><p>The same trade-off between lowering nuclear risks and diminishing a nation\u2019s deterrence can be seen here. It is extremely unlikely any nuclear power would elect to give up their silos or nuclear armed submarines in the foreseeable future because of the huge strategic advantages they offer.</p><h3>Post-nuclear use, or \"right-of-boom\" interventions</h3><p>The most deaths from an all-out nuclear war will likely come from climate effects from nuclear winter. As a result, there may be an argument for researching nuclear postures and capabilities that retain potential deterrent effects, while minimising the probability of nuclear winter. E.g., can yields, burst heights, targeting policies, etc. be adjusted in ways to minimise soot production while <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tRbCjvm4cuuzm95Mv/nuclear-risk-and-philanthropic-strategy-founders-pledge#Introduction__Deep_Uncertainty\">retaining deterrence</a>?</p><p>Founders Pledge deep dives into more right-of-boom interventions in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tRbCjvm4cuuzm95Mv/nuclear-risk-and-philanthropic-strategy-founders-pledge#Introduction__Deep_Uncertainty\">their report</a>.</p><h3>Civilisational resilience</h3><p>Increasing the resilience of population centres, food supply, and infrastructure would reduce the overall death toll of a nuclear exchange.

It is also somewhat common in Effective Altruism for independent researchers to seek funding for smaller projects. Funding sources such as <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds\">EA funds</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy</a>, <a href=\"https://lightspeedgrants.org/\">Lightspeed grants</a>, <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/\">Founders Pledge</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.longview.org/\">Longview Philanthropy</a> may be interested in work on nuclear war.</p><p><strong>Educating policymakers and the public about technical matters related to nuclear war</strong></p><p>It is difficult to conceptualise something so powerful and complex as nuclear arms systems. For nations to take action to minimise the chances of nuclear use, policymakers and the public must be well-informed on relevant technical topics.</p><p>People with general technical expertise often have an advantage when consuming technical information and rapidly synthesising this into a format that would be digestible to someone with no background in the field. Technical expertise is often respected by policymakers who will heed expert judgment when enacting policy. This may be especially important today, with digital media allowing the rapid spread of misinformation.</p><p>Engineers with experience in research, journalism, policy or education (either secondary/high school or college/university level) would be especially well-suited to this work.</p><h3>Technical work</h3><p><strong>Improving verification for arms control</strong></p><p>Verifying compliance with arms control treaties requires people with technical expertise in areas such as fissile material, manufacturing technology, and aerospace engineering. This is historically achieved through verification envoys visiting other nations\u2019 nuclear facilities to verify weapons numbers, amounts of fissile material, and facility security. Increasingly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_technical_means_of_verification\">new technologies</a> are being used to verify treaty compliance.</p><p>Verification of compliance with arms control treaties has recently become extremely important. Russia has <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2023-02/nuclear-disarmament-monitor\">suspended the inspection</a> of its nuclear arms, previously agreed under the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/new-start/\">New START</a> treaty. China is building its nuclear forces and is <a href=\"https://www.spf.org/spf-china-observer/en/document-detail039.html#:~:text=Lack%20of%20transparency%20in%20plutonium,order%20built%20around%20the%20NPT.\">resistant to verification and inspection</a>. Not having had the arms control history of the US-USSR, they are not as comfortable with letting inspectors roam their facilities.</p><p>New technical solutions may need to be found that give access to just enough information to confirm agreed terms, without incidentally gathering any additional information. Engineers with experience in aerospace, manufacturing, nuclear physics, and data analysis would be especially well-suited to this work.</p><p><strong>Improving technologies to prevent theft of fissile material and nuclear weapons technologies</strong></p><p>Theft of <a href=\"https://fissilematerials.org/\">fissile material</a> by nations or non-state actors would present enormous issues for non-proliferation efforts. It can advance national nuclear weapons programs, lead to nuclear terrorism, and contribute to political instability.</p><p>Radioactive sources including cobalt, caesium, and iridium isotopes are present worldwide. Many of these have civilian uses in medicine, energy, and research. Only 20 states have at least one kilogram of fissile materials like highly enriched uranium and plutonium which could be used for weapons. This figure is down from 40 states as recently as 2005.</p><p>It should be noted that while the nuclear arsenal of newly nuclear armed nations or terrorist groups could be enough to create significant human tragedy, they wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to cause nuclear winters or threaten civilisation collapse. It\u2019s possible that nuclear first use by these actors could precipitate further nuclear use in some scenarios, however.</p><p>There are also sensitive technologies that would present non-proliferation issues if stolen. This includes rocketry technology, uranium enrichment technology, and submarine technology. This may be theft of the technology itself, plans and technical drawings, or even just technical information communicated by a member of staff.</p><p>Additional technical solutions are needed worldwide to protect these materials and technologies. Computer systems may be vulnerable to cyberattack, facilities may be vulnerable to physical breach and additional controls could be placed on material and information.</p><p>One famous historical example of a breach of nuclear facilities is the commuter program <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\">Stuxnet\u2019s</a> destruction of many of Iran\u2019s enrichment centrifuges. Stuxnet was a cyberweapon likely built jointly by the United States and Israel in a collaborative effort known as Operation Olympic Games. Although no theft of fissile material occurred, this example underscores the vulnerability of these facilities.</p><p>Engineers with experience in cybersecurity, electronics, and defence would be especially well suited to this work.</p><p><strong>Improving the robustness of nuclear command, control, and communications systems</strong></p><p>In the US, the nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) system refers to the chain of authority and associated technologies that control nuclear use. Other nations have similar systems.</p><p>The proper functioning of these systems is vital to preventing the misuse or accidental use of nuclear arms. A <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/nc3-challenges-facing-future-system\">new set of technological challenges</a> will be faced in the coming years by cyber-attacks on NC3 systems, laser attacks on satellites in space, and artificial intelligence applied to autonomous weapons systems, such as submarine drones.</p><p>Engineers with experience in cybersecurity, communications systems, electronics, and aerospace would be especially well-suited to this work.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/how-engineers-can-work-on-civilisation-resilience\"><strong>Civilisation Resilience</strong></a></p><p>Making societies more robust to the dangers of a nuclear exchange could be an effective strategy to mitigate the risks of nuclear war. This includes projects such as building refuges and bunkers, as well as widespread changes like <a href=\"https://allfed.info/\">making food systems more resilient.</a></p><p>This may be a more accessible route to impact for some engineers. Building civilisational resilience is a burgeoning field and may require a different background from many of the other career paths to reducing nuclear risk. Civil engineers, biomedical engineers, chemical engineers, those with experience in the agricultural industry and others could all contribute here but may find many of the other bottlenecks difficult to pursue.</p><p><strong>Becoming an expert in nuclear testing, modelling, and simulation</strong></p><p>In the wake of various test ban treaties, there was a necessity for many nations to develop <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997_11-12/garwin\">new methods</a> to conduct experiments on nuclear arms systems. Today, nuclear powers without testing campaigns conduct lengthy and expensive experimental research to verify and modernise their arsenals.</p><p>Notable in this is the development of extremely advanced <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/ASC_Report_Feb_2023_Lowres_3_3_23.pdf\">modelling and simulation tools</a> to analyse many aspects of these weapon systems. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/28/china-nuclear-arms-race-610028\">Many of the world\u2019s most advanced supercomputers</a> are used almost exclusively for these tasks.</p><p>Expertise in this modern age of testing may be a key bottleneck for policymakers. The topic is extremely complicated and some efforts to put controls on this space have been <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-top-nuclear-weapons-lab-used-american-computer-chips-decades-after-ban-11674990320\">poorly implemented.</a> Engineers with experience in modelling and simulation or high-performance computing would be especially well-suited to this work.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>The MacArthur Foundation was the largest private funder of nuclear security work with grants of around $15 million per year between 2014 and 2020, around <a href=\"https://maps.foundationcenter.org/#//?subjects=all&amp;popgroups=all&amp;years=all&amp;location=0&amp;excludeLocation=0&amp;geoScale=ADM0&amp;layer=&amp;boundingBox=-139.219,-31.354,135,66.513&amp;gmOrgs=all&amp;recipOrgs=all&amp;tags=all&amp;keywords=&amp;pathwaysOrg=&amp;pathwaysType=&amp;acct=&amp;typesOfSupport=all&amp;transactionTypes=all&amp;amtRanges=all&amp;minGrantAmt=0&amp;maxGrantAmt=0&amp;gmTypes=all&amp;recipTypes=all&amp;minAssetsAmt=0&amp;maxAssetsAmt=0&amp;minGivingAmt=0&amp;maxGivingAmt=0&amp;andOr=0&amp;includeGov=0&amp;custom=all&amp;customArea=all&amp;indicator=&amp;dataSource=oecd&amp;chartType=trends&amp;multiSubject=1&amp;listType=gm&amp;windRoseAnd=undefined&amp;zoom=0\">32%</a> of the total annual philanthropic nuclear security funding. In 2021, they <a href=\"https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/%2421-million-to-support-a-stronger-more-diverse-nuclear-field\">announced</a> that they would withdraw funding support, with final funds disbursed in 2023. This leaves a major funding shortfall. For comparison, the budget of Oppenheimer was more than twice as much as philanthropists currently spend on preventing nuclear war.</p><p>With tensions building due to the Russia-Ukraine war and other conflicts, donations now could have <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62435b2d773bcf0ad9cbb672/t/62cee05cb38a4b2487a533e0/1657725020334/The+Changing+Landscape+of+Nuclear+Security+Philanthropy.pdf\">particularly high leverage</a> over the strategic direction of the field.</p><h2>Career moves</h2><h3>Positioning yourself as a policy expert</h3><p>As many of the interventions to reduce the risks of nuclear war are political actions, policy experts are very well positioned to have a high impact.</p><p>For some engineers, returning to education to get a graduate degree in a relevant subject such as international relations or public policy may be beneficial. This can make it more straightforward to get into defence policy, but it is also possible to enter into the field without these qualifications.</p><p>Technical experience is valued in the field, so having years of experience in engineering before beginning work on policy is beneficial. It would make sense for many engineers to target an area of policy that is quite technical (such as emerging technologies), as they may have more credibility here.</p><p>Nuclear weapons policy touches on many technical areas. Becoming an expert in the intersection between nuclear weapons and an emerging technology which which one has existing expertise is an effective strategy for building credibility. This would include the intersection between nuclear weapons policy and topics such as AI, nanotechnology, and computational modelling.</p><p>Particularly high-impact areas of policy include:</p><ul><li><strong>Disarmament advocacy</strong>: Disarmament has led to a huge reduction in the potential death toll from nuclear war and remains the most effective way to lower nuclear risks.</li><li><strong>Targeting strategy</strong>: Changes to a nation\u2019s targeting strategy could have a huge impact on the death toll in a nuclear exchange. Presently, <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/resource/us-nuclear-targets/\">both military infrastructure and densely populated cities</a> would be targeted by most nations in a nuclear strike. Among the justifications for bombing cities is that they contain political centres, manufacturing facilities and key infrastructure. Having targeting plans target fewer cities could save millions of lives in an exchange.</li></ul><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/2jy3JU-ORpo\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jy3JU-ORpo\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><ul><li><strong>Preventing accidents</strong>: More strict policies preventing accidents, thefts and improving security at nuclear facilities and in command and control systems would be very impactful.</li><li><strong>Non-proliferation</strong>: Proliferation of nuclear material and nuclear weapons destabilises deterrence and international cooperation.</li></ul><p>One notable program for those interested in transitioning to policy is the <a href=\"https://sgs.princeton.edu/school\">Princeton School on Science and Global Security</a>, which trains scientists and engineers from around the world in technical perspectives on understanding, reducing, and ending the threat from nuclear weapons. It is a short program that runs each year and mostly accepts graduate students in STEM.</p><p>Other policy fellowships include the <a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships/become-st-policy-fellow\">Science and Technology Policy Fellowship</a> at the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/jobs/stanton-fellows.html\">Stanton Nuclear Security Fellows Program</a> at RAND.

These organisations can have an effect on nuclear strategy in most nations. <i><strong>This strategy should only be attempted by those who are already unusually well-positioned to do so</strong></i>. The agency of individuals is generally limited in these institutions.</p><p>Engineers who already have experience in defence technologies may be well-positioned for this.</p><h2>Risks, pitfalls, and things to keep in mind</h2><p>Much of the work within the field of nuclear weapons is likely either actively harmful or is extremely uncertain if it would have a positive effect. Engineers are especially vulnerable to doing harmful work in this field despite good intentions, as it is often assumed that engineers are happy to work on any technically challenging project regardless of its positive or negative impact. This assumption is not poorly founded, as many are. This means that an engineer\u2019s ethical or political position is often not taken into account during hiring or when an organisation is putting teams together for projects. For example, this article\u2019s author had completed several recruitment steps for a research project, unaware the research was funded by a missile manufacturer to design more effective missiles, some with nuclear capabilities.</p><p>With this in mind, we recommend avoiding the following notable areas:</p><h3>Avoid improving missile defence systems</h3><p>Intercontinental ballistic missile defence systems can seem on their face to be a viable strategy to avert or reduce the damages incurred in a nuclear exchange. However, their testing record and the international response to their development tell a different story.</p><p>Missile defence systems have proven in full-scale testing to have a very limited success rate at intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles. This is true even in a best-case scenario where the oncoming missile is not equipped to overcome missile defence systems and the trajectory and timing of the missile are known.</p><p>The development of missile defence systems has proven to be relatively slow and extremely expensive. For countries pursuing these systems, such as the US, this has led to adversaries building advanced delivery systems such as <a href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Multiple-Independently_New-1.pdf\">multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles,</a> fractional orbital bombardment systems, hypersonic glide vehicles and other technologies designed to overcome missile defences. These technologies have proven cheaper and easier to develop and produce than missile defence systems. In a future world with less stable disarmament norms, a country could also merely increase its nuclear arsenal to overwhelm these defences at a low cost.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/l4AJq4MqwwU\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4AJq4MqwwU\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/90nNOEadYrI\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/90nNOEadYrI\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>Intercontinental ballistic missile defence systems are ineffective and an extremely destabilising force to deterrence and disarmament norms. Work related to advancing these systems should be avoided and great care should be taken in any work that might be related to missile defence.</p><p>It should be noted that the smaller \u201ctheatre\u201d missile defence systems may not carry the same implications. These intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometres, often within combat zones. These have less of an effect on the deterrence strategy in place for ICBM use and may be helpful in reducing battlefield deaths.</p><h3>Avoid advancing the capabilities of weapons systems</h3><p>As one might expect, advances in nuclear weapons systems will typically make them more deadly and increase the destruction in a nuclear exchange. This includes advancements in yield, speed, range, manoeuvrability, telemetry and overcoming missile defences. As technical professions in this field have very little strategic input, <strong>engineers should not attempt to change organisations such as defence contractors from the inside</strong>.</p><p>Significant advances in weapons systems generally also lead to arms races, where either the same technology or a negating technology is rapidly developed by adversaries. Therefore, even if there was a nation that the whole international community would benefit from having weapons superiority, it may not be wise for that nation to pursue advancements. Incidentally, it is not at all clear that such a nation exists today.</p><p>Advancing weapon accuracy is one notable exception. Greater accuracy could lead to more effective targeting of military infrastructure and therefore fewer casualties due to smaller weapon numbers and yields being used to hit targets. However, attempting to advance weapon accuracy is likely a suboptimal strategy for impact.</p><p>Engineers should not pursue careers in advancing weapons systems and instead work on interventions that plausibly directly reduce nuclear risks. If technical expertise in aerospace or nuclear physics is required for some specific career path, these skills are often more easily obtained in the non-military aerospace or nuclear power industries respectively.</p><h3>Avoid spreading information hazards</h3><p>Information hazards are <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf\">defined as</a> a risk that arises from the dissemination or the potential dissemination of information that may cause harm or enable some agent to cause harm. Publishing technical information, drawing attention to sensitive data sources, or releasing information that inadvertently signals the intentions of a nation to others could all increase nuclear risks under certain circumstances.</p><p>Information hazards are detrimental to non-proliferation efforts, as they could aid nations or even terror groups in developing nuclear capabilities. Under some circumstances, they can also be detrimental to international relations.</p><p>The open source intelligence community may be an especially concerning source of information hazards. Although much of their work is beneficial to transparency, there is potential to release information to the public that causes great harm and extreme caution should be taken by those doing openly published work.</p><p>In order to work in this field some amount of sensitive information needs to be handled and communicated to others and extreme care should be taken in this. Work in this field is however extremely important and should not be disregarded for fear of information hazards alone.</p><p><strong>Avoid</strong> <strong>advancing radiological weapons or their underlying technologies</strong></p><p>Radiological weapons disperse radioactive material to inflict radiation damage or cause radiation contamination of an area. Though these weapons are often thought of in relation to non-state actors or terror groups, <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/45/2/51/95262/Death-Dust-The-Little-Known-Story-of-U-S-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">they have been developed by several nations in the past.</a></p><p>Radiological weapons are of special concern as they can produce a much more intense fallout than regular nuclear weapons and can render an area uninhabitable for a long period. The radiation from a salted bomb for example would <a href=\"https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html#:~:text=Initially%20gamma%20radiation,about%2075%20years.\">initially be 35 times more intense than a typical fission bomb and would only reduce to the same level as the fission bomb after 75 years due to its shorter radiation half-life.</a></p><p>The long-lasting effects of radiological weapons and the potential spread of radioactive material present a serious and more long-lasting threat to humanity if used and work on them should be avoided. Thankfully developing weapons employing radiological warfare is uncommon today, though <a href=\"https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/its-time-to-prohibit-radiological-weapons/#:~:text=This%20situation%2C%20for,a%20cobalt%20shell.\">some development</a> has been seen in recent years.</p><p>Despite the high potential impact, nuclear safety is likely one of the highest risk areas to do technical work, similar to technical work in <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/how-engineers-can-have-impact-working-in-biosecurity\">Biorisk and Biosecurity</a>. Any attempts at impact in this cause area should be done with careful contemplation and consultation with others in the field.</p><h1>Learn more</h1><h2>Additional resources</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t0RLZ_pl6RoBIR6nVF4jMonlE5rFY6_Z/view\">Nuclear Weapons Reading Group Syllabus \u2013 PDF</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk\">Sequence: Risks from Nuclear Weapons \u2013 EA Forum</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/N4oG4jMZRkbaKuPZF/nuclear-risk-research-ideas-summary-and-introduction\">Nuclear risk research ideas: summary and introduction \u2013 EA Forum</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tutorials.nti.org/\">NTI Education Tutorials \u2013 Nuclear Threat Initiative</a></li><li><a href=\"https://unidir.org/disarmament-orientation-course-2022\">Online Disarmament Orientation Course \u2013 UN Institute for Disarmament Research</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sgs.princeton.edu/about\">Program on Science and Global Security \u2013 Princeton University</a></li></ul><h2>Relevant organisations</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://nti.org/\">Nuclear Threat Initiative</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.rand.org/\">RAND</a></li><li><a href=\"https://longview.org/\">Longview Philanthropy</a></li><li><a href=\"https://unidir.org/\">UN Institute for Disarmament Research</a></li><li>See the <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/how-engineers-can-work-on-disarmament-nuclear-war-security#Research-analysis-and-educational-work\">Research, analysis, and educational work</a> section</li></ul><p><i>We are grateful to </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/michaela\"><i>MA</i></a><i> for their input and feedback.

We encourage EU citizens interested in AI governance to apply.</li></ul><h1>The EU AI Act: Where are we now?</h1><p>As the EU AI Act trilogues come to a close, AI governance in Europe is on the brink of a significant milestone.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the precise scope of the act remains somewhat unclear, there are hopeful signs that it will regulate foundation models.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231011155323/https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:e0649735-a372-11eb-9585-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_2&amp;format=PDF\"><u>Early drafts of the EU AI Act</u></a> listed a series of high-risk areas in which the deployment of AI was restricted (e.g. law enforcement; migration, asylum &amp; border management). More recent drafts include an article which extends this legislation to cover foundation models and would require providers to demonstrate the mitigation of reasonably foreseeable risks &amp; document remaining non-mitigatable risks.</p><p>If such requirements remain following these final trilogue negotiations, major AI labs must decide whether to withdraw their models from the EU, create separate models for an EU market, or develop a single model which is compliant with the EU AI Act. If AI labs opt for this third option, this would constitute a \u201cde facto\u201d Brussels Effect and EU standards would become a global norm.</p><h1>Opportunities for impact beyond the AI Act</h1><p>However, passing the AI Act is just the beginning. The act will not come into effect until Fall 2025 and the window for effecting change here has not yet closed and is likely to extend several years into the future beyond this. For EU citizens interested in reducing risks from advanced AI, we believe there is still a strong impact case for entering European policy.</p><h3>Enforcement</h3><p>Enforcement is an essential component of the EU AI Act. Without adequate enforcement, the act will likely have little impact on reducing risks from advanced AI.</p><p>The challenges of enforcing the AI Act are akin to those faced with GDPR. Just as GDPR is enforced by individual data protection authorities within each member state, enforcement of the AI Act is also likely to involve a shared responsibility between national bodies at a member state level and European authorities. Organisations tasked with this responsibility will likely be talent and resource-constrained. This provides an opportunity for knowledgeable individuals with a strong prioritisation mindset to have a large impact</p><p><strong>How to enter:&nbsp;</strong>Apply directly to relevant open vacancies at the EU level (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012100458/https://recruitment.jrc.ec.europa.eu/showprj_iframe.php?id=2682&amp;apply=vacancy-for-auxiliary.php?inst=18002DTD&amp;pid=2682&amp;target=_blank#toolbar=0\"><u>this role at ECAT</u></a><u>)</u>. Join your local data protection authority responsible for enforcing GDPR (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012100734/https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm\"><u>full list here</u></a>) with the intention of transitioning to an AI department if/when it is established or alternatively leveraging this experience to join the organisation which will ultimately enforce the AI Act in your country.</p><h3>Technical standards &amp; guidelines</h3><p>Technical standards and guidelines will continue to be developed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cencenelec.eu/\"><u>CEN and CENELEC</u></a> between 2023-2025. The forthcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/10/03/letter-to-eu-s-future-ai-office-pub-90683\"><u>EU AI Office could also play an important role here</u></a>, as could national standardisation committees. These standards will play a pivotal role in shaping the practical aspects of the act, e.g. outlining the exact risk management requirements for voluntary audits. Those with technical backgrounds and a strong understanding of the risks of advanced AI models could make significant contributions here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to enter:</strong> Those interested could join one of the National Standards Bodies (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012103909/https://standards.cencenelec.eu/dyn/www/f?p=CEN:5\"><u>full list</u></a>), the bodies responsible for standards in each of the member states; the European Standards Organisations (i.e.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cencenelec.eu/about-cen/\"><u>CEN</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cencenelec.eu/about-cenelec/\"><u>CENELEC</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/\"><u>ETSI</u></a>), the organisations responsible for all EU standard-setting; the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/jobs-european-commission_en\"><u>European Commission</u></a>; or through think tanks working on developing technical standards.</p><h3>Exporting European regulation</h3><p>The EU\u2019s standards and regulations have the potential to influence the global AI landscape. Provided that sensible technical standards &amp; enforcement mechanisms are enacted, it could make sense for individuals to encourage other international bodies to adopt similar protocols. For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012102316/https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ttc-joint-roadmap-trustworthy-ai-and-risk-management\"><u>TTC</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012102434/https://www.oecd.org/digital/artificial-intelligence/\"><u>OECD</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012102506/https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm21880.doc.htm\"><u>UN</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/07/3e39b82d-464d-403a-b6cb-dc0e1bdec642-230906_Ministerial-clean-Draft-Hiroshima-Ministers-Statement68.pdf\"><u>G7</u></a> are currently considering frameworks for classifying AI systems and technical standards for regulating them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to enter:</strong> Those with strong diplomacy skills (or a professional background in diplomacy) and an understanding of the relevant aspects of EU technical standards / enforcement protocols could join other international bodies likely to introduce AI policy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Advocating for increased AI safety funding</h3><p>Lobbying the next Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034) for AI safety funding could also be a high impact opportunity. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012111810/https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/funding-digital\"><u>2021-2027 MFF</u></a> allocated ~\u20ac7.6 billion to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012111845/https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme\"><u>Digital Europe Programme</u></a> which aims to accelerate economic recovery and drive the digital transformation of Europe (among others, areas invested in include core AI &amp; supercomputing capacities).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231012111823/https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en\"><u>Horizon Europe</u></a> also received a dedicated budget of \u20ac95.5 billion for research related to \u201cdigital, industry and space\u201d. This budget will be dedicated to developing AI, high performance computing, and other key digital technologies. Given the scale of the funding available, redirecting even a small portion of it to safety-focused efforts could be enormously impactful.</p><p><strong>How to enter:</strong> Joining the European Commission, likely within the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/research-and-innovation_en\"><u>DG RTD</u></a> could be a helpful step. The European Parliament will play a role later on, so joining as an assistant to a relevant MEP could also be helpful. It\u2019s also possible to advocate through other channels, for example at a think tank focused on tech policy or through a national government.</p><h3>Other potential paths</h3><ul><li><strong>Updating the AI Act:</strong> Technical standards &amp; guidelines could be updated over time as models advance. It\u2019s unclear where this responsibility will fall, but working at the forthcoming EU AI Office could enable one to shape future amendments to the act in a positive direction.</li><li><strong>EU Careers focused on a narrow threat model: </strong>It could make sense for a portion of talent to specialise in a specific domain relevant to concrete&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/ai-risk\"><u>risk model</u></a>. This could be especially true if you have a background particularly suited to one area (e.g. an individual with a biotechnology background could be best suited to working on the potential use of AI to release engineered pandemics). Other options could include specialising within cybersecurity to improve Europe\u2019s resilience to infrastructure attacks (e.g. at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/\"><u>ENISA</u></a>) or in tackling disinformation to protect against AI-facilitated disinformation campaigns.</li></ul><h1>Interested?

We see carefully developed spines in <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/bB3GdagE7d9t5z7M9\">stickleback fishes</a>, porcupines, and many other species that changed their anatomy over time to tackle the surrounding changes. These changes take multiple generations of time, paying the cost by their bodily features and functions. It should be noted that these are not weapons proper, but rather, defensive armor. The chain of development starts from a purely defensive body cover\u2014void of any means to attack\u2014to the growth of small weapons to aid in defense,&nbsp; to the generation of enhancements (like venom, acid, etc) in those small weapons. We see that in the case of sticklebacks, marine fish have better weapons than freshwater fish (whose anatomy varies in a mere period of years).<br>&nbsp;</p><p>A similar pattern is observed when we study the teeth and claws of wildlife species of sabertooths, cats, wolves, etc. Each species developed their attacking weapons based on their environmental needs. The evolution of large sizes increased their power to deal damage to their prey. But enhanced performance in one context can detract from performance in another, forcing a compromise. For some time, there were different kinds of tradeoffs in most of these species\u2014speed, agility, ability to hunt or even chew, etc. In Fact, bigger weapons were better for killing prey, but they also prevented an animal from catching prey in the first place. Eventually, they became extinct.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>For as long as we can imagine, deadly jaws, fangs, and canines served as the primary weapon. Different animal species settle on their body structure while evolution takes several turns. Many techniques, like sit and wait, ambush and target are direct results of how to make the most out of your weapon. Small predators like praying mantis have a limb mechanism similar to the working of a gun mechanism. Species like Mantis Shrimp even use the concept to cause vacuum explosions to stun nearby prey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Following this path, numerous changes in the armor of soldiers were made during the earlier eras of warfare. To strike a balance has always been key. Even in tribal battles, spears/ax modifications juggled in size with the passage of time. As we see in the later parts, development along the same lines leads to far greater advances in modern arms.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Mayank Modi"}}, {"_id": "z8PuHEpAuZx3wPq4n", "title": "Intro to the book: Animal Weapons by Douglas Emlen.", "postedAt": "2023-10-11T21:26:47.573Z", "htmlBody": "<p>\u201c<i>Reminder that you can listen to this post and other EA Forum/LessWrong posts on your podcast player with&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://pod.link/1587343144\"><i>The Nonlinear Library</i></a><i>.\u201d</i></p><hr><p><i><strong>A</strong>nimal Weapons: The Evolution of Battle is written by an evolutionary biologist, who extended research into arms and armament evolution while studying the origin of weapons in varied species found all across nature.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I have been planning to write a post about this book for the better part of 2023.

This serves as a subtle reason for the first-ever creation of any weapon. Defense\u2014a means of protection\u2014is the first choice of weapon for all species, including humans.

In simple terms,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-preservation\"><u>Self Preservation</u></a>.

He founded one of the largest private charitable foundations in history, giving away his entire fortune within his lifetime. He was almost obsessively secretive in his giving, and set a standard of seriousness which inspired the Giving Pledge and many of its pledgers.</p><hr><p>Feeney was born at the tail end of the Great Depression into modest circumstances, raised by blue-collar Irish-American parents, and became the first of his family to attend university.</p><p>The story of his fortune began after Feeney enrolled in the U.S. Air Force, soon deployed to Japan as a radio operator during the Korean War. The 1944 GI Bill of Rights had entitled returning GIs to a course of study after WWII, and the scheme was renewed for Korean War veterans. He used the allowance to attend Cornell, graduated in 1956, then travelled to Europe to indulge a newly developed wanderlust.</p><p>One night in a bar in Villefranche he met an Englishman, Bob Edmonds. Edmonds had noticed that U.S. sailors were entitled to buy up to five bottles of spirits at ports, duty free, and have them shipped back home as unaccompanied baggage. The savings were significant even accounting for the shipping. In the immediate post-war years, \u2018duty free shopping\u2019 had emerged as a half-familiar concept, but the business had remained uncompetitive. So Edmonds had noticed an opportunity: take orders for European liquor from these sailors at port towns in Spain and elsewhere, arrange for shipping back home, and take a cut. The trick was finding a way to board the ships as they docked. This required some schmoozing, and the kind a Cornell certificate and U.S. military service record could help with. Edmonds explained he was looking for help from a partner like Feeney; Feeney obliged.</p><p>The scheme worked fantastically. But while Edmonds was visiting the Caribbean in search of new opportunities, Feeney heard that an old classmate had made his way to Europe also. Robert Miller was one year Feeney\u2019s senior at Cornell, agreed to become Feeney\u2019s business partner and see what could become of the duty free scheme he had going. Soon not just sailors were visiting port towns, but an influx of tourists to Europe, largely from the U.S. They opened stores, not just in port towns but in major cities too. They expanded from alcohol to watches, perfumes, and jewellery.</p><p>In 1960 Feeney arranged to visit Harry Adler, the owner of \u2018Duty Free Shoppers\u2019 (DFS) and a potential rival. Feeney had considered arranging an ad deal, where Adler might promote his products. But Adler was unexpectedly forthright: his business was failing, nothing but debt. So Feeney offered to buy the entire company, and to employ Adler until the deal went through.&nbsp;</p><p>Next came airports, fast becoming more accessible to middle-class tourists. First Hong Kong and Honolulu, later outlets in Europe and the Americas, Asia, Oceania. Their duty free concession stands at airports started as a sideshow but grew to become the main event. Feeney and Miller inherited a failing business and made it a growing empire.</p><p>As his wealth grew Feeney had begun to think about what to do with it. He was never especially comfortable with the standard options for the wealthy to conspicuously consume their money. Wealth felt more like a responsibility. \u201cI am not really into money,\u201d he told the reporter. \u201cSome people get their kicks that way. That\u2019s not my style.\u201d</p><p>So he began to give it away in a piecemeal fashion \u2014 $10,000 to the current dean of the catering school he attended in Cornell; a lump sum for the provision of a sports facility for his children\u2019s school in Nice. In the late 70s, a friend of Feeney\u2019s had mentioned the name of Andrew Carnegie \u2014 someone he might want to read about. Also the son of an immigrant to the U.S., Carnegie had accumulated enormous wealth in iron and steel,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike\"><u>breaking strikes</u></a> with small militias and implementing gruelling working hours in the process. Then he disbursed almost all of it to universities and foundations<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6wah3t5y59w\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6wah3t5y59w\">[1]</a></sup></span>. His essay called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html\"><u>\u2018The Gospel of Wealth\u2019</u></a> laid out his philosophy of giving. It\u2019s essentially an early earn-to-give manifesto, impelling its reader to accumulate as much wealth as possible, then give it all away for the betterment of humanity. \"The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\"</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:67.69%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/geve7pkjwhzhvtqfpkos\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/yd4fsu4qxgjluhisozra 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/qarnfkckcknl0s4qsuo6 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/fl1grzy6t3awpor3ijjg 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/cnpvvffkjj4oc4j95sli 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/srpga8oi2t5wjvbucu5u 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/v80aatxbao5iitmzujcb 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/t18pn0rrbob1mikt2e9z 1680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/ikdvxqy7tkcgv6jtvcir 1920w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/qaq39xqgrhjqqpkiirod 2160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yS3qRbHzzWxjR2Ehp/b4y6h4tiqq0brhzxijkn 2400w\"><figcaption>Andrew Carnegie</figcaption></figure><p>Feeney read this, and in 1982 was moved to found something more more lasting. This \u2018something\u2019 was The Atlantic Foundation, the first of The Atlantic Philanthropies. But there was no fanfare, because at the same time Feeney had decided his&nbsp; giving \u2014 and thus his role as the funding source for Atlantic \u2014 would be entirely anonymous. Atlantic Philanthropies would require that grantees do not disclose the source of their donation.</p><p>While silent about his role, Feeney was nonetheless restlessly engaged with how his money was being spent. He travelled the world to meet grantees, and beneficiaries of their work. A biography recounts that he told a correspondent \u201chis idea of helping charities was not simply handing money over but personally seeing that it was effectively used to help as many people as possible\u201d.</p><p>There are some advantages to anonymity: potential grantees will be frank and candid, not imagining they\u2019re supposed to be impressing you. You can be confident that reputational effects aren\u2019t clouding your judgement. And if you don\u2019t ask for naming rights, you can leverage more donations from those who do. But it\u2019s hard not to imagine Feeney\u2019s secrecy had a more personal, psychological source; a kind of reflexive modesty.</p><p>To finance Atlantic, Feeney transferred his entire 38.75% stake in DFS to Atlantic in 1984. For more than a decade, even Feeney\u2019s partner Miller was oblivious to the transfer of ownership. Feeney\u2019s philanthropic identity was revealed in 1996, by force, after Feeney had proposed a sale of their shares in DFS to a French luxury conglomerate. Miller had opposed this plan and prepared a presumptive lawsuit; and Feeney anticipated that the legal battle would compel him to disclose how he no longer owned the share in DFS which Miller took him to own, but had transferred it to Atlantic. So Feeney agreed to out himself. The New York Times broke the story: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/23/nyregion/he-gave-away-600-million-and-no-one-knew.html\"><u>He Gave Away $600 Million, and No One Knew</u></a>\u201d. Atlantic made $1.63 billion from the deal.</p><p>Since transferring his stock in 1984, DFS grew tremendously, and Feeney had reinvested unspent funds into other businesses with similar success. Consequently Feeney ultimately gave away not just $600 million but closer to $8 billion in all.</p><p>An underappreciated fact about billionaire philanthropy is that it appears to be the norm, not the exception, to die having failed to spend all \u2014 even most \u2014 the money a billionaire commits to giving. Sometimes this is a considered strategy, as in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/627475/200-year-old-gift-from-benjamin-franklin-to-boston-and-philadelphia\"><u>Ben Franklin\u2019s endowment</u></a> to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia \u2014 designed to go untouched for a full century while it accrued interest \u2014 or as in newer thinking around \u2018<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/patient-altruism\"><u>patient philanthropy</u></a>\u2019. But mostly this happens (as far as I can tell) through some combination of distraction, unambition, hesitance around delegating grant decisions, and mostly because it is very difficult to find and prioritise and perform due diligence on and process enough charitable grants to total over one billion dollars.</p><p>Chuck Feeney gave everything. Before the \u201896 lawsuit, magazines would speculate on how many billions his net worth amounted to; unaware he was even then worth less than $5 million. He lived his last years in rented accommodation. He preferred to fly coach until his late 70s, owned no car, and wore that coveted timepiece, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W\"><u>Casio F-91W</u></a>.</p><p>Does it look like that $8 billion was directed mostly according to cost-effectiveness thinking? Did it coincide much with causes most celebrated by EA? Honestly, no. I get the sense Feeney liked to think about his giving in terms of giving back to institutions he benefited from, and building personal connections without locales across the world, generating a sense of obligation through closeness. But less so maximising 'impact' or 'good' in the floaty, faceless sense. His single largest beneficiary was his alma mater Cornell, to which he gave nearly $1 billion. He gave to public health works in Vietnam; universities and research institutions in Australia, Ireland, and Northern Ireland; a fellowship program with a remit I\u2019m not clear on. He also cared about systemic change \u2014 especially the peace process in Ireland \u2014 and put large amounts of control in the hands of local leaders. Nor was he afraid to leverage his social and political capital to push for changes he wanted to see, or to give political causes in his personal giving, including Sinn F\u00e9in.</p><p>It\u2019s also not clear that Feeney\u2019s commitment to anonymity is worth celebrating in itself. After all, giving openly is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/should-charity-be-anonymous\"><u>one way to inspire others</u></a> to follow your lead, especially if you\u2019re in a position to give large amounts, or you can demonstrate ways to think about how to do more good per dollar. Not to mention how much \u2018anonymous\u2019 giving&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/should-you-admire-bragshtml\"><u>involves a game</u></a> of getting others to know you\u2019re a great person while maintaining plausible deniability that you wanted them to think you\u2019re a great person<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref47r86w14mtf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn47r86w14mtf\">[2]</a></sup></span>. But Feeney\u2019s anonymity seemed genuine, I claim. Reports from those who knew him corroborate the ultra-humble image. Even after his link to Atlantic Philanthropy was revealed, he avoided the media and never became especially well-known. And if that\u2019s right, one reason to celebrate his anonymity is as a kind of existence proof of billionaire philanthropy motivated by, as far as anyone can tell, pure altruism.</p><p>But I also think there is a strong case that Feeney\u2019s approach to giving inspired significantly much more billionaire philanthropy, including giving which ultimately was more explicitly guided by impact. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://givingpledge.org\"><u>Giving Pledge</u></a> was founded in 2010 by Warren Buffett, Melinda French Gates, and Bill Gates, both parties pledging to give away 99% of their fortunes. The same year, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna also joined the Pledge. To date,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Pledge\"><u>total pledges</u></a> to the Giving Pledge add up to the best part of a trillion dollars<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjvmxikautjb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjvmxikautjb\">[3]</a></sup></span>. Feeney signed the pledge in 2011, but more importantly there is a case that he inspired it. \u201cChuck has set an example,\u201d said Buffett in a 2014 event, \u201c[he] is my hero and Bill Gates\u2019 hero. He should be everybody\u2019s hero\u201d.</p><p>Feeney died on October 9, 2023, at the age of 92.</p><p>More:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/23/nyregion/he-gave-away-600-million-and-no-one-knew.html\"><u>He Gave Away $600 Million, and No One Knew</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Feeney\"><u>Wikipedia page</u></a></li><li>Book:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2842145\"><i><u>The Billionaire Who Wasn't: How Chuck Feeney Secretly Made and Gave Away a Fortune</u></i></a></li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn6wah3t5y59w\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref6wah3t5y59w\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.carnegie.org/\"><u>Carnegie Corporation of New York</u></a> remains a major grantmaker on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.carnegie.org/programs/international-peace-and-security/\"><u>peace and security work</u></a>, among other areas.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn47r86w14mtf\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref47r86w14mtf\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCSyHBuw5DE\"><i><u>Nobody told me I could be anonymous and tell people!</u></i></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnjvmxikautjb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefjvmxikautjb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Though, again, it's unclear how this translates into donations within pledgers' lifetimes.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "finm"}}, {"_id": "AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL", "title": "Metaculus Launches Space Technology & Climate Forecasting Initiative ", "postedAt": "2023-10-11T01:29:51.528Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/pp4vmvnhe9aby25sxmdv\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/i1qtk7wnnfyrm6avp8qo 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/yrbtyperwllbstxkdvl5 280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/yjbjjug5ddq7v62e1bek 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/t06ttmzdhypdpnxfkekp 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/gucl8dkrkv9gwanlwdsp 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/doecuco1xq1njg8dhijg 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/n2tyboplgkongj66rbpx 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/ng4zlfgbr9qbyqagdl1n 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/hac267xxrxdzvelnicss 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/AHKLbZtpni3JNwCjL/ovea1kdbiynyfq3bblfe 1319w\"></figure><p>The number of satellites launched into space has <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space?country=~OWID_WRL\">grown substantially in recent years</a>, and this enhanced access to space may enable new frontiers in sustainable development and climate monitoring.

Here, we provide a preview of the entire sequence.</p><h1><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h1><p>We want to help others as much as we can. Knowing how is hard: there are many empirical, normative, and decision-theoretic uncertainties that make it difficult to identify the best paths toward that goal. Should we be focused on sparing children from malaria? Reducing suffering on factory farms? Mitigating the threats associated with AI? Should we split our attention between all three? Something else entirely?</p><p>Here are two common responses to these questions:</p><ul><li>We ought to set priorities based on what would maximize expected value.</li><li>Expected value maximization (EVM) supports prioritizing existential risk (x-risk) mitigation over all else.</li></ul><p>This post introduces a sequence from Rethink Priorities\u2019 Worldview Investigations Team (WIT) that examines these two claims. The sequence highlights some reasons for skepticism about them both\u2014reasons stemming from significant uncertainty about the correct normative theory of decision-making and uncertainty about many of the parameters and assumptions that enter into expected value calculations.&nbsp;It concludes with some practical resources for navigating uncertainty. What tools&nbsp;can we create to reason more transparently about tough questions? And&nbsp;at the end of the day,&nbsp;how should we make decisions?</p><p>Accordingly, this sequence is a contribution to the discussion about macro-level cause prioritization\u2014i.e., how we split&nbsp;resources between global health and development, animals, and existential risk.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxk5fhudwjod\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxk5fhudwjod\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Before we go any further, though, let\u2019s be clear: this sequence does <i>not </i>defend a specific split for any particular actor or group. Instead, it tries to clarify certain fundamental issues that bear on the split through the following series of reports.</p><p>The sequence has three parts. In the <strong>first</strong>, we consider alternatives to EVM.</p><ul><li>We start by noting that some plausible moral theories avoid EVM entirely: they offer an entirely different way to set priorities. If the standard view is that effectiveness should be measured in something like counterfactual welfare gains per dollar spent, our report on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/3KsvReHD6CckfwHak\"><strong>contractualism and resource allocation</strong></a>&nbsp;illustrates how we might set priorities if we were to measure effectiveness in something like \u201cstrength-adjusted moral claims addressed per dollar spent.\u201d</li><li>In our report on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/HMakzketADQq4bkvD\"><strong>risk and animals</strong></a>, we examine several ways of incorporating risk sensitivity into the comparisons between interventions to help numerous animals with a relatively low probability of sentience (such as insects) and less numerous animals of likely or all-but-certain sentience (such as chickens and humans). We show that while one kind of risk aversion makes us more inclined to help insects, two other kinds of risk aversion suggest the opposite.</li><li>We generalize this discussion of risk in our report on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t\"><strong>risk-aversion&nbsp;and cause prioritization</strong></a>. Here, we model the cost-effectiveness of different cause areas in light of several formal models of risk aversion, evaluating how various risk attitudes affect value comparisons and how risk attitudes interact with one another.</li></ul><p>The <strong>second</strong>&nbsp;part of the sequence examines the claim that EVM robustly favors x-risk&nbsp;mitigation efforts over global health or animal welfare causes.</p><ul><li>In our report on the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/LCfd56cBeRzrMiAhw\"><strong>common sense case for spending on x-risk mitigation</strong></a>, we consider a simple model for assessing x-risk mitigation efforts where the value is restricted to the next few generations. We show that, given plausible assumptions, x-risk may not be orders of magnitude better than our best funding opportunities in other causes, especially when evaluated under non-EVM risk attitudes.</li><li>We then explore a more complicated hypothesis about the future, the so-called \u201ctime of perils\u201d (TOP) hypothesis, that is commonly used to claim that x-risk is robustly more valuable than other causes. We delineate a number of assumptions that go into <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/i5cuLZH3SQJigiHMs\"><strong>the TOP-based case for focusing on x-risk</strong></a> and highlight some of the reasons to be uncertain about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>As we reflect on the time of perils and more general risk structures, we investigate <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/S9H86osFKhfFBCday\"><strong>the value of existential risk mitigation efforts</strong></a>&nbsp;under different risk scenarios, different&nbsp;lengths of time during which risk is reduced, and a range of population growth cases. This report shows that the value of x-risk work varies considerably depending on the scenario in question and that value is only astronomical under a select few&nbsp;assumptions.

Written by RP\u2019s Co-CEOs,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>this post comments on the theory and practice of setting priorities when your own resources are on the line.</li></ul><p>With this quick summary behind us, we\u2019ll provide a bit more detail about the major narrative of the sequence.</p><h1><strong>2. Making Comparisons</strong></h1><p>To compare actions that would&nbsp;benefit humans and&nbsp;chickens, we must find some common currency for comparing human and chicken welfare. To compare sure-thing investments versus moonshots with potentially great payoffs, we need to consider how to weigh probabilities when making decisions. To compare actions with near-term versus long-term consequences, we need to consider how we should take into account our uncertainty about the far future. In some of these cases, it can feel as though we are dealing with different kinds of value (human and animal welfare); in others, we may be dealing with the same kind of value, but it\u2019s mediated by different factors (probability and time).</p><p>It\u2019s difficult to know how to make comparisons across these apparent differences. Still, these comparisons are all the more&nbsp;pressing in a funding-constrained&nbsp;environment, where investments in any given cause come at the expense of investments in others. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A standard approach for making these comparisons&nbsp;favors maximizing expected value (EVM). The expected value (EV)&nbsp;of an action takes the sum of the values of the possible consequences of that action weighted by the probabilities of those consequences coming to pass. EVM&nbsp;states that we ought to perform&nbsp;the action that has the highest EV (or one of the highest EV actions if there are ties).</p><p>This decision procedure tells us how to incorporate payoffs with uncertainties over those payoffs. Moreover, it promises a way to compare very different kinds of actions. For instance, while we may&nbsp;not&nbsp;have a precise theory about how to compare human and chicken welfare, we&nbsp;may not need one. Instead, we can simply perform sensitivity tests: we can consider our upper and lower bound estimates of the value of chicken welfare to see whether our decision turns on our uncertainty. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re in the clear.</p><p>In addition to its pragmatic appeal, EVM also has the backing of formidable philosophical arguments purporting to show that it is a uniquely rational way of making decisions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc1iityb0syq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc1iityb0syq\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, EVM&nbsp;has some highly unintuitive consequences,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4sl46zsb1dq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4sl46zsb1dq\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;many of which stem from a simple fact: the highest EV option needn\u2019t be one where success is at all likely, as&nbsp;reductions to the probability of an outcome can always be compensated for by proportional increases in its value. For instance, if we assume that value is proportional to the number of individuals affected, it follows that as the number of individuals affected by an action increases, the probability of success of those actions can get proportionally smaller while maintaining the same EV. As a result, actions that can affect large numbers of individuals need only have a small probability of success in order to have higher EV than more sure-thing&nbsp;actions that affect fewer individuals.</p><p>Consider two&nbsp;examples&nbsp;of this problem. First, humans and other large animals are vastly outnumbered by insects, shrimps, and other invertebrates. Since it is less likely that the latter&nbsp;creatures are&nbsp;sentient,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwf0n6cw4vo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwf0n6cw4vo\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;it\u2019s less likely&nbsp;that actions to benefit them will result in any value at all. However, given the sheer number of these invertebrates, even a small probability of sentience will produce the result that actions that would benefit invertebrates have higher EV than actions that would benefit humans and other large animals. The result is (what Jeff Sebo&nbsp;calls) the \u201c<a href=\"https://jeffsebodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/the-rebugnant-conclusion-.pdf\"><u>rebugnant conclusion</u></a>,\u201d according to which we ought to redirect aid from&nbsp;humans toward insects and shrimps.</p><p>Comparing<i>&nbsp;</i>future and present people provides another example where&nbsp;large numbers tend to dominate EV calculations. One way to justify working on x-risk mitigation projects is based on the many future people they might allow to come into existence.&nbsp;If the human species were to persist for, say, another million years, the number of future people would be much larger than it would be if humanity were only to survive for another&nbsp;few centuries. So, let\u2019s consider an action with a low probability of ensuring that humanity lasts another million years rather than a few hundred years. The value of success would be far greater than the value of a successful action that affects a relatively small number of present people. Therefore, actions that have a low probability of bringing about a positive, population-rich&nbsp;future will tend to have higher expected values than more sure thing&nbsp;actions that affect only (or primarily) present people.</p><p>You might already think that going all-in on shrimps or x-risk work is fanatical. (A view that\u2019s compatible with wanting to spend significant<i>&nbsp;</i>resources on these causes!)&nbsp;If you don\u2019t, then we can push this reasoning further. Suppose you\u2019re approached by someone who claims to have magical powers and promises you an astronomical reward tomorrow in exchange for your wallet today. Given the potential benefits, EVM suggests that it would be irrational not to fork over your wallet even if you assign a miniscule (but non-zero) probability to their claims (i.e., <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/pascal-s-mugging\"><u>you\u2019re vulnerable to \u201cPascal\u2019s mugging\u201d</u></a>). If there is some chance that panpsychism is true, where even microparticles are sentient, then we may need to devote all resources to improving their welfare, given how many of them there are. If having access to limitless free energy or substrates for digital minds would allow us to maximize the amount of value in the world, then research on those topics may trump all other causes. If we follow EVM&nbsp;to its logical end, then it\u2019s rational to pursue actions that have <i>the tiniest&nbsp;</i>probabilities of astronomical value instead of actions that have sure&nbsp;but&nbsp;non-astronomical values.</p><p>This isn\u2019t news. Indeed, some key figures in EA have expressed doubts about EVM for just these sorts of reasons. \u201cMaximization is perilous,\u201d <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\"><u>Holden Karnofsky</u></a>&nbsp;tells us, encouraging us not to take gambles that could result in serious harm.&nbsp;And as <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/toby-ord-perils-of-maximising-good/\"><u>Toby Ord</u></a>&nbsp;observes, \u201cthere are different attitudes you can take to risk and different ways that we can conceptualize what optimal behavior looks like in a world where we\u2019re not certain of what outcomes will result from our actions\u2026 [Some risk-averse alternatives to EVM] have some credibility. And I think we should have some uncertainty around these things.\u201d Presumably, therefore, at least some people in EA are open to decision theories that depart from EVM in one way or another.</p><p>To date, though, there hasn\u2019t been much discussion of alternatives to EVM. It\u2019s valuable, therefore, to explore alternatives to it. There are at least two different ways to challenge EVM. First, we might question its strict risk neutrality. Decision theorists have offered competing accounts of decision-making procedures that incorporate risk sensitivity. We explore three different kinds of reasonable risk aversion, showing that they yield significantly different results about which causes we ought to prioritize. Second, we might give some credence to a moral theory in which our responsibilities to others often prohibit us from maximizing value, such as contractualism.</p><p>Of course, many EAs are quite committed to EVM.&nbsp;And many EAs appear to be convinced that EVM has a specific practical implication: namely, that we ought to focus our resources on mitigating x-risk. If we stick with EVM, do we get that result? We\u2019re skeptical, as there are many controversial&nbsp;assumptions&nbsp;required&nbsp;to secure it. Since expected values are highly sensitive to changes in our credences, the results of EVM&nbsp;are far less predictable than they have been assumed to be.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>3. Beyond EV maximization</strong></h1><p>Our sequence begins by illustrating the importance of our moral theory&nbsp;in assessing what we ought to do. EVM fits naturally with welfare consequentialism, according to which the moral worth of an action is determined by its consequences for overall well-being. <a href=\"https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/4890\"><u>Even among philosophers</u></a>, though, consequentialism is a minority view. Adopting a different moral theory might lead to quite different results. In our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/3KsvReHD6CckfwHak\"><strong>contractualism report</strong></a>, we consider the implications of one prominent alternative moral theory for cause prioritization. In brief, contractualism says that morality is about what we can justify to those affected by our actions. We argue that this theory favors spending on the surest GHD interventions over x-risk work and probably over most animal work <i>even if the latter options have higher EV</i>. Insofar as we place some credence in contractualism, we should be less&nbsp;confident that the highest EV action is, therefore, the best&nbsp;option. Even if you aren\u2019t inclined toward contractualism, the point stands that uncertainty over the correct theory of morality casts doubt on a strategy of always acting on the recommendations of EVM.</p><p>We then turn to the second reason for giving up on EVM: namely, making room for some kind of risk-aversion. EVM is sensitive to probabilities in only one way: the probabilities of outcomes are multiplied by the value of those outcomes, the results of which are summed to yield the expected value. However, agents are often sensitive to probabilities in many other ways, many of which can be characterized as types of <i>risk aversion</i>. The EV calculations that we mentioned in the previous section (regarding invertebrates and x-risk) involve several kinds of uncertainty. First, some outcomes have a low probability of occurring. Second, there is uncertainty about how much our actions will change the relevant probabilities or values. Third, there is uncertainty about the probabilities and values that we assign to the various outcomes in question. We identify three corresponding kinds of risk-averse attitudes: risk aversion with respect to outcomes; risk aversion with respect to the difference our actions make; and aversion to ambiguous probabilities. You can be averse to any or all these kinds of uncertainty.</p><p>&nbsp;In our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/HMakzketADQq4bkvD\"><strong>risk and animals report</strong></a>, we motivate sensitivity to these kinds of risk by using them to diagnose disagreements about the value of actions that would benefit humans compared to&nbsp;actions to help more numerous animals with relatively low probabilities of sentience (e.g., shrimps and&nbsp;insects). Here, the key uncertainties&nbsp;concern the sentience of the individuals benefited. If shrimps are sentient, then benefitting them has&nbsp;enormous payoffs, given how much more numerous they are. However, if shrimps aren\u2019t sentient, we\u2019ll be wasting&nbsp;our money on organisms without&nbsp;conscious experiences\u2014and for whom, therefore, things can\u2019t go better or worse. Because EVM is risk-neutral,&nbsp;it&nbsp;suggests that the gamble is worthwhile, so we ought to direct our charitable giving toward shrimps over people. We introduce three approaches to risk, including a novel form of risk aversion about the difference that our actions make. We argue that while one prominent form of risk aversion tells in favor of the rebugnant conclusion, other reasonable forms of risk aversion tell in favor of helping creatures of more certain sentience.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjek2rfogqge\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjek2rfogqge\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>We use this test case to motivate a more general discussion of risk.&nbsp;In our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t\"><strong>risk-aversion and cause prioritization</strong></a><strong> </strong>report, we evaluate how various risk attitudes affect comparisons between causes and how risk attitudes interact with one another.</p><p>First, an agent who is risk-averse with respect to <i>outcomes</i> is motivated to avoid the worst-case states of the world more than she\u2019s motivated to obtain the best possible ones. She places more decision weight on the potential bad outcomes of a decision and less weight on the good ones. There are several well-studied and well-motivated formal models of this kind of risk aversion. Recall that strict EVM treats changes in probabilities and values symmetrically. Risk-sensitive procedures break this symmetry, albeit in different ways. For example, in Buchak\u2019s (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/9439\"><u>2013</u></a>) Risk-Weighted Expected Utility (REU), a risk weighting is applied to the probabilities of outcomes, such that the probabilities of worse outcomes are adjusted upward and better outcomes are adjusted downward.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdmukwfcyc6\"><sup><a href=\"#fndmukwfcyc6\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>Similarly, when applying Bottomley and Williamson\u2019s (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpr.13006\"><u>2023</u></a>) iteration of Weighted-Linear Utility Theory (WLU)&nbsp;under neutral assumptions about the present state of the world, larger amounts of value created are adjusted downward, such that very large value outcomes must have higher probabilities to compensate for smaller probabilities of causing large amounts of harm. Risk-aversion in <i>this</i>&nbsp;sense makes us even more inclined to favor work to reduce x-risk (since we\u2019re even more motivated to avoid catastrophe) and more inclined to favor insects over people (since trillions of insects suffering would be <i>really </i>bad). However, it would also make us less inclined toward fanatical moonshots with very low probabilities of astronomical&nbsp;value, since these extremely positive outcomes are given increasingly less weight the more risk-averse you are.</p><p>A second kind of risk aversion concerns <i>difference-making</i>. An agent who\u2019s risk-averse in this sense is motivated to avoid actions that cause things to be worse or that do nothing. She assigns decision weights not merely on the basis of the overall state of the world that results from her action but on the difference that her action makes. We believe this kind of risk aversion is both common and undertheorized.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref12my2apy5u6o\"><sup><a href=\"#fn12my2apy5u6o\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Difference-making risk aversion (DRMA) makes us hesitant to undertake actions that have a high probability of inefficacy or making things worse. As a result, difference-making risk-weighted EV tends to favor helping humans over helping shrimps and helping actual versus merely possible people.</p><p>Lastly, we might be risk-averse about <i>ambiguous</i>&nbsp;or <i>uncertain probabilities </i>(<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1884324\"><u>Ellsberg 1961</u></a>). An ambiguity-averse agent prefers to take gambles on bets where she is confident about the probabilities that she assigns. She prefers bets where she has good evidence about the probabilities of outcomes; she avoids bets when the probabilities she assigns are largely reflections of her ignorance. There are several strategies for penalizing ambiguity. Regardless of which we choose, risk aversion in this sense will penalize actions for which there is high variance in plausible probability assignments and for which EV results are highly sensitive to this variance.</p><h1><strong>4.&nbsp;Uncertainty about the effects of our actions</strong></h1><p>All these points aside, suppose we go in for EVM. Another aim of this sequence is to explore whether there\u2019s&nbsp;a quick route from EVM to the view that x-risk work is clearly more cost-effective than all other opportunities.</p><p>Let\u2019s again consider how EV calculations work. An EV calculation considers a partition of states that we take to be relevant to our decision-making. We then evaluate how good or bad things would be if we took each candidate action and ended up in that state. Finally, we ask what the probabilities of those states would be if we took each candidate action. For example, if you are deciding whether to study for an exam, two states would be relevant: either you will pass or you won\u2019t. You consider what it would be like if you study and pass, study and fail, don\u2019t study and pass, or don\u2019t study and fail. Lastly, you estimate the effect of studying on your probability of passing or failing, how much more likely you are to pass if you study than if you don\u2019t. You combine these to yield the EV of studying&nbsp;and the EV of not studying. Then, you compare the results and make a decision.&nbsp;</p><p>Cases like deciding whether to study for an exam are fairly treated as \u201csmall world\u201d decision problems. We consider only the near-term and direct effects that our actions would have and these effects are relatively small. For example, when deciding to study, I don\u2019t consider the effect that my passing the exam would have for global nuclear war. We typically have good purchase on the probabilities and the values involved in such a decision problem. However, that\u2019s often far from true&nbsp;when we evaluate the long-run, indirect effects of our actions, as in the case of x-risk mitigation efforts.</p><p>With this in mind, there\u2019s something appealing about simple models for assessing the value of x-risk mitigation efforts: we know that there are enormous uncertainties at every turn; so, if we can make a \u201ccommon sense\u201d case for working on x-risk, drawing only on premises about which we are confident, then perhaps we can ignore all the other complexities.</p><p>So, for instance, someone might want to argue that spending on x-risk mitigation is orders of magnitude better than spending on animals or global health <i>even if </i>the future isn\u2019t enormous. Instead, the thought might be, we can get a winning EV for x-risk interventions just based on the interests of a few generations. However, in our report on the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/LCfd56cBeRzrMiAhw\"><strong>common sense case for x-risk</strong></a>, we show that,&nbsp;when you run the numbers, you don\u2019t necessarily get that result. Instead, we see that plausible x-risk mitigation efforts have a competitive EV with animal causes and are likely no more than an order of magnitude more cost-effective than global health interventions. What\u2019s more, high-risk, high-EV existential risk interventions probably don\u2019t hold up to some plausible risk-sensitive attitudes.</p><p>Someone might argue that a fatal flaw of the common-sense view is that it doesn't care about the long-run future, and it\u2019s precisely the long-run future that\u2019s supposed to make x-risk mitigation efforts so valuable. In order to predict the long-term value that our actions will create, though, we need to make substantive hypotheses about the causal structure of the world and what the future would be like if we didn\u2019t act at all. Again, as noted above, the value of investing in AI alignment is much smaller if there will be a nuclear war in the near future. It\u2019s much greater if AI alignment would lower the probability of nuclear war.</p><p>Arguments that AI risk mitigation actions have higher EV than alternatives often assume a particular view about the future, the so-called \u201ctime of perils\u201d hypothesis. On this view, we are currently in&nbsp;a period of very high existential risk, including risk from AI. However, if we get transformative aligned AI, we\u2019ll have access to a resource that will allow us to address the other existential threats we face. Thus, if we survive long enough to secure transformative aligned AI, the value of the long-run future is likely to be extremely large. In our report on the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/i5cuLZH3SQJigiHMs\"><strong>time of perils-based case for x-risk\u2019s dominance</strong></a>, we show that many premises are probably required to make this story work\u2014so many, in fact, and so uncertain in each case, that the probability of its coming to pass is low enough that betting on x-risk for this reason may amount to fanaticism.</p><p>As we reflect on the many other possible futures, it becomes important to model alternative risk trajectories. In our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/S9H86osFKhfFBCday\"><strong>report on the value of extinction risk mitigation efforts</strong></a>, we investigate the value of such efforts under more realistic assumptions, like sophisticated risk structures, variable persistence, and different cases of value growth. This report extends the model developed by <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/ORDTPE\"><u>Ord</u></a>, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papa.12248\"><u>Thorstad</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://bayes.net/ltf-paper/\"><u>Adamczewski</u></a>. By enriching the base model, we are able to perform sensitivity analyses and can better evaluate when extinction risk mitigation could, in expectation, be overwhelmingly&nbsp;valuable, and when it is comparable to or of lesser value than the alternatives. Crucially, we show that the value of x-risk work varies considerably with different scenario specifications.&nbsp;Insofar as we don't have much confidence in any one scenario, we shouldn\u2019t have much confidence in any particular estimate of the value of extinction risk mitigation efforts.</p><p>We complete our discussion of uncertainty in our report on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/CpgQzQzJKx95Jgguh\"><strong>uncertainty over time and Bayesian updating</strong></a>. When deciding between actions with short-term versus long-term impacts, there's a balance between certainty and expected value. Predictions of short-term impacts are more certain but might offer less value, while long-term impacts can have higher expected value but are grounded in less certain predictions. This report provides an empirical analysis of how uncertainty grows over a 1-20 year range using data from development economics RCTs. Through statistical predictions and Bayesian updating models, we demonstrate how uncertainty gradually increases over time, and how this leads to the expected value of long-term impacts diminishes as the forecast time horizon lengthens.</p><p>The upshot of these reports is fairly simple. There clearly are sets of assumptions where x-risk mitigation work has higher EV than the standard alternatives. However, there are other assumptions on which it doesn\u2019t. And more generally, it\u2019s difficult to make the case that it clearly beats all animal and global health work without relying on very low probability outcomes having large values.</p><h1><strong>5. Cross-Cause Cost-Effectiveness Model and How RP Should Make Decisions</strong></h1><p>Having considered the impact of risk aversion and explored the case for work on x-risk mitigation, we introduce our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pniDWyjc9vY5sjGre/rethink-priorities-cross-cause-cost-effectiveness-model\">cross-cause cost-effectiveness model</a> (CCM). This tool allows users to compare interventions like corporate animal welfare campaigns with work on AI safety, direct cash transfers with attempts to reduce the risk of nuclear war, and so on. Of course, the outputs depend on a host of assumptions, most of which we can\u2019t explore in this sequence. We provide some views as defaults, but invite users to input their own. Furthermore, we allow users to input distributions of possible values to make it possible to see how uncertainties about parameters translate into uncertainties about results. So, this tool is not intended to settle many questions about resource allocation. Instead,&nbsp;it\u2019s designed to help the community reason more transparently about these issues.</p><p>Finally, we turn to the hyper-practical.

It is written by Damin Curtis &amp; Alexander M. Wyckoff, and discusses a proposal by Yonadav Shavit. Crossposted on the <a href=\"https://alignmentforum.org/posts/qAjGfYh2pQvvnsCBk/a-new-model-for-compute-center-verification-1?_ga=2.5276147.1145172760.1697105936-1994054132.1696965607\">AI Alignment Forum</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Verification Problem</strong></h2><p>To cope with emerging security challenges, states will have to create new regulatory frameworks to reign in the development of dangerous AI models/capabilities. To be effective, any laws or agreements will need a credible verification mechanism behind them, yet how to create such a mechanism is an open technical/policy question.&nbsp;</p><p>Frameworks to limit the proliferation of powerful weapons systems have been developed before, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Through internationally agreed upon frameworks, inspections, and tracking of hazardous materials, the IAEA and NPT have successfully limited the development of nuclear WMD while allowing parties to develop useful technologies such as nuclear energy and biochemical research labs.</p><p>Developing a similar framework for verifying the peaceful development of AI models is, of course, difficult. The infrastructure and process of training safe versus unsafe models can be nearly identical, and unsafe protocols difficult to identify in training modules. What\u2019s more, a method of verification must not endanger the privacy/intellectual property rights of the proving party (\u201cthe prover\u201d). However, there is growing consensus that compute governance may be the keystone of AI governance, and there are strategic bottlenecks in the supply chain of compute-providing semiconductors that may allow for effective monitoring.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Proposal Overview</strong></h2><p>A recent (2023) proposal for such a framework by Yonadav Shavit seems promising on all of these fronts, as outlined in his paper,<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11341.pdf\">&nbsp;<u>What Does it Take to Catch a Chinchilla? Verifying Rules on Large-Scale Neural Network Training Via Compute Monitoring</u></a>. (Note that the following proposal is not our own, it is the work of Yonadav Shavit. The wording in this paper, and the discussion surrounding it, is our own.)</p><p>Shavit proposes that all advanced chips be manufactured with hardware which saves occasional \u201csnapshots\u201d of the training transcripts running on the chip, which can then be viewed by inspectors. An international regulatory agency would inspect to ensure chips are not being trained for illegal/dangerous models, and simultaneously monitor chip supply chains and deliveries to keep informed on which parties are stockpiling enough chips to train large, new AI models. We believe this proposal holds promise as a potential underpinning of an (inter)national verification system for powerful AI model developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The proposed system works at three levels:</strong></h3><h3><strong>1. Chip level</strong></h3><p>In order to be approved for use in AI training infrastructure, new chips will be hard-wired to save log-weight snapshots of the code they\u2019re running. These snapshots will be reported to regulators along with (hashes of) training transcripts, allowing regulators to verify whether the chips have been used for a rule-violating training run. Regulators can physically inspect random samples of chips to ensure that their snapshots were reported, and to ensure that tampering has not occurred to undermine the validity of remote snapshot taking &amp; reporting.</p><h3><strong>2. Data Center level</strong></h3><p>The data center (prover) provides its training process transcript, allowing the prover &amp; verifier to confirm that retraining with that transcript provides the same \u201clogged weight-snapshot\u201d, showing that the training is being done as claimed. The verifier then ensures that the training transcript\u2019s properties are in line with agreed regulations; for example, making sure none of the algorithm code is relevant to achieving breaches of data security or other unlawful use cases.</p><h3><strong>3. Supply Chain level</strong></h3><p>Cutting-edge chip supply chains have highly concentrated bottlenecks/choke points. These concentrated providers will record where chips are being sold to, and report to the verifier. When doing checks, the verifier can randomly sample chips at training centers to ensure chips were acquired through legally reported sources/transactions, ensuring that none have been covertly acquired. Ensuring chips are not illegally sold would help prevent training runs from happening outside of this monitoring system.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Benefits</strong></h2><h3><strong>Reduces the Necessity of Unilateral Actions</strong></h3><p>In the absence of a verification mechanism, governments will increasingly deploy costly unilateral export restrictions to try and limit one another\u2019s development of harmful models. For example, in 2022, the US enacted export controls to deny the People\u2019s Republic of China access to advanced computer chips, in part to restrict development of AI models that might be put to harmful purposes (such as weapons development or human rights violations). This measure may not have been necessary if a mechanism had existed for the PRC to credibly commit to exclusively pursue models with agreed-upon capabilities, in which case China could continue with unobjectionable imports and the US would not have to restrict its own companies\u2019 investments and sales to the PRC. This dynamic is similar to how the existence of nuclear verification systems allows more nations to build peaceful nuclear power plants without causing fear of weapons proliferation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Empowers safety/regulatory minimums, increasing security for all</strong></h3><p>This framework could also empower governments to enforce safety minimums. Without government-enforced safety precautions, companies are incentivized to skirt safety lest they fall behind their competitors. This also applies at the international level; as nations race to acquire advanced AI capabilities and compete for high-end research investments, governments are incentivized to \u201crace to the bottom\u201d, reducing regulations in order to speed up development and attract research lab investments. A verification framework could empower international agreements on safety minimums, setting a common floor for all and averting unsafe development norms. (Notably, such a development could slow the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d even if only a small number of countries agreed to join this verification framework. Today, countries have an incentive to sacrifice safety for speed due to lack of knowledge of whether their rivals have done the same. If even a few important countries joined the framework, those outside the framework could feel more confident in the safety behavior of those within, reducing their uncertainty and their incentive to preemptively cut down on safety.)</p><h3><strong>Respects privacy &amp; sovereignty</strong></h3><p>This framework does not require AI developers to disclose sensitive, proprietary information about their training models, nor does it require monitoring of individual\u2019s private computing devices (it only monitors large training centers). Participant countries must give their continued consent by allowing inspectors to access their chips\u2019 snapshots and training process transcripts. A country or data center could refuse compliance at any point, which ensures this process respects national sovereignty. If the prover follows the verifier's steps, rule-violation is unlikely to go undetected. If the prover does not comply with verifiers, this will itself be cause for suspicion, as is the case with the nuclear facility verification processes. Participation should be driven by a universal interest in ensuring the international community upholds safety norms in advanced AI development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Limitations &amp; Weaknesses</strong></h2><p>We conclude by noting some potential weaknesses of this proposal. These may also serve as ideas for further work on the subject of developing credible verification systems. Like with our security threats, we divide our framework\u2019s weaknesses into three major areas of concern:&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1. Only Monitors Larger Compute Centers.&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>This framework only calls for monitoring of large-scale compute clusters. This proposal also does not prevent the training of smaller models, which don\u2019t require large quantities of compute to train. These may still have concerning capabilities such as facial recognition, weapons targeting, or misinformation risk.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Pre-existing models and chips.&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>This framework only prevents the training of new large models going forward; it does not prevent application of models that have already been created, nor does it necessarily monitor chips and data centers that were already on the market prior to the implementation of this framework.&nbsp;</p><p>What\u2019s more, this system only seeks to prevent the development-- not the propagation-- of illegal models. If a model&nbsp;<i>were</i> somehow created outside of this monitoring system, it could be easily copied and used.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. Dual capability.&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We are also concerned about the dual capability of some microchips, especially in the future. As AI computation becomes cheaper, microchips meant for applications such as in medical technology could be repurposed for training harmful AI models. This framework would need to evaluate not only the advertised training capabilities of chips, but also potential dual capability, ideally ensuring these programs are not illegally transferred to use at an unauthorized training center.&nbsp;</p><p>The framework does partially account for this, as verifiers can randomly sample chips at known training centers to ensure that all chips were obtained from verified sources in recorded transactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We believe that this framework has potential as a means for verifying compliance with international regulations on AI development, empowering governments to pursue beneficial agreements on AI development and substantially improving the AI safety/governance landscape. We hope that this post increases the visibility of this proposal and sparks further discussion of its feasibility and improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>Written by Damin Curtis &amp; Alexander M.

We can increase training compute by simply spending more money to buy more chips, or by making the chips more efficient (packing in more FLOP per dollar).

GPT-4.5 will perform much better than GPT-4 on most tests designed to measure understanding of the world, practical reasoning in messy situations, and mathematical and scientific problem-solving. A whole lot of things GPT-4 struggles with will probably come easily to GPT-4.5. It will probably generate a whole lot more economic value, and present much bigger societal risks. And then the same thing will happen all over again with GPT-5. We think the dramatic performance improvements from scale will continue for at least another couple of orders of magnitude \u2014 as Geoffrey Hinton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1270814602931187715?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>joked in 2020</u></a>, \u201cExtrapolating the spectacular performance of GPT-3 into the future suggests that the answer to life, the universe and everything is just 4.398 trillion parameters.\u201d</p><p>But even if no one trained a larger-scale model than GPT-4, and its basic architecture and training process never got any more efficient, there would still probably be major economic change from language models over the next decade. This is because we can do a lot of <strong>schlep</strong> to better leverage the language models we already have and integrate them into our workflows.</p><p>By schlep, we mean things like prompting language models to give higher-quality answers or answers more appropriate to a certain use case, addressing annoying foibles like <a href=\"https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/the-hallucination-problem-of-large-language-models-5d7ab1b0f37f?ref=planned-obsolescence.org#:~:text=Hallucination%20in%20the%20context%20of,to%20the%20provided%20source%20input.\"><u>hallucination</u></a> with in-built fact-checking and verification steps, collecting specialized datasets tailored to specific tasks and fine-tuning language models on these datasets, providing language models with tools and plug-ins such as web search and code interpreters, and doing a lot of good old fashioned software engineering to package all this into sleek usable products like ChatGPT.</p><p>For one example of what schlep can do to improve language models, take <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>chain of thought prompting</u></a>. Chain of thought prompting is dead simple \u2014 it\u2019s basically the same thing as your teacher reminding you to show your work \u2014 and it substantially improves the performance of language models on all kinds of problems, from mathematical problem-solving to \u2018common sense\u2019 reasoning.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4MkkdbSa42h73pXi8/ou7e4jryxdiwxnkkerjm\" alt=\"alt_text\"></p><p>By default, language models can only answer questions by immediately spitting out the first word of their answer, then rolling with whatever they said and immediately spitting out the next word, and so on word-by-word until eventually they\u2019ve completed their thought. They are unable to backtrack or get any thinking done outside of the next-word rhythm.</p><p>Imagine if you had to take a standardized test like that: by answering every question on the spot without any backtracking, as if you were being interviewed on live TV. For one thing, it would be very hard! For another, you\u2019d probably do a lot better if you verbalized your reasoning step by step than if you just tried to blurt out the final answer. This is exactly what we see in chain-of-thought.</p><p>This suggests chain-of-thought is probably not just a one-off trick, but an instance of a more general pattern: language models will probably perform better if they can spend more effort iterating on and refining their answers to difficult questions, just like humans get to do. In fact, simply allowing language models to spit out a \u201cpause and think longer\u201d symbol rather than having to commit to the next word immediately <a href=\"https://browse.arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02226.pdf?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>also seems to improve performance</u></a>.</p><p>Scale makes language models better. Techniques like chain-of-thought improve models at any given scale. But it\u2019s more than that: chain of thought prompting only works at all on sufficiently large language models, and the returns are greater when it\u2019s used on bigger models which were already more powerful to begin with.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn9ln00gpjw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn9ln00gpjw\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>You could imagine a variety of more elaborate techniques that follow the same principle. For example, you could imagine equipping an LLM with a full-featured text editor, allowing it to backtrack and revise its work in the way humans do.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6l85p07dl13\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6l85p07dl13\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Or you could imagine giving a language model two output streams: one for the answer, and one for its stream-of-consciousness thoughts <i>about</i> the answer it\u2019s writing. Imagine a language model that had the option to iterate for days on one question, writing notes to itself as it mulls things over. The bigger and more capable it is, the more use it could get out of this affordance. Giving a genius mathematician a scratchpad will make a bigger difference than giving one to a six year old.</p><p>Another technique that dramatically improves performance of models at a given size is fine-tuning: retraining a large model on a small amount of well-chosen data in order to get much better-targeted responses for a given use case. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)</u></a> involves fine-tuning models on whether human raters liked its answer. Without RLHF, a language model might riff off a question or generate the kind of text that would surround that question on a website, instead of answering it. In effect, RLHF gets the model to \u2018realize\u2019 that it should be aiming to use its capabilities and knowledge to <i>answer questions well</i> rather than <i>predict text on the internet:</i> two different tasks, with a lot of overlapping skills.</p><p>With prompting and fine-tuning and a lot of other schlep, we can build <strong>systems</strong> out of language models. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a> is a very simple and very familiar example of a language model system. To understand all of the ways that ChatGPT is a system, not just a language model, it\u2019s useful to compare it to InstructGPT, which is the same basic underlying technology. Before ChatGPT was released, InstructGPT was available to people who made an account to test it out in OpenAI\u2019s playground.</p><p>Here\u2019s the UI for OpenAI\u2019s playground today (it was worse a year ago but unfortunately we don\u2019t have a screenshot of it from then):</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4MkkdbSa42h73pXi8/hso4qapmkffnl366yihv\" alt=\"alt_text\"></p><p>If you\u2019re an experienced LLM expert, the option to customize temperature and adjust the frequency penalty and presence penalty, add stop sequences, and so on is really useful. If you\u2019re a random consumer, all of that is intimidating. ChatGPT\u2019s UI abstracts it away:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4MkkdbSa42h73pXi8/u0merk59ghvulk1gzqou\" alt=\"alt_text\"></p><p>That UI difference might seem small. But InstructGPT was mostly used only by a small community of researchers, and ChatGPT reached 100 million users within two months of launch. The difference between the two products was essentially presentation, user experience, and marketing. That kind of thing can result in massive differences in actual user behavior. Some of the work that goes into making language model <strong>systems</strong>, then, is about figuring out how to make the model usable for users.</p><p>If language models are like engines, then language model systems would be like cars and motorcycles and jet planes. Systems like <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/harnessing-ai-so-that-all-students-benefit-a-nonprofit-approach-for-equal-access/?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>Khan Academy\u2019s one-on-one math tutor</u></a> or <a href=\"https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-and-openai?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>Stripe\u2019s interactive developer docs</u></a> would not be possible to build without good language models, just as cars wouldn\u2019t be possible without engines. But making these products a reality also involves doing a lot of schlep to pull together the \u201craw\u201d language model with other key ingredients, getting them all to work well together, and putting them in a usable package. Similarly, self-driving cars would not be possible without really good vision models, but a self-driving car is more than just a big vision neural network sitting in a server somewhere.</p><p>One kind of language model system that has attracted a lot of attention and discussion is a <a href=\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>language model agent</u></a>.</p><p>An agent is a system which independently makes decisions and acts in the world. A language model is not an agent, but language models can be the key component powering a system which is agentic and takes actions in the world. The most famous early implementation of this is <a href=\"https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>Auto-GPT</u></a>, a very straightforward and naive approach: you can tell it a goal, and it will self-prompt repeatedly to take actions towards this goal. People have already employed it towards a wide range of goals, including building <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3mxe3/ai-tasked-with-destroying-humanity-now-working-on-control-over-humanity-through-manipulation?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>ChaosGPT, which has the goal of destroying humanity</u></a>.</p><p>Auto-GPT is not very good. Users have complained that it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_timothyalan_/status/1646486202550304769?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>constantly comes up with reasons to do more research</u></a> and is reluctant to decide that it\u2019s done enough research and can actually do the task now. It\u2019s also just not very reliable. But there are many people building agentic language models for commercial uses, and working to solve all of these shortcomings, including well-funded and significantly-sized companies like <a href=\"https://imbue.com/?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>Imbue</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.adept.ai/?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>Adept</u></a>. Adding chain of thought prompting, fine tuning the underlying language models, and many similar measures will likely make agents a lot better \u2013 and, of course, increasing scale will make them better too.</p><p>We\u2019re really at the very beginning of this work. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see major advances in the practical usefulness of LLMs achieved through schlep alone, such that agents and other systems built out of GPT-4 tier models are much more useful in five years than they are today. And of course, we are continuing to scale up models at the same time. That creates the conditions for rapid improvements along many dimensions at once \u2014 improvements which could reinforce each other. Many people will be trying hard to make this a reality. Even if specific approaches meet dead-ends, the field as a whole doesn\u2019t seem likely to.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnnyb31gq6p6\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefnyb31gq6p6\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Here, we\u2019re wrapping together <a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/revisiting-algorithmic-progress?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>algorithmic progress</u></a> with scale for simplicity; this could have been broken out into its own type of progress.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnwzjh56bkubi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefwzjh56bkubi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/artificial-intelligence-training-computation?zoomToSelection=true&amp;country=GPT%7EGPT-2%7EGPT%7EGPT%7EGPT-4%7EGPT%7EGPT%7EGPT-3+175B+%28davinci%29%7EGPT-2+%281542M%29%7EGPT-3.5+%28text-davinci-003%29&amp;ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>graph</u></a> pictured in the text is by <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>Our World in Data</u></a>, pulling <a href=\"https://epochai.org/mlinputs/visualization?startDate=1950-1-1&amp;endDate=2023-4-1&amp;xAxis=Publication+date&amp;yAxis=Training+compute+%28FLOP%29&amp;separateCategories=false&amp;citationThreshold=0&amp;otherDomainThreshold=10&amp;startDlEra=2009-12-31&amp;startLargeScaleEra=2015-9-1&amp;largeScaleAction=label&amp;outliersAction=remove&amp;recordSettersAction=ignore&amp;bigAlphagoAction=ignore&amp;alphagozeroAction=ignore&amp;lowOutliersZValueThreshold=-2&amp;highOutliersZValueThreshold=0.76&amp;outlierWindowSize=2&amp;filterText=&amp;splitDomains=&amp;domainsToNotSplit=&amp;ranges=%5Bobject+Object%5D&amp;splitDlEra=true&amp;splitLargeScaleEra=true&amp;plotRegressions=true&amp;bootstrapSampleSize=10000&amp;adjustForEstimateUncertainty=true&amp;preset=Three+eras+of+compute&amp;aspectRatio=fit+to+container&amp;autoresetCamera=true&amp;showTitle=false&amp;labelEras=true&amp;showDoublingTimes=true&amp;showOpenAITrend=false&amp;regressionDecimals=1&amp;textSize=100&amp;systemAlpha=100&amp;systemNames=hide&amp;showLegend=true&amp;parametersRange=NaN%2CNaN&amp;trainingComputeRange=NaN%2CNaN&amp;inferenceComputeRange=NaN%2CNaN&amp;trainingDatasetSizeRange=NaN%2CNaN&amp;inferenceComputePerParameterRange=NaN%2CNaN&amp;inferenceComputeTimesParameterRange=NaN%2CNaN&amp;labelPoints=false&amp;ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>numbers</u></a> from our grantee organization <a href=\"https://epochai.org/?ref=planned-obsolescence.org\"><u>Epoch</u></a>, the original GPT was trained on 1.8e19 FLOP; GPT-2 was 1.5e21 FLOP; the largest version of GPT-3 (175 billion parameters) was trained on 3.1e23 FLOP, and GPT-4 was trained on ~2.1e25 FLOP.

It wasn\u2019t. Participants couldn\u2019t agree on basics of what they meant by \u201cpause\u201d, whether it was possible, or whether it would make things better or worse.</p><p>There was at least some agreement on what a successful pause would have to entail. Participating governments would ban \u201cfrontier AI models\u201d, for example models using more training compute than GPT-4. Smaller models, or novel uses of new models would be fine, or else face an FDA-like regulatory agency. States would enforce the ban against domestic companies by monitoring high-performance microchips; they would enforce it against non-participating governments by banning export of such chips, plus the usual diplomatic levers for enforcing treaties (eg nuclear nonproliferation).</p><p>The main disagreements were:</p><ol><li>Could such a pause possibly work?</li><li>If yes, would it be good or bad?</li><li>If good, when should we implement it? When should we lift it?</li></ol><p>I\u2019ve grouped opinions into five categories:</p><p><img style=\"width:728px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7WfMYzLfcTyDtD6Gn/vztficywdja8esqkmyzj\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Simple Pause: </strong>What if we just asked AI companies to pause for six months? Or maybe some longer amount of time?</p><p>This was the request in the <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\">FLI Pause Giant AI Experiments open letter</a>, signed by thousands of AI scientists, businesspeople, and thought leaders, including many participants in this debate. So you might think the debate organizers could find one person to argue for it. They couldn\u2019t. The letter was such a watered-down compromise that nobody really supported it, even though everyone signed it to express support for one or another of the positions it compromised between.</p><p>Why don\u2019t people want this? First, most people think it will take the AI companies more than six months of preliminary work before they start training their next big model anyway, so it\u2019s useless. Second, even if we do it, six months from now the pause will end, and then we\u2019re more or less where we are right now. Except worse, for two reasons:</p><ol><li>COMPUTE OVERHANG. We expect AI technology to advance over time for two reasons. First, <i>algorithmic progress</i>&nbsp;- people learn how to make AIs in cleverer ways. Second, <i>hardware progress</i>&nbsp;- Moore\u2019s Law produces faster, cheaper computers, so for a given budget, we can train/run the AI on more powerful hardware. A pause might slow algorithmic progress very slightly, with fewer big AIs to test new algorithms on. But it wouldn\u2019t slow hardware progress at all. At the end of the pause, hardware would have progressed some amount, and instead of AIs progressing gradually over the next six months, they would progress in one giant jump when the pause ended, and all the companies rushed to build new AIs that took advantage of the past six months of progress. But gradual progress (which allows iteration and debugging in relatively simple AIs) seems safer than sudden progress (where all at once we have an AI much more powerful than anything we\u2019ve ever seen before). Since a pause like this simply replaces gradual progress with sudden progress, it would be counterproductive.</li><li>BURNING TIMELINE IN A RACE. Suppose that we prefer America get strong AIs before China. If America pauses but China doesn\u2019t, then after the pause we\u2019d be exactly where we were before, except that China would have caught up relative to America. More generally, companies that care most about AI safety are most likely to obey the pause. So unless we\u2019re very good at enforcing the pause even on non-cooperators, this just hurts the companies that care about safety the most, for no gain.</li></ol><p>These are counterbalanced by one benefit:</p><ol><li>MORE TIME FOR ALIGNMENT. Maybe we can use those six months to learn more about how to control AIs, or to prepare for them socially/politically.</li></ol><p>This benefit is real, but this kind of pause doesn\u2019t optimize it. Technical alignment research benefits from advanced models to experiment on; the Surgical Pause strategy takes this consideration more seriously. And social/political preparation depends on some kind of plan: this is what the Regulatory Pause strategy adds.</p><p><strong>Surgical Pause: </strong>The Surgical Pause tweaks the Simple Pause to add two extra considerations:</p><ol><li>WHEN TO PAUSE. If we\u2019re going to pause for six months, which six months should it be? Right now? A few years from now? Just before dangerous AI is invented? The main benefit to a pause is to give alignment research time to catch up. But alignment research works better when researchers have more advanced AIs to experiment on. So probably we should have the six month pause right before dangerous AI is invented.</li><li>HOW LONG TO PAUSE. The biggest disadvantage of pausing for a long time is that it gives bad actors (eg China)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2yg1i9mka1u\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2yg1i9mka1u\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;a chance to catch up. Suppose the West is right on the verge of creating dangerous AI, and China is two years away. It seems like the right length of pause is 1.9999 years, so that we get the benefit of maximum extra alignment research and social prep time, but the West still beats China.</li></ol><p>Obviously the problem with the Surgical Pause is that we might not know when we\u2019re on the verge of dangerous AI, and we might not know how much of a lead \u201cthe good guys\u201d have. Surgical Pause proponents suggest being very conservative with both free variables. This is less of a well-thought-out plan and more saying \u201ccome on guys, let\u2019s at least <i>try </i>to be strategic here\u201d. At the limit, it suggests we probably shouldn\u2019t pause for six months, starting right now.</p><p>Since this involves leading labs burning their lead time for safety, in theory it could be done unilaterally by the single leading lab, without international, governmental, or even inter-lab coordination. But you could buy more time if you got those things too. Some leading labs have promised to do this when the time is right - for example <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond\">OpenAI</a>&nbsp;and (a previous iteration of) <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SbAgRYo8tkHwhd9Qx/deepmind-the-podcast-excerpts-on-agi%23_Avengers_assembled__for_AI_Safety__Pause_AI_development_to_prove_things_mathematically\">DeepMind</a>&nbsp;- with varying levels of believability.</p><p>AnonResearcherAtMajorAILab discussed some of the strategy here in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/BFbsqwCuuqueFRfpW\">Aim For Conditional AI Pauses</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YkwiBmHE3ss7FNe35/\">this Less Wrong post</a>&nbsp;is also very good.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Pause: </strong>If one benefit of the Simple Pause is to use the time to prepare for AI socially and politically, maybe we should just pause until we\u2019ve completed social and political preparations.</p><p>David Manheim suggests a monitoring agency like the FDA. It would \u201cfast-track\u201d small AIs and trivial re-applications of existing AIs, but carefully monitor new \u201cfrontier models\u201d for signs of danger. Regulators might <a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/\">look for dangerous capabilities</a>&nbsp;by asking AIs to hack computers or spread copies of themselves, or test whether they\u2019ve been programmed against bias/misinformation/etc. We could pause only until we\u2019ve set up the regulatory agency, and take hostile actions (like restrict chip exports) only to other countries that don\u2019t cooperate with our regulators or set up domestic regulators of their own.</p><p>Many people in tech are regulation-skeptical libertarians, but proponents point out that regulation fails in a predictable direction: it usually <i>does </i>successfully prevent bad things, it just also prevents good things too. Since the creation of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1975, there has never been a major nuclear accident in the US. And sure, this is because the NRC prevented any nuclear plants from being built in the United States at all from 1975 to 2023 (one was <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/american-nuclear-reactor-built-scratch-decades-enters-commercial-101861665\">finally built</a>&nbsp;in July). Still, they <i>technically</i>&nbsp;achieved their mandate. Likewise, most medications in the US are safe and relatively effective, at the cost of an FDA approval process being so expensive that we only get a tiny trickle of new medications each year and hundreds of thousands of people die from unnecessary delays. But medications <i>are</i>&nbsp;safe and effective. Or: San Francisco housing regulators almost never approve new housing, so housing costs millions of dollars and thousands of San Franciscans are homeless - but certainly there\u2019s no epidemic of bad houses getting approved and then ruining someone\u2019s view or something. If we extrapolate this track record to AI, AI regulators will be overcautious, progress will slow by orders of magnitude or stop completely - but AIs will be safe.</p><p>This is a depressing prospect if you think the problems from advanced AI would be limited to more spam or something. But if you worry about AI destroying the world, maybe you should accept a San-Francisco-housing-level of impediment and frustration.</p><p>A regulatory pause could be better than a total stop if you think it will be more stable (lots of industries stay heavily regulated forever, and only a few libertarians complain), or if you think <i>maybe</i>&nbsp;the regulator will occasionally let a tiny amount of safe AI progress happen.</p><p>But it could be worse than a total stop if you expect continued progress will eventually produce unsafe AIs regardless of regulation. You might expect this if you\u2019re worried about deceptive alignment, eg superintelligent AIs that deliberately trick regulators into thinking they\u2019re safe. Or you might think AIs will eventually be so powerful that they can endanger humanity from a walled-off test environment even before official approval. The classic Bostrom/Yudkowsky model of alignment implies both of these things.</p><p>David Manheim and Thomas Larsen set out their preferred versions of this strategy in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/3hSEQnEN2D3SSzHWn\">What\u2019s In A Pause?</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/DG6bf5YW3jxLRD7KN\">Policy Ideas For Mitigating AI Risk</a>.</p><p><strong>Total Stop:</strong>&nbsp;If you expect AIs to exhibit deceptive alignment capable of fooling regulators, or to be so dangerous that even testing them on a regulator\u2019s computer could be apocalyptic, maybe the only option is a total stop.</p><p>It\u2019s tough to imagine a total stop that works for more than a few years. You have at least three problems:</p><ol><li>NON-PARTICIPANTS. As with any pause proposal, unfriendly countries (eg China) can keep working on AI. You can refuse to export chips to them, which will slow them down a little, but their own chips will eventually be up to the task. You will either need a diplomatic miracle, or willingness to resort to less diplomatic forms of coercion. This doesn\u2019t have to be immediate war: Israel has come up with \u201ccreative\u201d ways to slow Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and countries trying to frustrate China\u2019s chip industry could do the same. But great powers playing these kinds of games against each other risks wider conflict.</li><li>ALGORITHMIC PROGRESS. Suppose the government banned anyone except heavily-regulated companies from having a computer bigger than a laptop. Right now you can\u2019t train a good AI on a laptop, or even a cluster of laptops. But AI training methods get more efficient every year. If current research progress continues, then at some point - even if it\u2019s decades from now - you <i>will</i>&nbsp;be able to train cutting-edge AIs on laptops.</li><li>HARDWARE PROGRESS. Also the laptops keep getting better, because of Moore\u2019s Law.</li></ol><p>Regulators can plausibly control the flow of supercomputers, at least domestically. But eventually technology will advance to the point where you can train an AI on anything. Then you either have to ban all computing, restrict it at gradually more extreme levels (1990 MS-DOS machines! No, punch cards!) or accept that AI is going to happen.</p><p>Still, you can imagine this buying us a few decades.

Specifically:</p><blockquote><p>[A pause] would have several predictable negative effects:</p><ol><li>Illegal AI labs develop inside pause countries, remotely using training hardware outsourced to non-pause countries to evade detection. Illegal labs would presumably put much less emphasis on safety than legal ones.</li><li>There is a brain drain of the least safety-conscious AI researchers to labs headquartered in non-pause countries. Because of remote work, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to leave the comfort of their Western home.</li><li>Non-pause governments make opportunistic moves to encourage AI investment and R&amp;D, in an attempt to leap ahead of pause countries while they have a chance. Again, these countries would be less safety-conscious than pause countries.</li><li>Safety research becomes subject to government approval to assess its potential capabilities externalities. This slows down progress in safety substantially, just as the FDA slows down medical research.</li><li>Legal labs exploit loopholes in the definition of a \u201cfrontier\u201d model. Many projects are allowed on a technicality; e.g. they have fewer parameters than GPT-4, but use them more efficiently. This distorts the research landscape in hard-to-predict ways.</li><li>It becomes harder and harder to enforce the pause as time passes, since training hardware is increasingly cheap and miniaturized.</li><li>Whether, when, and how to lift the pause becomes a highly politicized culture war issue, almost totally divorced from the actual state of safety research.

EA has a long history of trying to work with companies and regulators, and has been less confident in its ability to execute protests, ads, and campaigns.

As usual, a lot of the discussion was just clarifying what everyone was fighting about, but there were also a few real fights:</p><ul><li>Gerald Monroe <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId%3DFGSp5PBjm6o9rcY2g\">thought </a>that the history of nuclear weapons suggested pauses like this were impossible (because many countries did build nuclear weapons). David Manheim thought it suggested pauses like this could work (because there were some successful arms limitation treaties, and less nuclear proliferation than would have happened without international cooperation). Manheim also brought up the successful bans on ozone-destroying CFCs and on human cloning.</li><li>Nora thought most treaties like this fail, and a successful one would have to involve some level of global tyranny. David Manheim <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId%3DKRw7Q3rM3R6vg83Kc\">thought </a>most treaties sort of do some good, even if they don\u2019t accomplish exactly what they wanted, and none of them so far have led to global tyranny. Cf. <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-book-review-the-internationalists\">the Kellogg-Briand Pact</a>&nbsp;for an example of a treaty that didn\u2019t succeed perfectly but was probably net good.</li><li>Nora thought it was important to give alignment researchers advanced models to experiment with, because the sort of armchair alignment research before interesting AIs existed (eg Bostrom\u2019s <i>Superintelligence) </i>wasn\u2019t just wrong, but fostered dead-end worse-than-nothing paradigms that continue to confuse the field. Daniel Filan <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId%3DFeYj7vCfMpn5hxFpD\">objected</a>&nbsp;that Bostrom got some things right and even described something like the direction that modern alignment research is taking. There was a long argument about this, which I think reduces to \u201cBostrom said some useful theoretical things, speculated about practical direction, and a few of his speculations were right but most now seem outdated\u201d.</li><li>Zach Stein-Perlman <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId%3DHMipMShBr6ymoNzcd\">made some good points</a>&nbsp;about the technical factors that made pauses better vs. worse, which I\u2019ve tried to fold into the Surgical Pause section above.</li><li>Nora thought that success at making language models behave (eg refuse to say racist things even when asked) suggests alignment is going pretty well so far. Many other people (eg <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId%3D5aE2ZTt2RbADFJpq3\">Rafael Harth</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId%3DkqSzGBBr4TCu5ztbq\">Steven Byrnes</a>) suggested this would produce deceptive alignment, ie AI that says nice things to humans who have power over it, but secretly has different goals, and so success in this area says nothing about true alignment success and is even kind of worrying. The question remained unresolved.</li></ul><p>In <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/fwdjMtJLpkyJ2Gice\">How Could A Moratorium Fail?</a>, David Manheim discussed his own takeaways from the debate:</p><blockquote><p>My biggest surprise was how misleading the terms being used were, and think that many opponents were opposed to something different than what supporters were interested in suggesting. Even some supporters &nbsp;Second, I was very surprised to find opposition to the claim that AI might not be safe, and could pose serious future risks, largely because the systems would be aligned by default - i.e. without any enforced mechanisms for safety. I also found out that there was a non-trivial group that wants to roll back AI progress to before GPT-4 for safety reasons, as opposed to job displacement and copyright reasons. &nbsp;I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId%3DuaotaqDdgX9tDWh53\">was convinced by Gerald Monroe</a>&nbsp;that getting a full moratorium was harder than I have previously argued based on an analogy to nuclear weapons. (I was not convinced that it \u201cisn't going to happen without a series of extremely improbable events happening simultaneously\u201d - largely because I think that countries will be motivated to preserve the status quo.) I am mostly convinced by Matthew Barnett\u2019s claim that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/k6K3iktCLCTHRMJsY/the-possibility-of-an-indefinite-ai-pause%23The_possibility_of_an_indefinite_pause\">advanced AI could be delayed by a decade, if restrictions are put in place</a>&nbsp;- I was less optimistic, or what he would claim is pessimistic. As explained above, I was very much not convinced that a policy which was agreed to be irrelevant would remain in place indefinitely. I also didn\u2019t think that there\u2019s any reason to expect a naive pause for a fixed period, but he convinced me that this is more plausible than I had previously thought - and I agree with him, and disagree with Rob Bensinger, about how bad this might be. Lastly, I have been <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId%3DekvpGt53R2DupGniT\">convinced by Nora</a>&nbsp;that the vast majority of the differences in positions is predictive, rather than about values. Those optimistic about alignment are against pausing, and in most cases, I think those pessimistic about alignment are open to evidence that specific systems are safe. This is greatly heartening, because I think that over time, we\u2019ll continue to see evidence in one direction or another about what is likely, and if we can stay in a scout-mindset, we will (eventually) agree on the path forward.</p></blockquote><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>Some added thoughts of my own:</p><p><strong>First,</strong>&nbsp;I think it\u2019s silly to worry about world dictatorships here. The failure mode for global treaties is that the treaty doesn\u2019t get signed or doesn\u2019t work. Consider the various global warming treaties (eg Kyoto) or the United Nations. Even though many ordinary people (ie non-x-risk believers) dislike AI enough to agree to a ban, they\u2019re not going to support it when it starts interfering with their laptops or gaming rigs, let alone if it requires ceding national sovereignty to the UN or something.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, if we never get AI, I expect the future to be short and grim. Most likely we kill ourselves with synthetic biology. If not, some combination of <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/26/is-science-slowing-down-2/\">technological</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/\">economic </a>stagnation, rising <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/bad-definitions-of-democracy-and\">totalitarianism</a>&nbsp;+ <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/theses-on-the-current-moment\">illiberalism</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/the-gossip-trap\">+ </a><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/07/addendum-to-enormous-nutshell-competing-selectors/\">mobocracy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/slightly-against-underpopulation\">fertility collapse and dysgenics</a>&nbsp;will impoverish the world and accelerate its decaying institutional quality. I don\u2019t spend much time worrying about any of these, because I think they\u2019ll take a few generations to reach crisis level, and I expect technology to flip the gameboard well before then. But if we ban all gameboard-flipping technologies (the only other one I know is genetic enhancement, which is even more bannable), then we <i>do</i>&nbsp;end up with bioweapon catastrophe or social collapse. I\u2019ve said before I think there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-extinction-tournament\">~20%</a>&nbsp;chance of AI destroying the world. But if we don\u2019t get AI, I think there\u2019s a 50%+ chance in the next 100 years we end up dead or careening towards Venezuela. That doesn\u2019t mean I have to support AI accelerationism because 20% is smaller than 50%. Short, carefully-tailored pauses could improve the chance of AI going well by a lot, without increasing the risk of social collapse too much. But it\u2019s something on my mind.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, most participants agree that a pause would necessarily be temporary. There\u2019s no easy way to enforce it once technology gets so good that you can train an AI on your laptop, and (absent much wider adoption of x-risk arguments) government\u2019s won\u2019t have the stomach for hard ways. The <a href=\"https://takeoffspeeds.com/playground.html\">singularity prediction widget</a>&nbsp;currently predicts 2040. If I make drastic changes to starve everybody of computational resources, the furthest I can push it back is 2070. This somewhat reassures me about my concerns above, but not completely. Matthew Barnett <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/k6K3iktCLCTHRMJsY\">talks about whether a temporary pause could become permanent</a>, and concludes probably not without a global police state. But I think people 100 years ago would be surprised that the state of California has managed to effectively ban building houses. I think if some anti-house radical had proposed this 100 years ago, people would have told her that would be impossible without a hypercompetent police state<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7idwk045r8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7idwk045r8\">[4]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><strong>Fourth, </strong>there are many arguments that a pause would be impossible, but they mostly don\u2019t argue against <i>trying</i>. We could start negotiating an international AI pause treaty, and only sign it if enough other countries agree that we don\u2019t expect to be unilaterally-handicapping ourselves. So \u201cChina will never agree!\u201d isn\u2019t itself an argument against beginning diplomacy, unless you expect that just starting the negotiations would cause irresistible political momentum toward signing even if the end treaty was rigged against us.</p><p><strong>Fifth, </strong>a lot hinges on whether alignment research would be easier with better models. I\u2019ve only talked to a handful of alignment researchers about this, but they say they still have their hands full with GPT-4. I would like to see broader surveys about this (probably someone has done these, I just don\u2019t know where).</p><p>I find myself willing to consider trying a Regulatory or Surgical Pause - a strong one if proponents can secure multilateral cooperation, otherwise a weaker one calculated not to put us behind hostile countries (this might not be as hard as it sounds; so far China has just copied US advances; it remains to be seen if they can do cutting-edge research). I don\u2019t entirely trust the government to handle this correctly, but I\u2019m willing to see what they come up with before rejecting it.</p><p>Thanks to Ben and everyone who participated.

The idea that we could effectively ban housing would not have been inconceivable to people 100 years ago, and indeed many people (including the plaintiffs in the case) were worried about this type of outcome.I don't think people back then would have said that zoning would require a hypercompetent police state. It's more likely that they would say that zoning requires an intrusive expansion of government powers. I think they would have been correct in this assessment, and we got the expansion that they worried about.Unlike banning housing, banning AI requires that we can't have any exceptions. It's not enough to ban AI in the United States if AI can trained in Switzerland. This makes the proposal for an indefinite pause different from previous regulatory expansions, and in my opinion much more radical.To the extent you think that such crazy proposals simply aren't feasible, then you likely agree with me that we shouldn't push for an indefinite pause. That said, you also predicted that if current trends continued, \"rising totalitarianism + illiberalism + mobocracy, fertility collapse and dysgenics will impoverish the world and accelerate its decaying institutional quality\". This prediction doesn't seem significantly less crazy to me than the prediction that governments around the will attempt to ban AI globally (sloppily, and with severe negative consequences). I don't think it makes much sense to take one of these possibilities seriously and dismiss the other.\u201d</p><p>My answer: I think there\u2019s a difference between the regulatory framework for something existing vs. expecting it. It\u2019s constitutional and legal for the US to raise the middle-class tax rate to 99%, but most people would still be surprised if it happened. I\u2019m surprised how easy it is for governments to effectively ban things without even trying just by making them annoying. Could this create an AI pause that lasts decades? My Inside View answer is no; my Outside View answer has to be \u201cmaybe\u201d. Maybe they could make hardware progress and algorithmic progress so slow that AI never quite reaches the laptop level before civilization loses its ability to do technological advance entirely? Even though this would be a surprising world, I have more probability on something like this than on a global police state. Possible exception if AI does something crazy (eg launches nukes) that makes all world governments over-react and shift towards the police state side, but at that point we\u2019re not discussing policies in the main timeline anymore.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Scott Alexander"}}, {"_id": "JjfvzDuPyHgEZHRBb", "title": "Truthseeking when your disagreements lie in moral philosophy", "postedAt": "2023-10-11T21:11:34.702Z", "htmlBody": "<p><br>[Status: latest entry in a longrunning series]</p><p>My <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/ea-vegan-advocacy-is-not-truthseeking-and-it-s-everyone-s\">last post</a> on truthseeking in EA vegan advocacy got a lot of comments, but there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aW288uWABwTruBmgF/ea-vegan-advocacy-is-not-truthseeking-and-it-s-everyone-s-1?commentId=thct6NEbPopHc8KsX\">one</a> in particular I want to highlight as highly epistemically cooperative.

I would need a full post to explain myself, but basically I think that what seems to be really important when going vegan is standing in a certain sort of loving relationship to animals, one that isn\u2019t grounded in utility but instead a strong (but basic) appreciation and valuing of the other. But let me step back for a minute</i></p><p><i>I guess the first time I thought about this was with my university EA group. We had a couple of hardcore utilitarians, and one of them brought up an interesting idea one night. He was a vegan, but he\u2019d been offered some mac and cheese, and in similar thinking to above (that dairy generally involves less suffering than eggs or chicken for ex) he wondered if it might actually be better to take the mac and donate the money he would have spent to an animal welfare org. And when he roughed up the math, sure enough, taking the mac and donating was somewhat significantly the better option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>But he didn\u2019t do it, nor do I think he changed how he acted in the future. Why? I think it\u2019s really hard to draw a line in the sand that isn\u2019t veganism that stays stable over time. For those who\u2019ve reverted, I\u2019ve seen time and again a slow path back, one where it starts with the less bad items, cheese is quite frequent, and then naturally over time one thing after another is added to the point that most wind up in some sort of reduceitarian state where they\u2019re maybe 80% back to normal (I also want to note here, I\u2019m so glad for any change, and I cast no stones at anyone trying their best to change). And I guess maybe at some point it stops being a moral thing, or becomes some really watered down moral thing like how much people consider the environment when booking a plane ticket.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t know if this helps make it clear, but it\u2019s like how most people feel about harm to younger kids. When it comes to just about any serious harm to younger kids, people are generally against it, like super against it, a feeling of deep caring that to me seems to be one of the strongest sentiments shared by humans universally. People will give you some reasons for this i.e. \u201cthey are helpless and we are in a position of responsibility to help them\u201d but really it seems to ground pretty quickly in a sentiment of \u201cit\u2019s just bad\u201d.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>To have this sort of love, this commitment to preventing suffering, with animals to me means pretty much just drawing the line at sentient beings and trying to cultivate a basic sense that they matter and that \u201cit\u2019s just bad\u201d to eat them. Sure, I\u2019m not sure what to do about insects, and wild animal welfare is tricky, so it\u2019s not nearly as easy as I\u2019m making it seem. And it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to have any idea of some of the numbers and research behind it all, I know I need to stay up to date on debates on sentience, and I know that I reference relative measures of harm often when I\u2019m trying to guide non-veg people away from the worst harms. But what I\u2019d love to see one day is a posturing towards eating animals like our posturing towards child abuse, a very basic, loving expression that in some sense refuses the debate on what\u2019s better or worse and just casts it all out as beyond the pale.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>And to try to return to earlier, I guess I see taking this sort of position as likely to extend people\u2019s time spent doing veg-related diets, and I think it\u2019s just a lot trickier to have this sort of relationship when you are doing some sort of utilitarian calculus of what is and isn\u2019t above the bar for you (again, much love to these people, something is always so much better than nothing). This is largely just a theory, I don\u2019t have much to back it up, and it would seem to explain some cases of reversion I\u2019ve seen but certainly not all, and I also feel like this is a bit sloppy because I\u2019d really need a post to get at this hard to describe feeling I have. But hopefully this helps explain the viewpoint a bit better, happy to answer any questions \ud83d\ude42</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s true that this comment doesn\u2019t use citations or really many objective facts.

And so here is the first post in that spirit!</p><h3><strong>Why respond at all?</strong></h3><p>EA's last 12 months has been pretty challenging. In the light of various scandals and controversies, there seems to be increased scepticism of the movement, especially in public debates. Some of this pushback is valid, and it is up to us as a community/movement to respond accordingly. <i>However</i>, a lot of anti-EA takes I've seen this year have often been quite poor, showing lack of familiarity with the ideas and debates occurring within EA.</p><p>Despite this semi-hostile media landscape, my current understanding of what could be called 'EA comms strategy' is that all criticisms of this form are basically ignored, probably for reasons such as:</p><ul><li>Responding to these criticisms is not a good use of time or effort</li><li>In fact, it may potentially backfire by bringing unwanted attention to the community/Forum</li><li>With small comms resources, it's better to communicate to specific people carefully (e.g., journalists at major newspapers)</li><li>Alternatively, it may be that there is <i>no EA comms strategy&nbsp;</i>as nobody can speak for decentralised movement (e.g., nobody can be a spokesperson for all of Feminism or Environmentalism)</li></ul><p>I sympathise with a lot of these perspectives. And my intention <i>is not to respond for the EA philosophy, but as an individual EA.&nbsp;</i>Nevertheless, I do think the current comms strategy<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref63p1ll2tlmf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn63p1ll2tlmf\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;has not fared well over the last year. As criticism of EA has grown, certain misconceptions, falsehoods, and bad arguments have essentially been left to spread without much engagement or pushback.</p><p>It's true that most public debates end without anyone on the stage changing their minds, and I think the same is true for social media. <i>However,&nbsp;</i>there are far more people reading and referencing social media than those who contribute to it, and the arguments and ideas they encounter do matter. So this post (and maybe sequence) is meant to be a way of rectifying this balance.</p><h3><strong>Why this article?</strong></h3><p>A friend of mine<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwfy9qhmvh8b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwfy9qhmvh8b\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;shared it on WhatsApp this morning and it provoked some interesting discussion between us, but I found the article itself lacking.</p><p><i>The Observer&nbsp;</i>is the sister paper of <i>The Guardian,&nbsp;</i>the UK's leading left-of-centre newspaper. The column therefore has a large amount of potential reach.</p><p>It is also another example of EA being portrayed negatively in the 'left-of-centre toward left' sphere. Counteracting the perception that such a split is inevitable, common, or necessary is another reason I wanted to start on this series of posts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Onto the Article</strong></h2><h3><strong>The Main Argument</strong></h3><p>As this is a newspaper column and not an academic paper there isn't a structured, syllogistic argument laid out for us. However, one consistent theme emerged: Malik seemed to tie EA's role in the FTX scandal inevitably back to its philosophical commitments, hence leading to his pessimistic view on it as a whole.</p><p>The points below are therefore my summary from the article, as well as paraphrased. I'd suggest reading it yourself to get a clearer sense of what Malik thinks:</p><ol><li>EA holds that moral consequences of actions must be quantified, and our moral decisions ought to be taken on that basis.</li><li>This leads into problems of measurability bias and only treating the 'symptoms' of world problems. Given its philosophical commitments, EA will ignore these kinds of interventions.</li><li>As such, it means it gives backing to those with power in the existing status quo of the world, such as Silicon Valley billionaires or cryptocurrency whizzkids, and turns them into heroes.</li><li>This philosophical cover in fact means that essentially any action of these powerful people can be justified under the EA framework.</li><li>These structures and these people are actually causing harm, meaning that EA is unable to fulfil its goal of 'doing the most good'</li></ol><p>Suffice to say, I disagree with a lot of this, though some parts more than others. I'd also want to re-iterate that this is my impression of Malik's case after reading (and re-reading) the article as well as drafting the post. In his actual article it flows together less systematically, but I'll quote specifics in the next section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The Errors</h3><p><strong>Factual Errors and Lack of Evidence</strong></p><p>In a variety of cases, Malik either makes claims that are wrong and could have been checked or could use more clarification. Again, it's a newspaper article rather than an academic article, but here are some examples of where I think he should have done better.</p><p>1)&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>MacAskill encourages students to become not relatively poorly paid aid workers or doctors, but bankers or traders who might earn millions.</p></blockquote><p>This is referencing MacAskill's 2013 Paper <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10677-013-9433-4\"><i>Replaceability, Career Choice, and Making a Difference</i></a>. I also think MacAskill is somewhat standing in for 'EA Thinking' as a whole here. But by 2015 institutional EA and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/\">even Will himself was moving away</a> from 'Earning to Give', both philosophically and in terms of EA outreach.&nbsp;</p><p>Funnily enough, even in the 2015 Amia Srinivasan criticism that Malik cites, she also mentions that Will has already moved away from Earning-to-Give. Maybe 'students' actually means 'some students', but 'some' could mean 0.05% so the criticism becomes a lot less focused and loses its force.</p><p>2)</p><p>Finally, while there are references to MacAskill and Singer in the article, Malik also makes claims about the EA movement and Effective Altruists as a whole without referencing any empirical evidence on what its members actually believe.&nbsp;For example, there have been <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/g5uKzBLjiEuC5k46A/ftx-community-response-survey-results\">great surveys shared on this Forum</a> that give good insight into how EA members have reacted to the FTX collapse, but Malik doesn\u2019t seemed to have tried to take something like this into account.</p><p>This is a frequent problem I have with EA criticism. A lot is made of the \u2018longtermist turn\u2019 in EA, but many people in the movement still focus on Global Health &amp; Development, and that\u2019s still where the bulk of the movement\u2019s money goes. Now I think there is merit to a criticism along these lines but the criticism is strongest, I think, from a counterfactual or opportunity cost perspective, rather than as a blanket statement about the what the EA movement is doing as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Philosophical and Conceptual Confusion</strong></p><p>Some ideas in EA are confusing, others are unintuitive, and some are both! This doesn't mean that all EA ideas are like this though, which makes me confused when some critics think that there are simple philosophical criticisms that EAs simply haven't thought about. For example:</p><p>1)</p><blockquote><p>Few people would dispute that the consequences of an act must play a major role in helping decide its moral worth. The trouble is, being merely \u201csensitive to numbers\u201d, divorced from social context, can lead to perverse ends.</p></blockquote><p>I found this criticism really odd to read. Malik is arguing against consequentialism here, but the grounds for that concern are 'perverse ends', which seems like an alternate phrasing of 'bad consequences'. This seems like a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv1nMc-k0N4\">'straw Vulcan' criticism</a>, as a good consequentialist would be aware of the styles of thinking that would lead to these bad consequences. <a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c85a99d8-5ed3-4854-a2ee-9fdbf9ea942f/download_file?file_format=application%2Fpdf&amp;safe_filename=Ord_2009_Beyond_Action__applying.pdf&amp;type_of_work=Thesis\">This PhD Thesis</a> has a really good summary of different interpretations of consequentialism and shows that as early as JS Mill consequentialists were arguing that unifying ethical principles need not be required for every moral deliberation an agent undertakes. That PhD candidate's name? Toby Ord.</p><p>Note also how Malik shifted from quoting Singer saying Effective Altruists \"are sensitive to numbers\" to being \"merely sensitive to numbers\". That was a quick sleight of hand that passed me by the first time and is unhelpful not just because it isn\u2019t what Singer (or any other EA) has said, but it once again crosses criticism of EA as a philosophy and EA as a movement.</p><p>2)</p><blockquote><p>He [SBF] might have scammed investors but at least he gave more money to charity than another scammer might have done. Most EA supporters, I imagine, would reject such arguments, but in so doing they reveal that there is more to morality than numbers adding up, and that concepts such as dignity or intrinsic worth may be as important as consequences.</p></blockquote><p>Once again, that EAs believe that there is no more 'to morality than numbers' is something which Malik has written into existence here. There is infinitely more to morality than numbers, even for EAs, but quantitative analyses (or \u2018numbers adding up\u2019 as Malik phrases it) are what many EAs use for cause prioritisation and deciding which problem to tackle. But these numbers often come after deciding what is valuable, and what might be an amenable proxy for tracking it.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also confusing to me why someone wouldn't include 'dignity' or 'intrinsic worth' into their thoughts about how to do good. We could imagine a scenario in which there are two worlds, which contain the same number of persons, who experience the same hedonic utility but vastly different levels of dignity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkvibr1or8hb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkvibr1or8hb\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;My assumption is that the vast majority of EAs would say that the world with more dignity is the world that is more moral. Alternatively, even a hedonic utilitarian could argue that in the real-world dignity and a sense of intrinsic worth so closely correlate states of the world that have high utility that in practice they will only come apart in convoluted thought experiments.</p><p>I think there is an underlying, unspoken objection to the whole premise of consequentialism here; and an assumption by Malik that morality is correctly viewed as a question of what makes a moral character rather than what makes an action moral. But that's a whole other debate, and one Malik does little if anything to set up in this piece, and even then one of the developments in EA moral thought over the last few years is how to deal with questions of <a href=\"https://www.moraluncertainty.com/\">Moral Uncertainty</a>.</p><p>In summary, I think that this line of argument would need a lot more work to become convincing, and also suffers from many of the same confusions about consequentialism raised in the previous point.</p><p>3)</p><blockquote><p>Effective altruists tend also to target the symptoms rather than the causes of social problems, as it is easier to do so, and \u201ceasier\u201d becomes translated as \u201cmore effective\u201d</p></blockquote><p>There is a big debate on systemic vs marginal action in EA so I don't want to recap all of that here. But I do think the first half of Malik\u2019s sentence here is already feeling a bit dicey to me unless you have an idea what 'the causes of social problems' is. I think that's actually a much harder thing to be sure about than many people claim.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdgmltb6kls\"><sup><a href=\"#fndgmltb6kls\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Do social problems have a single cause'? Surely they are multicausal, and it'd be plausible to say that interventions that seem 'symptomatic' will actually feed back into society. If a child is saved by an EA-funded health intervention, are we assuming that this child will never have an impact on their society later? Perhaps this is a practical claim about where EAs send their money, but it doesn\u2019t really go through as a criticism unless you think that symptomatic interventions are treated as less effective by EAs because they are not as easy.</p><p>But again, this feels like it isn\u2019t telling the whole story, and is again neglecting a wide range of EA thought on this topic. Consider again the good old I-T-N Framework. Yes, marginal interventions are 'easier' than systemic changes in the sense that they are more tractable, but if the systemic changes were neglected and important enough then they would end up having more impact (i.e., be more \u201ceffective\u201d) and they would be supported to some degree by EA. That's basically where I'd place Animal Welfare. Getting humanity to treat Animals better is an incredibly challenging task, but the alternative seems to be morally catastrophic, so it is worth trying and it is worthwhile for EA to support this effort.</p><p>Anyway, there's a lot more to be said about this topic, and I can\u2019t do justice to it in this post. But I just want to note that, again, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any recognition by Malik that many EAs have thought carefully about these issues in a variety of ways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Object-level Disagreements</strong></p><p>There are also some points where I think Malik disagrees with EA on an object level, and I think that EA is mostly correct (hence why I'm posting on the Forum, rather than the Guardian comments section)</p><p>1)</p><p>I think EA as a philosophy is against moral intuitionism as <i>ending&nbsp;</i>a debate as Malik does here, but I don't think it's against intuitionism as <i>starting&nbsp;</i>a debate. That's exactly what I think the 'expanding moral circle\u2019 is. The intuition is that our moral concerns don\u2019t seem to end with ourselves, our families, nations, or even the species as a whole. The question is then what are the implications for us, our actions, and our world. In general, I'm sceptical of how far moral intuitions should be used as cornerstones of our moral actions,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffdt7x0efi1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfdt7x0efi1\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;though I suspect they could be valuable as guardrails.</p><p>Again, the role of moral intuition in applied ethics and meta-ethical debate is another topic I can\u2019t cover here. But Malik again throws this line in without seeming to think it through. The fact that strict consequentialism violates some of our moral intuitions in some cases is not a compelling argument against EA.</p><p>2)</p><blockquote><p>Food banks address a pressing need, but not the underlying reasons for that need \u2013 poverty wages and abysmally low benefits. Many of us recognise the necessity both of providing immediate help for people failed by the system and of campaigning to transform that system, thereby removing the necessity for food banks.</p></blockquote><p>The clearest piece by an EA I can think of that argues against systemic interventions is <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/22/beware-systemic-change/\"><i>Beware Systemic Change</i></a> by Scott Alexander. I don\u2019t fully agree with it, but if you\u2019re interested in this debate, it\u2019s very worth reading. A very quick simplification of the argument it makes is that it's much easier to claim you have a fool-proof way to solve a systemic problem (e.g., remove the need for food banks and guarantee that no citizen will go hungry) but in practice this seems very difficult to achieve, and historically has led to a number of bad outcomes and moral atrocities. The current system has many flaws, but broadly it seems to have been a large part of how <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief\">humanity has begun to eradicate poverty</a>. To misquote Churchill <i>\"Capitalism is the worst form of Economic System except for all those other forms that have been tried.\u201d</i></p><p>So, to return to Malik\u2019s example, if you don\u2019t think that there is a campaign to hand that can transform the system to remove the need for food banks, and if a person were considering shutting down their food bank (and they were the only person who could provide it) I think there would be reasons to get them to consider not doing so. I think an assumption Malik, and other EA critics, make on this issue is to assume that there\u2019s an oven-ready systemic change we can immediately invest in that will have a positive impact, but I think that\u2019s false or at least not clearly true. I think a lot of EAs are very interested in supporting positive systemic changes, but it turns out that in reality they\u2019re <a href=\"https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300246759/seeing-like-a-state/\">very difficult to design and implement from the top down successfully</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>3)</p><blockquote><p>Inevitably, it [EA] gives inordinate power to those with the biggest pockets, turning the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried into heroes</p></blockquote><p>I think there's a version of this criticism that might have more bite (Srinivasan makes it more thoroughly and persuasively in <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse\">her criticism</a>), but it doesn't work well as a concluding line in this piece. I don't think that the 'inevitably' is justified at all. In fact, by arguing that we should take into account future generations or non-human animals as moral patients many parts of EA seem to extend moral worth to those who do not have the biggest pockets far more than many other moral frameworks that exist today.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there are very valid criticisms of how EA institutions deal with power practically, but Malik doesn\u2019t do anything to argue that this is an inevitable result of EA philosophy. A charitable reading would be something like \u2018the main argument,\u2019 but even here EAs negative consequences are a result of other contingent social factors as well, and this contingency means that the claim of inevitability regarding EA\u2019s social consequences is not (and probably can't be) epistemically justified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><h3>Another disappointing critique</h3><p>As I read this article, I became increasingly disappointed at it. While I don't think a newspaper column should be held to the standards of an academic article, and Malik isn't writing for an EA-aware audience, it still comes off as a 'first-pass' criticism of EA that's also out-of-date in its perspective of the movement.</p><p>Of course I'm biased towards EA here. But I don't ask people to take my word for it. I think that the 'main argument' implicit in Malik's piece is unsupported, and that the specific extracts I've presented show that his arguments are relatively weak, overly general, and not supported by specific examples or evidence. It might be that he does have more worked-out versions of these arguments that do present a challenge to EA, but this article shouldn't make anyone think that EA is likely to be a wrong approach to doing good.</p><h3><strong>Why this matters</strong></h3><p>To re-iterate, I feel like this post is the result of sticking to a new principle of mine: don't let bad criticisms of EA slide. My hope is that if people link to Malik's piece or bring it up as a point in a discussion as evidence of arguments against EA, then this piece is here as a response. In turn, I hope it will lead all involved to a better understanding of EA perspectives and why EA is not as bad as our critics say it is. Failing that, I hope it will at least be useful in identifying where the key cruxes of our disagreement actually are, rather than having to fight an \u2018Eternal September\u2019 each time.</p><p>This isn't to say that there are no good criticisms of EA, or that we shouldn\u2019t be doing more to encourage good criticisms from outgroups. I think there is a lot in the last 12 months that hasn't fully been reckoned with. But this piece was a nice crystallisation of what I consider to be representative of a large amount of poor EA criticism.</p><h3><strong>What's next</strong></h3><p>I hope that there will be no more bad criticisms of EA, but reality is often disappointing. I'll continue this series if I have the time, and probably prioritise criticisms based on:</p><ul><li>How large the reach of the criticism is.</li><li>How egregious the anti-EA claims are, either by overclaiming or presenting weak arguments as obviously true.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2vlby3lizk3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2vlby3lizk3\">[6]</a></sup></span></li><li>Whether it covers new arguments that haven't been covered before.</li></ul><p>As a brief preview, however, Professor Noah Giansiracusa recently posted <a href=\"https://nitter.net/ProfNoahGian/status/1711458105010040894\">another EA weak take</a>, and as they've been doing this consistently this year<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4zhrnl5r7h5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4zhrnl5r7h5\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;they're probably a contender to be next on my list.</p><p>Anyway, that's it for now. Let me know if you like this post, if you have another 'bad EA criticism' for me to tackle next, or if you desperately suggest that I end the entire enterprise. Wherever you are reading this, I hope your motivations are altruistic and your actions effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn63p1ll2tlmf\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref63p1ll2tlmf\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><i>de facto </i>if not <i>de jure</i></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnwfy9qhmvh8b\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefwfy9qhmvh8b\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>A friend who is \"EA-adjacent\" and was a lot more sympathetic to the article than I was</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnkvibr1or8hb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefkvibr1or8hb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>If such a world is plausibly imaginable</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fndgmltb6kls\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefdgmltb6kls\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The closest Malik gives us is saying that they are \"social and economic forces\", without saying more.

Here, I'd like to briefly walk through the core arguments of the article (self-quoting in several places) and then outline a few hypothetical examples of novel interventions derived from its ideas. I hope that this post and the original article contribute to future collaborations between social scientists and biosecurity professionals.</p><p><i>This article represents my personal opinions and does not reflect the opinions of my employer Gryphon Scientific.</i></p><h2>Core claims</h2><p>Biorisk management (BRM) encompasses a broad set of practices that life scientists can follow to mitigate the risks of their work. It includes things like following safety and security protocols, reporting suspicious activities in and around the lab, and modifying or stopping a research project if you believe that its results could be misused to cause harm.</p><p>Life scientists face external pressure from regulators to practice BRM, but sometimes external rules cannot be effectively enforced or haven\u2019t been created yet. In these situations, it is important for life scientists to practice&nbsp;<i>proactive</i> BRM - to be vigilant about potential biorisks and take steps to mitigate them, even when nobody else is looking.</p><p>Unfortunately, research suggests that many life scientists may not be very motivated to proactively manage biorisks. Much is still unknown about life scientists\u2019 opinions on BRM, especially outside of the US, but enough studies have been done to be concerning. For example, in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chas.0c00012\"><u>series of annual surveys</u></a> of laboratory safety staff and scientists at a US national conference, the most commonly cited barrier to improving laboratory safety (with almost 50% of each group agreeing) was \u201ccompeting priorities,\u201d the second-most commonly cited barrier was \u201capathy,\u201d and the fourth was \u201ctime and hassle factors.\u201d There are no high-quality surveys on the topic of managing risks of deliberate misuse, but in <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/12460/a-survey-of-attitudes-and-actions-on-dual-use-research-in-the-life-sciences\">interview</a> <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/spp/article-abstract/45/1/92/4158227?redirectedFrom=PDF\">studies</a>, non-trivial fractions of life scientists have expressed the ideas that risks are virtually nonexistent, that risks are present but unstoppable, and that the benefits of research virtually always outweigh the risks. (See the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/hs.2022.0101#_i3\"><u>full paper</u></a> for a more complete discussion.)</p><p>Despite these findings, little effort is being put directly into understanding or changing life scientists\u2019 attitudes about BRM or providing compelling arguments and narratives about the importance of BRM.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/hs.2022.0101#_i8\"><u>Most existing biosafety and biosecurity training focuses entirely on imparting technical biosafety and biosecurity skills</u></a>, like how to decontaminate equipment or use PPE. It makes little effort to persuade, engage, motivate, or inspire life scientists to practice these skills when nobody else is looking, or to think critically about how to prevent their work from being misused. Relevant research exists on the topic of \u201csafety culture,\u201d but the field is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1535676018778538\"><u>underdeveloped</u></a>.</p><p>Lessons from the social and behavioral sciences can and should be adapted to promote proactive biorisk management. For example, literature on social norms, persuasion, attitude change, and habit formation could be used to design and test behavior-change interventions. The bar is low; researchers have not rigorously tested interventions to change life scientists' proactive BRM practices. Funders should support social scientists and biorisk experts to partner with life scientists on programs of applied research that start with interviews and surveys and build toward scalable and testable interventions.</p><h2>Example interventions</h2><p>To illustrate, here are three sketches of possible social-science interventions to promote proactive BRM that could be piloted and evaluated in field settings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/hs.2022.0101\"><u>full paper</u></a> includes references, more intervention ideas, and more detailed thoughts about implementation and evaluation.</p><h3>Listening tours for proactive biosafety</h3><p>Labs are more likely to maintain biosafety when scientists and their institutional biosafety staff maintain strong working relationships and see themselves as being on the same team. Unfortunately, the relationships between scientists and safety staff are often strained. Scientists may fear that interacting with safety staff will slow down their work, so they fail to ask questions or tell staff about their concerns.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/18706/safe-science-promoting-a-culture-of-safety-in-academic-chemical\"><u>Research on safety in chemistry labs</u></a> has also found that scientists can sometimes offload responsibility for safety onto staff in ways that are not justifiable. For example, if a scientist notices a malfunctioning piece of equipment, they might assume that staff know about the malfunction and would not allow it to continue if it was truly risky. In fact, safety staff often rely on scientists to let them know about malfunctions and other anomalies.</p><p>One approach to improve scientist-staff relations in the life sciences is for biosafety staff to conduct periodic \u201clistening tours\u201d with life science laboratories, as is already practiced by executives in many private firms. Biosafety staff could attend existing lab meetings to introduce themselves, assure the lab that they are not conducting an audit, and ask the lab members to teach them about the possible safety risks involved in their subfield (not necessarily their particular laboratory). Staff could close the conversation by thanking the group and requesting advice on how to reduce the burdens of risk management and how to communicate with&nbsp;<i>other</i> life scientists about the importance of laboratory safety.</p><p>By positioning themselves as learners, biosafety staff members can accomplish several psychologically potent goals simultaneously. They can send the message that they are not omnipotent, frame scientists in a position of responsibility and authority regarding laboratory safety, and convey the potential for a friendly, collaborative relationship in the future. This effort could also give life scientists practice thinking about how their own work could be unsafe without fear of being audited, and may give staff valuable information about novel safety risks and ways of making risk management less costly.</p><p>One potential example of this approach in practice can be found at Colorado State University, which oversees a large and complex life science research infrastructure. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.research.colostate.edu/bso/\"><u>CSU Biosafety Office</u></a> conducts outreach visits to life scientists with the goals of establishing caring and friendly relationships and positioning themselves as helpful supporters of scientists' own values of personal safety. According to staff reports, the upfront work of building relationships pays off later with smoother future interactions and a stronger safety culture. Their approach could be studied and scaled.</p><h3>Shifting social norms in laboratories</h3><p>Social norms are powerful determinants of workplace behavior, and social psychologists have a long history of successfully shifting behavior by changing norms. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919283/\"><u>a study published in 2020</u></a>, social psychologists involved with the open-science movement sought to encourage academic lab scientists to use a formal policy to decide the order of authorship on published papers. The psychologists ran a randomized controlled trial across 30 labs to test a \u201clab-embedded discourse intervention\u201d - essentially a semi-structured lab meeting - designed to shift norms and attitudes, and found statistically significant effects 4 months later on lab members' self-reports of using a formal authorship policy.</p><p>Deciding authorship is a sensitive topic in academia - best practices might not always be widely known, and it can be uncomfortable to bring it up among your peers unless you know how they feel. Many areas of proactive BRM are like this. Imagine asking your labmate, \u201cHey\u2026 would you mind wearing proper PPE in the lab?\u201d Or worse yet, \u201cHey\u2026 I\u2019m worried that our research could be used as a weapon, will you support me if we talk to our professor about it?\u201d</p><p>It might be possible to design interventions that shift social norms in labs around proactive BRM. For example, social scientists could work with life scientists to design a semi-structured lab meeting that creates common knowledge among lab members that they all care about biorisk concerns. To assess effectiveness, life scientists could be surveyed about whether they would be willing and able to raise a biorisk concern if they had one. Eventually, it could be promoted at academic conferences. Effective interventions could be scaled, targeted to high-consequence labs, and embedded in academic institutions as part of onboarding (as is done with other promising interventions).</p><h3>Designing compelling dual-use education programs</h3><p>In the context of the life sciences, research is considered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/ethical-conduct/special-research-considerations/dual-use-research\"><u>\u201cdual-use\u201d</u></a> if it can be misused to cause harm. There is increasing international agreement that life scientists should consider the dual-use potential of their work and adopt codes of conduct to minimize the potential for misuse. See the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.interacademies.org/sites/default/files/2021-07/Tianjin-Guidelines_210707.pdf\"><u>Tianjin Biosecurity Guidelines for Codes of Conduct for Scientists</u></a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240056107\"><u>WHO Global Guidance Framework for the Responsible Use of the Life Sciences</u></a> for two recent examples.</p><p>However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053622001264?via%3Dihub\"><u>life scientists are rarely formally taught about dual-use issues</u></a>. (Former US Asst. Secretary of Defense and biosecurity expert Andy Weber recently called this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KbTasufbtJwZYiJQ8/ama-andy-weber-u-s-assistant-secretary-of-defense-from-2009#comments\"><u>\u201cshocking\u201d</u></a> on the EA Forum.) Existing curricular materials cover some aspects of dual-use issues, but they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053622001264?via%3Dihub\"><u>have not</u></a> been compiled, tested, or translated into common languages, and their quality likely varies greatly. (For example, I\u2019m skeptical that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2588933823000365-gr2_lrg.jpg\"><u>comic books</u></a> are a compelling format.)</p><p>There need to be compelling, comprehensive, and widely-accessible off-the-shelf online dual-use education programs available for life scientists. Such programs could be developed and tested by educators in partnership with biosecurity experts and life scientists. Government bodies and/or private funders could require them as a precondition for funding or accreditation.&nbsp;</p><p>I expect this topic to be somewhat controversial on this forum because of concerns about creating information hazards. While I remain open to changing my mind about the value of dual-use education, I want to offer a couple of thoughts about mitigating information hazards. First, dual-use education programs do not need to go into extensive detail about particular risks to be effective. Second, dual-use education programs should include guidance on responsible disclosure to avoid propagating information hazards. The details of how to do so are outside the scope of this post, but for example, they might involve privately discussing concerns with labmates before blurting them out on social media.</p><h2>How can I get involved?</h2><p>If you are interested in learning more, I encourage you to read the <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/hs.2022.0101\">full paper</a> from which this article was drawn.</p><p>If you think that you might have the skills and motivation to contribute to any of these or similar interventions, I welcome you to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:dgreene@gryphonscientific.com\"><u>contact me</u></a> by email or via direct message on this Forum.

But for the purpose of this Giving Guide, I stuck to the most common forms of donations: cash and securities (stocks, bonds, funds, ETFs).</p><p>There are also other ways to donate to charity, for example via a charitable trust or private foundation, but I chose to cover the most common forms of donating: from personal banking and investment accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inspiration for Giving Guide</strong></p><p>Yield &amp; Spread is a nonprofit whose mission is to promote personal finance as a force for good. We believe that increasing financial literacy creates more opportunities for people to give back, in that when we can better optimize our own finances, we are in a much better position to help others.</p><p>Here in the US, our financial system and tax structures are challenging to navigate. And I\u2019ve found that when it comes to giving, there are even fewer quality financial resources that pertain to donating. Many of the resources I have come across are from marketing materials created by providers and/or charities themselves, resulting in misleading information and an overpromise of tax benefits when donating.&nbsp;</p><p>In speaking with many individuals about their financial plans for giving (please see our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BraHs6yqgRyecEsGq/personal-finance-coaching-for-eas-call-for-applicants\"><u>free financial coaching program for do-gooders</u></a>), I have found that many people are so focused on whether or not they are donating in a tax-advantaged way that it becomes a point of friction. It often delays their donations, or worse\u2026prevents them from donating in the first place. In these cases, perfect is the enemy of good. My goal is to help people elevate their baseline understanding for financial planning and donation strategies to enable them to make donations with confidence. As such, I want to be clear that this guide wasn\u2019t created to just promote charitable tax breaks.

I think part of the post is sufficiently misleading about evolutionary history and the OP first prize gives it enough visibility, that it makes sense to write a post-long response.<br><br>Central evolutionary biology related claim of the original post is this:</p><blockquote><ul><li>The animals of the generation learn throughout their lifetimes, collectively performing many billions of steps of learning.</li><li>The generation dies, and all of the accumulated products of within lifetime learning are lost.</li><li>Differential reproductive success slightly changes the balance of traits across the species.</li></ul><p>\u2026<br><br>The only way to transmit information from one generation to the next is through evolution changing genomic traits, because death wipes out the within lifetime learning of each generation.<br><br>\u2026<br><br>However, this sharp left turn does not occur because the inner learning processes suddenly become much better / more foomy / more general in a handful of outer optimization steps. It happens because you devoted billions of times more optimization power to the inner learning processes, but then deleted each inner learner shortly thereafter. Once the inner learning processes become able to pass non-trivial amounts of knowledge along to their successors, you get what looks like a sharp left turn. But that sharp left turn only happens because the inner learners have found a kludgy workaround past the crippling flaw where they all get deleted shortly after initialization.</p></blockquote><p>In my view, this interpretation of evolutionary history is something between \"speculative\" and \"wrong\".<br><br>Transmitting some of the data gathered during the lifetime of the animal to next generation by some other means is so obviously useful that is it highly<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sam4ehxHgnJEGCKed/lessons-from-convergent-evolution-for-ai-alignment\"><u> convergent</u></a>. Non-genetic communication channels to the next generation include epigenetics, parental teaching / imitation learning, vertical transmission of symbionts, parameters of prenatal environment, hormonal and chemical signaling,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4048089/\"><u>bio-electric signals</u></a>, and transmission of environmental resources or modifications created by previous generations, which can shape the conditions experienced by future generations (e.g. beaver dams).&nbsp;<br><br>Given the fact overcoming the genetic bottleneck is&nbsp;<i>so highly convergent</i>, it seems a bit surprising if there was a large free lunch on table in exactly this direction, as Quintin assumes:</p><blockquote><p>Evolution's sharp left turn happened because evolution spent compute in a shockingly inefficient manner for increasing capabilities, leaving vast amounts of free energy on the table for any self-improving process that could work around the evolutionary bottleneck. Once you condition on this specific failure mode of evolution, you can easily predict that humans would undergo a sharp left turn at the point where we could pass significant knowledge across generations. I don't think there's anything else to explain here, and no reason to suppose some general tendency towards extreme sharpness in inner capability gains.</p></blockquote><p><br>It's probably worth to go a bit into technical details here: evolution did manage to discover evolutionary innovations like mirror neurons:&nbsp;<i>A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an organism acts and when the organism observes the same action performed by another. Thus, the neuron \"mirrors\" the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. ... Further experiments confirmed that about 10% of neurons in the monkey inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex have \"mirror\" properties and give similar responses to performed hand actions and observed actions.</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcgipi135eef\"><sup><a href=\"#fncgipi135eef\">[1]</a></sup></span><i>&nbsp;</i><br><br>Clearly, mirror neurons are type of an innovation which allows high throughput behavioural cloning / imitation learning.&nbsp;<i>\"10% of neurons in the monkey inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex\"&nbsp;</i>is a massive amount of compute. Neurons imitating your parent's motoric policy based on visual channel information about the behaviour of your parent is a high-throughput channel. (I recommend doing a Fermi estimate of this channel capacity).<br><br>The situation where you clearly have a system totally able to eat the free lunch on the table, and supposedly the lunch is still there, makes me suspicious.<br><br>At the same time: yes, clearly, nowadays, human culture <i>is</i> a lot of data, and humans learn more than monkeys.</p><h3>Different stories</h3><p>What are some evolutionary plausible alternatives of Quintin's story?&nbsp;<br><br>Alternative stories would usually suggest that ancestral humans had access to channels to overcome the genetic bottleneck, and were using such channels to the extent it was marginally effective. Then, some other major change happened, the marginal fitness advantage of learning more grew, and humans developed to transmit more bits, so, modern humans transmit more.<br><br>An example of such major change could be advent of culture. If you look at the past timeline from a replicator dynamics perspective, the next most interesting event after the beginning of life is cultural replicators running on human brains crossing R&gt;1 and starting&nbsp; the second <i>vast</i> evolutionary search, cultural evolution.<br><br>How is the story \"cultural evolution is the pivotal event\" different? Roughly speaking, culture is a multi-brain parallel immortal evolutionary search computation. Running at higher speed and a layer of abstraction away from physical reality (compared to genes), it was able to discover many pools of advantage, like fire, versatile symbolic communication, or specialise-and-trade superagent organisation.<br><br>In this view, there is a type difference between 'culture' and 'increased channel capacity'.&nbsp;<br><br>You can interpret this in multiple ways, but if you want to cast this as a&nbsp;<i>story of a discontinuity</i>, where biological evolution randomly stumbled upon starting a different powerful open-ended misaligned search, it makes sense. The fact that such search finds caches of fitness and negentropy seems not very surprising.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6cir8b7m1yn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6cir8b7m1yn\">[2]</a></sup></span><br><br>Was the \"increased capacity to transfer what's learned in brain's lifetime to the next generation\" at least the most important or notably large direction what to exploit? I'm not a specialist on human evolution, but seems hard to say with confidence: note that&nbsp;<i>'fire'</i> is also a big deal, as it allows you do spend way less on digestion, and cheaper ability to coordinate is a big deal, as illustrated by ants, and symbolic communication is a big deal, as it is digital, robust and and effective compression.<br><br>Unfortunately for attempts to figure out what were the precise marginal costs and fitness benefits&nbsp;for ancestral humans, my impression is, ~ten thousand generations of genetic evolution in a fitness landscape shaped by cultural evolution screens a lot of evidence. In particular, from the fact modern humans are outliers in some phenotype characteristic, you can not infer it was the cause of the change to humans. For example, argument like&nbsp;<i>'human kids have unusual capacity to absorb significant knowledge across generations compared to chimps, ergo, the likely cause of human explosive development is ancestral humans having more of this capacity than other species'&nbsp;</i>has very little weight. Modern wolfs are also notably different from modern chihuahuas, but the correct causal story is not&nbsp;<i>'ancestral chihuahuas had an overhang of loyalty and harmlessness'.</i><br><br>Does this partially invalidate the argument toward implications for AI in the original post? In my view yes; if, following Quintin, we translate the actual situation&nbsp; into quantities and narratives that drive AI progress rates<br><br>- the \"specific failure mode\" of not transmitting what brains learn to the next generation is not there<br>- the marginal fitness advantage of transmitting more bits to the next generation brains is unclear, similarly to an unclear marginal advantage of e.g. spending more on LLMs curating data for the next gen LLM training<br>- because we don't really understand what happened, the metaphorical map to AI progress mostly maps this lack of understanding to lack of clear insights for AI<br>- it seems likely culture is somehow big deal, but it is not clear how you would translate what happened to AI domain; if such thing can happen with AIs, if anything, it seems pushing more toward the discontinuity side, as the cultural search uncovered relatively fast multiple to many caches of negentropy<br>(- yes, obviously,&nbsp;<i>given culture</i>, it is important that you can transmit it to next generation, but it seems quite possible that for transferring&nbsp;<i>seed culture</i>&nbsp; the capacity channel you have via mirror neurons is more than enough)<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Not even approximately true</h3><p>In case you still believe the original post is still somehow approximately true, and the implications for AI progress still somehow approximately hold, I think it's important to basically un-learn that update. Quoting the original post:</p><blockquote><p>This last paragraph makes an extremely important claim that I want to ensure I convey fully:</p><p>- IF we understand the mechanism behind humanity's sharp left turn with respect to evolution</p><p>- AND that mechanism is inapplicable to AI development</p><p>- THEN, there's no reason to reference evolution at all when forecasting AI development rates, not as evidence for a sharp left turn, not as an \"illustrative example\" of some mechanism / intuition which might supposedly lead to a sharp left turn in AI development, not for anything.<br>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The conjunctive IF is a crux, and because <strong>we don't understand what happened with culture enough, the rest of the implication does not hold</strong>.<br><br>Consider a toy model counterfactual story: in a fantasy word, exactly repeating 128 bits of the first cultural replicator gives the human ancestor the power to cast a spell and gain +50% fitness advantage. &nbsp;Notice that this is a <i>different</i> story from \"overcoming channel to offspring capacity\" - you may be in the situation you have plenty of capacity, but don't have the 128 bits, and this is a situation much more prone to discontinuities.<br><br>Because it is not clear if reality was more like stumbling upon a specific string, or piece of code, or evolutionary ratchet, or something else, we don't know enough to rule out a metaphor suggesting discontinuities. &nbsp;</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Where I do agree with Quintin is scepticism toward some other stories attempting to draw some strong conclusion from human evolution, including strong conclusions about discontinuities.<br><br>I do think there is a reasonably good metaphor <i>genetic evolution</i> : <i>brains ~ base optimiser : mesa-optimiser, </i>but notice that evolution was able to keep brains mostly aligned for all other species except humans. &nbsp;Relation&nbsp;<i>human brain : cultural evolution</i> is very unlike&nbsp;<i>base optimiser : mesa-optimiser</i>.&nbsp;</p><h3>(Note on AI)</h3><p>While I mostly wanted to focus on the evolutionary part of the OP, I'm sceptical about the AI claims too. (Paraphrasing: <i>While the current process of AI training is not perfectly efficient, I don't think it has comparably sized overhangs which can be exploited easily.</i>)</p><p>In contrast, to me, it seems current way how AIs learn is very obviously inefficient, compared to what's possible. For example, explain to GPT4 something new, or make it derive something new. Open a new chat window, and probe if it now knows it.

The Scout Mindset is key to seeing the world clearly, having constructive disagreements and forming accurate models of the world. We need an increased understanding of what groups of people are more likely to possess the scout mindset, other correlated factors, how to measure it and how to increase the proportion of the population that have this mindset. Promoting these skills could improve society in a variety of ways. The work of scientists, researchers and other career paths oriented towards doing good would be enriched. Moreover, a greater understanding of how people make judgements will likely aid the development of strategies to improve people's rationality and decision making skills. Fields from education and healthcare to business could benefit.</p><h3>Research Aims</h3><p>Currently, there is a lack of a properly validated psychological scale to measure the scout mindset. From a scientific point of view, It would be helpful to derive some method of gauging the extent to which the scout mindset prevails in different people, as well as which characteristics or personality traits factor in. My project aim was to provide a start to exploring different methods of testing the characteristics of scout mindset and carrying out some of this research.</p><p>More specifically, I created two distinct psychological scales for measuring the Scout Mindset (one self-report and one using conditional reasoning), to examine the correlation between direct and indirect personality testing. In order to validate the scales, I gave each test to two groups of participants with different educational backgrounds (one consisting of Cambridge University undergraduate students, and one of people with no particular shared higher education), to see whether the results matched my expectations. My hypotheses were that the psychological scales would be somewhat correlated (which one is more accurate is another question to discuss) and that the university students should score more highly on both scales.</p><h2>Types of Psychological Scales Investigated</h2><h3>Self-Report Scale</h3><p>Self-report scales work on the basis of respondents evaluating and conveying their own characteristics. Often, they are presented with a statement or question about themselves, and they respond with the extent to which they agree on a scale of one to five.&nbsp;</p><p>These tests are not always the most accurate way to measure characteristics of people\u2019s identity, because they rely on people consciously analysing and accurately reporting their traits. A lack of self awareness, or a desire to appear a certain way, can easily lead to people providing responses that do not truly represent them. This risk is especially significant in a test for the scout mindset, since I wish to test self-awareness and bias themselves.</p><p>Some measures can be taken to avoid any biases and mistakes within self report surveys, which I have employed in my survey design. For example,&nbsp;reverse scoring&nbsp;is when in some of the questions (for example half), the direction of the scale runs the opposite way. For example, in a question that asks \u2018I am open to changing my beliefs\u2019, picking \u2018strongly agree\u2019 would provide the most points in a test that checks for open mindedness - reverse scoring would require a question that asks \u2018I am not open to changing my beliefs\u2019, and agreeing with this would lead to a low number of points. This technique tests for intra-rater reliability - that individuals\u2019 responses are cohesive. It ensures that people reply and represent themselves consistently, leading to accurate results. Otherwise, to give one example, the results would be skewed by someone who simply picks \u2018agree\u2019 for every option. Another method would be to rephrase questions in a more positive or negative way, which avoids&nbsp;response bias<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(people answering inaccurately in order to paint a more positive picture of themselves). For example, the question \u2018I am stubborn\u2019 could be rephrased to \u2018I stick to my opinions\u2019.</p><p>The items I selected to measure through a self-report scale were 'truth-seeking', 'open-mindedness' and 'questioning of beliefs and identity'. As described above, the questionnaire assessed these characteristics in a range of different ways. For example, for 'truth-seeking', my survey asked both \u2018Part of my identity is being a truth-seeker\u2019 and \u2018I value stability over exploration\u2019, demonstrating the reverse scoring method. For 'questioning of beliefs and identities' it included \u2018I often think about the uncertainty of my beliefs and assumptions.\u2019 and \u2018I stick to my personal identity no matter what\u2019, trying to avoid people presenting themselves in the way they thought they should. A factor that would have increased the reliability of the test was that most of the respondents were likely not well acquainted with the concept of the Scout Mindset, so there was a lower chance of them providing the answers that they thought they should.</p><h3>Conditional Reasoning Test</h3><p>The second method of psychological survey I will be investigating involves a more indirect investigation of personality tests. Implicit personality testing avoids pitfalls of self-report methods, since bias is less likely to occur and people are less able to manipulate results.</p><p>Conditional reasoning tests work by identifying the characteristic you want to test and the biases people are prone to based on this. Bias causes us to rationalise in order to justify our beliefs. So, people with a certain bias are more likely to reason a certain way. In the test, a concept or theory is introduced, and four possible responses are listed. Two are spoof answers, but the others are both logically plausible (just based on different assumptions). The one people intuitively pick reveals their motivated reasoning and underlying characteristics. Hence, conditional reasoning questions appear to test subjects\u2019 logical reasoning like an IQ test, but in reality work to identify respondents\u2019 root biases!</p><p>Trial studies show a good correlation between conditional reasoning tests and self report statistics. Implicit personality measurement techniques have even been shown to be better predictors (than self-report measures) of concrete things like career success.</p><p>Below is an example of a conditional reasoning question I used. Participants were presented with a few sentences on the topic of free will, and asked to identify a valid criticism of the argument. The analytical, Scout Mindset answer would be option three, which is based on the premise that we should evaluate our definitions and arguments. On the other hand, option two is also logically valid (again, depending on your definition of free will), except that it does not factor in the same mindset of truth-seeking and questioning beliefs which seems immediately obvious. Through questions like these, the hope was that participants would think they have identified the 'right' answer, regardless of which of the two logically viable options they picked, and so answer in a way that is representative of their beliefs and thinking.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/nzimrl6pnzwdqmj6hja2\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/x88gkc47piqdvebize4y 210w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/q53lds0sdaz7pt5voxhv 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/ijizn57uwejsmkuj8ca2 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/fklxs2alz0nludhlketk 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/j9leku5lsjbxhl5yglcg 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/bttvc4u5fhqnbmc2ongz 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/mwkz9jixxqam1riwtrm0 1470w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/zgmbehgoulu8isbvxqai 1680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/qm1hiukw3x1hddcoormx 1890w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/fvse2mloep50yshrqefw 2037w\"></p><h2>Validating the Psychological Scales</h2><p>Scout mindset is linked to bias and self-deception, so I decided to see whether conditional reasoning offers a more accurate way to test it (by checking whether results correlate with the self-report scale).&nbsp;</p><p>To validate the surveys, I decided to approach&nbsp;two groups of people with them. This way, if the relationship of results between groups followed the&nbsp;predicted outcome based on what I know about scout mindset, it would be some indication that the tests are valid. I selected a group of students attending Cambridge University (group 2). My hypothesis was that this group of individuals with a very good&nbsp;education, access to reading materials and an analytical mindset would score higher on my scout mindset metrics. The other sample I used was from a group of parents on Facebook (group 1), with no particular higher education in common.</p><p>I called the self-report, shorter answer survey 'survey 1' and the longer conditional reasoning test 'survey 2', giving both surveys to each group.</p><h2>Research Methods</h2><h3><br>Creating the Self-Report Scale</h3><p>The questions were:</p><ol><li>What is your age?</li><li>I mostly know all I need to know about the world already.</li><li>I value stability over exploration.</li><li>I enjoy learning by listening to opinions different to mine.</li><li>It is likely my beliefs about the world will change in the near future.</li><li>I believe I am self aware.</li><li>I stick to my personal identity no matter what.</li><li>Part of my identity is being a truth-seeker.</li><li>I often think about the uncertainty of my beliefs and assumptions.</li><li>I prefer to accept my family's/community's beliefs rather than question them.</li><li>I reflect over my actions and words often.</li><li>I am happy to adjust my plans in light of new information.</li><li>Failure has a deep discouraging effect on me.</li><li>Your intelligence is something about you that you cannot change very much.</li></ol><p>Crucially, several of these questions (1, 6, 13, 14) were not assigned point values. I simply wanted to investigate differences in age, reports of self-awareness and growth mindset between the two sample sets, to see whether there was a notable difference. Self-awareness, for example, could be interesting in that if people are more aware of their own biases, that should increase their levels of Scout Mindset. Additionally, there is a chance that growth mindset is correlated with Scout Mindset, if the latter is something learned and developed.</p><p>A&nbsp;pilot study using a small number of family and friends led to me rephrasing some of the questions in a more understandable and eloquent way, so that I was asking the questions that are most relevant. I ended up with a total of ten questions that were actually assessing Scout Mindset. I decided to keep the number of questions low, in order to hold the attention of as many respondents as possible, and make sure more people finish the survey.</p><p>I used Qualtrics<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to format the survey, which enabled me to assign points to the scales (I formatted them as matrix tables. For questions that aligned with the scout mindset, such as \u2018part of my identity involves being a truth seeker\u2019, \u2018strongly agree\u2019 gave 10 points and \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 gave 2, with five options total (strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree and strongly disagree). This way, the total possible points added up to a round 100.</p><h3>Creating the Conditional Reasoning Test</h3><p>Designing these questions was a challenge, since each begins with the introduction of a new idea or theory and I had to take the perspective of people with different mindsets/biases. It was difficult to phrase the questions in a way that would enable the participants to understand the concepts as quickly as possible and be able to reason through an answer to the question. This involved another pilot study which involved me making a lot of changes, as I asked people who were unfamiliar with the ideas and had to adapt a few of the sentences to make them easier to follow. The questions I ended up with were structured like the example I presented earlier - two spoof answers, one from the perspective of someone without Scout Mindset and one from the perspective of someone with Scout Mindset. Both of the latter were inductively logical.</p><p>The questions and answers:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/uan2gx73mwxriw6bht5f\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/tr6e5zriospnligqdvp8\"></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/vb8wtvdyds2u1uc9rs3j\"></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/clsdsl1mxzapkc0vecyb\"></p><h2>Results<br>&nbsp;</h2><h3>Self-Report Survey</h3><p>Group 1 - Parents:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/vri9tlmpgnfymirwqpd0\"></p><p>Group 2 - University Students:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/iihhqahjbotpsfjxw0ph\"></p><p>The&nbsp;standard deviation of Survey 1 was 6.64, whereas that of Survey 2 was 8.49 - which was quite a bit higher. This could perhaps suggest that the results of survey 2 would have been more significantly higher (or lower) if there was more agreement between respondents. It is also worth noting that the&nbsp;mode score of group 2 was 84, whereas for group 1 it was 74, which is a more notable difference. As it is, the average scout mindset score of group 2 was 5.56 points higher than that of group 1. I carried out a hypothesis test (seen below).</p><p>H0: The population mean scout mindset score of group one is 76.43</p><p>H1: The population mean scout mindset score of group two is lower than 76.43</p><p>Significance level = 5% (0.05)</p><p>Standard Deviation = 1.77 (8.49/root23)</p><p>Mean = 76.43</p><p>X~N(76.43,3.13)</p><p>p(X\u226470.78) = 0.0007075</p><p>0.0007075&gt;0.05</p><p>The test confirmed that this was a statistically significant result; Group 2 indeed had a higher average Scout Mindset score than Group 1.</p><p>Interestingly, however, there was not much of a correlation between&nbsp;growth mindset and the overall scout mindset scores between the groups. If anything, the group of were slightly more likely to report that they are not affected as strongly by failure, and that intelligence is not fixed. Perhaps this has something to do with the age difference between the groups, though - studies show that growth mindset consistently declines from early to late adolescence, and only rises in later adult life. With the&nbsp;self-awareness question though, group 2 described themselves as self-aware more consistently than group 1. Interestingly, zero participants in either group picked \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019 or \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 in response to the question \u2018I believe I am self aware. And, in group 2, zero participants picked \u2018neither agree nor disagree\u2019! The results of this do seem to correlate with the scout mindset relationship between the groups. But the extent to which this particular self-report question can be trusted is something to consider.&nbsp;</p><h3>Conditional Reasoning Test</h3><p>Group 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/pikkrmfiry9drbxuh41f\"></p><p>Group 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Dajsp3iGkgmrELHyF/uvflq6sofvbxmjvnv1yy\"></p><p>Survey 1 had a&nbsp;lower mean than survey 2 (61.43 vs. 77.39), as well as a&nbsp;lower median&nbsp;score (60 vs. 80). The&nbsp;mode of survey 2 was also much higher (90 vs. 60). Visually, survey 2 also seems to have a higher&nbsp;standard deviation - the results were more spread out - and a much larger range. This was perhaps due to the larger sample size (24 vs. 14). However, the large differences in score visible in all these measures of central tendency indicate a pretty&nbsp;reliable trend: the average points earned by group 2 were larger than group 1. All in all, there was a&nbsp;correlation between the relationship of group 1 and group 2 scores for survey 1 and survey 2, meaning survey 2 seems to have been a successful measure of scout mindset (or at least thought patterns related to the scout mindset). Moreover, there was a significant divide between the responses of the two groups for many of the conditional reasoning questions, and a much greater proportion of people in group 1 seemed to be picking the non scout mindset answers than in group 2. This is promising, since it means that the&nbsp;question design was effective to some extent - it achieved the differentiation I was hoping for.</p><h2>Evaluation</h2><h3>Validity</h3><p>There was&nbsp;correlation between the two surveys (showing similar trends within each group) - the total score for each survey was 100, and the mean scores for each group were similar in both surveys they did. Moreover, the correctly predicted difference in results between the groups (that Cambridge students would score higher) indicates that the surveys could potentially be&nbsp;valid measures of the scout mindset. This is promising, since the&nbsp;success of conditional reasoning means it could be incredibly helpful in measuring these kinds of things in the future, especially if even more time goes into devising insightful questions.</p><h3>Further Research Needed</h3><p>We have concluded that there is some correlation between the results of the two tests. However, from a practical point of view, the next step needs to be figuring out which of the two surveys (conditional reasoning or self-report) is actually more accurate, since this will determine whether further research should go into investigating indirect methods of personality measurement - there is no point if direct measures are just as accurate. This could be done through finding some ground measure of the Scout Mindset, taken to be truth, and comparing it to my results. One option for this is a more subjective, qualitative method of analysis, such as observation of behaviour in individuals. Additional resources would be needed.</p><p>In the future, a number of additional techniques could also be implemented to check how representative my results are (which is necessary), and make future progress. The main problem perhaps was&nbsp;sample size - I was limited in time and access to respondents (especially of the groups I wanted). For survey 1, I only managed to receive 23 responses from group 1 and 42 from group 2. For survey 2 I received 14 responses from group 1 and 23 from group 2. This means there were 102 responses in total. In an ideal world, there should have been at least 400 participants in the surveys, in order to ensure reliable results. The results I did get should definitely be tested to see if they are&nbsp;repeatable or reproducible - this is something I can do in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Factor analysis&nbsp;should be carried out on my results - grouping questions with similar trends in responses to analyse which questions are most useful. I would like to ask even more questions on a greater range of scout mindset traits. Then I will identify questions for which responses are naturally clustered, with a high correlation between answers. Clustering retrospectively is how the big five personality test was developed (you\u2019re only really asking five questions, but they are asked in different ways to confirm results). Then, clean-up can be done after testing the survey - getting rid of irrelevant or only weakly related factors in order to make the questioning more precise.</p><p>Checking for&nbsp;validity&nbsp;is something I think I can do more work on - to check the tests are measuring exactly what I mean to measure. For example, a test is good if it correlates well with existing measures. In this case I am measuring something new, but the Scout Mindset is linked to other traits for which validated scales exist (such as open mindedness on the big five personality test). So, testing another established scale alongside my questions to check for correlation&nbsp; will help (for example, Tetlock states that there is a correlation between open mindedness, which factors into the scout mindset, and people\u2019s forecasting ability). Additionally, It would be good to do further testing on whether results show a different trend for researchers/experts (especially forecasters), if I can get access to these. I will also need a way of determining whether I have added anything new to existing scales, and am therefore testing something worthwhile (incremental predictive validity).</p><p>An interesting question for further research would be whether the difference in results was caused by&nbsp;nature or nurture. The higher level of Scout Mindset for university students could indicate that resources, upbringing and access to high quality teaching lead to a Scout Mindset, which would mean that it is something learned rather than innate and can be promoted more throughout the general public! Equally, however, it could be concluded that the people going to Cambridge University have been born with this nature, and the Scout Mindset inevitably comes along with the other aspects of their mindset and abilities (rather than being developed as a by-product). Further research is needed to gain understanding of how factors that contribute to the Scout Mindset develop<strong>.</strong></p><h2>References</h2><p>Boateng, G. O., Neilands, T. B., Frongillo, E.

It solves <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/\">existential risk</a>, develops molecular nanotechnology and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/atomically-precise-manufacturing/\">atomically precise manufacturing</a>, masters biotechnology, and turns itself sustainable: turns half of the planet into a wilderness preserve that can evolve on its own, keeping to the other half where you have high material standards in a totally sustainable way that can keep on going essentially as long as the biosphere is going. And long before that, of course, people starting to take steps to maintain the biosphere by putting up a solar shield, et cetera. And others, of course, go off \u2014 first settling the solar system, then other solar systems, then other galaxies \u2014 building this super-civilisation in the nearby part of the universe that can keep together against the expansion of the universe, while others go off to really far corners so you can be totally safe that intelligence and consciousness remains somewhere, and they might even try different social experiments.</p><p>But you could imagine another future: In the near future, we develop ways of doing <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/whole-brain-emulation/\">brain emulation</a> and we turn ourselves into a software species. Maybe not everybody; there are going to be stragglers who are going to maintain the biosphere on the Earth and going to be frowning at those crazies that in some sense committed suicide by becoming software. The software people are, of course, just going to be smiling at them, but thinking, \u201cWe\u2019ve got the good deal. We got on this infinite space we can define endlessly.\u201d</p><p>And quite soon they realise they need more compute, so they turn a few other planets of the solar system into computing centres. But much of a cultural development happens in the virtual space, and if that doesn\u2019t need to expand too much, you might actually end up with a very small and portable humanity. I did a calculation some years ago that if you actually covered a part of the Sahara Desert with solar panels and use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot_cellular_automaton\">quantum dot cellular automaton</a> computing, you could keep mankind in an uploaded form running there indefinitely, with a rather minimal impact on the biosphere. So in that case, maybe the future of humanity is instead going to be a little black square on a continent, and not making much fuss in the outside universe.</p><p>The thing that interests me is that I like open-ended futures. I think it\u2019s kind of worrisome if you come up with an idea of a future that is so perfected, but it requires that everybody do the same thing. That is pretty unlikely, given how we are organised as people right now, and systems that force us to do the same thing are terrifyingly dangerous. It might be a useful thing to have a singleton system that somehow keeps us from committing existential risk suicide, but if that impairs our autonomy, we might actually have lost quite a lot of value. It might still be worth it, but you need to think carefully about the tradeoff. And if its values are bad, even if it\u2019s just subtly bad, that might mean that we lose most of the future.</p><p>I also think that there might be really weird futures that we can\u2019t think well about. Right now we have certain things that we value and evaluate as important and good: we think about the good life, we think about pleasure, we think about justice. We have a whole set of things that are very dependent on our kind of brains. Those brains didn\u2019t exist a few million years ago. You could make an argument that some higher apes actually have a bit of a primitive sense of justice. They get very annoyed when there is unfair treatment. But as you go back in time, you find simpler and simpler organisms and there is less and less of these moral values. There might still be pleasure and pain. So it might very well be that the fishes swimming around the oceans during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian\">Silurian</a> already had values and disvalues. But go back another few hundred million years and there might not even have been that. There was still life, which might have some intrinsic value, but much less of it.</p><p>Where I\u2019m getting at with this is that value might have emerged in a stepwise way: We started with plasma near the Big Bang, and then eventually got systems that might have intrinsic value because of complex life, and then maybe systems that get intrinsic value because they have consciousness and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia\">qualia</a>, and maybe another step where we get justice and thinking about moral stuff. Why does this process stop with us? It might very well be that there are more kinds of value waiting in the wings, so to say, if we get brains and systems that can handle them.</p><p>That would suggest that maybe in 100 million years we find the next level of value, and that\u2019s actually way more important than the previous ones all taken together. And it might not end with that mysterious whatever value it is: there might be other things that are even more important waiting to be discovered. So this raises this disturbing question that we actually have no clue how the universe ought to be organised to maximise value or doing the right thing, whatever it is, because we might be too early on. We might be like a primordial slime thinking that photosynthesis is the biggest value there is, and totally unaware that there could be things like awareness.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The (far) future of war</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Anders Sandberg:</strong> Why does anybody go to war? There is actually a serious debate about the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/chris-blattman-five-reasons-wars-happen/\">rationality of war</a> and there is serious disagreement about the motives. It\u2019s a bit unclear to me whether you would see advanced civilisations going to war. I think you sometimes can sketch out possibilities. You could imagine the radical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_utilitarianism\">negative utilitarian</a> civilisation not wanting that other civilisation to have a lot of resources because they are actually causing pain and suffering, even though they are saying that on average they\u2019re making things better. They would have a reason to try to remove resources from that pain-inducing civilisation, and they would make very bad neighbours.</p><p>Now, the really interesting question is: How much is there an attacker-versus-defender advantage in this kind of advanced future? Right now, if somebody\u2019s sitting on Mars and you\u2019re going to war against them, it\u2019s very hard to hit them. You don\u2019t have a weapon that can hit them very well. But in theory, if you fire a missile, after a few months, it\u2019s going to arrive and maybe hit them, but they have a few months to move away. Distance actually makes you safer: if you spread out in space, it\u2019s actually very hard to hit you. So it seems like you get a defence-dominant situation if you spread out sufficiently far. But if you\u2019re in Earth orbit, everything is close, and the lasers and missiles and the debris are a terrible danger, and everything is moving very fast.</p><p>So my general conclusion has been that war looks unlikely on some size scales but not on others. It might be that as you move out into space, it becomes at first much harder. But then you learn how to move better over interstellar distances, which means that each solar system is actually easily accessible. And the solar system is hard to have several parties inside that fight each other. Once you reach the galactic scale, it might again take so much time to set up a conflict. But again, it might vary. It\u2019s very unclear, and it actually depends partially on physics.</p><p>On the largest scales, the universe looks very defence-dominant simply because everything is moving slowly apart from each other, so you can\u2019t even send light signals telling other parts of your civilisation, \u201cWe declared war on the Zorgons.\u201d So it might be that the universe at the very largest scale is very peaceful. Even a doomsday weapon like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay\">false vacuum decay</a> is only a local problem; it cannot actually destroy everything simply because everything is expanding apart.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Black hole power</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> After the era of stars \u2014 the Stelliferous Era, as it\u2019s called \u2014 so after most of the stars are burned out, and the universe is kind of getting very cold, what options remain for extracting lots of energy to do things?</p><p><strong>Anders Sandberg:</strong> At that point, there is still a fair bit of fusion energy you could get, because there are a lot of brown dwarfs that are still hanging around. They just were too light to ever turn into a star. So in theory, you could mine them for hydrogen and burn that if you have a fusion reactor.</p><p>The funny thing is that also, in the really long run, they are also randomly occasionally bumping into each other and forming little red dwarf stars. That\u2019s a very inefficient process, but over very long time periods it actually does happen. But I think intelligent life would not be patient enough for that.</p><p>So what you probably want to do is that you burn the fusible elements, either in your fusion reactor or by dropping them on top of, for example, a white dwarf star or a neutron star. This has a bit of a limit, because once you add enough, the white dwarf star collapses gravitational and turns into a supernova. So there is that slight environmental problem.</p><p>The best method, in my opinion, is to use black holes. I\u2019m very fond of black hole power. And I am assuming that maybe in a few trillion years I\u2019m going to be dealing with protesters saying, \u201cNo black holes in our neighbourhood,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t build that power plant, Anders.\u201d But they\u2019re actually lovely. Black holes have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk\">accretion disks</a> when they suck in matter. Or rather, it\u2019s not that they suck in matter \u2014 that\u2019s kind of a picture we get from science fiction \u2014 they\u2019re just an object with gravity like anything else. But what happens when you put a lot of junk around a black hole? They form a disk, and the friction between parts of the disk heats up the matter. That means it radiates away energy and gets more tightly bound and slowly spirals in. There is also some angular momentum leaking out at the sides where some dust gets thrown off.</p><p>The effect of this is that the potential energy of that junk \u2014 and it can be anything: burnt-out stars, old cars, old space probes, planets you don\u2019t care for, et cetera \u2014 gets ground down, and the potential energy gets released as radiation. So now you can build a Dyson sphere, a very big one, around this whole system, and get all of that energy.</p><p>How much total mass energy can you get? It turns out it\u2019s almost up to 40% for a rapidly spinning black hole. The exact limit depends on where the inner edge of the accretion disk is, because eventually you get close enough that you essentially fall straight in without releasing any more energy, and that gets trapped inside the black hole. Now, converting 40% of the mass energy of old cars and space probes into energy is kind of astonishing: that is way more effective than fusion. So actually, the stars might not be the biggest energy source around. We might actually be able to make the galaxies shine much more if we dump things into black holes and gather that energy.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Grabby aliens</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> If life spreads through the universe, the overwhelming majority of beings will live in this totally different world very far in the future \u2014 well, not necessarily that far in the future, but in a world where complex life is spread across most of the accessible universe. So our position will seem shockingly strange and really early. What\u2019s your favourite explanation for how it is that we find ourselves in this unusual and, in some sense, arguably kind of privileged position?</p><p><strong>Anders Sandberg:</strong> I think this is a very important and tricky question. It\u2019s also worth noticing that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Ages_of_the_Universe#Stelliferous_Era\">Stelliferous Era</a>, where there are stars, is going to last maybe 10 to 100 trillion years \u2014 and we are in the first 13 billion years. Again, what\u2019s going on here? Why are we really early? There I think you can make an argument that most of the biosphere years you could imagine in the future are going to be around little red dwarf stars that might not be as habitable as we currently think they could be. So maybe actually we are close to peak habitability for organic life in the universe, and we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised about that.</p><p>But still, if technological civilisation spreads, then of course those red dwarf stars are going to be totally good real estate. And you could argue that maybe this is evidence that actually nobody\u2019s going to spread across the universe. Actually, this is it. This early part of the Stelliferous Era is where intelligence shows up, and maybe you can\u2019t spread for some weird reason across the universe.</p><p>But another interesting answer, which I\u2019m rather fond of, is Robin Hanson\u2019s <a href=\"https://grabbyaliens.com/\">grabby aliens</a> idea. I\u2019m particularly fond of it because I almost had the idea but didn\u2019t. I had all the pieces \u2014 I have a chapter in the book where I\u2019m talking about alien intelligence, various explanations, expansion patterns, and all of that \u2014 I had all the pieces laid out in front of me. But Robin actually was the one putting it together, and said if civilisations start spreading out, presumably in the areas where they have spread, new intelligent species don\u2019t arise. It\u2019s just going to be whoever had gone there, and whatever they do. We are not in one of those zones.</p><p>Now, if you look at the history of the universe, you have this kind of phase transition of a universe with no intelligent life spreading; a relatively short period where there is a fair bit of intelligent life in transit, expanding out; and then eventually they meet each other and all parts of space are now settled. That means that we are in this kind of weird position that we\u2019re quite close to that limit. And if there are many hard evolutionary transitions to get to intelligence, you should expect intelligence to show up as late as possible in the history of a biosphere. I have some papers to that effect, so I\u2019m totally in agreement with this.</p><p>In that case, we should expect to be relatively close to this transition. This transition is still probably billions of years long, so we\u2019re talking astronomical timescales. But I like the grabby aliens argument because it both explains why we haven\u2019t seen any aliens \u2014 the aliens that are quiet are hard to see, they\u2019re not expanding, they\u2019re just sitting there enjoying life; and the expansive ones, we haven\u2019t met with them yet because we just started expanding about this time, and we might start noticing them in a billion years or so when we might also be expanding \u2014 and this also explains why we are around now.</p><p>It still has this big problem: Why aren\u2019t we part of some posthuman super-civilisation after we contacted the grabby aliens in a few billion years? And maybe the answer is maybe we all form one big group intellect, and out of the trillion human beings that ever existed, the group intellect that exists forever after that time is just one of us. The probability is one in a trillion of being the group intellect. So we found ourselves being among the more normal boring humans before contact. That might be an explanation, although I\u2019m not convinced by it.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Chances that aliens have actually visited Earth</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Anders Sandberg:</strong> I looked a little bit into it, and I\u2019m not particularly convinced. So, UAPs: Why are we seeing these blurry, weird things? There could be a lot of different reasons for that, and people immediately latch on to one possible explanation: It\u2019s aliens. Why aren\u2019t they talking about angels, or superintelligent squid from the bottom of the ocean? There is a very long list of possible explanations, including the super boring: there are optical effects in the complex lens systems on modern warplanes.</p><p>In some cases, footage of UAPs have turned out to have very weird natural explanations. Like in one case, it was a Batman-logo-shaped balloon up among the clouds. What\u2019s the probability of even seeing that from a plane? That\u2019s kind of low. There is a lot of strange random stuff. So when you see something strange, you need to update your beliefs. And if you try to be a good Bayesian about it, you need to check what hypothesis is this compatible with? So if I see a blurry spot of light moving very fast, it both fits with aliens having a super-advanced spacecraft, but it also fits quite well with some weird problem with my optics \u2014 as well as a long list of the other weird possibilities, ranging from the squid over to that I\u2019m actually hallucinating.</p><p>Now, if I see a little green man on my lawn telling me, \u201cTake me to your leader,\u201d suddenly a lot of those other explanations go away. Not all of them. The probability of me going crazy is still embarrassingly high. So I should probably ask my friends, \u201cDo you see that little green guy too?\u201d And if they all agree, then the probability of all us going crazy simultaneously is low. There is still some possibility for a prank or something, but you need rather specific evidence. Seeing weird things moving around doesn\u2019t tell us very much. And I think, unfortunately, we latch on to this explanation.</p><p>The fact that there are hearings and there are surprisingly credible sources saying this, I think these credible sources are an interesting thing to check. How likely is it that they know what they\u2019re talking about? Because there has been a lot of very crazy stuff going on in the US intelligence and military establishment too, driven by people with various bees in their bonnets about particular threats.</p><p>So I\u2019m not terribly convinced by this. The really interesting issue is, of course, it\u2019s still not implausible that advanced civilisations exist. And if they wanted to hide, could they hide from us? And I think if you\u2019re an advanced [enough] civilisation and have your act together, you could hide really well. So in that case, why would we be seeing blurry things moving around? On the other hand, you could also imagine that maybe you had an advanced civilisation, but there are teenagers taking the saucer out for a spin \u2014 and they are trying to keep a non-interference activity going, but there are these people messing around, which would of course also explain a lot of the stupidities with many of these UAP observations.</p><p>But I don\u2019t think that sounds super plausible, actually. I think it\u2019s a bit more binary than that. Still, I think it\u2019s worth recognising that the world is strange, and full of a lot of unlikely and strange things. The bigger our world gets, the more things just out of sheer randomness that is just simply unbelievable will just keep on increasing. So it\u2019s going to be hard to filter all of this.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The lifespan of civilisations</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> A listener wrote in with another question that\u2019s a bit related to the book. It was a question of do civilisations eventually decay and become more likely over time to break apart. \u201cI saw that you\u2019d published a <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003331384-24/lifespan-civilizations-anders-sandberg\">book chapter</a> titled \u2018The lifespan of civilizations: Do societies \u201cage,\u201d or is collapse just bad luck?\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t get the book. What\u2019s the answer? Do societies get more likely to collapse the longer they last for?\u201d</p><p><strong>Anders Sandberg:</strong> I don\u2019t think so. And that is actually the point of that chapter, which is a spinoff from my big book, because when I was going through the calculations of how to move galaxies and do all of this stuff, I realised that maybe the big limitation here is not physics, but society. If you need to have a project team that keeps the move of a galaxy going for a billion years, how likely is that to last? I mean, most organisations don\u2019t last very long in the present.</p><p>And indeed, if civilisations inexorably collapse after a while because they age and become decadent, then maybe that is the fundamental limitation of how grand of futures we could possibly have. So I started reading macro history, and realised macro historians make very compelling stories about why civilisations rise and fall and why history has a certain shape, but they\u2019re all different and they\u2019re all kind of contradictory. So I became a bit nervous about trusting any of them.</p><p>So then I just took a lot of data and started doing curve fitting to try to see the survival curves. And the thing I found that was the best fit I could find for civilisations was exponential decay. There is a kind of time constant for how likely a civilisation is going to be around for, there is a kind of half-life for civilisations. But the risk of a civilisation collapsing doesn\u2019t seem to increase with time, which is the important part. If there was some kind of decadence building up or maybe some environmental debt or something else, then you should expect that over time it became more likely that it crashed.</p><p>Or you could have that there may be some childhood disease of civilisations, that when they first show up they have a high likelihood of crashing. We don\u2019t see that. That might partially be that we have a selection bias: that we don\u2019t think about stuff that crashed immediately as a civilisation. But this seems to apply also to other forms of polities, like kingdoms in Europe and various political states. In the case of corporations, it\u2019s kind of well known that they also have a fairly constant hazard rate, except for the startup phase where they\u2019re very vulnerable. It\u2019s fairly constant, except for the very oldest corporations in the world that tend to be very stable: typically a Japanese inn at a hot spring or some brewery or something exploits that resource that people always will want to have.</p><p>So using this data, my conclusion seems to be that civilisations probably collapse because of bad luck rather than there is something bad building up. Now, that is still an interesting open question: Why do we have this bad luck? Is it just that it\u2019s very unlikely events that conspire to bring things down, or is it that there is something intrinsic? And even worse: of course bad luck is rather hard to defend against. You can imagine a Dyson sphere covered with rabbits\u2019 feet and horseshoes, hoping to ward off bad luck. But that\u2019s unlikely to work. Probably the best way of warding off bad luck is having multiple copies, having backup civilisations \u2014 and if one crashes, the other ones shake their heads, pick up the pieces, and resettle that part of space.</p><p>A lot of people talk about the flourishing of civilisation or a young civilisation or an old civilisation \u2014 and we quite often anthropomorphise societies and civilisations way more than is good. Rousseau was talking about \u201cdiseases of civilisation,\u201d and he was literally thinking that some bad things in society were like a literal disease in the body of a civilisation. Once you start thinking like that, of course ageing seems to be reasonable. But it\u2019s worth noting that a lot of multicellular life doesn\u2019t age.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Humble futures vs. grand futures</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Anders Sandberg:</strong> It\u2019s very interesting to think about not grand futures, but humble futures \u2014 because a lot of people are totally cold to the idea of moving galaxies and having trillions of beings in some weird astronomical future. I usually express it like they want to have this nice little <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotswolds\">Cotswolds</a> village \u2014 where their friends are playing cricket, they\u2019re having tea with the vicar, and having sensible social relations with normal people. And yeah, it needs to be sustainable and peaceful and all of that, but you don\u2019t need an entire galaxy to do that. I think there is a lot of truth to that. This is quite close to what most people think is a good life, and it\u2019s certainly much easier to think about virtue ethics in that little British village, or whatever the Swedish or Chinese counterparts are.</p><p>The real question is, of course, would it be good to just have that? I tend to think that we are so uncertain about normativity that we should hedge our bets. I think it\u2019s actually probably a better idea that some people are living in these nice little humble futures and others go off and terraform planets and build Dyson spheres and whatnot \u2014 because we might not know which one of these is the right one, but we might be able to get the right one by having a big palette of possibilities.</p><p>The real problem is when they impinge on each other: the nice little village might not want their night sky scarred by having megastructures flying around there, so there might have to be some deal about leaving the sky dark, et cetera. There are some people who are very upset that anybody in the world might be having fun in the way they morally disapprove of. So they have nosy preferences, and they\u2019re of course going to be very annoying neighbours. And we need to resolve these kinds of problems.</p><p>That gets into this issue of how do you make a cosmopolitan ethics, especially if humanity becomes much more diverse? But I\u2019m kind of cheered by the fact that the Amish seem to be doing pretty well. They are living in some sense in a humble world, deliberately making a humble society, but it\u2019s also being protected by one of the least humble societies you can possibly imagine: the United States. And they have a right kind of relationship to the outside. Over the decades there have been interesting discussions about both how to prevent too many young people going off into the sinful outer world and realising that this is actually quite wonderful, and instead setting up things so they can both maintain each other. And it works, partially because the values of the United States and the rights catalogued in the laws and the rule of law can act to protect it. You can maintain humility and a humble future inside something much more grand.</p><p>I guess this might also be the solution for how to get virtue in these grand futures. It might actually start out at small nuclei. You actually don\u2019t want to go maximise the universe: you want to ensure that this nuclear virtue, that if they\u2019re really good and attractive, might expand \u2014 instead of saying first we optimise everything for it.</p><p>So this gets to one of my big things, and that is we need to have an open future. Existential risk is an ultimate closed future. It\u2019s the end of history. But you can also imagine futures that are too limited, where there are too few possibilities and certain choices and options are not there. And I think we need to safeguard against those, even if they\u2019re otherwise pretty nice futures.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "o2ERcHHFBmbBn9Miu", "title": "Slaughter of farmed seabass and seabream in Europe: Literature review", "postedAt": "2023-10-09T23:03:29.179Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>We are beginning a new project that aims to work towards humane slaughter of sea bass and sea bream in Europe.

Description of industry in priority countries</strong></h1><h2><strong>2.1 Turkey</strong></h2><p>In 2019, aquaculture enterprises in Turkey produced a total of 137,400 tonnes (t) of sea bass and 99,730t of sea bream (3). These two species are mostly farmed using floating cages (96% of production), though a minority of production involves earthen ponds (4%) (3).</p><p>For sea bass and sea bream, there were 410 enterprises in 2018 (excluding hatcheries) (3). Of these 410 enterprises, 237 were sea cages (accounting for 96% of production) and 173 were earthen ponds (accounting for 4% of production). This means that sea cage enterprises tend to have relatively large volumes of production, with the mean sea cage enterprise producing around 1,040 t.</p><p>Most of the sea bass and sea bream produced in Turkey is exported. For the two species combined, Turkey exports approximately 75% of production. The major destination countries are Italy, Spain, France and other EU Member States (4), with a small amount of production going to the Far East, Middle East, Asia and the Americas (3).</p><p>The key pieces of legislation governing the welfare of fish in aquaculture in Turkey are:</p><ul><li>Fisheries Law No. 1380. An important regulation in this law requires that new aquaculture facilities be planned to minimise their environmental impact.</li><li>The Aquaculture Regulation, published in the Official Gazette No. 25507 dated 29.06.2004.</li><li>Circular on welfare of fish in aquaculture (2018/3), which is based on the Aquaculture Regulation. \"This circular aims to determine the minimum standards of rearing, care and welfare of fish grown for food production and other purposes taking into account general biological characteristics and to harmonise the national regulation with the European Union Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes.\" (3).</li></ul><p>Since late 2020, new farms can only be established 500+ metres from shore (1,250 metres for sensitive marine areas) at a depth of 30+ metres (40 metres for sensitive marine areas) (3). This means that Turkish fish farms would be classified as \"coastal\" or \"off-coast\".</p><h2><strong>2.2 Greece</strong></h2><p>In 2019, aquaculture enterprises in Greece produced a total of 41,300 tonnes (t) of sea bass and 55,500t of sea bream (5). These two species are farmed using inshore floating sea cages (6). These cages are much closer to the shore than in Italy.</p><p>For sea bass and sea bream, there were 347 enterprises in 2018, with an average of eight full-time equivalent employees per enterprise (8). Most enterprises belong to larger parent companies (6,8). The industry is continuing this consolidation into larger companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the sea bass and sea bream produced in Greece is exported. For the two species combined, Greece exported 88,700 t in 2019 (9). This represents about 92% of production. The major destination countries are Italy (41% of exports), Spain (21%), and France (11%). Overall, 95% of exports are destined for the EU, and 5% are destined for third countries.</p><p>On average, Greek fish farms are 68 metres from the coastline (10,11). This means that Greek production would be mostly \"coastal\".</p><p>he Greek aquaculture industry has expressed interest in fish welfare. The Federation of Greek Maricultures participates in programs to research fish welfare and establish guidelines. The 'Fish from Greece' certification scheme, which is widespread, certifies products according to six pillars - one of these pillars is fish welfare (see https://fishfromgreece.com). There has been initial, experimental interest in electrical stunning before slaughter (12).&nbsp; However, despite the industry's concern for fish welfare, the industry has not yet adopted a humane slaughter method like electrical stunning (12).</p><p>Charity Entrepreneurship is currently incubating a new organisation working on fish welfare in Greece. Their research report contains the following information that is relevant here (13):</p><ul><li>There are some pessimistic signs about the tractability of fish welfare work in Greece: farmers are concerned that they can't fit electrical stunners on the boats they currently use to harvest fish; the government seems to be pushing towards deregulation of the industry and so might not have a lot of appetite for welfare legislation; and Greece is generally seen as a laggard in the EU when it comes to animal welfare. The government is \"currently trying to deregulate the market as they are competing with Turkey to try and capture the American market and so they are attracting American investment to set up aquaculture farms and trying to attract funding for facilities that wouldn't be allowed anywhere else on terms that are very friendly to investors.\"</li><li>There are also some optimistic side: the Greek government took the lead in developing fish welfare guidelines which were adopted by the EU Platform on Animal Welfare; and technical experts in Greece have worked with the sector to produce detailed guidance specifically for seabass and sea bream and so perhaps they would have interest in working to improve this welfare.</li><li>\"Greece holds the presidency of the Council of the EU in July-December 2027. It will not hold this presidency again for 13.5 years. This would be the time that it would be able to have the biggest influence of EU policy and agenda setting, so it would be great if we could get Greek policymakers on the side of fish welfare and have some fish welfare legislation enshrined in legislation in Greece before this.\"</li></ul><h2><br><strong>2.3 Egypt</strong></h2><p>In 2017, aquaculture enterprises in Egypt produced a total of 30,700 tonnes (t) of sea bass and 35,200t of sea bream (14). Egypt is unique in that the sea bass and sea bream industry takes place almost entirely in earthen ponds (15). Almost all of these farms are small- or medium-scale (15). Sea bass and sea bream account for only about 2% of aquaculture production (15). Most production takes place on Egypt's northern coast in the Mediterranean, with the majority taking place in Damietta Governorate and some in other areas (e.g. Alexandria, Ismaila, Port Said) (15).</p><p>The government of Egypt intends to expand production substantially by establishing new, large-scale production enterprises (16). In 2016, it was reported that Egypt was building new farms in the Suez Canal, Kafr El Sheikh, and East Port Said (17). These three projects would have a combined annual production capacity of 400,000 t of fish, including sea bass and sea bream.</p><p>Most of the sea bass and sea bream produced in Egypt is consumed domestically. Exports are modest. In 2015, 25,000 t of saltwater fish were exported, though most of these were sea bass or sea bream (17). Egypt cannot export fish to the EU, as Egypt does not comply with European Council Directive 91/493/EEC on health conditions for the production and placing on the market of fishery products (15).&nbsp;</p><p>Egypt has a number of laws regulating the environmental impact of aquaculture (15).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2.4 Spain</strong></h2><p>In 2017, aquaculture enterprises in Spain produced a total of 17,700 tonnes (t) of sea bass and 17,000t of sea bream (14). These two species are mostly farmed using floating sea cages (90% of production), though a minority of production takes place in wetlands/brackish water (10%) (8). Sea bass and sea bream are the main species produced by Spain in terms of value (19), and most of the production takes place in the coast of the Mediterranean (8).</p><p>For sea bass and sea bream, there were 24 enterprises in 2018 (excluding hatcheries) (8). This means that Spain has a mean production volume of 1,270 t, higher than any other country we consider in-depth in this report (Turkey, Greece, Egypt, and Italy).</p><p>Annually, Spain exports around 13,000 t of sea bass and sea bream, while it imports around 29,000 t (20,21). This means that most (~60%) of the country's production is consumed domestically and that imported products make up almost half of the domestic market.</p><p>On average, Spanish fish farms are 1,106 metres from the coastline (10). This means that most fish farms would be classified as \"off-coast\", though there is a lot of variation and some farms would be classified as \"coastal\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>2.5 Italy</strong></h2><p>Most fish farmed in Italy belong to freshwater species. In comparison, there is a small amount of fish farming in marine (i.e., saltwater) farms. The key marine species farmed in Italy are seabass and seabream (23).</p><p>There is a complete lack of legal provisions detailing how fish should be treated. The main regulatory authority for aquaculture is the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest Policies (24); however, the focus of that Ministry is environmental sustainability and economic development, rather than fish welfare (25,26). Existing international guidelines fare no better, with international codes of conduct failing to provide any meaningful consideration for fish welfare (27). Even existing protections for the welfare of animals at the time of killing fail to extend to fish. To illustrate, the European Union's Regulation (EC) 1099/2009 (28)&nbsp; provides some guidelines for the slaughter of animals, but justifies a lack of recommendations for fish on the basis of \u2018a need for further scientific opinion and economic evaluation in this field\u2019. The lack of legal provisions means that farmers are incentivised to make husbandry decisions according to economic motivations, rather than the welfare of the fish.</p><p>Seabass and seabream are the two major marine fish species farmed in Italy. The majority (ca. 78%) of sea bass and sea bream are farmed in intensive, floating sea cages&nbsp;[2,7]. The size of the marine cage depends on the life stage of the fish and the water depth. During the grow out phase, the cages typically have a diameter of 30-50m and a net depth of between 12-20m (29). Beyond this, some are farmed in land-based systems (ca. 16%), and a small minority are farmed in wetlands (ca. 6%) [8], specifically in extensive brackish water 'valli', ponds, and lagoons. This generally occurs off the northern Adriatic regions and in Sardinia, Sicily, Apulia and Lazio (30).</p><p>Annually, Italy exports around 8,000 t of sea bass and sea bream, while it imports around 77,000 t (20,21). This means that most (~60%) of the country's production is consumed domestically and that imported products dominate the domestic market. Therefore, it is also important to consider the conditions in which these fish are raised in other countries, particularly Greece.</p><p>On average, Italian fish farms are 991 metres from the coastline (10). This means that most fish farms would be classified as \"off-coast\", though there is a lot of variation and some farms would be classified as \"coastal\".</p><h1><strong>3. Slaughter methods</strong></h1><h2><strong>3.1 Current slaughter method: Asphyxiation</strong></h2><p>Currently, almost all sea bass and sea bream are killed by live chilling (immersion in ice/ice slurry slurry), followed by gill cutting (12). This method is chosen primarily due to its ease of use. Unfortunately, this method involves prolonged periods of consciousness, during which fish experience intense suffering (32). Studies on the time taken for the fish to become unconscious report a wide range, with fish remaining conscious for between 5 and 40 minutes (33\u201336). These findings are supported by studies in other species (37). During this period, the fish show signs of immense suffering, including vigorous attempts to escape (35,36). Research has documented brain activity after fish had stopped moving, indicating that ice slurry causes fish to become paralysed rather than stunned - this means that fish likely experience suffering well after movement has stopped (38).</p><h2><strong>3.2 Electrical stunning</strong></h2><p>Electrical stunning involves exposing fish to an electric current to rapidly render the fish unconscious, either temporarily or permanently.</p><p>Electrical stunning comes in two forms: in-water and in-air. The efficacy of each depends on the electrical current and duration of the stun. Either method can potentially be followed by a secondary killing method or an additional, percussive stun. To illustrate, sea bass and sea bream are raised in cages and captured using brailing or pumping. (Brailing involves the use of a large net that is hoisted by a crane (34).) Where fish are captured by brailing, the more appropriate stunning system is in-water; fish are placed in a tank in batches and exposed to an electric field until they are permanently insensible. Likewise, where fish are captured by pumping, in-water stunning can also be used. Fish are passed along a channel through which an electrical current is passed (39). In-air stunning can be used in either case but requires the fish to be dewatered beforehand. Previous experiments by Tesco for their supply chain in the UK found that pumping systems were preferable as it reduced crowding, and thus the stress on the fish (40), while maintaining a similar rate efficiency in moving fish (41).</p><p>Several studies have found that electrical stunning produces immediate loss of consciousness or sensibility in seabass (35,42,43) and seabream (37). The use of higher currents and a longer duration generally have greater efficacy and result in longer periods of insensibility (39,44,45). It is important that current and duration are carefully selected based on the method of electrical stunning, the method of handling, and the subsequent killing method will be used.</p><p>It is important to note that no single stunning method has proved to be 100% effective. Thus, in addition to the primary stunning method, it is critical for staff to be trained to provide a backup stun when staff observe signs of consciousness. For example, a backup percussive stun can be delivered by trained staff members.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3.3 Percussive stunning</strong></h2><p>One method of stunning that can improve the welfare of fish at slaughter is percussive stunning. This involves the delivery of blow(s) to the head to stun or kill a fish instantly (37) followed by a secondary killing method if needed. Percussive stunning, when applied correctly, causes rainbow trout to cease moving immediately and permanently (37,46,47). For this reason, percussive stunning causes unconsciousness much faster than asphyxia (48) and causes less stress (49).</p><p>Notably, the effectiveness of percussive stunning in an industrial setting depends on the size of the fish being slaughtered. It is only feasible for percussive stunning to maintain accuracy and effectiveness over long periods of time when the body sizes of the fish are large (34).</p><p>Percussive slaughter is not recommended for fish that are slaughtered at a small body size, such as seabass and seabream (34). Despite the strengths of percussive stunning, it is not practical for small fish, particularly when accuracy must be consistently maintained over time in a commercial setting (34). For these fish, only electrical stunning appears to result in acceptable welfare outcomes (32).</p><h1><strong>4. Equipment options</strong></h1><p>Animal Ask spoke with a number of companies offering equipment for humane slaughter in aquaculture in Europe to validate the European Commission's figures. The following information summarises the options available for electrical stunning equipment&nbsp;<i>installed on land</i>. On-boat stunners for sea bass and sea bream may cost more and present greater engineering challenges [10]. We discuss on-board stunners in the next section of this report.</p><p>For stunning equipment, Animal Ask spoke to Ace Aquatec who offer in-water electrical stunners for a variety of fish species, including trout, sea bass, and sea bream. These stunners are connected to a centrifugal fish pump capturing fish from sea pens or raceways. Fish are rendered insensible in water during capture without any prior need for handling. One of Ace Aquatec's clients, Scottish Sea Farms, found that the fish are significantly easier to handle as they are only handled when unconscious. This allowed the company to double their harvest rate using the same labour [25]. This also reduced the risks faced by staff who would otherwise have to handle large, stressed fish.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the true cost of this equipment will vary according to the specific context, Ace Aquatec was able to provide Animal Ask with a general quote of approximately 100,000 \u20ac for a stunner for trout, and 120,000 \u20ac sea bass and sea bream.</p><p>One alternative to this is a dry stunner, such as those available from OPTIMAR which can be outfitted for both trout and sea bass/bream (<a href=\"https://optimar.no\"><u>https://optimar.no</u></a>). The stunner is appropriate for capture and stunning in both freshwater and sea cage aquaculture after dewatering and has been used on small vessels.&nbsp;</p><p>The final method of stunning available is percussive stunners, such as those available from BAADER (<a href=\"https://fish.baader.com/products/baader-101\"><u>https://fish.baader.com/products/baader-101</u></a>). However, Animal Ask was unable to obtain general quotes for either of these products.</p><p>There are a variety of pumps that can be used to capture fish prior to stunning with one of the above systems. Brands producing these pumps include FAIVRE (<a href=\"http://www.faivre.fr/\"><u>http://www.faivre.fr/</u></a>), VAKI (<a href=\"https://vakiiceland.is/pumps/\"><u>https://vakiiceland.is/pumps/</u></a>), Washpower (<a href=\"https://washpower.com/bluecomfort/\"><u>https://washpower.com/bluecomfort/</u></a>) and Milanese (<a href=\"http://www.milaneseitalia.com/en/185vs.htm\"><u>http://www.milaneseitalia.com/en/185vs.htm</u></a>). There are pumps suitable for trout, sea bass, and sea bream of all sizes. Depending on the particular pump, the capacity ranges from 5 to 85 tons/hour, with prices varying accordingly from 20,000 to 66,000 \u20ac. One model to highlight is the pump produced by the Italian company Milanese\u2019s Art. Their \u2018185/Maxi\u2019 pump costs 20,800 \u20ac with a 3,000 \u20ac dewatering unit, and handles fish up to 0.9kg at 30 tonnes per hour.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>5. Marine engineering challenges</strong></h1><p>If stunning equipment is to be installed on aquaculture vessels a good overview of the feasibility and costs of installing is required. Examples of stunning devices being installed on work vessels in the Mediterranean are rare, and technical information and cost overviews are not available. Of key influence on the installation costs is whether stunning equipment can be installed on a new build or existing vessel.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>5.1 New build vessels</strong></h2><p>Installing stunning equipment on new build vessels, if planned correctly, would require less work, time and capital compared to refitting an existing vessel. Any necessary equipment could be installed during the general construction phase of the vessel.</p><h2><strong>5.2 Existing vessels</strong></h2><p>Outfitting an existing vessel with stunning equipment is likely to require some changes to the vessel's structure. Considering that deck space is essential for storing fish and conducting operations, it's expected that boat operators may be hesitant to reduce the deck area currently used for fishing activities. Consequently, part of the equipment may need to be installed below deck. The feasibility and costs of installing stunning equipment depend on the type of vessel being considered. To get a clear picture, reaching out to shipyards for a price estimate is crucial. However, it can be challenging to find readily available information about the types of vessels commonly used for this purpose. Some key considerations for outfitting existing vessels with stunning equipment are:</p><ul><li>Can the stunning rate match the original harvest rate?</li><li>Is the hull structure suitable for below deck equipment? (e.g. catamaran vs. monohull)</li><li>Can installation of stunning equipment be combined with other ship maintenance, and with that reduce installation costs?</li><li>Can the installed power generation support the stunning devices? (Is the propulsion diesel-electric, diesel or other?)</li></ul><p>Another important aspect to consider is how well the existing operational methods on the vessel align with the integration of stunning equipment. Currently, fish are mainly brought aboard using smaller nets lifted by an onboard crane. Examples of combining this technique with stunning were not found and would likely complicate the harvesting procedure. Changing the structure and procedures on a vessel could also lead to problems with the vessels classification. Most aquaculture vessels found have a length below 24 metres. For ships below 24 m regulations specific for small service crafts apply. In the subset of small service crafts there no specific aquaculture regulations seem to exist, however it could be that regional or national regulations are present.</p><h1><strong>6. Our planned work</strong></h1><p>We will spend our first six months gathering as much information as we can to answer these questions, with respect to the sea bass and sea bream farming industries in our priority countries and other countries in the Mediterranean:</p><ul><li>How likely is the industry to implement stunning themselves?<ul><li>What time frame?</li><li>How does this vary by country?</li><li>How well would this be implemented, in terms of animal welfare?</li></ul></li><li>How would offering the industry more help (money + technical expertise) change things?<ul><li>Would it make them more likely and/or faster to implement stunning?</li><li>Would it improve the implementation in terms of animal welfare?</li></ul></li><li>What do farm owners think about stunning technology?<ul><li>Are they keen, or not keen to implement it?</li><li>How many farms have stunners already?</li><li>How many farmers are eager to do it? (If we can find farmers who are keen, they would be great partners if we continue operations past our first six months.)</li><li>Can we find at least one fish farmer from each country who is keen to adopt electrical stunning?&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>How much would it cost to implement stunners?<ul><li>For farmers who have stunners already (or pilot projects), how much did implementation cost?</li><li>Can we ask equipment manufacturers how much it would cost?</li><li>How does this vary by country, ship size/type, etc?</li><li>Would the ships need to be refitted in a yard? What would this cost?</li></ul></li><li>How easy would it be to implement stunners, in a technical sense?<ul><li>For farmers who have stunners already (or pilot projects), how easy was this to do?</li><li>Can we ask equipment manufacturers how easy it would be?</li><li>How does this vary by country, ship size/type, new/existing vessel, etc?</li><li>What are the main types/specifications of ships being used for harvesting?</li><li>Can the stunning rate match the original harvest rate?</li><li>Is the hull structure suitable for below deck equipment? (e.g. catamaran vs. monohull)</li><li>Can installation of stunning equipment be combined with other ship maintenance, and with that reduce installation costs?</li><li>Can the installed power generation support the stunning devices?

In other words, a proposal can be blocked by a coalition of at least 4 Member States who represent at least 35% of the population of the EU.</li></ul><p>This procedure can vary in a few corner cases, but those tend to be rare (51).</p><p>Our ability to study the voting process of the Council is hindered by one key fact: the results of votes are made public, but the actual negotiations on particular proposals take place behind closed doors. It is only when an agreement is reached that a public vote takes place (52). The Council members typically negotiate until they achieve a consensus - when that happens, a public vote occurs, and the vote is usually unanimous (52,53).&nbsp; The actual negotiations occur well before the vote, behind closed doors. Whether a Member State is able to obtain concessions on a particular proposal - and the size and nature of those concessions - depends on the power of that Member State in a forming coalition to either support or block the proposal (53). This is an informal process.&nbsp;</p><p>How, then, can we figure out which Member States hold the most sway over the Council's decisions? In a series of modelling studies, Kleinowski calculates the voting power of each Member State post-Brexit (51,53,54).&nbsp; Kleinowski calculates two mathematical metrics that describe the voting power of Member States:</p><ul><li>The Normalised Banzhaf Index (NBI) indicates the probability that an EU Member State will find itself in a position where a proposal's approval hinges on the support of that Member State.</li><li>The Preventive Power Index (PPI) indicates the percentage of blocking coalitions in which an EU Member State is a critical member.</li></ul><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>This project is supported by a grant from the EA Animal Welfare Fund.</p><h1><strong>References</strong></h1><p>1.

The average number of connections per attendee, one of CEA\u2019s primary metrics for conference value, was ~10.9, the highest reached at a US EAGx event. However, even with ~5,400 connections made, the total cost in dollars-per-connection was still high relative to most other EAGx events. This is almost entirely due to the expense of venue rental in NYC at a peak time of year, and on relatively short notice.&nbsp;</p><p>Most respondents of the attendee survey indicated a high likelihood of recommending a similar event (8.94/10), and many complaints were for impossible-to-optimize variables (e.g. a roughly balanced number of respondents indicated that talks were \u201ctoo general\u201d vs \u201ctoo niche\u201d). While impact of the conference is hard to evaluate shortly after the event, several attendees have reported important career connections, high chances of new hires, donation pledges taken, and research collaborations that would not have occurred counterfactually.</p><h3>High-level facts and figures</h3><p>Dates: August 18-20, 2023</p><p>Location: Convene, near the Financial District of Manhattan</p><p>~655 Applications --&gt; ~540 accepted applications and 75 direct invites --&gt; ~510 registered attendees (of whom 50 were awesome volunteers!)</p><p>70 Speakers</p><p>89 Sessions of programming (talks, panels, speed friending, meetups, and office hours)</p><p>20 Orgs represented at the Career Fair</p><p>~5400 Estimated connections made based on feedback survey, ~10.9 per person (6,954 connections on Swapcard, ~13.4 per person)</p><p>1<a href=\"https://podcast.clearerthinking.org/episode/178/dylan-matthews-journalism-in-the-age-of-ai/\"><u> Podcast recorded live</u></a></p><p>8 light-hearted awards bestowed (including \u201cMost 1-1s held\u201d and \u201cMost 1-1s canceled\u201d, to the same person!)</p><h3>Things we think we did well:&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Active matchmaking:&nbsp;</strong>We tried to aid organic networking by offering a large number of unstructured meetups, with facilitators when possible, for both demographic groups and cause-area focus, as well as providing stewardship (connecting those whose applications indicated they may be particularly capable of mentoring with those who seemed best positioned to benefit from a mentor). The feedback on these efforts indicate they were among the best uses of our organizing time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Persistence:</strong> Both in getting the conference to happen in the first place, and in finding a suitable venue. Given the timing (one of the first conferences to be greenlit after the change in the funding landscape of late-2022), there were many points at which it seemed like EAGxNYC wouldn\u2019t be able to happen. After hunting through well over one hundred potential venues, we were able to find and negotiate a high caliber venue in a convenient, central location in downtown Manhattan. Some attendees expressed surprise (and even concern) at the venue\u2019s apparent luxuriousness. And while it was not inexpensive (little in Manhattan ever is), the conference location was actually the lowest cost-per-attendee venue available among the many options we found.</p><h3>Things we hope others might learn from:</h3><p>We found the advice in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/pdPaG5eE3GZe4c4kD\"><u>Events in EA: Learnings &amp; Critiques</u></a> series invaluable, and want to direct more eyes towards it. Our own takeaways mostly supplement the information there.</p><p><strong>Timing</strong>: The Learnings series advised us to start organizing early. We took that into consideration, and still came away wanting (cf. Hofstadter\u2019s Law) to suggest that people start even earlier. This applies both to our own planning work but also to others involved in the process (e.g. presenters and applicants/attendees). Specifics of project management are included in the longform retrospective, but we think it is valuable to share anecdata here about the consequences of perceived EA-norms of short timelines<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffwvfzymfp5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfwvfzymfp5\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>For example, our conference was advised to set the application deadline eighteen days before the conference. This was considered fairly early by EAGx standards, which often have applications open up to two weeks (or less!) before the conference. Accepted applicants are given the option to register up until the day of the conference and registrants are fully reimbursed for their ticket if they cancel at any time. These protocols are based on well-intentioned, impact-focused rationale (i.e. making the conferences available and convenient to more people and thereby maximizing the number of good candidates who can attend; many good candidates do not know they are available until shortly before the event).&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are also significant costs as well. The largest is that it adversely affects organizers\u2019 ability to calibrate the admissions bar. For example, without knowing the total number of applicants or their average fit for the conference, the admissions team may waitlist some candidates who deliberately applied early (e.g. in order to book travel or time off). By the time it becomes clear that these waitlisted applicants will clear the bar, they may no longer be able to come. In this case, the conscientious early-applier loses out to a norm that caters to those who don\u2019t apply until just before the conference. Late applications/registrations also affect production elements like merchandise and name-tag printing, and can dramatically swing the cost of the event when the venue and/or catering charges by headcount<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftf5f9kvfj7k\"><sup><a href=\"#fntf5f9kvfj7k\">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>In the end, ~24% of applications were received in the last four days of the application window, less than three weeks before the event. We have significant anecdotal evidence that many of these were applicants who knew well in advance that they intended to come. Many applicants who applied early and were initially waitlisted before being accepted did not end up attending; some were likely in the category described above. Final registration numbers changed up until the day of the conference (both late registrants and late cancellations, some of which canceled each other out but still left a &gt;5% swing in headcount in the last two days).

This choice was made based on the same \u201cmaximize marginal impact\u201d rationale as the choice to leave applications and registrations open until shortly before the conference. We nonetheless regret contributing to the perception that deadlines are optional, and encourage future event organizers to consider this norm-setting element when considering late applicants.</p><p>We heard from many other organizers that these \u201clast-minute\u201d issues were not unique to our event. The organizing team has experience with non-EA events (academic, professional, and trade conferences) that indicate that short timelines and their attendant consequences are not essential to event planning. They are not unique to EA, but they are avoidable and we believe EA events could benefit from moving towards earlier confirmation by all parties involved. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CwKwwxRpNWmG2jgPT/eagx-application-community-norms-we-d-like-to-see\"><u>recommended to cancel your EAGx ticket as early as possible if you can't attend</u></a>, our takeaway is that it\u2019s beneficial if applications, registrations&nbsp;<i>and</i> cancellations are all made as early as possible, as well as aiming as early as possible for all organizing elements, especially venue choice and speaker confirmations. &nbsp;</p><p>Given CEA\u2019s experience of experimenting with earlier deadlines (which were then extended to reach capacity), it is unlikely that this move can or will come solely from top-down changes. This advice is therefore a general nudge to the broader EA community to move towards earlier action. We included some of the specifics of our conference\u2019s consequences and our understanding of why the deadlines are set so late to try to make the point that even if the deadline&nbsp;<i>is</i> shortly before the conference, you shouldn\u2019t anchor on that date. You can help organizers and actually improve EA events by applying and registering (and canceling if necessary) as soon as you can.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Working on an EAGx</strong>: The EAG/EAGx paradigm, where EAG\u2019s are managed by CEA\u2019s dedicated events team but EAGx\u2019s are one-off teams, means that EAGx organizers will typically be operating under timescales where thorough vetting and team-building are difficult, and turnover is especially hard to manage. Our team came together in a very short time and in a fairly ad hoc manner, (possibly more so than other EAGx teams), so we aim to offer some suggestions to mitigate the difficulties of the process. &nbsp;</p><p>We encourage those that run EAGx events to consider requiring an application round (even if you have a list of people ready and willing to contribute), and for those that apply to consider the pros and cons of a medium-term, project-based contract. We believe that events are more likely to go well, and the individuals involved to benefit professionally, if the uncertain job demands are considered in advance and it is understood that one\u2019s ability to handle their given responsibilities could substantially impact, positively or negatively, their career in the EA ecosystem. While it is definitely possible to fill some organizing duties as a \u201cside-hustle,\u201d it is important to prepare for complications to arise from this.&nbsp;</p><p>Executing an EAGx event is an unpredictable job, as it's likely that every event will be substantively different from other EAGx conferences. But in our experience, it can also be an opportunity for personally satisfying work, an important career step, and generate positive impact on the EA community and the world.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfwvfzymfp5\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffwvfzymfp5\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Not&nbsp;<i>those</i> short timelines.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntf5f9kvfj7k\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftf5f9kvfj7k\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Almost all catering charges by headcount, but when rented in full, most venues do not charge extra per person.

This has been mentioned in the context of AI safety, and not in the context of biosecurity. Thus, it seems anecdotally that people see a significant portion of AI risk being that of an AI somehow being instrumental in causing a civilization-threatening pandemic. That said, I have failed to find any even precursory exploration of <i>how much</i> of AI risk is this risk of AI being instrumental in creating catastrophic bioweapons. Does anyone know of any attempts to quantify the \"overlap\" between AI and bio? Or could someone please try to do so?<br><br>One reason to quantify this overlap is if bio+AI is used as a primary or at least prominent example to the public, it seems useful to have some analysis underpinning such statements. Even showing that bio+AI is actually just a small portion of AI risk might be helpful so that when using this example, the person using this example can also mention that this is just one of many ways AI could end up contributing to harming us. Or if it is indeed a large portion of AI risk, state this with a bit more clarity.<br><br>Other reasons to have such analysis might be:</p><ol><li>Assisting grantmakers allocate funds. For example, if there is a large overlap, it might be that grantmakers currently investing in AI safety also might want to donate to biosecurity interventions likely to help in an \"AI assisted pandemic\"</li><li>Help talent decide what problem to work on. It might, for example be that policy experts worried about AI Safety also want to focus on legislation and policy around biosecurity</li><li>Perhaps foster more cooperation between AI and biosecurity professionals</li><li>Perhaps a quantification here could help both AI safety experts and biosec professionals know what type of scenarios to prepare for? &nbsp;For example, it could put more emphasis in AI safety work on trying to prevent AI from becoming too capable in biology (e.g. by removing such training material).</li><li>Probably other reasons I have not had time to think about</li></ol><p>Relatedly, and I would be very careful in drawing conclusions from this, I just went through the Metaculus predictions for the <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/2568/ragnar%25C3%25B6k-seriesresults-so-far/\">Ragnar\u00f6k </a>question series and found that these add up to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13q-369RQg2mmGRQV0n4Wzspl2ryf_1Q3oG6FFfsoRso/edit?usp=sharing\">132%</a>. <i>Perhaps</i> this indicate overlaps between the categories, or perhaps it is just an effect of the different forecasters for the different questions (there seems to be large variation in how many people have forecasted on each question). Let us assume for the sake of the argument that the \"extra\" 32% very roughly represents overlap between the different categories. Then, with very little understanding of the topic, I might guess that perhaps half of the biorisk of 27% would also resolve as AI caused catastrophe, so roughly 15%. This means 15% of the bio risk is the same as 15% of the AI risk which would reduce the 32% excess (132%-100%) to about 32%-15%=~15%. Perhaps the remaining 15% are overlaps between AI and nuclear, and possibly other categories. However, this would mean almost half the AI risk is biorisk. This seems suspiciously high but at least it <i>could</i> explain why so many prominent voices uses the example of AI + bio when talking about how AI can go wrong. Moreover, if all these extra 32% are indeed overlaps with AI, it means there is almost no \"pure\" AI catastrophe risk which seems suspicious. Anyways, these are the only numbers I have come across that at least points towards some kind of overlap between AI and bio.</p><p>Thanks for any pointers or thoughts on this!</p>", "user": {"username": "Ulrik Horn"}}, {"_id": "ydJbtnT8ygwzTaFr4", "title": "Importance of Increasing Suffering-focused Values and Potential Interventions", "postedAt": "2023-10-08T03:23:08.728Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This essay will focus on the importance of increasing suffering-focused values in other people, and possible avenues to effectively perform such value shifting.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, suffering-focused values, in this paper, refers to a combination of a person's concerns for the suffering of other sentient beings, or even future suffering in that person's own life, as well as a motivation to act to reduce or prevent that suffering. The concern can be based in emotion, such as when empathizing to a degree that one feels significant sadness or anxiety about another sentient being's negative situation. It could also be based in detached, rational thought, if a person has a high-level understanding that suffering is basically the definition of a \"bad\" thing, and therefore logically it should be reduced as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is it important to focus on increasing and spreading suffering-focused values? It is evident that some people appear to have more suffering-focused values than others. There are people who spend their whole lives fighting to prevent the suffering of millions of factory farmed animals, people who donate a kidney to a complete stranger in need, people who give some of their money to a homeless person on the side of the road. There are people who will pass the homeless person and ignore them. Continuing along the spectrum, there are people with psychopathy who have little or no concern for anyone else's suffering. And there are people who exhibit sadism, meaning they find pleasure in others' suffering, and may in some sense have negative \"concern\" for others' suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>One can try to estimate how much suffering has been and will be prevented by the acts of someone nearer the high-concern end of the spectrum. How many dozens, hundreds, or thousands of animals have been spared a life of pain in a factory farm because of a person protesting poor farm conditions, creating petitions to change conditions, or simply boycotting the products from factory farms? Or how many starving Africans have been fed by volunteers who travel to developing countries to volunteer?&nbsp;</p><p>Then consider the population as a whole, where the average person is unlikely to be making nearly as much difference in farm conditions, human starvation, or any other source of extreme suffering. About a third of households in the United States do not donate to charity. If only considering those households that made over 162,501 dollars per year, the average donation was only 3% of their income. Only a quarter of the US population volunteers. (philanthropyrountable.org) Around nine out of ten Americans eat meat, with about 99% of farm animals being factory farmed. (Berg, sentienceinstitute.org)&nbsp;</p><p>There is a large amount of suffering that can be prevented where the only limiting factor is peoples' willingness and opportunity to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>As a way forward in trying to increase suffering-focused values in others, most of my recommendations come down to further brainstorming and research of new ideas. But some relatively concrete thoughts follow.&nbsp;</p><p>Meditation could possibly be an effective tool to increase suffering-focused values. Studies have shown that meditation increases a person's willingness to help those who are suffering. (Condon, Weng) There are many different styles of meditation, and it could be beneficial to compare relative effectiveness between them in this domain.&nbsp;</p><p>Research into other indirect (meaning not directly targeting the brain, such as with chemicals) interventions could be done by searching the literature for studies, or funding new studies. For example, it has been shown that reading fiction leads to increases in empathy. (Mar) It is thus not farfetched to me that specifically reading fiction where the characters are suffering greatly may possibly lead to the reader experiencing increased suffering-focused values. Similarly, watching movies where the characters suffer may have a similar effect, as may reading and watching non-fiction accounts of actual extreme suffering, such as a documentary about the unbearable pain of cluster headaches.&nbsp;</p><p>Potentially, pursuing knowledge of the specific differences in neural chemistry between those with high levels of suffering-focused values and those with low levels may be instrumental in creating new interventions, both indirect, like meditation, and direct, such as research into chemicals which may increase these values, or discovering chemicals and environmental factors people are already exposed to which increase or decrease suffering focused-values. Note that I would consider the use of new drugs a poor intervention in the near future, considering knowledge of the brain is still very limited, and massive risks arise when trying to change brain chemistry.&nbsp;</p><p>It is plausible that people who exhibit characteristics of suffering-focused values can spread the values to others just by being role models. Thus it may be a good idea to try to promote people with such values to positions where they are seen by many others, such as leaders of companies/governments, or celebrities. For example, resources could be used to assist with political campaigns. In the near term, research should be done to determine if value spreading through role models is effective. Apart from these people's value as role models, there would also be the benefit of them having the power to more effectively decrease suffering if they are in a position of power.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people would likely be uninterested in using their time and money to increase their own suffering-focused values even if there were an effective way to do so, thus it may be wise to somehow try to \"bundle\" an incentive that most people will definitely want, such as money, with the side-effect of increasing their concern for others. Maybe research tying meditation and productivity (Sage) could be presented to company leadership, who could then create incentives for their employees to meditate, such as cheaper health insurance. Or research tying meditation and health costs [Stahl] could be presented to government leadership, who could mandate meditation opportunities in schools.&nbsp;</p><p>Sidenote: It may be that experiencing suffering oneself is currently one of the most likely ways for a person to have increased concern for others' suffering. It would not be a good idea for many reasons to intentionally cause involuntary suffering to others to try to increase their suffering-focused values. But with psychiatry and medical science continually advancing, the world may reach a point where virtually everyone who potentially has the power to help others never actually experiences any extreme suffering themselves. This may lead to a large increase in the world's total suffering due to a dearth of concern. There may even be a point of no return, where everyone in power \"forgets\" what it is to suffer, and nothing done simply for the sake of helping the worst off happens anymore. Thus, finding alternate methods to increase suffering-focused values may be an urgent need.&nbsp;</p><p>The space for potential good that can be done, considering the observed high levels of suffering-focused values in some humans, and the average person's levels, makes the high level intervention of \"spreading and increasing suffering-focused values\" worth pursuing. Some ideas for targeted interventions have been presented, and further research may produce many more possible interventions.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>The preceding was a (slightly modified) essay I wrote for an application for the Center for Reducing Suffering. I didn't get the job, but I'm glad I wrote it. I saw a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eby2kf2AXsmt6eSfB/draft-increasing-empathy-as-a-new-cause-area\">post by Christoph Hartmann</a> recently which has a very similar theme, and it inspired me to post my essay.</p><p>My dream would be to pursue this type of work in some capacity. I don't have experience in EA work, but I want to do what I can to prevent extreme suffering in the universe. Increasing empathy and suffering-focused values seems like a very good option, as I think they are maybe the most fundamental ingredients in suffering prevention. Basically, interventions against suffering can only happen if people want them to happen. And I look around the world and see a lot of people that don't care. I even wish I cared more than I do. Humans are intelligent and capable on a level that is scary, and each of those non-caring people has the potential to offer a lot of that capability towards suffering prevention if they somehow were instilled with the desire and means to do so.</p><hr><h3>References&nbsp;</h3><p>Berg, Jennifer, and Chris Jackson. \"Nearly Nine in Ten Americans Consume Meat as Part of Their Diet.\" Ipsos, 12 May 2021.

It is a great story by a great story teller. As for accuracy, that is harder to judge. I think the book is very useful if seen as one among several takes to try to understand what happened.</p><p>I don't have time for a more examined review, but I'll mention a few things:</p><p>First, I appreciated that a lot of the book explored Sam's psychology, his perspective on the world, people, and himself, as well as his lack of feelings (perhaps to a clinical extent). Sam openly admits he just doesn't care... and yet seems to mostly have done all that he did to make the world better (eg pandemic preparedness). He loved games and saw much of life like one.</p><p>Second, many critics are saying Lewis got taken in and was insufficiently harsh on Sam who clearly did obviously bad things. But one can easily read the book and see Sam as an uncaring person, a terrible manager, and a negligent executive that had little concern for others if they want to. <a href=\"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/michael-lewis-hitting-back-critics-033359599.html\">It's all right there</a>.</p><p>Third, related to the second one, there is a weird underlying complication that everyone seems to pretend isn't there. And that is that nearly all financial markets are constructed so that they are not fair to the average person, instead tipped towards those with power, influence, and popularity. Two wrongs don't make a right, but let's at least look at the playing field. Crypto was and is notoriously less reliable than traditional financial instruments. Most people knew this. Startups creating near worthless coins and selling them only works because someone is willing to buy. If the perceived value of some coins drop dramatically, then people will feel ripped off. The whole thing was always a gamble though. The question is whether Sam illegally, intentionally, or just stupidly, wasn't careful about which funds were in which organization. Given how smart he is but how clueless he was, a case can be made for both sides.</p><p>Fourth, the book made me think a lot less of the bankruptcy CEO brought in to take over when things collapsed. Lewis argues that he didn't really understand Sam's business or how it worked (not that anyone else really did either). And the whole power move of having the trial in the US so hundreds of millions of lawyer fees could be claimed seems its own horrible thing.</p><p>Fifth, Lewis seems justified in thinking many others are overconfident in thinking that they know what happened given that the people in FTX at the highest levels didn't know.</p><p>Six, effective altruism (EA) gets mentioned throughout and I think the coverage was generally fair. EAs are described as trying to do the most good in a very calculating fashion. Given that many revolted against Sam and didn't trust him, there is more than enough diversity to assume all EAs are not the same. Many in FTX did seem unfortunately clueless. But then so were over 100 different investors.</p><p>I appreciated that the book is a story about money and power.

I admire the perspective presented in this book, for its intense and ambitious passion for achieving the utilitarian maximus. However, I believe that it is a probabilistically deficient theory with a good chance of doing more harm than good - if it emerges as a sustained framework for policy and philanthropic activity.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>Professor MacAskill's \"Longtermism\" as an expansion of Utilitarian&nbsp;thinking into future times and generations is ambitious and, at face value, on purely numerical grounds, rational. It is an effort to expand the temporal limits of Utilitarian action to maximize the \"common good\" along the time axis.&nbsp;</p><p>But Longtermism is flawed, because its numerical allure risks almost entirely ignoring the possibility that the most direct path to maximizing the long-term common good of tomorrow's&nbsp;beings is, in reality, to maximize the health and happiness of today's beings.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? because today's beings are the very source of tomorrow's beings. Furthermore, if accepted as a formal school of thought upon which to base social and political policies and market products, in the hands of humankind's limited personal and political adjudications, Longtermism risks overriding the rights of unique individuals, today, for the presumed sake of future generations' \"common good\". A most tangible example of such a failure of justice could conceivably become a woman's right to choose motherhood: <i>shall we create policies to override her choice to become a mother, in order that we secure/maximize utility to a future being?</i> &nbsp;The critic of my position would state that, of course, this would be an abuse of the moral ground on which Longtermism is built, yet it would be a rationally consistent one to derive from the premise: Afterall, as the Longtermist would argue, <i>What gives a person today, the right to eliminate all the vast potential of a future being only to secure her own comfort and convenience, today?</i></p><p>Not to mention that along the Longtermist trajectory of thinking, powerful and highly successful Longtermists, exercising their futuristic <i>effective altruism</i>, might even be willing (and able) to bend the rules of contemporary civil and legal conduct, and violate the rights and property of others - in order, presumably, to achieve the morally superior utilitarian aim of securing trillions' well being, in the future. Perhaps the fate of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is telling in this regard - but let me not digress, nor play Monday morning quarterback on the self-evident nature of that disaster. But from my perspective the emergence of the fraud, dripping with moralistic futurism, committed by SBF, was only a matter of time - it was not a random event and is linked directly to a moral superiority argument implicit to the Longtermist approach to Utilitarian altruism.</p><p>To be clear, I am suggesting that the present generation (and by extension generations past, given that they contributed real members to today) serve as the most tangible and <i>probabilistically accessible</i> source for the trillions of individuals that MacAskill's theory of Longtermism aims to secure the good life for, in the future. So it stands to reason that securing the utilitarian maximus, contemporaneously or with tangible/knowable generational proximity to today, is probabilistically a far more productive approach to securing the happiness/utility of future generations - in as much as their happiness (nay, their very future existence) relies on our existence, today. To formally and altruistically direct today's limited resources on securing a complex and vastly unknowable&nbsp;future using the utilitarian theory of \"Longtermism\", when the most direct path to futuristic utilitarianism is to maximize contemporaneous&nbsp;utilitarian metrics for all of today's existing entities well, risks irrecoverable waste.&nbsp;</p><p>I will introduce a caveat, as one who doubts the <i>knowability</i> of the \"common good\": I only accept the <i>utilitarian metric</i> as a practically valid one because most human societies of the 21st century have bought into Utilitarianism as their foundational cognitive algorithm - regardless of the national strategy used to achieve it (i.e., socialism vs. Market-based utilitarianism, or a combination thereof). After all, we live on \"Utilitarian\" earth, so we cannot operate using the physics of a \"theoretical\" Mars.</p><p>MacAskill's ambitious postulate has, however, brought me to the idea that reaching to expand the limits of morally balanced utilitarianism (as juxtaposed&nbsp;against short-sighted and immoral superiority-based and market theories of utilitarianism) today, may include, not necessarily formal altruistic action on \"Longtermist\" ideology, but rather an attempt at materializing&nbsp;a <i>\"retrospective Utilitarianism\"</i>&nbsp;as the justification for spending social and philanthropic resources on repairing generational harms of the past, today.&nbsp;</p><p>Though&nbsp;<i>retrospective utilitarianism</i>&nbsp;will not make the dead happy, nor resurrect them from the crypt, it will ameliorate the generational unhappiness caused by past inefficiencies and injustices in miscalculated Utilitarian social constructs. In other words, why not dominantly extend our utilitarian actions, policies and philanthropy to focus on those excluded from happiness in the past by repairing their descendants, whose damaged existence is the direct result of the past failures of socially utilitarian constructs we, humans, miscalculated and now view as having been immoral....This idea (i.e., reparations) is the aim of some social justice movements and of tort law, and is, thus, not novel at all. But, if the utilitarian philosophical construct on which most contemporary humanity's actions are built (albeit imperfectly, and in many cases, unjustly) is to be expanded in a formal way along the temporal&nbsp;axis as MacAskill is attempting, it may be far more prudent and effective to ascribe to the school of \"<i>retrospectivism</i>\" instead of \"Longtermism\"- because given the higher probability of efficient resource use in the <i>knowable space of the past</i>, it can build a more robustly balanced Utilitarian today for the ancestors of the future. In comparison, \"Longtermism\" risks wasting resources on an unknowable and vastly complex future as the damaged descendants of Utilitarian miscalculations whither, flail and harm themselves and others, today - trivial and knowable examples of Longtermism, (e.g., the broken glass on a hiking trail example, which MacAskill has used frequently), notwithstanding.</p><p>The practical truth, also, is that actualization of \"Longtermism\" demands reliance on development of novel more efficient technologies and political structures which are, by definition, stimulative of the financial marketplace - thus, there will be appetite for it on the part of today's investors and innovators in search of riches - no matter how well garbed in the armor of <i>effective altruism, </i>\"Longtermism\" requires the generation of disposable wealth in a marketplace....No such luck with \"retrospectivism\", however - it has only pure human rationality and empathy to rely on for its actualization, in a world where both virtues are vastly and increasingly deficient.</p><p>Consider, that \"<i>Retrospectivist Utilitarianism</i>\" today, as a foundation for policy and philanthropy, may be the most powerful approach to achieving the Utilitarian maximus in the long-term - not direct \"longtermism\", which risks not only causing irrecoverable waste but also promotes a sense of corruptible moral superiority that could only serve to damage life today masked as Good. Because repairing damage is a far more probabilistically certain human endeavor, than is predicting the future.</p><p>I write this opinion, knowing that the foundational premise and metric of Utilitarianism (i.e., \"The Common Good\") is not, nor ever has been, fully knowable by humankind in any era - but could easily become fire to civilization.</p><p>Then the serpent whispered in her ear: \"You are as beautiful, as He\".</p>", "user": {"username": "Hooman"}}, {"_id": "R9GbQQksznh2SwS4y", "title": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Rabbit Hole Problem", "postedAt": "2023-10-08T12:25:41.473Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Crossposted on </i><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mandelbrot020/silicon-valleys-rabbit-hole-problem-a9e5471b3d91\"><i>Medium</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><i>Content warning: This article discusses sexual assault and suicide.</i></p><p><i>Edited to add: This post is not an attack of EA, on the contrary.

She was an energetic and optimistic tech entrepreneur. She was speaking on world stages about her work to improve the state of the world.</p><p>More than a year prior to her death, she had allegedly been sexually abused at a conference. A successful man had allegedly shared a hotel room with her, given her drugs, and taken advantage of her. Among friends, we rumored that this had something to do with her death. But why did she die long after the event was over \u2014 and not right after the traumatic event, when the stress is supposedly the highest?</p><p>In this past decade in the San Francisco Bay Area, we have come across similar stories. Many women left. A few died. By now, many of us know more women with tech backgrounds who have left Silicon Valley than who are still there. Of those who left, everyone mentioned non-consensual sexual experiences and the resulting fallout.</p><h1><strong>What\u2019s the reality?</strong></h1><p><img style=\"width:45.99%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/R9GbQQksznh2SwS4y/whp6cmbnok9npmtp6yse\" alt=\"Alice falling down a rabbit hole\"></p><p>Here is an anonymized list of the reality of women whose experiences contributed directly or indirectly to this article.</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>A</strong> was sexually assaulted. She moved to another country and re-enrolled in college to earn a new degree in a different industry. Her rapist\u2019s career was unaffected.</i></p><p><i><strong>B</strong> worked at a venture fund for tech startup companies. She was groomed for being trafficked in Epstein\u2019s network. She left the Silicon Valley Bay Area. She now works in tech in another country.</i></p><p><i><strong>C</strong> was an investor for tech startup companies. She left after a well-liked entrepreneur violently attacked her. Her abuser\u2019s career was unaffected. He flourishes in AI.</i></p><p><i><strong>D</strong>\u2019s reputation was destroyed by a close male friend of hers after she was raped by a buddy of his. After the rapist started addiction treatment and somewhat owned up and apologized, she was cautiously tolerated in the tech community again. She now has a new job and a family.</i></p><p><i><strong>E</strong> quietly struggled, hinted at traumatic experiences, and took her own life.</i></p><p><i><strong>F</strong> was tied up and sexually assaulted. She left the tech industry and moved away. Her rapist\u2019s career was unaffected. He flourishes in AI.</i></p><p><i><strong>G</strong> was sexually assaulted while intoxicated. She moved to another country. Her rapist\u2019s career was unaffected. He flourishes in AI.</i></p><p><i><strong>H</strong> was sexually assaulted in her sleep. Her rapist slandered her mental health, leading her to be ostracized. Later, her rapist was ostracized himself after he sexually assaulted someone of higher social status and popularity.</i></p><p><i><strong>J</strong> was abused on business travel at a conference. She died of suicide more than a year later. Her rapist\u2019s career was unaffected.</i></p><p><i><strong>K</strong> was a VP at a major tech company. She left Silicon Valley after she was raped on business travel and subsequently fired. Her rapist was investigated, but never formally charged. His career flourishes.</i></p><p><i><strong>L</strong> was abused several times. She went on to study misogyny and reported about it to the Effective Altruism community. Her work was dismissed. She named her abusers in an elaborate post, then took her own life. Her accusations were dismissed. [0]</i></p><p><i><strong>M</strong> left the Bay Area for two years after being sexually assaulted, then returned to start a new life. Her rapist\u2019s life was unchanged.</i></p><p><i><strong>N</strong> was sexually abused by someone influential who keeps inspiring social aggression against her. She is considering a dignified death at a euthanasia facility in Switzerland. His career flourishes.</i></p></blockquote><h1><strong>Why though?</strong></h1><p>This phenomenon has puzzled some. Why do women in Silicon Valley, instead of getting therapy and support, leave their lives behind? Some of us even received therapy money from our respective rapists. And yet, after much struggle to stay, we couldn\u2019t. Some of us hosted goodbye events. One woman even organized a \u201cfuneral\u201d gathering before leaving to say goodbye to her career, her friends, and her chosen family. Why is sexual assault in the Silicon Valley Bay Area such a life-ending event?</p><p>We argue that the initial trauma of a sexual consent violation, while severe, does not explain the magnitude of the impact on the lives and careers of women.<strong> The real horror is in how the Bay Area treats its witnesses of sexual abuse. Women leave after sexual assault because of the loss of belonging, psychological safety, and shared meaning.</strong></p><blockquote><p>The real horror is in how the Bay Area treats its witnesses of sexual abuse.</p></blockquote><h1><strong>Introducing the Alice</strong></h1><p>In this article, besides calling a person a survivor, a victim, or a witness\u00b9 of sexual abuse in the Silicon Valley Bay Area\u00b2 (which are all appropriate terms in the right context), we will call them an \u201cAlice\u201d\u00b3. \u201cAlice\u201d refers broadly to a person who experienced a violation in a world pitted against her\u2074. This is intended to be a value-neutral allegory to the fairytale protagonist who unexpectedly finds herself in a bizarre world full of nonsense and casual cruelty. It also challenges the \u201cKaren\u201d trope that is weaponized against Alices. Next time you encounter someone alleging abuse and getting called a Karen, you may ask yourself: \u201cIs she really a Karen? Or is she an Alice?\u201d</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIs she really a Karen? Or is she an Alice?\u201d</p></blockquote><p><img style=\"width:45.08%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/R9GbQQksznh2SwS4y/y7who1za5u1wbshdtrge\" alt=\"\"></p><h1><strong>Down the rabbit hole</strong></h1><p>When we talk about the Bay Area or Silicon Valley culture, we\u2019re referring to the particularities of tech workers and the tech elites. A wealthy social class of a particular type of neurodivergence dominates the culture. Many people formally or informally identify on the autism spectrum. Openness to new experiences is high, and mind-altering drugs are common and popular. Akin to royal courts of the past, exclusive events are where deals are made and new companies are founded. It creates an environment that can be extremely fun and stimulating, but also dangerous and unaccountable. With drugs, parties, overflowing testosterone, a lack of communication skills, and blindness to social cues, consent violations happen easily and frequently.</p><p><strong>A perpetrator often has an active imagination, projecting more sexual desire than what actually was present in the other party. </strong>His\u2074 perception may be affected by a long string of encounters with women where he successfully imposed his fantasy on them, including \u201cno consent parties\u201d where drugged women are available for him to have his way with. An Alice, on the other hand, suffers from a lack of imagination: She expects society to work as advertised, her boundaries to be respected, and is unwilling to bend to his distorted version of reality. To a tech entrepreneur who has a \u201creality distortion field\u201d around him, living in a fantasy world of his making, this can be an unusual and jarring experience. An Alice is an unwelcome tether from the default world.</p><blockquote><p>A perpetrator often has an active imagination, projecting more sexual desire than what actually was present. An Alice is an unwelcome tether from the default world.</p></blockquote><h1><strong>In concrete numbers</strong></h1><p>Can we estimate how many \u201cbad apples\u201d there are? In a study\u2075 among US college students, almost a third of the men (31.7%) said that in a consequence-free situation, they\u2019d force a woman to have sexual intercourse. The Artificial Intelligence industry is highly male-dominated, with only an estimated 12% of employees in AI being women\u2076. In our back-of-the-envelope comparison, <strong>the AI industry can be estimated to contain more self-identified sexual assaulters than women</strong>.</p><p>This tracks when we look at the statistics about victims in this population, too. Women on the Asperger\u2019s spectrum, the archetype of the \u201ctechnical person\u201d (that Elon Musk identifies as, too), report\u2078 rates of sexual assault at 90%.</p><p>Sexual assault is very rarely reported to the police, and when it is, the police even more rarely move the case to formal charges\u2079.</p><p>Another characteristic of Bay Area tech culture is that there is little to no separation between work and private life. Work, community, housing, spiritual life, our \u201ctribe\u201d, everything is one big source of meaning, and different from \u201cnormie\u201d life. This is very effective for startups, but when it fails, Alices are left without support, social connection, or sources of meaning.</p><blockquote><p>Statistically, the AI industry can be estimated to contain more sexual assaulters than women.</p></blockquote><h1><strong>No way home</strong></h1><p>Once a consent violation has happened, a perpetrator may recruit allies in a war against the Alice while she is still in shock. The collective efforts to shut down her truth render her world bizarre. As a result, the Alice can no longer live an authentic life: She has to choose between conforming to the pressure and denying her reality or saying goodbye to her network, her career, and her ability to keep and form social connections. The section \u201cReal life Cyberball\u201d below describes what this looks like concretely.</p><p>We\u2019ve found\u00b9\u2070 that the amount of second-hand betrayal is most highly correlated with the perceived social influence of the perpetrator, such as his wealth, his power, and his network. <strong>Social climbers will further harm the Alice to curry favor with the perpetrator.</strong></p><p><img style=\"width:44.94%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/R9GbQQksznh2SwS4y/vxl5kphntbowwlxosoj8\" alt=\"\"></p><h1><strong>The Cyberball experiment</strong></h1><p>In a classic psychology experiment\u00b9\u00b9, a human participant sits in front of a screen to play a simple game. They, let\u2019s call them player A, virtually tosses a ball back and forth with two other players. It\u2019s simple, wholesome, ball-tossing fun. A tosses to B, B to C, then back to A, and so on. Now comes the kicker: Players B and C stop including A in their tosses. A watches helplessly as B and C keep tossing the ball to each other, but never to A. A\u2019s stress response shoots up. What A doesn\u2019t know is that the game had been rigged from the beginning; they are the only real participant.</p><p>As players B and C exclude A from their ball tosses, player A will soon start to get nervous, then distressed, and then hopeless. We can measure their significant stress responses, for example in their skin\u00b9\u00b2 and in their pupils\u00b9\u00b3. Brain scans\u00b9\u2074 revealed that these feelings of social exclusion are registered in the same way as physical pain\u00b9\u2075. <strong>Their distress is negatively correlated with a sense of control, belongingness, and meaningful existence\u00b9\u2076.</strong></p><p>Luckily, it was just a brief experiment, and they can go back to the real world where they are seen and included. Often, the researchers let the participant play a few more inclusive rounds of Cyberball in the end to undo the feeling of ostracization.</p><p>We posit that even more than the initial sexual assault, this social pain of ostracism exiles and ultimately kills Alices. Instead of a quick trauma that could be addressed and resolved, it is a slow, ongoing, excruciating one, happening repeatedly until the Alice gives up on shared meaning, social connection, and impactful work.</p><p><img style=\"width:49.55%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/R9GbQQksznh2SwS4y/ye2ngfqgkybrauoums3d\" alt=\"\"></p><h1><strong>Real life Cyberball</strong></h1><p>Calling the Alice\u2019s reality cruel and bizarre is no exaggeration. We have collectively experienced the following <strong>acts of ostracization </strong>after sexual assault:</p><blockquote><p><i>We were uninvited from events and conferences.</i></p><p><i>We lost jobs and had job offers revoked.</i></p><p><i>We were removed from group chats.</i></p><p><i>When contracted for work, employers have requested secrecy from us to be able to deny knowing us.</i></p><p><i>Speaking engagements were canceled.</i></p><p><i>Our trauma was disclosed as a reason to exclude us from communities, conferences, job opportunities, and retreats.</i></p><p><i>Elaborate documents were circulated in group chats in our absence on the topic of our character and mental health.</i></p><p><i>Cherry-picked screenshots were circulated in group chats, along with elaborate discussion for character assassination.</i></p><p><i>Our friends have been selectively approached and influenced to no longer engage with us.</i></p><p><i>We were unfriended and blocked on social media by former friends.</i></p><p><i>We were frozen out and lied to about upcoming social gatherings.</i></p><p><i>Warnings were circulated about us with calls to spread the warning to everyone.</i></p><p><i>We were kicked out of community housing, and prevented from finding new housing within the network.</i></p></blockquote><p>Besides ostracization, we experienced concerted efforts to <strong>silence us</strong>, including:</p><blockquote><p><i>When reacting with fear to being in the presence of our rapist, we were accused of \u201cprojecting our trauma\u201d and ruining a friendly event.</i></p><p><i>We were manipulated in various ways to agree that what happened wasn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d sexual assault.</i></p><p><i>We were pressured to sign non-disclosure agreements or \u201cconsent statements\u201d in a manipulative \u201ccommunity process\u201d.</i></p><p><i>We were put through triggering psychedelic experiences \u2014 and accused of not being spiritually enlightened enough when it didn\u2019t change our story.</i></p><p><i>We were put through intimidating \u201ccommunity mediation\u201d processes by self-appointed \u201cwitch hunters\u201d. When we didn\u2019t recant at the end of the process, we were excluded on the grounds of failing the process.</i></p><p><i>We were pressured to publicly \u201cadmit\u201d to lying about the sexual assault, under the promise that it would end the ostracization.</i></p><p><i>We were threatened and intimidated to stay silent in text, in voice, and in person.</i></p><p><i>We were vilified for \u201cviolating social norms\u201d when we named an abuser.</i></p><p><i>We were directed to file our concerns with self-appointed community stewards, who advocated for silence, no police intervention, and who, on multiple occasions, compassionately recommended suicide.</i></p></blockquote><p>And then there was <strong>opportunistic harm</strong>, including:</p><blockquote><p><i>We were targeted with other interpersonal crime, such as theft and appropriation, followed by the thieves joining ranks with the rapists to cast doubt on us.</i></p><p><i>We were refused pay, equity, and credit for our work, followed by the employer joining ranks to freeze us out from our industry.</i></p><p><i>Humiliating websites were put up about us with cherry-picked screenshots and non-consensual recordings.</i></p><p><i>Our home address was publicly released (doxxed) with encouragement for harassment.</i></p><p><i>We were pressured into sexual acts to \u201cprove ourselves\u201d to \u201ccommunity advocates\u201d.</i></p><p><i>We were preyed on by other sexual assaulters in the rapist\u2019s network. The amount of predation after the initial assault implies a gossip network among rapists where they help each other identify targets and coordinate to harm the woman\u2019s credibility.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is now becoming more clear how our friend died in 2020. After the sexual assault, rumors began to circulate that she was crazy, annoying, and dangerous. Her distress, confusion, and shock at being frozen out from meaningful interactions were interpreted to confirm the rumors about her annoyingness and contributed further to her isolation. Over time, it became impossible for her to raise capital for her business, to find a new job, or to have trusted friends, until there was nothing meaningful left. Ultimately, she stopped communicating, eating, and drinking water. She died alone, in a slow death of starvation and dehydration.</p><p>Among us, a certain kind of gossip and warning about a woman raises skepticism now. More likely than not, the woman is another Alice, and the gossip is the candy trail that leads back to a rapist and his circle of enablers.</p><p>Among Alices, we confidentially share knowledge not only about the men who violate boundaries, but also about those who will do their dirty work of harming the women\u2019s reputations. While rapists vary, the ones who take an active role in ending women\u2019s careers, social life, and belonging in the Bay Area are a shockingly small number of individuals who come up over and over. A wealthy and popular entrepreneur in AI has been identified by half a dozen women for having harmed their reputations after they were raped by buddies of his. A thought leader in AI safety wrote multiple slandering documents about women whom his friends had raped. They often present as extraordinarily \u201ccaring about the community\u201d, seeking social leadership positions. Needless to say, the presence of these \u201cwitch hunters\u201d does not imply any actual witchcraft \u2014 just like in historic days, non-conforming women are eliminated to protect the establishment and the illusions that uphold it.</p><p><i>Deep thanks to everyone who contributed to this report.</i></p><h1><strong>Footnotes</strong></h1><p>[0] <a href=\"https://medium.com/@itai.ilyich/if-i-cant-have-me-no-one-can-kathleen-rebecca-forth-born-april-11-1980-31c49ed15121\">If I Can\u2019t Have Me, No One Can (Kathleen Rebecca Forth \u2014 Born April 11, 1980) | by Itai Emberwell | Medium</a></p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://medium.com/@lucretiatheprotector/my-experience-as-a-female-ai-researcher-in-silicon-valley-and-why-i-spoke-to-time-magazine-sexual-6bfe87f11fd0\"><u>[Pt 0] The Lucretia Books: My Experience with Sexual Harassment/Abuse as a Female AI Researcher in Silicon Valley | by Lucretia | Medium</u></a></p><p>[2] The same dynamics may happen in other locations, too, most likely everywhere where power is largely held by men.</p><p>[3] This is not to be confused with the neurological condition called Alice in Wonderland syndrome. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1826192/pdf/canmedaj00720-0006.pdf\"><u>canmedaj00720\u20130006.pdf (nih.gov)</u></a> <a href=\"https://cp.neurology.org/content/6/3/259.short\"><u>Alice in Wonderland syndrome | Neurology Clinical Practice</u></a></p><p>[4] We are using female pronouns when referring to the Alice concept, although male victims and non-binary victims exist, too.

It is NOT a copy and pasted list of every sentence with the words \"effective altruism\". &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Pinocchio is narrated by Jiminy Cricket; the Great Gatsby is narrated by Nick; Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s story is narrated by Michael Lewis. His book, <i>Going Infinite, </i>isn\u2019t written from Sam\u2019s perspective, exactly. Michael Lewis is a sympathetic fly on the wall documenting a tragically flawed underdog being destroyed by his own infinite ambition.</p><p>But like the Great Gatsby, where Nick speaks so fondly about Daisy (who Gatsby loves) and so unkindly about Tom (who Gatsby hates), you get the sense that Sam\u2019s love for the effective altruism movement colours a lot of what ended up in the book.</p><p>Spectacle is another thing that colours what went into the book. Michael Lewis doesn\u2019t take the tabloid road and make this a book about drugs and shrimp rings and \u201cthe polycule\u201d, thankfully. But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that most of the characters in the book are basically zoo animals on display for the public\u2019s amusement.</p><p>He\u2019s constantly saying, implicitly or explicitly, that effective altruists are high iq children who don\u2019t trust emotions or adults. It feels condescending: \u201cOf course you failed. You\u2019re children! Idiot savants, like something out of a Dostoevsky novel.\u201d</p><p>But he also seems to really believe EAs are genuine, and that\u2019s not nothing.</p><p>The first mention of effective altruism is in the preface. It doesn\u2019t say effective altruism, exactly, but</p><blockquote><p>He [Sam] needed infinity dollars because he planned to address the biggest existential risks to life on earth: nuclear war, pandemics far more deadly than Covid, artificial intelligence that turned on mankind and wiped us out, and so on.</p></blockquote><p>And that really sets the tone for the rest of the book. At least according to his book, Michael Lewis believes that Sam, Caroline, Gary and Nishad were motivated to earn a lot of money because they wanted to give it to charity.</p><p><strong>Chapters 1 and 2</strong> introduce the character of Sam, including the way he thinks about expected value and the way he taught himself to make facial expressions, and <strong>Chapter 3</strong> properly introduces effective altruism.</p><blockquote><p>One other oddly big thing happened to Sam at the beginning of his junior year. Completely out of the blue, a twenty-five-year-old lecturer in philosophy at Oxford University named Will Crouch [Will MacAskill\u2019s unmarried name] reached out and asked to meet with him. Sam never learned how the guy had found him\u2014probably from the writing Sam had been doing on various utilitarian message boards.</p></blockquote><p>He devotes several pages to talking about Peter Singer, Toby Ord and Will MacAskill, and the early version of 80,000 Hours Will was promoting on his visit to Harvard. As far as I can tell, Lewis basically gets those things right. And then he included a quote from Will that completely blew my mind:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe demographics of who this appeals to are the demographics of a physics PhD program,\u201d he said. \u201cThe levels of autism ten times the average. Lots of people on the spectrum.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>\u2026<i>yeah</i>.</p><p>Moving on: the end of <strong>Chapter 3</strong> mentions allegedly the first earning-to-giver on Wall Street, Matt Wage (nominative determinism strikes again). <strong>Chapter 4</strong> says that Sam became a vegan and an effective altruism because he thought through the arguments and concluded they were correct, not because of feelings of guilt or empathy. And <strong>Chapter 5</strong> gets into the Alameda origin story, which is where EA really gets involved.</p><blockquote><p>The business hadn\u2019t even really been Sam\u2019s idea but Tara\u2019s. Tara had been running the Centre for Effective Altruism, in Berkeley, and Sam, while at Jane Street, had become one of her biggest donors. \u2026 Her success [trading crypto] led Sam to his secret belief that he might make a billion dollars by creating a hedge fund to trade crypto the way Jane Street traded everything.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t do it by himself. Crypto trading never closed. Just to have two people awake twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, he\u2019d need to hire at least five other traders. He\u2019d also need programmers to turn the traders\u2019 insights into code, so that their trading could be automated and speeded up. Tara had been making a handful of trades a week on her laptop; what Sam had in mind was an army of bots making a million trades a day. He\u2019d need to hire some lower-IQ people to do the boring stuff, like finding office space and getting food for the traders and paying utility bills and probably lots of other things he hadn\u2019t thought of.</p><p>His access to a pool of willing effective altruists was his secret weapon. Sam knew next to nothing about crypto, but he did know how easy it was to steal it. Anyone who started a crypto trading firm would need to trust his employees deeply, as any employee could hit a button and wire the crypto to a personal account without anyone else ever having the first idea what had happened. Wall Street firms were not capable of generating that level of trust, but EA was.</p></blockquote><p>Lewis touches on how Alameda started out just <i>sending money to random EAs in specific countries</i> and getting them to transfer it back as a way of exploiting arbitrage opportunities. It\u2019s absolutely wild.</p><p>Caroline, Gary and Nishad join Alameda in this chapter - Lewis briefly touches on each of their EA origin stories - and wealthy EAs including Jaan Tallinn invest in the young hedge fund. (No friends and family discount on the interest rate though - \u201cinvestors were charging them a rate of interest of 50 percent\u201d according to Lewis.)</p><p>Lewis does cover half of the EA founding team leaving Alameda as well, and to his credit I think he did interview some of the people who left, although it still comes off as very Sam-friendly compared to the accounts I\u2019ve heard.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe prospect of losing a couple of hundred million dollars that would have otherwise gone into solving the world\u2019s problems felt pretty high stakes,\u201d said Ben West. Under the circumstances, they thought it was insane to continue trading, but Sam insisted on trading. Crypto markets would not remain inefficient for long. They needed to make hay while the sun shone.</p></blockquote><p>Lewis says the other managers were trying to figure out how to get rid of Sam; \u201caimed to bankrupt Sam, almost as a service to humanity\u201d; and \u201ctold our investors he was faking being an EA, because it was the meanest thing they could think to say\u201d.</p><blockquote><p>In the end, for Sam to leave he had to want to leave, and Sam did not really want to leave. And so, on April 9, 2018, his entire management team, along with half of his employees, walked out the door, with somewhere between one and two million dollars in severance.</p></blockquote><p>People in the wider EA community started hearing things, but\u2026</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThere was no smoking gun.\u201d No one thing Sam had done for which they could easily condemn him. It was, as Tara said, \u201cone hundred small things.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And after a while when Alameda and then FTX started doing so well, some of them even started to think that maybe they were wrong, maybe Sam was just rude and stubborn and untrustworthy in a way that makes you good at business, not in a way that means you should cut all ties.</p><p>In <strong>Chapter 6</strong>, Lewis shares Sam\u2019s writing about the situation:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI did damage to the EA community,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI made people hate each other a little more and trust each other a little less \u2026 and I severely curtailed my own future ability to do good. I\u2019m pretty sure my net impact on the world has, so far, been negative and that is why.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>At that point, Sam stopped hiring so many EAs.</p><p><strong>Chapter 7</strong> focuses on George Lerner, a psychiatrist who \u201cwas treating maybe twenty EAs\u201d when he was invited to move to the Bahamas and join the FTX staff. He says really mean things about Caroline particularly. And he comments a lot on the trends in his EA patients:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA lot of EAs chose not to have kids,\u201d said George. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the impact on their own lives. They believe that having kids takes over from their ability to have impact on the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two parts of being EA,\u201d said George. \u201cPart one is the focus on consequences. Part two is the personal sacrifice.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And trends in the EA staff in the Bahamas:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cEveryone is complaining about the lack of dating opportunities,\u201d said George. \u201cExcept the EAs. The EAs didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>The non-EAs thought the EAs thought they were smarter than everybody else.</p></blockquote><p><i>*shrug*</i></p><p><strong>Chapter 8</strong> introduces a new EA character - Igor Kurganov. \u201cKurganov was a Russian-born former professional poker player to whom Musk had entrusted the task, it was reported, of giving away more than $ 5 billion worth of his fortune. He was also a self-described effective altruist\u201d.</p><p>Lewis describes Sam as spending more of his money now:</p><p>considering buying some of Twitter with Elon Musk, in a bid to convince him to donate more of his money towards EA-style causes</p><p>investing $500 million in Anthropic</p><p>going to EA leaders\u2019 retreats where they discuss how to spend his money</p><p>and trying to buy political power</p><blockquote><p>In a very short time, Sam\u2019s money had bankrolled some of the most spectacular failures in the history of political manipulation. Carrick Flynn, for example. When Sam stumbled upon him, Carrick Flynn was a newcomer to elective politics. He was the quintessential Washington, DC, policy wonk\u2014one of the faceless minions in blue suits who sit along the wall behind the more important people and occasionally rise and whisper something in their ears. Carrick Flynn\u2019s most important trait, in Sam\u2019s view, was his total command of and commitment to pandemic prevention. His second-most important trait was that he was an effective altruist.</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>Flynn asked some fellow EAs what they thought about him running for Congress. As a political candidate he had obvious weaknesses: in addition to being a Washington insider and a bit of a carpetbagger, he was terrified of public speaking and sensitive to criticism. He described himself as \u201cvery introverted.\u201d And yet none of the EAs could see any good reason for him not to go for it\u2014and so he\u2019d thrown his hat into the ring. Somewhere along the EA trail he\u2019d become known to Sam.</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>The people of Oregon not only did not appreciate the effort; a lot of them started to kind of hate Carrick Flynn. And Carrick Flynn was not designed to ignore their feelings. Attacked by other candidates during a debate, he simply walked out in the middle.</p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>Anyway, to Sam, the money he\u2019d spent on Carrick Flynn had been a drop in his second bucket. Other congressional races had worked out better.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Chapter 8 </strong>also introduces the FTX Future Fund:</p><blockquote><p>From the moneymaking division of FTX, it was just her, Sam, Gary, and Nishad; from the money-giving side were the four employees who worked for FTX\u2019s philanthropic wing. They shared their employer\u2019s habit of turning life decisions into expected value calculations, and their inner math yielded similarly surprising results. In 2020, Avital Balwit had won a Rhodes Scholarship and turned it down, first to run Carrick Flynn\u2019s congressional campaign and then to give away FTX\u2019s money. Leopold Aschenbrenner, who had entered Columbia University at the age of fifteen and graduated four years later as class valedictorian, had just declined a spot at Yale Law School to work for this new philanthropy. Their boss, a former Oxford philosopher named Nick Beckstead, was also present, as was their spiritual guru, Will MacAskill\u2014who was of course in some way responsible for everyone, including Sam, even being there.</p></blockquote><p>Lewis introduces the idea of longtermism here, and tries to shoehorn it into his theme of <i>high iq kids with no use for feelings who follow the numbers.</i></p><blockquote><p>One day some historian of effective altruism will marvel at how easily it transformed itself. It turned its back on living people without bloodshed or even, really, much shouting. You might think that people who had sacrificed fame and fortune to save poor children in Africa would rebel at the idea of moving on from poor children in Africa to future children in another galaxy. They didn\u2019t, not really\u2014which tells you something about the role of ordinary human feeling in the movement. It didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was the math. Effective altruism never got its emotional charge from the places that charged ordinary philanthropy. It was always fueled by a cool lust for the most logical way to lead a good life.</p></blockquote><p>And for this one sentence, I remember how exciting things were very briefly:</p><blockquote><p>After handing out $ 30 million in 2021, they were on pace to hand out $ 300 million in 2022, and then $ 1 billion in 2023. As Nishad had put it to me not long before, \u201cWe\u2019re finally going to stop talking about doing good and start doing it.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And then the rest of the book is about the collapse of FTX. I won\u2019t get into it; I expect the trial over the next six weeks will cover this much better than the book could.</p><p>It\u2019s weird - whenever Lewis wants to talk about Sam, Caroline, Nishad and Gary, he calls them \u201cthe effective altruists\u201d. And I guess that is how they met and a way to distinguish them from other key players in FTX! But I found it jarring every time.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent so much time thinking about how <i>those people</i> were <i>naive utilitarians</i> or possibly just <i>bad actors, </i>but either way <i>criminals</i> who make upstanding people like <i>us</i> look bad, that I forgot how relatable Nishad and Gary and Caroline and Sam are. I\u2019m glad the book helped me to remember.</p><p><i>This post first appeared on the </i><a href=\"https://ealifestyles.substack.com/\"><i>EA Lifestyles</i></a><i> Substack.

Let\u2019s go back a bit and try to examine this. In 1906, Pixxlie Kaisaka Kaseme talked about the regeneration of Africa. An Africa that had the brand of slavery and had been fully colonized. It may seem that slavery might not have been just physical but to some point mental.&nbsp;</p><p>We cannot continue relying solely on external interventions for our issues and problems. We can easily solve the problems we have by simply speaking them out and finding lasting solutions. But we may not forget that some of the things that make us not solve certain problems because of the corrupt political systems we have in place that day in and day out try to shush people who talk of anything.</p><p>Focusing on community-driven solutions rather than more individual solutions - People in communities possess knowledge and resources that can help us in the development of a better Africa. Recently, companies like Google have opened branches in Africa and this clearly shows that we have the brains just that we don\u2019t want to utilize our own and feel they might rise to the top before us.&nbsp; This will slowly help us take ownership of decisions we make from people who understand the communities.</p><p>To empower local voices in African Development we really need to have more thought-provoking leaders who are ready to listen to their own people. We need to empower such leaders to rise to power and at least take their place in society. With such leaders, we can easily implement change and have more voices being open and speaking out. The only challenge we have with that is the amount of corruption and deceit that goes on in the corridors of justice in our courts, and parliament and the amount of intimidation from existing leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Promotion of grassroots organizations that can help empower young people who can be thoughtful leaders can be a very effective way to empower African Development. If those organizations are provided with access to information they can really go a long way. Everyone should be allowed credible and real-time information that will help them make sound decisions.<br><br>In the long run, there is a need to hold every decision maker accountable to the rule of law because most of what we have to deal with are corrupt leaders who know they are being taken no-where even after they commit multiple crimes. The rule of law should make everyone from the poor to the rich accountable.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, empowering local voices in African development will definitely provide a greater likelihood of sustainable and contextually relevant solutions being implemented.

There are various approaches to this sector, and some of these are focused on creating policies that set the criteria AIs should follow, while others are considering the technical aspect of creating the safe AI that we want. I focus on the second part,&nbsp;<strong>technical AI safety</strong>.</p><p>This problem is very important due to the potential threats that can arise from it, immediately or as consequences of an uncontrollable AI, as it is estimated&nbsp;<strong>it has a non-negligible chance of eliminating humanity</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(0.5-50%)</strong>. Also, there are&nbsp;<strong>not too many people working in that sector</strong> (~400), as most of the people working on AI are focused on increasing the capabilities of it or using it in certain areas. There is a&nbsp;<strong>small amount of money put into mitigating AI risks</strong> (50 million) relative to the amount put into advancing AI capabilities (1 billion). (source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\"><u>Preventing an AI-related catastrophe - 80,000 Hours</u></a>)</p><p>Some subproblems that I am interested in (which are related to each other) are&nbsp;<strong>goal misgeneralization</strong> (and robustness in general) and&nbsp;<strong>reward specification</strong>. I think that most issues regarding the safety of AI arise from unforeseen scenarios and the unexpected behavior AI will have on these. This behavior highly depends on its reward function. If we have an AI that we know is going to have the same behavior in real life as it had in training, we eliminate most of the safety risks that arise from it. Also, we can solve most problems in training instead of having to deal with unexpected scenarios in real life, where it will have much more influential capability.</p><h1>Sectors of technical AI safety</h1><h2>Specifications</h2><p><strong>Specification</strong> ensures that an AI system\u2019s behavior aligns with the operator\u2019s true intentions. It is divided into the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Ideal specifications:</strong> the hypothetical description of an ideal AI system that is fully aligned to the desires of the human operator</li><li><strong>Design specifications:</strong> the specification that we actually use to build the AI system (e.g., its structure, the reward function)</li><li><strong>Revealed specifications:</strong> the specification that best describes what&nbsp;<i>actually</i> happens, the behavior of the AI</li></ul><h2>Robustness</h2><p><strong>Robustness</strong> ensures that an AI system continues to operate within safe limits upon perturbations. I focuses on the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Distributional shift:</strong> making an AI agent act in an environment with unknown aspects, non-existent in the training environments.</li><li><strong>Adversarial inputs:</strong> a specific case of distributional shift where inputs to an AI system are designed to trick the system through the use of specially designed inputs.</li><li><strong>Unsafe exploration:</strong> can result from a system that seeks to maximize its performance and attain goals without having safety guarantees that will not be violated during exploration, as it learns and explores in its environment.</li></ul><h2>Assurance</h2><p><strong>Assurance</strong> ensures that we can understand and control AI systems during operation. It is done in two ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Monitoring (e.g., interpretability):</strong> inspecting systems in order to analyze and predict their behavior.</li><li><strong>Enforcement (e.g., interruptibility):</strong> designing mechanisms for controlling and restricting the behavior of systems. (e.g. off-switch)</li></ul><h2>Alignment components</h2><p>These are the most common ways we try to mitigate the above issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Inner Alignment:</strong> Aligning the&nbsp;<strong>Design</strong> with the&nbsp;<strong>Revealed</strong> specifications</li><li><strong>Outer Alignment:</strong> Aligning the&nbsp;<strong>Design</strong> with the&nbsp;<strong>Ideal</strong> specification</li></ul><p>(Sources:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JC7aJZjt2WvxxffGz/paradigms-of-ai-alignment-components-and-enablers\"><u>Paradigms of AI alignment: components and enablers \u2014 LessWrong</u></a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/building-safe-artificial-intelligence-52f5f75058f1\"><u>Building safe artificial intelligence: specification, robustness, and assurance | by DeepMind Safety Research</u></a>)</p><h1>Promising approaches</h1><p>Here is an overview of the most promising approaches that try to solve these problems:</p><h2>Reward specification</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\"><strong><u>Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL)</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> CIRL is a framework where the AI agent and human interact to achieve a common objective while learning each other's intentions, leading to better alignment with human values.</li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02827\"><strong><u>Inverse Reward Design (IRD)</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> making a probability distribution of reward functions that fit the training data and training the model to avoid uncertain scenarios.</li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03060\"><strong><u>Active Inverse Reward Design (AIRD)</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> (improved IRD) after making the initial probability distribution, we ask a number of queries in order to specify the uncertainties.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bziebart/publications/maximum-causal-entropy.pdf\"><strong><u>Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MCEIRL)</u></strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkevMnRqYQ&amp;noteId=r1eINIUbe4\"><strong><u>Reward Learning by Simulating the Past (RLSP)</u></strong></a><strong> (using MCEIRL)</strong></li></ul><h2>Robustness/Goal misgeneralization</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JKj5Krff5oKMb8TjT/imitative-generalisation-aka-learning-the-prior-1\"><strong><u>Imitative Generalization</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> making a text that describes the criteria with which a human would solve a problem, while in parallel training an ML model to follow this text.</li><li><a href=\"https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/designing-agent-incentives-to-avoid-side-effects-e1ac80ea6107\"><strong><u>Designing agent incentives to avoid side effects</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> penalizing the model for disrupting factors of the environment that are not dependent on its goal, or exploiting features of it in order to maximize its reward in an unwanted way.</li></ul><p>The approaches that I consider the most promising of those, as they are feasible to implement in real-life artificial agents and generalize to most of them, are&nbsp;<strong>Inverse Reward Design</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Active Inverse Reward Design</strong>.

This reduces the immediate risk of human extinction due to the AI causing great harm, and the negative influences the AI can have in society in general, which can indirectly be an existential threat.</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Next steps</h1><h2>Improving efficiency/usability</h2><h3>Other query selection methods</h3><p>In this project, I only used one query selection method from those that are used in the AIRD paper, the one where the query is increased by size one each time, after randomly sampling some weights and optimizing them. I also only used queries of size 5.</p><p>However, other query methods are more efficient in the original paper, but more computationally expensive, so I wasn\u2019t able to run them on my PC. I will try to optimize them and integrate them into RBAIRD (my approach), in order to compare their efficiency and performance, and maybe achieve better results.</p><h3>More efficient risk-averse planning method</h3><p>Until now, I have only tried using some simple, per-state, risk-averse reward functions, that simply take the worst-case scenario or penalize the variance in some way. However, they lead to the so-called&nbsp;<i>blindness to success</i>, and there are more efficient, but more complicated, methods that improve that aspect and gain performance-wise, and possibly reduce the expected variance even more. I will try to implement these, and evaluate their performance, regarding the maximum reward and the uncertainty of the actions.</p><h3>Answering each query in multiple environments at once</h3><p>What the code currently does is it makes a single query in each iteration, that is optimized along all environments, but then gets an answer for each environment (total number of answers = number of environments in each batch, but we have the same query in each environment). This answer depicts which function performs better in that specific environment, relative to the true reward function.&nbsp;</p><p>What would be more efficient, is to answer each query once for all environments, showing which reward function shows better behavior in general, not specific performance to that environment. This would greatly reduce the number of query answers needed, and maybe make it less computationally expensive. However, then the human has a more difficult task to do, and the selection is a bit ambiguous, since there is no clear measure of \u201cbetter behavior\u201d about a reward function, since each one incentivizes different behaviors to a different extent.</p><h3>Making an interactive query-answer environment</h3><p>Currently, the program does not actively ask for a human to answer each query, but it is given the true reward function and predicts the expected answer based on that. Something that would demonstrate how a human would be able to judge and compare different reward functions, is to make an interactive environment where the human can answer the query, given various types of information.&nbsp;</p><p>It could show the trajectories that are computed based on each reward function, in a single or multiple environments (maybe choose the environments where their behavior would differ a lot, or where a single feature is prevalent in each environment). Also, it could provide various metrics about the performance of the reward function regarding various features, or some other high-level patterns that are observed, but this is a bit ambiguous and related to mechanistic interpretability. It could also provide the risk-averse and the unsafe performance of the planner in various steps of the query process, in order for the human to be able to judge what behavior the agent adopts (as a safety measure)</p><h2>Long-term actions</h2><ul><li>Write a research paper on the approach, describing and evaluating the process and the above changes, changing various parameters, and demonstrating its capability to improve various aspects of AI Alignment.</li><li>Work on adapting it to real-life systems, e.g.:<ul><li>Household cleaning robots, to take the trash out without causing damage when encountering a new object or a new house (unknown environments)</li><li>Autonomous farming tractors, in order to avoid unknown surfaces, destroying new plants, or getting stuck in a certain place due to difficult conditions.</li></ul></li><li>Follow a major related to AI, specialize in that sector, and work on improving AI alignment and specifically applying the knowledge I gained from the project to other subproblems of it.</li></ul><h1>Related work/References</h1><p>Barnes, B.

Travelling across timezones can lead to jet lag, where our circadian rhythms are disrupted by a sudden change in day and night cycles.</p><p>The circadian rhythms are a collection of ~24-hour cyclic processes that manage many bodily functions, including wakefulness and sleep (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S6683\">Vosko et al 2010</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60529-7\">Waterhouse et al 2007</a>). A part of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) acts as a master regulator of these rhythms. The rhythm of the SCN itself is maintained by photosensitive cells in your eyes, which get more light during daytime hours and less light during nighttime hours.&nbsp;</p><p>The SCN regulates the circadian rhythms in several ways, such as through direct neural influence, central nervous system influence, and hormonal influence, such as signalling the pineal gland to produce melatonin in the absence of light, or suppress melatonin in the presence of light.&nbsp;</p><p>When you shift timezones, the pattern of daylight and nighttime abruptly changes; the SCN now receives signals from the retina that are very different from its existing rhythm. As a result, the circadian system is disrupted, leading the individual rhythms to desynchronise from each other and the SCN master regulator. Over several days, the rhythms readjust based on the new pattern of light and dark from the destination timezone.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, you may experience symptoms like waking up and going to sleep at the wrong time, being alert / active and being drowsy / lethargic at the wrong time, sleeping for the wrong length of time (e.g., only 3-4 hours even though you usually sleep through the night), changes in appetite and digestion, and mood. This is jet lag!</p><h1><strong>Jet lag can be effectively managed by seeking and avoiding light at specific times</strong></h1><p>Systematic reviews for interventions to manage jet lag have found mostly poor quality evidence (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001520\">Herxheimer &amp; Petrie 2002</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2019-101635\">Janse van Rensburg et al 2020</a>).</p><p>The most effective interventions rely on seeking or avoiding bright light during the period before and after cross-timezone travel, accelerating the natural adaptation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.&nbsp;</p><p>Other interventions with some positive evidence include using melatonin, using caffeine, shifting sleep schedules, or shifting food times. Each of these interventions is based around accelerating adaptation to the destination timezone. This means that they might be in tension with other needs and goals relevant to your lifestyle or travel (e.g., do you need caffeine to stay awake for a presentation on the first day at your destination? Are you willing to go to bed at 8pm on the last night of your trip?)</p><h2><strong>Seeking and avoiding bright light</strong></h2><p>The primary method of managing jet lag is to seek and avoid bright light at times consistent with daytime and nighttime at the destination timezone.</p><p>The specific pattern of seeking and avoiding light depends on your home timezone and a destination timezone.</p><p>In general:</p><ul><li>If your destination timezone is later / ahead / eastward than your home timezone, you should seek light early in the morning and avoid light late in the afternoon and evening.</li><li>If your destination timezone is earlier / behind / westward than your home timezone, you should avoid light early in the morning and seek light late in the afternoon and evening.</li></ul><p>It\u2019s important to recognise that online information often refers to \u2018eastward\u2019 and \u2018westward\u2019 travel and uses terms like \u2018earlier\u2019 or \u2018later\u2019; this is easiest to understand in the United States and Europe, but becomes complicated for very long haul travel or travel that crosses the International Date Line (e.g., Australia to UK; China to the US).</p><h2><strong>Using melatonin</strong></h2><p>Melatonin can be useful to further accelerate adaptation if synchronised with desired regular sleep times at the destination timezone; a systematic review found no difference in efficacy between 0.5mg and 5mg dose (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001520\">Herxheimer &amp; Petrie 2002</a>).&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Using caffeine</strong></h2><p>Caffeine may be useful to help stay awake for other adaptation activities (e.g., seeking/avoiding light, sleep schedule), but can reduce sleep quality and make adaptation worse.</p><h2><strong>Shifting sleep schedule</strong></h2><p>Napping during transit can be helpful for staying awake until bedtime at the destination timezone, so long as this doesn\u2019t interfere with seeking / avoiding light.</p><p>Trying to sleep and wake at times consistent with the destination timezone (e.g., while in transit) can be helpful for adaptation, and can also help to reduce the fatigue of travel.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Shifting food times</strong></h2><p>Changing your meal times to align with the destination time may be helpful for improving lifestyle and digestive adaptation to the destination.</p><h2><strong>Caveats</strong></h2><p>The relevance and usefulness of these interventions depends on when you are travelling (e.g., during the day or night), how you are travelling (e.g., stopovers or flight changes), opportunities, needs and responsibilities before and after travel (e.g., work and caring responsibilities, social events), and other factors.</p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting that jet lag and travel fatigue are separate issues that are experienced concurrently. So even if you reduce the disruption of circadian rhythms from jet lag, you may still have flown 8+ hours in a cramped seat and feel exhausted!</p><h1><strong>Example management plan for jet lag: London to New York City</strong></h1><p>In this management plan, the traveller is flying from a home timezone of London UTC+0, to a destination timezone of New York City UTC-5. This is so-called 'westward' travel, where NYC is earlier than / behind London.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Timezones</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Home (London): UTC+0</p><p>Destination (New York City): UTC-5</p><p>9am in London is 4am in New York City</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Common terms of comparison</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>New York City is earlier than London</p><p>New York City is behind London</p><p>New York City is \u2018westward\u2019 from London</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Example flight</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Virgin Atlantic VS45</p><p>13:20 LHR - 16:25 JFK (8 hour flight)</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Jet lag management plan</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Avoid bright light in the morning (e.g., wear sunglasses everywhere) and seek bright light in the evening before you leave London.

While we no longer project raising $1 billion in 2025, our research team has risen to the challenge and has found more cost-effective funding opportunities than we expect we'll be able to fund.</p>\n<p>Open Philanthropy isn't yet sure what level of funding it might provide for GiveWell's recommendations after 2025, if it renews its support. Our outreach team is ramping up its fundraising efforts so that we can help as many people as possible, and we expect to support hundreds of millions of dollars worth of outstanding programs regardless of Open Philanthropy's funding trajectory.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/04/10/expected-funds-raised-through-2025/#our_updated_forecasts\">goal</a> is still to reach $500 million in funds raised from donors other than Open Philanthropy by 2025; the update on Open Philanthropy's giving doesn't represent a change in what we expect from other donors. Reaching $500 million annually would represent a substantial increase from the roughly $250 million<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-3\" id=\"fnref-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-3\">[3]</a></sup> we raised, excluding Open Philanthropy, in 2022.</p>\n<p>As of today, our cost-effectiveness bar is still <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models#grantmaking\">10x cash</a> (i.e., we fund opportunities we believe are at least 10 times as cost-effective as giving unconditional cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-4\" id=\"fnref-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-4\">[4]</a></sup> Over the next few months, we intend to revise our <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/04/10/expected-funds-raised-through-2025/#our_updated_forecasts\">projections</a> of funds raised and available funding opportunities, which may lead us to update our bar. If it changes, we'll share that publicly.</p>\n<p><strong>More background on GiveWell and Open Philanthropy</strong></p>\n<p>Open Philanthropy and GiveWell are longtime partners. Open Philanthropy originated as a <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/announcing-givewell-labs/\">project</a> within GiveWell, working in partnership with Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz, and then became an <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/the-open-philanthropy-project-is-now-an-independent-organization/\">independent organization</a>. We still work together closely, discussing research questions of mutual interest. We've been in conversation with Open Philanthropy about its giving plans as they've developed.</p>\n<p>Our goals are very similar; we're both aiming to identify the opportunities that can do the most good per dollar donated. Within this similar space, our approaches are somewhat different. GiveWell recommends giving opportunities to the public, <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/transparency\">publishing its research and analysis</a> to provide donors with confidence that their giving is having a large impact. Open Philanthropy primarily gives away Cari and Dustin\u2019s money, and it often focuses on more speculative opportunities with a <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/hits-based-giving/\">hits-based giving</a> approach. For example, Open Philanthropy is more likely to fund the development of potential vaccines, whereas GiveWell is more likely to fund the <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/05/12/why-givewell-funded-malaria-vaccine-rollout/\">rollout</a> of existing vaccines.</p>\n<p>We work on some of the same causes, such as global health, but Open Philanthropy funds work in a wider variety of areas both within its Global Health and Wellbeing programs (e.g., Farm Animal Welfare) and through its Global Catastrophic Risks programs.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Open Philanthropy's spending is changing</strong></p>\n<p>Open Philanthropy's view of GiveWell's recommendations hasn't changed. It's reducing its grantmaking to GiveWell because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less overall funding is available for its Global Health and Wellbeing programs (an area of work that includes its funding to GiveWell as well as programs like Farm Animal Welfare and Global Health R&amp;D) due to a combination of decreased assets and a shift in strategy toward opportunities in other areas.</li>\n<li>Roughly 75% of the funding Open Philanthropy expects to spend internally in Global Health and Wellbeing in 2024 is already pre-committed to specific programs within Open Philanthropy's portfolio, decreasing the pool of funding Open Philanthropy could choose to direct through GiveWell.</li>\n<li>Open Philanthropy is setting a cost-effectiveness threshold for its uncommitted Global Health and Wellbeing funding that it believes may be slightly higher than GiveWell's cost-effectiveness bar in the future, although Open Philanthropy is uncertain how our opportunities will ultimately compare to one another and it's difficult to compare across cause areas and different methodologies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-5\" id=\"fnref-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-5\">[5]</a></sup>\nWe don't yet have a well-developed opinion on how our recommendations compare to Open Philanthropy's non-GiveWell Global Health and Wellbeing grantmaking. We look forward to collaborating with Open Philanthropy to better understand how its grants and our funding opportunities compare in terms of impact per dollar. We value the opportunity to learn from each other's work, and we'll both be considering whether we could increase our impact by incorporating aspects of each other's approaches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also appreciate that Open Philanthropy's leadership continues to see our recommendations as a gold standard for donors even as Open Philanthropy's grantmaking evolves. As they write,</p>\n<pre><code>\"When it comes to evidence-backed, scalable global health interventions, we don\u2019t know of another resource for donors that is remotely comparable; GiveWell continues to set the gold standard in our eyes. Regardless of what happens with our respective bars over the next few years, we\u2019re confident that GiveWell\u2019s recommendations will remain a stellar resource for donors looking for outstanding giving opportunities, and we\u2019re proud to be able to support their work.\"\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The impact of a gift to GiveWell's recommended programs</strong></p>\n<p>We're grateful for Open Philanthropy's support, which has funded opportunities we think are <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-planned-allocation-to-givewells-recommendations-for-the-next-few-years/#where-our-funding-to-givewells-recommendations-ultimately-goes\">outstanding</a>. With $300 million from Open Philanthropy over the next three years, we believe we'll be able to fund programs that will save tens of thousands of lives.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-6\" id=\"fnref-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>However, like <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/07/05/update-on-givewells-funding-projections/\">last year</a>, we're funding-constrained; that is, we expect to identify more high-impact giving opportunities than we can fully fund, likely including some that we believe can save a life for roughly $7,500. Without increased giving from our donors, some of those programs will go unfunded, which may mean the difference between life and death for the people those programs would serve. <a href=\"https://secure.givewell.org/\">Your support</a> will help fill those gaps.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This refers to funds raised for the programs we recommend.

GiveWell has more of a unified decision-making process, and creates more comparable cost-effectiveness analyses across its grants (which can be done more straightforwardly for the type of grantmaking we focus on, although it's still very much subject to uncertain assumptions). Open Philanthropy generally staffs its work with subject-matter experts leading its programs in specific areas, who have more discretion over spending within their programs. <a href=\"#fnref-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-B3srKiNhQEzGfKWSM-6\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>We believe that our four top charities each avert a death for very roughly $5,000 on average. $300 million divided by $5,000 per life saved would yield 60,000 lives saved, if our estimates are accurate and if all funding went to life-saving programs like our top charities. Some of our funding is directed to programs that primarily aim to increase consumption (e.g., deworming) or to other opportunities, like research. Some of our funding to top charities may go to opportunities where the cost to avert a death is closer to $7,500. And a small portion of Open Philanthropy's giving will go to GiveWell's operating costs.

These programs distribute preventive antimalarial drugs to young children during the malaria season, in areas where transmission rates are high; they are a highly efficient way to combat malaria. GiveWell\u2019s funding to Malaria Consortium <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobTref/status/1696996398246580622\"><u>represents a large portion</u></a> of the global scaleup of SMC.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/evidence-action-syphilis-screening-and-treatment/\"><u>$13.2 million to Evidence Action</u></a> to support its work providing technical assistance in Zambia and Cameroon to scale up syphilis testing and treatment in pregnancy.

In July 2022, it was roughly in the range of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-our-planned-allocation-to-givewells-recommended-charities-in-2022/#how-we-chose-this-years-allocation-to-givewell\"><u>1100x-1200x</u></a>; we recently raised it to slightly over 2000x.

Our current plans are within the range we\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/#gcr_allocation\"><u>communicated</u></a> <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/alexander-berger-improving-global-health-wellbeing-clear-direct-ways/#how-much-to-allocate-to-different-umbrellas-015654\"><u>publicly</u></a> in the past, but represent a lower GHW funding trajectory than we had internally anticipated over the last couple of years. We now expect our GHW spending over the next couple of years to be at roughly 2021 levels. We\u2019ve had a lot of volatility on this front over the last few years, and much of our current thinking is focused on trying to make sure we preserve optionality over the near term.</li><li>Our push <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/givewells-top-charities-are-increasingly-hard-to-beat/#it-should-be-possible-to-outperform-the-givewell-top-charities\"><u>since 2019</u></a> to identify causes that \u201c[combine] multiple sources of leverage for philanthropic impact (e.g., advocacy, scientific research, helping the global poor) to get more humanitarian impact per dollar (for instance via advocacy around scientific research funding or policies, or scientific research around global health interventions, or policy around global health and development)\u201d has led to new programs in <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/south-asian-air-quality/\"><u>South Asian air quality</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-aid-policy/\"><u>global aid policy</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/innovation-policy/\"><u>innovation policy</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/ea-global-health-and-wellbeing/\"><u>effective altruism with a GHW focus</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-health-rd/\"><u>global health R&amp;D</u></a>. Those programs have significantly increased our ability to find high-ROI opportunities, which in turn means that for a given amount of GHW funding, the \u201cbar\u201d will be higher (because we have found more opportunities at higher levels).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How GiveWell\u2019s impressive growth and our higher Global Health and Wellbeing bar influence our current plans</strong></h2><p>As we <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-our-planned-allocation-to-givewells-recommended-charities-in-2022/#how-changes-in-assets-influence-optimal-allocation-across-portfolio-areas\"><u>discussed last year</u></a>, changes in our bar disproportionately affect funding for opportunities that are scalable and close to our bar:</p><p>\u201cSome portfolios or categories of interventions will have many grants with cost-effectiveness near the bar. Those grants could be ruled in or out by small fluctuations in the bar, so our giving in those categories will be especially sensitive to changes in asset values. Others will have most of their grants far above or far below the bar, which means our giving in those categories will not be very sensitive to changes in asset values [or the bar].\u201d</p><p>The marginal GiveWell recommendations tend to be more \u201celastic\u201d (i.e., decline less in cost-effectiveness with more funding) and closer to our bar, for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>GiveWell has grown and matured impressively</strong> over the last few years, and has built a strong base of donors: in <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/04/10/expected-funds-raised-through-2025/\"><u>April</u></a> their median projection for funding raised in 2024 from sources other than Open Philanthropy was <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/sources/blog-post/expected-funds-raised-through-2025#5\"><u>$421 million</u></a>, compared to ~$117 million <a href=\"https://files.givewell.org/files/metrics/GiveWell_Metrics_Report_2019.pdf\"><u>five years earlier</u></a>. This makes GiveWell\u2019s projected support from non-OP donors roughly twice as large as OP\u2019s projected non-farm animal welfare, non-GiveWell GHW giving in 2024.<ul><li>Having that funding available allows GiveWell to cover many of its highest-ROI opportunities regardless of our support. Given that independent funding base, even if the distribution of opportunities GiveWell was selecting from was the same as the distribution of other GHW opportunities, the existence of other donors would mean that <i>our</i> support for GiveWell was on the flatter part of the curve, and therefore should be more elastic than the underlying opportunity set. (Note that we think in terms of <i>marginal </i>funding. We expect GiveWell to find opportunities far above our bar each year, but as noted above, we expect those to be covered by other donors, such that our funding on the margin would be close to our bar. This isn\u2019t as true for most of our other GHW areas.)</li><li>By contrast, we are a much larger portion of the funding available in many other areas where we work. Relative to the size of the opportunity space in farm animal welfare (to name one example), the amount of funding from other donors is quite low, and some of our highest-ROI opportunities would often go unfunded without our support.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Separately, as we\u2019ve said <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-updates-to-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework/#43-increases-to-our-estimate-of-future-available-assets\"><u>before</u></a>, GiveWell\u2019s marginal recommendations are more often (though not exclusively) \u201cscalable, commodities-driven global health interventions\u2026 than opportunities like R&amp;D or advocacy that are more people-intensive (where we have a prior that returns tend to be more like logarithmic, which is more steeply declining [in cost-effectiveness with more funding] than our model of the GiveWell top charities).\u201d By contrast, our other GHW programs tend to investigate opportunities involving research, advocacy, or other relatively inelastic activities. These tend to have high returns from initial funding, which more steeply decline with additional funding, even separate from their different funding bases.</li></ul><p>So, reversing the order of the points above, we both think that the abstract GiveWell returns curve is flatter than in other spaces where we work, and even conditional on that, GiveWell\u2019s large base of other donors pushes our marginal support into an even flatter part of the curve. Accordingly, as we\u2019ve noted <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-updates-to-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework/#43-increases-to-our-estimate-of-future-available-assets\"><u>previously</u></a>, our support for GiveWell\u2019s recommendations should be (and has been) disproportionately responsive to changes in assets and the bar.</p><p>More mechanically, in the near term, we expect a small wedge between our estimates for our GHW bar and GiveWell\u2019s bar, possibly on the order of 0-30% but with a wide margin of error. We think that means less than one might naively expect for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>While a small difference in actual expected impact could obviously be very substantial at this scale, we <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\"><u>don\u2019t think you can take these expected value estimates literally</u></a>, and we see a small difference in <i>estimated/projected </i>ROI as <strong>well within the margin of error of these estimates</strong>. And as we note below, our estimate of this wedge could shrink (or the sign could change) as we continue to engage with GiveWell.</li><li>GiveWell and GHW use our bars differently. Our perception is that GiveWell has more unified decision-making \u2014 it\u2019s much closer to the platonic ideal of having a single list of grants, sorting it by estimated cost-effectiveness, and then funding grants until the budget is exhausted. For GHW, while centralized decision-makers review every grant, we think much more in terms of annual budgets for programs, and tend to be <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-grantmaking-so-far-approach-and-process/#rule_50_40_10\"><u>more (but far from absolutely) deferential to program staff within their budget envelopes</u></a>. This is related to differences in grant size and number (GiveWell makes fewer bigger grants) and staff composition (OP has historically been more likely than GiveWell to hire subject matter experts as program officers). As a result, we think GiveWell\u2019s bar binds its grant decisions much more than GHW\u2019s does in practice. Additionally, roughly ~75% of our internal GHW spending projected for 2024 is based on budget commitments we made to program officers in prior years; the place where we expect the GHW bar in particular to weigh most heavily in the near term is around the decision on whether to launch new programs (which usually come with large multi-year budget commitments to be able to attract top candidates), and then over time it will also weigh in annual budget setting processes. Accordingly, we\u2019d still expect there to be individual GHW grants over the next few years that OP leadership inside-view thinks are below this bar.</li></ul><p>So our support for GiveWell\u2019s recommendations should be more responsive to changes in the bar than our other GHW giving, and we expect a small wedge in estimated/projected cost-effectiveness between our bar and GiveWell\u2019s. We\u2019re making a large multi-year commitment in spite of that because:</p><ul><li><strong>As discussed above, we\u2019re not sure how real the gaps in expected cost-effectiveness will actually turn out to be.</strong> We\u2019re excited to continue collaborating closely with GiveWell over the next few years to get their critical engagement on assumptions we\u2019re making, to see whether the current projected differences in fact manifest, and then, if they do materialize, to look for ways on both sides to reduce them and make sure that the best opportunities get funded regardless of organizational boundaries. As we undergo this process, it\u2019s possible the wedge in marginal cost-effectiveness will turn out to be smaller than we think or even not materialize. But if the wedge turns out to be real and persistent, it\u2019s possible this could be our final large-scale commitment to GiveWell\u2019s recommendations.</li><li>We committed $350M to GiveWell\u2019s recommendations last year. We feel an obligation to them and to the organizations they support given our long-term partnership; we want to make sure that we handle large changes in our funding trajectory in a reasonably gradual and responsible way. As we said above, we\u2019ve been in conversation with them about these potential changes over the course of this year, and the prospect has shaped their gradual spending out of our 2022 commitment. But even with that, we didn\u2019t want to overreact to a potential wedge in cost-effectiveness, and wanted to give GiveWell some support to help transition in the event that the wedge does turn out to be real and persistent.</li><li>Finally, given the volatility of the last few years and uncertainty about the future, we want to give GiveWell a few years of predictable support from us so they can plan effectively and so we have plenty of time to sync up on the first point above.</li><li>We think this will be an impactful grant, even if we aren\u2019t yet sure how it will compare to other opportunities we could support with our uncommitted funding. GiveWell estimates that its top charities each prevent a death for around $5,000, so we expect the programs funded by this grant to save tens of thousands of lives, mostly among young children.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>This means that the marginal GiveWell opportunity will be at least as strong as in past years</strong></h2><p>All of the changes in the GiveWell allocation here are coming from changes on our side. Both we and GiveWell expect that GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness margin over the next year or two will be as strong or potentially stronger than in past years. So for donors who have supported GiveWell in the past or been on the margin of doing so, we think the marginal GiveWell opportunity today looks at least as promising as it did last year or the year before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2><p>Open Philanthropy <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/announcing-givewell-labs/\"><u>began as a project of GiveWell</u></a>, and one of us (Alexander) began his career there. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elie-hassenfeld-92072a9\"><u>Elie Hassenfeld</u></a>, GiveWell\u2019s CEO, serves on Open Phil\u2019s board, and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/cari-tuna/\"><u>Cari Tuna</u></a>, our main funder, serves on GiveWell\u2019s. The two organizations continue to see our missions and outlooks as extremely aligned.</p><p>And in our personal charitable giving, both of us continue to use, and aggressively evangelize, GiveWell\u2019s recommendations. When it comes to evidence-backed, scalable global health interventions, we don\u2019t know of another resource for donors that is remotely comparable; GiveWell continues to set the gold standard in our eyes. Regardless of what happens with our respective bars over the next few years, we\u2019re confident that GiveWell\u2019s recommendations will remain a stellar resource for donors looking for outstanding giving opportunities, and we\u2019re proud to be able to support their work.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnnkw20hfb3te\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefnkw20hfb3te\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:676px\"><table style=\"background-color:white;border-color:\"><thead><tr><th style=\"border-color:;padding:0px\">Note that we and GiveWell express cost-effectiveness in different units.

He claims that there is a potential for a <i>massive</i> animal welfare win, if we can eliminate this parasite.&nbsp;</p><p>This feels worthy of a discussion, so I'm starting this thread. Is this issue on anyone's radar? Has anyone looked into these claims? They seem potentially important/actionable, if true!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Relevant section from the podcast:</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> [...] the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochliomyia\">New World screwworm</a>, which has the amazing scientific name of <i>Cochliomyia hominivorax</i>: \u201cthe man devourer.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t primarily eat humans; it feeds indiscriminately on warm-blooded things, so mammals and birds. It\u2019s a botfly that lays its eggs in open wounds, anything as small as a tick bite. And it\u2019s called the screwworm because the larvae are screw-shaped and they drill their way into living flesh, devouring it. And as they do, they cultivate bacteria that attract new gravid females that lay more eggs and continue the cycle.</p><p>So you have this macabre dance of parasitisation that results in the animal being devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots. And we know that it\u2019s horrendously painful, because people get affected by this, and the standard of treatment is you give them morphine immediately so that surgeons can cut the things out \u2014 because it\u2019s just that painful; it\u2019s unbelievably agonising. And by my back-of-the-envelope calculations, there\u2019s about a billion hosts of this every year \u2014 so a billion animals are devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots every single year.</p><p>We even know that we can eradicate this species from at least many ecosystems and not see any effects, because it used to be present in North America too, and we wiped it out using nuclear technology, oddly enough. Some clever folks noticed if you irradiate the larvae, then they grow up sterile. And if you release enough of them, then the wild ones will mate with a sterile one, and they only mate once, so you can suppress the population to the point of not being there anymore.</p><p>So we did this first up through Florida and then across the West, and then down through Texas to the Mexican border. The US Department of Agriculture then inked a deal with the Mexican government to eradicate them from Mexico because the southern border was shorter and therefore cheaper. And then they just went country by country down Central America to Panama. The southern border of Panama is the shortest, so American taxpayer dollars today contribute to the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/flesh-eating-worms-disease-containment-america-panama/611026/\">creation and maintenance of a living wall of sterile screwworm flies</a> released in southern Panama that prevents the South American screwworm from reinvading North America \u2014 10 million released every week.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Wow.</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> But there\u2019s too many of them in South America to wipe out by that means. And so the way forward is obviously gene drive. If the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercosur\">Mercosur</a> countries agree that they want to get rid of the New World screwworm, they can start with something like a daisy drive locally \u2014 and Uruguay is working on this \u2014 then they can wipe it out from their country. Uruguay loses about 0.1% of their total country\u2019s GDP to the screwworm because they\u2019re so dependent on animal exports. I mean, Uruguay and beef is\u2026 To those listeners who eat beef, I\u2019m going to start fights here, but it\u2019s better than beef from Argentina, even. But anyway, they\u2019re all very concerned about their beef, and screwworm is horrific.</p><p>It also, of course, preferentially hurts poor farmers who struggle to afford the veterinary treatments for their animals. And of course, they hate to see it, because here you\u2019re watching these animals that you\u2019re caring for literally get devoured by flesh-eating maggots, and it\u2019s agonisingly painful.</p><p>But from an animal wellbeing perspective, in addition to the human development, the typical lifetime of an insect species is several million years. So 10<sup>6</sup> years times 10<sup>9</sup> hosts per year means an expected 10<sup>15</sup> mammals and birds devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots. For comparison, if we continue factory farming for another 100 years, that would be 10<sup>13</sup> broiler hens and pigs. So unless it\u2019s 100 times worse to be a factory-farmed broiler hen than it is to be devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots, then when you integrate over the future, it is more important for animal wellbeing that we eradicate the New World screwworm from the wild than it is that we end factory farming tomorrow.</p><h3><strong>The ethics of CRISPR </strong><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/kevin-esvelt-stealth-wildfire-pandemics/?t=9514\"><strong>[02:38:34]</strong></a></h3><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> What a take. I also love the application of gene drives for animal suffering in particular. I\u2019d heard of many applications for human benefit, but the idea that we could make a dent on some <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/wild-animal-welfare/\">wild animal suffering</a> was just really moving to me. I feel like there are loads of concerns about kind of messing with an ecosystem. In this case, it\u2019s already happening, just through a different method that can\u2019t be scaled up \u2014 so it just seems like a really great case of how we\u2019ve got this way to scale it up much bigger, eradicate this horrible insect in more places.</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> It might matter to some listeners, they might be concerned about the moral implications of actually driving a species to extinction. Which, of course, is also what we\u2019re proposing for the malaria parasite (but not the mosquitoes) and also for the schistosoma. But for something that is not a major human disease, that\u2019s [not] a microbe, here we\u2019d be proposing eradicating the screwworm itself \u2014 the fly, the macroscopic thing from the ecosystem everywhere in the world.</p><p>But it\u2019s worth noting that this is actually reversible, because screwworm is one of those comparatively few insects whereby you can freeze the larvae and unfreeze them decades later and they\u2019re perfectly viable. So we don\u2019t have to drive them extinct, we just need to remove them from the wild and then we can keep them on ice. So if for some reason we decide we need them again later, we can reintroduce them. It\u2019s just we\u2019ve got to ensure, if you want the animal welfare benefit\u2026</p><p>One of the things that really I find attractive is, when you think about how much suffering humans have inflicted on animals in the course of our species, it almost certainly does not outweigh 10<sup>15</sup> mammals and birds devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots. So to the extent that we\u2019re now net negative on the scale, all we have to do is, before civilisation collapses, or we disassemble the Earth or whatever futurists think we\u2019re going to be doing \u2014 or even if we lose, even if we fail and civilisation collapses, or even we go extinct \u2014 as long as we remove the New World screwworm first, we will be in morally net positive territory when it comes to our impacts on other species\u2019 wellbeing.

I work for Metaculus and this is part of a broader exploration of how we can compare forecasting performance.&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>\"Which one of two forecasters is the better one?\" is a question of great importance. Countless internet points and hard-earned bragging rights are at stake. But it is also a question of great practical concern to decision makers. Imagine you are king Odysseus of Ithaca and you urgently need counsel for important government affairs. You vividly remember the last time you went away on a journey and now ask yourself: Is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia\">Delphi</a> really worth the extra mile, or is the oracle of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodona\">Dodona</a> just as good?&nbsp;</p><p>Being Odysseus, a man of cunning, you quickly think of ways to obtain more knowledge. The obvious answer, of course, would be to run a forecasting tournament between the two oracles. But how many forecasting questions do you need? Divine revelations are expensive. And once the questions resolve and one oracle comes out ahead, how sure can you be that the winning oracle is really <i>better</i>? Oracling is not an exact science and sometimes, after all, the gods do play dice. Even a perfect oracle (who always reports a probability equal to the true probability of an event) will sometimes look bad if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna\">Tyche</a> is not on her side.&nbsp;</p><h2>Methods</h2><p>You quickly decide you need to run a simulation study. That way you will know the 'true probabilities' of events. You can easily compare a perfect forecaster with a noisy forecaster and see whether the difference comes out as significant. You want to look at binary outcomes, meaning that either an event happens (outcome = 1) or it doesn't (outcome = 0). You also decide to restrict the analysis to only two forecasters to avoid issues with multiple comparisons and additional complications. Battles become complicated if too many factions are involved.&nbsp;</p><p>You choose to do a thousand replications of your experiment. For every replication, you simulate 1000 true probabilities, observations and corresponding forecasts. You then add increasing amounts of noise to the forecasts, score them, and then do a paired t-test to check whether there would be a significant difference between a noisy forecaster and a perfect forecaster.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a qualitative difference between a forecast that is moved from 50% to 55% and one that is moved from 94.5% to 99.5%. The former is only a small update, whereas the latter corresponds to a massive increase in confidence. This becomes obvious when you convert the probabilities to odds (odds = p / (1 - p)). The move from 50% to 55% would mean a move from 10:10 to 11:9 expressed as odds. the move from 94.5% to 99.5% would mean a move from 189:11 to 1990:10. To reflect this, you decide to convert your probabilities to log odds, add some normally distributed noise, and convert back to probabilities: &nbsp;</p><p><span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{noisy odds} = \\log \\left(\\text{true probability} / (1 - \\text{true probability}) + \\mathcal{N}(0, \\text{noise level})\\right)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em;

This is the one they should listen to. The last simulation (Figure 3) suggests that a noticeably better forecaster has a decent chance of winning a direct comparison. The problem is that even if both forecasters are equally good, one of them has to win. The mere fact that one of them won is <i>some</i> evidence they are better, but not that much. Even with a quite noticeable difference in performance and in an ideal scenario, it takes quite a few questions to make a decision at a standard 5%-significance level. This is important to know, and we should adjust our expectations accordingly whenever we try to compare between two forecasters, forecasting platforms, or oracles.&nbsp;</p><p>You, Odysseus, sit down on a rock. \"How, by Zeus, am I supposed to run 500 questions by the oracles of Dodona and Delphi?

These parties are minor (niche) parties. Animal parties can usually only win seats in elections that use proportional representation.</p><p>There are a few ways that animal parties can influence the lives of animals. The main way is by winning seats in legislatures and exercising power over legislation, government budgets, and so on. Animal parties can also influence policy in ways that do not necessarily require winning elections, such as obtaining policy concessions from other parties and setting the political agenda.</p><p>Currently, animal parties have won seats in national and sub-national legislatures in five countries (Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal). The track record of the animal parties in these countries shows that the impact is positive and moderate, though massive wins do happen sometimes. The impact falls into four main categories:</p><ul><li>Large policy wins, which seem rare but enormous (i.e., hits-based). These crop up on the rare occasions when the policy agenda and the specific makeup of the legislature provide a window for an animal party to secure large policy concessions from other parties. Examples include major policy changes (e.g. inclusion of fish in animal welfare laws or bans on widespread farming practices like beak trimming) or allocating millions of dollars for animal welfare in national budgets.</li><li>Small policy wins, which seem quite common. Examples include policies that benefit small numbers of animals (e.g. bans on particular types of hunting, restrictions on animal experimentation).</li><li>Shifting the political agenda and influencing the policies of other parties. This effect is notoriously difficult to measure, though it does seem to be positive and meaningful.</li><li>Capitalising on the non-legislative benefits of being an MP. This can include joining parliamentary committees, using the public stature of an MP to gain media attention for animal issues, and using allocated budgets to conduct campaigns outside of parliament.</li></ul><p>In elections, animal parties typically attract just a few percent of the vote (e.g. 0 - 3%). There are numerous jurisdictions around the world where parties can win seats with modest votes like this. We believe that these jurisdictions are low-hanging fruit. Forming parties and contesting elections in these jurisdictions would result in animals gaining representation in a number of additional legislatures. There is less evidence that animal parties can readily expand their vote through advertising - instead, it appears that animal parties are mainly supported by a small core of passionate voters, and that the vote will therefore remain somewhat steady at around 0 - 3% over time. So, we think that the most important consideration is not necessarily advertising or crafting a perfect campaign strategy, but rather&nbsp;<i>picking the right elections to contest</i>, i.e. running in elections where parties can win seats with just a couple of percent of the vote.</p><p>We ask whether there are any legislatures around the world where a) animal parties are not currently contesting elections, and b) an animal party would probably win at least one seat if such a party were formed and contested an election. In some of these jurisdictions, an animal party does exist but it is not contesting all available elections.</p><p>We think that the most promising jurisdictions, along with the number of seats we would expect to win, are as follows:</p><ul><li>Switzerland (Swiss Animal Party /&nbsp;<i>Tierpartei Schweiz</i>): ~8-9 seats (across regional + national legislatures)</li><li>Brazil (Animal Party of Brazil /&nbsp;<i>Partido Animalista</i>): ~2-5 seats (across regional + national legislatures)</li><li>South Africa (new party): ~4 seats (across regional + national legislatures)</li><li>Chile (Animal Party of Chile /&nbsp;<i>Partido Animalista de Chile</i>): ~1 seat (national legislature)</li><li>Israel (Justice for All Party): ~1 seat (national legislature)</li><li>Argentina (new party): ~1 seat (national legislature)</li></ul><p>We also identified a few jurisdictions where the expected number of seats is more modest. Nevertheless, we think that these jurisdictions are still worth considering:</p><ul><li>Norway (new party): ~0-1 seats (national legislature)</li><li>Albania (new party): ~0-1 seats (national legislature)</li><li>Colombia (new party): ~0-1 seats (national legislature)</li><li>Sri Lanka (new party): ~0-1 seats (national legislature)</li><li>Dominican Republic (new party): ~0-1 seats (national legislature)</li></ul><p>We would also recommend for all existing animal parties to ensure that they contest all elections available to them, including elections for state or regional parliaments.</p><p>The next step would be to reach out to local animal advocacy communities (or animal parties, where applicable) in the countries listed above. We have not considered the local contexts of these countries when forecasting the expected number of seats, so our forecasts may need to be adjusted up or down based on local considerations. For Switzerland, Brazil, Chile, and Israel, it would also be important to check whether the existing animal parties are indeed limited by funding.</p><p>We emphasise that all animal parties are great and should be supported, but these are the countries where an initial seed grant from a foundation is likely to generate a disproportionately high impact.</p><p>The costs to funders would be relatively small. These new parties may need financial support to contest the first election in each country. Most of this cost would pay for advertising, an online presence, and enabling a small team to work full-time on an election campaign in the few weeks immediately before the election. We suspect that around ~$30,000 USD would be the upper limit on how much a party would need for the first election. After the first election, the party would usually not require ongoing support from foundations - any elected legislators would receive a salary, the party may be eligible for government funding, and the party may build a base of paying members.</p><p>We also conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to illustrate the impacts that animal parties can have. Basically, the lessons from this analysis are that: costs are low; most elected animal parties can successfully pass small policies (benefiting thousands of wild or companion animals); and some elected animal parties can successfully pass enormous policies (benefiting millions of farmed animals). This approach is difficult to scale as it is limited by the availability of legislatures where seats can be won with just a few percent of the vote. However, given the low costs, the positive impact, and the opportunity for occasional big wins, we think that helping animal parties contest additional elections would be a great part of the movement's portfolio.</p><h1>1. How Do Animal Advocacy Parties Work?</h1><p>This approach involves establishing political parties with an explicit, and typically single-issue, focus on animal advocacy. These parties are almost always minor parties (the only exceptions being when parties join larger alliances, as in France).</p><p>Animal parties can realise impact by pursuing three main strategies. Of course, these strategies can support each other, and each strategy benefits from obtaining votes.</p><ul><li>Winning seats. A few parties have won seats at the national or regional/state levels (see table below). There have also been some successes at the supranational level (European Union) and the local level. When an animal party wins seats, it can influence legislation, which can be a major opportunity for policy influence. It is typically unrealistic for minor parties to implement their own legislation. Parliamentarians can also use their status to gain attention for issues, such as in the media or by building coalitions with other parliamentarians from other parties&nbsp;(1).</li><li>Policy concessions. For example, we illustrated in a previous article how the animal party in Australia can secure pro-animal policies from the government simply by running in elections&nbsp;(2). The election summarised in that article used preferential voting, in which a voter casts their vote by ranking the available candidates. This allowed the animal party to obtain policy concessions from one of the two major parties in exchange for having the animal party's voters rank that party above the competing major party when voting.</li><li>Agenda-setting. For example, the animal party in the Netherlands \"did not seek to implement its own animal welfare proposals directly, but rather it sought to make established parties work harder on animal issues through their participation in elections and in parliament\"&nbsp;(3). Influencing the agenda may be easiest for parties that can win seats, though parties can achieve some influence over the agenda simply by being very active during elections&nbsp;(2).</li></ul><p>Animal parties are unlikely to represent a pathway to victory for the animal advocacy movement on their own. The reason is that the success of animal parties is usually tied to public opinion. Nevertheless, animal parties can have an impact well beyond their level of formal electoral success, so animal parties could form one part of a portfolio of strategies used by the movement.</p><h1>2. Theory of Change</h1><p>The following diagram summarises the mechanisms by which animal parties contesting legislative elections can help animals. The main mechanism is, of course, winning one seat or a handful of seats and then using that position inside the legislature to pass animal welfare laws and to secure pro-animal concessions in other legislator's proposed laws. However, as the diagram shows, this is one mechanism among many. Many of these mechanisms are discussed in detail later in the report (see sections \"8. Track Record of Existing Parties\" and \"10. Academic Literature\").</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kiq83nGBoK8tih4wB/zkhnlwvnjpmqnpbmxjxy\"></p><p>Legend:</p><ul><li>Yellow bubbles = central points in the theory of change</li><li>Blue bubbles = helpful institutional factors that are out of the movement's control but useful to look out for</li><li>Green bubbles = end goal</li></ul><p>Since our analysis is focused on winning just one seat or a handful of seats in a legislature, this raises the question of how much policy influence a party can exert in a large legislature by holding just a handful of seats. On this topic, one cannot generalise - the answer will vary wildly across jurisdictions, and even in the same jurisdiction across terms of parliament.</p><p>On one extreme, there are cases where a single seat gives a minor party the power to make or break governments. We can illustrate using an example from outside animal politics. The Australian 2010 federal election resulted in two MPs striking the jackpot - the election resulted in a hung parliament, where the balance of power during the formation of government was ultimately held by just two independent MPs. These MPs found themselves in a position where they were being courted by the two major parties (which were hoping to form government) with major policy initiatives, high-value development projects in the MPs' districts, and even an offer of a Ministerial position&nbsp;(4,5). If an animal party MP found themselves in this position, the policy impact for animals could be transformative. On the other extreme, there are cases where a government commands a majority of seats, meaning that a single seat held by a minor party would be of little relevance.</p><p>Most of the time, minor parties that win a seat in a legislature would find themselves somewhere in between those extremes. Furthermore, whether an elected animal party finds itself in a powerful legislative position or not, merely holding membership in a legislature can also allow a party to exert policy influence through other means. One such means is sitting on parliamentary committees. For example, a Member of Parliament from the Animal Justice Party in New South Wales, Australia was the chair of the Select Committee on Animal Cruelty Laws (and a member of many other committees). Another way to exert policy influence is by capitalising on the public stature, staff budgets, and travel rights that come with being an MP. People elected to legislatures can use the profile and resources associated with this position to draw attention to their issues. This was exploited by one early legislator from the Australian Greens, who \"for most of her time in parliament concentrated on the outside world\", attracting substantial media attention to her chosen issues&nbsp;(1). It is easy to see how a legislator from an animal party could substantially magnify the attention given to, say, undercover investigations on factory farms.</p><h1>3. Voting Systems and Minor Parties</h1><p>In this report, we are mainly interested in how parties influence policy by winning seats in legislatures or otherwise influencing legislative elections). Our current view is that animal parties can successfully win seats in proportional systems, but this would be extremely difficult in majoritarian systems. Animal parties can certainly have meaningful policy influence without winning seats, but they would need to explore other avenues for achieving impact.</p><h2><strong>3.1 We focus on proportional representation</strong></h2><p>We distinguish between two broad classes of election systems.</p><ul><li>Majoritarian systems. These are also called \"winner-takes-all\" systems because the most popular major parties (typically two major parties) win almost all of the available seats. The percentage of seats won by the major parties typically exceeds their combined percentage of the vote. An example of a majoritarian system is First-Past-the-Post as used in the United States Congress. Importantly, we consider some preferential voting systems to be majoritarian, an example of which is the Instant-Runoff Vote used for the lower house in the Australian Parliament.</li><li>Proportional systems. These systems distribute seats to parties roughly in proportion to the share of the votes that the parties received - a party receiving 10% of the vote can expect to receive about 10% of the available seats. There are a few different mathematical formulae used to distribute the seats. Some jurisdictions have a minimum threshold that parties must surpass before receiving any seats (e.g. 5% of the vote).</li></ul><p>There is also a third type of electoral system - the&nbsp;<i>ni-ni</i> system. This is just a category that captures all miscellaneous systems that aren't accurately described as majoritarian or proportional. This term is an abbreviation of the French phrase \"ni l'un ni l'autre\", meaning \"neither one nor the other\"&nbsp;(6). We do note that, for the purposes of this report, we treat some ni-ni systems as proportional systems (e.g. mixed electoral systems in which voters \"cast separate votes for two sets of seats allocated by different systems, most commonly single-member plurality and proportional representation\"; and proportional with majoritarian incentives, in which \"other electoral rules give incentives to support larger parties\"&nbsp;(6)).</p><p>Animal parties are minor parties. How does the election system influence the success or failure of minor parties?</p><p>When it comes to majoritarian systems, the conventional wisdom is captured by Duverger's law. This law states that majoritarian systems naturally lead to stable, two-party systems in which minor parties are doomed to exclusion from the legislature&nbsp;(7). The mechanism typically offered to explain this pattern is that a voter does not want to \"waste\" their vote by voting for a party that is unlikely to win a seat in that voter's electorate - this leads to voters almost always voting for one or two major parties, which in turn makes minor parties seem like even less viable options&nbsp;(8). In contrast, Duverger concluded that proportional systems naturally lead to multi-party systems, in which minor parties often win seats&nbsp;(7).</p><p>While Duverger's law does hold in many jurisdictions, there are also exceptions. Voters do not always vote in the purely strategic way that is suggested above - evidence from elections shows that voters, even in majoritarian systems, simply vote for the candidate they like the best&nbsp;(8,9).</p><p>Academic research has identified some important circumstances in which minor parties can successfully win seats in majoritarian systems:</p><ul><li>Regionalist parties. Historically, minor parties in majoritarian systems have been most successful when they focus on issues specific to one region, ethnicity or demographic, enabling a minor party to receive high support in a small locality&nbsp;(6,9,10). This effect is magnified in federalist countries: the existence of provincial legislatures \"provides a power base for minor parties that can then be used as a platform for national office\"&nbsp;(11).</li><li>Anti-establishment parties. When voters feel discontent with established parties and frustration at the lack of options, they often express this dissatisfaction by voting for particularly radical minor parties. However, for minor parties to pursue this strategy, they must have policies sufficiently radical that they cannot be co-opted by major parties (e.g. extreme right-wing populism). This means that minor parties may have success where they can a) establish an ideology that is sufficiently distinct and radical to avoid being co-opted, and b) run on an anti-establishment platform to capture dissent in the population&nbsp;(8).</li><li>Centrist parties. Centrist parties can act as a reasonable alternative to the major parties when voters are dissatisfied with the major parties. In particular, Quinn&nbsp;(10) shows that minor, centrist parties are most successful in electoral districts where one major party is highly dominant and the other major party is weak - this enables the minor party to appear as viable as a major party and therefore benefit from tactical and protest voting in those districts. This dynamic is specific to centrist parties.</li></ul><p>More generally, Gerring also found that minor parties in majoritarian systems perform better when voters tend not to identify strongly with mainstream parties, and worse when mainstream parties are strongly organised&nbsp;(11).</p><p>With this understanding in mind, we believe that animal parties (which are minor parties by definition) will typically perform poorly in majoritarian systems:</p><ul><li>Animal parties are not regional. While certain demographics tend to be more supportive of animal welfare than others&nbsp;(12,13), the baseline support for animal parties is small (typically a few percent of the vote), so any correlation between demographics and support for animal welfare is not strong enough to concentrate potential supporters of an animal party into a specific electoral district.</li><li>Animal parties are not really radical. While animal parties often propose some radical policy measures (e.g. the abolition of animal agriculture), animal welfare is not radical as a general topic. This means that major parties, if they feel threatened by an animal party, can safely adopt pro-animal welfare policies and therefore co-opt animal welfare as an issue&nbsp;(2). This means that animal parties cannot cultivate an identity that is truly and stably distinct from major parties&nbsp;(8). We will return to this point, as pressuring major parties into adopting pro-animal welfare policies often represents a major win in its own right. (Related to this point is the fact that radical minor parties can have animal welfare as one policy among many&nbsp;(14), though these parties are not really animal parties.)</li><li>Animal parties are not really centrist. Animal parties are typically associated with left-wing and/or green politics. Notably, some animal parties are not left-wing but are single-issue&nbsp;(15) or even right-wing (e.g. Italy's Animalist Movement, which is not to be confused with Italy's Animalist Party). Animal welfare does attract the support of right-wing parties in some countries (e.g. the UK). In any case, it would be rare for an animal party to be positioned as the most viable centrist party for which dissatisfied voters can submit a protest vote, as required by Quinn's model&nbsp;(10) of centrist parties.</li></ul><p>Based on this reasoning, our current view is that animal parties can win seats in legislatures that are elected by proportional voting systems, and we think that animal parties will find it extremely difficult to win seats in legislatures elected by majoritarian systems. However, animal parties can definitely still influence policy in majoritarian systems - it is just a matter of influencing policy by means other than winning seats. This represents the working hypothesis on which we will structure our analysis in this report, and we would welcome any counter-arguments.</p><h2><strong>3.2 Contesting more elections seems better than spending more on advertising</strong></h2><p>In this report, we adopt the following mindset: we think it is important for animal parties to contest as many (winnable) elections as possible and to support those campaigns with sufficient resources to get the party name on the ballot, to produce an attractive policy platform, and to maintain an online presence. But we are less keen on spending large amounts on advertising for animal parties during election campaigns, once the party has those minimum sufficient resources. This is a working hypothesis, subject to future evidence.</p><p>Tentatively, we believe that advertising for an animal party during an election campaign has a negligible effect on the number of seats won by the party. The alternative view is that advertising&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>important, and that spending more money on advertising during a campaign would allow animal parties to win more seats.</p><p>In favour of the belief that advertising&nbsp;<i>is</i> important:</p><ul><li>It is widely believed that political advertising by mainstream parties has a meaningful effect on their vote. This belief has empirical support in some (but not all) academic studies&nbsp;(16\u201318) and in the observation that mainstream parties almost always spend lots of money on advertising during election campaigns (though that latter observation does not necessarily prove that such spending is an effective use of money)&nbsp;(19). On the other hand, there has been no analysis specific to animal parties, and relatively few analyses specific to minor parties.</li><li>The Party for the Animals in the Netherlands has witnessed a vote that is steadily increasing over time. This suggests that animal parties can increase their vote by building their popularity and profile, and advertising may be one component of this. On the other hand, there is an alternative explanation. Dinas et al&nbsp;(20) show that when small parties enter a legislature, they typically experience a subsequent increase in their vote because having an elected parliamentarian \"signals organisational capacity and candidates\u2019 appeal, and reduces uncertainty about parties\u2019 ideological profile\". So, the increasing profile of the Netherlands may not necessarily be related to any actual marketing.</li><li>In Australia, the Animal Justice Party observes higher votes at election booths where party volunteers hand out flyers to voters as they arrive&nbsp;(2). On the other hand, this may be correlation rather than causation - perhaps naturally higher support in a particular suburb means that there are more people willing to volunteer for the party. Also, it is unclear whether volunteers handing out flyers on election day would have the same effect as paid advertising (e.g. on social media during the election campaign).</li></ul><p>In favour of the belief that advertising&nbsp;<i>is not</i> important (i.e. our assumption for this report):</p><ul><li>There is reason to suspect that animal parties operate differently to mainstream parties (and even differently to other types of minor parties) and are hence an exception to conventional wisdom. One view that is common in the academic literature is that minor parties tend to attract a core of voters who are committed for ideological reasons. For example, Adams et al&nbsp;(21) conclude that minor parties can maximise their votes if they \"maintain their policy appeal to those core voters who are drawn to them for ideological reasons\". For animal parties, this would be a small core of voters who are already strongly committed to animal rights or welfare. Securing votes from other groups of people may be less tractable. Under this view, it is far more important whether the animal party has policies that appeal to this core of voters - in this case, the party simply being on the ballot may be all the advertising that is needed to win the support of this committed core. Whether the voter sees an advertisement for the animal party may therefore be less relevant.&nbsp;</li><li>Votes for existing animal parties are mostly capped within a narrow range (see data in \"5. Expanding Existing Parties\"). It is common for animal parties contesting proportionally-represented elections to receive votes between 0% and 4%, but anything above this is quite rare. This suggests that, at the most, advertising can help within this narrow range, but perhaps not above it.</li><li>The academic literature has found that, in general, advertising \"tend[s] to produce small average effects\"&nbsp;(19). Even if the effect of advertising is above zero, it may be small.</li><li>In one election in Australia, the animal party invested a high marketing spend, but received a much lower vote than expected&nbsp;(2). On the other hand, this is a single data point, and it is impossible to tell if the vote would have been even lower without the advertising.</li></ul><p>We emphasise that the evidence for either of these beliefs is ambiguous. There is simply no data on the effects of political advertising on the vote secured by animal parties. There are a few weak pieces of evidence on both sides of this question. This is why we are sceptical about spending the movement's resources on advertising for animal parties until stronger evidence arises - we are far more confident in spending resources to ensure that animal parties are contesting all (winnable) elections.</p><h1>4.

means the lowest vote in a particular electorate that successfully resulted in winning at least one seat in that electorate. This is&nbsp;<i>not</i> intended to show how popular each party is - rather, this shows how low a party's vote can be while still winning electoral representation.</p><p>**The party in France secured these extremely high votes as part of a larger alliance, due to France's system of running as political alliances. In all other contexts, it is unrealistic for an animal party to achieve a vote this high.</p><p>Note: The Italian Animalist Party did technically win a seat in the 2020 regional election in Campania, though this was a combined nomination with an environmentalist party, so we do not consider this to be a seat held by an animal party.</p><p>There are a couple of key takeaways from this table. Typically, seats have been won in legislatures that use proportional representation. The main exception is France, where the animal party joined a large and well-recognised alliance of parties. In Victoria in Australia, the election system involves a group voting ticket, an uncommon and unpredictable form of voting that can disproportionately benefit minor parties.</p><p>Also, animal parties have often won seats with just 1 - 2% of the primary vote. A vote of this level can be obtained very reliably by animal parties in most places.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, perhaps the most important strategic decision is to&nbsp;<i>pick the right country and legislature</i> in which to contest an election. In Australia, New South Wales and Victoria are the two states with the largest populations, which means that they have the largest state legislatures, which means that they have the lowest vote required to win at least one seat in a state legislature (at least in the proportionally-represented upper houses). Therefore, Australia's animal party has won seats in these legislatures, even though the party receives a very similar vote in other states.</p><p>Beyond representation within countries, some parties have won representation in a supranational legislature: the European Parliament. Members are elected using proportional representation. The parties from Germany (Human Environment Animal Welfare Party), the Netherlands (Party for the Animals), and Portugal (Peoples-Animals-Nature) have won representation in this body. We discuss the European Parliament in greater detail below (see section 7, \"European Parliament\").</p><p>A number of parties, including the ones listed above, have won representation at the local level (e.g. municipalities or local councils). These positions can lead to meaningful policy change for animals at the local level. However, we don't detail these victories here, as the list is long.</p><h1>5. Expanding Existing Parties: Where Could Animal Parties Win More Seats?</h1><h2><strong>5.1 Where do animal parties exist?</strong></h2><p>At least focusing on the strategy of actually winning seats, the best way for the animal advocacy movement to proceed could be to find jurisdictions that a) use proportional representation, b) have large enough legislatures that parties can be elected with just a few percent of the vote, and c) do not already have an existing animal party,&nbsp;<i>or</i> have an animal party that could run in additional legislatures if given extra funding.</p><p>Given the huge number of legislatures worldwide, there is still some low-hanging fruit - this is compounded by the fact that many countries have subnational legislatures at the regional/state levels, and it is common for these subnational legislatures to have power over agricultural policy anyway. Therefore, funding just a few small parties in a handful of countries could increase the power of the animal advocacy movement in legislatures worldwide.</p><p>The following countries have animal parties that have not yet won elected representation in national or regional/state legislatures: Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Moldova, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, the UK, and Turkey&nbsp;(2,22\u201324). The US has an animal party, but no proportionally-elected legislatures. Denmark did have a party, but it seems to have merged into a larger party with a focus on environmentalism rather than explicitly animal welfare&nbsp;(23).</p><h2><strong>5.2 Method: How we forecast the chance of winning a seat</strong></h2><p>In this report, we are interested in finding additional legislatures where animal parties could win seats.&nbsp;</p><p>Proportionally-elected legislatures have an&nbsp;<i>election threshold</i> - this is the minimum vote required for a party to win at least one seat in an election. Some legislatures have legally set thresholds, while others have&nbsp;<i>de facto</i> thresholds determined by the number of seats available. For example, if a legislature has 20 seats, then a party would usually need to win around 5% of the vote to win a seat; but if a legislature has 200 seats, then the party would usually only need to win 0.5% of the vote. Of course, this rule of thumb is influenced by the specific election system used in a jurisdiction: there may be a legal minimum threshold (which would increase the vote required to win at least one seat); voters may be divided into multiple constituencies (which would usually increase the threshold required); votes may be transferable and cast by ranking candidates (which would usually decrease the threshold required); and so on. For our analysis, we estimate a rough ballpark threshold for each legislature based on previous elections in that legislature (combined with any legal thresholds that may exist).</p><p>Now, how can we figure out if a new animal party might exceed the threshold necessary to win a seat? This requires making a prediction about what vote a new animal party might receive. Basically, the most agnostic way to predict a new party's vote is to look at the votes that have been received in the past by animal parties around the world.</p><p>The following graphs show the votes received by all animal parties around the world in elections that use proportional representation. We give rough percentages for the frequency with which votes are received in each interval. We have been quite aggressive in rounding these percentages, as we want to emphasise the fact that our forecasts are quite coarse in precision.</p><p>The top graph shows the raw data. For example, animal parties have received a vote between 0% and 1% in around ~20% of elections in our dataset.</p><p>However, there is one anomaly. The animal party in the Netherlands (Party for the Animals) has been extremely successful. This party has built its profile and support over time, and it now frequently receives votes that are unrealistic for new parties to expect.</p><p>So, the bottom graph shows the same raw data but excluding elections in the Netherlands. In this more modest dataset, animal parties have received a vote between 0% and 1% in around ~35% of elections.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kiq83nGBoK8tih4wB/siob3g5gnqgqsgehq9sk\"></p><p>We do think that it is worthwhile giving&nbsp;<i>some</i> weight to the elections from the Netherlands in our data set. So, for our forecasts for future elections, we basically average the numbers in the above two graphs. This is equivalent to placing a weighting of 0.5 on all data points from the Netherlands, and a weighting of 1 on all other data points.</p><p>Our forecasts are summarised below in Table 2. The top half of the table shows the average of the numbers from the above graphs. The bottom half of the table turns these numbers into forecasts. For example, we would expect perhaps ~30% of elections to yield a vote for an animal party between 0% and 1%. This means that around ~70% of elections would yield a vote above 1%.</p><p>Therefore, if we imagine that animal parties ran in 10 independent elections, we would expect to see:</p><ul><li>4 elections where the animal parties receive less than 1% of the vote</li><li>3 elections where the animal parties receive between 1% and 2% of the vote</li><li>1 election where the animal party receives between 2% and 3% of the vote</li><li>1 election where the animal party receives between 3% and 4% of the vote</li><li>1 election where the animal party receives between 4% and 5% of the vote</li></ul><p>Imagine that a country runs an election that uses proportional representation and has a threshold of 1%. This means that any party receiving 1% of the vote will receive at least one seat. Our data shows that animal parties exceed 1% of the vote about 70% of the time. So, if an animal party contested this election, there would be a 70% chance of receiving a seat. This means that running in this election yields the movement around 0.7 expected seats.</p><p><strong>We do not adjust this forecast up or down based on local considerations</strong>. This is the biggest limitation of our forecasting method. However, in the report sections below, we do flag where we think the forecast should be adjusted slightly up or down.</p><p>This simple calculation does exclude the possibility of receiving multiple seats. This means that our \"expected seats\" numbers could be slight underestimates. However, we suspect that receiving multiple seats on the first go is unlikely in practice. Other factors - such as limitations in our simple dataset - are far more important for the accuracy of our forecasts.</p><p>Table 2: How we convert past election results from existing animal parties to future forecasts for new animal parties.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Vote category</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Proportion of elections where animal parties received this vote</strong></p><p><strong>(all countries, though Netherlands weighted at half)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>0 - 1%</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~29% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>1 - 2%</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~43% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>2 - 3%</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~11% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>3 - 4%</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~9% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>4 - 5%</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~5% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>5 - 6%</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~2% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>6% +</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~0% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"2\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Minimum vote</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Proportion of elections where animal parties exceeded this minimum vote</strong></p><p><strong>(all countries, though Netherlands weighted at half)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>1% +</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>70% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>2% +</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>27% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>3% +</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>16% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>4% +</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>7% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>5% +</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>2% of elections</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>6% +</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~0% of elections</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2><strong>5.3 Results: Our predicted chances of winning a seat for existing parties</strong></h2><p>The following table lists&nbsp;<i>all</i> animal parties that exist in countries with proportionally-represented legislatures, including those parties that have not yet won a seat.

Future Parties: Where Could Future Animal Parties Be Established?</h1><h2><strong>6.1 Where do animal parties not yet exist?</strong></h2><p>We looked at all countries where animal parties do not yet exist. For each of those countries, we asked whether it would be worthwhile to form a new animal party.</p><p>We limited our analysis to countries ranked as \"Full democracy\" or \"Flawed democracy\" in The Economist Democracy Index&nbsp;(25). We only included legislatures that use some form of proportional representation. We attempted to capture all national and subnational legislatures. For subnational legislatures, we attempted to find all subnational legislatures that are genuine regional/state legislatures rather than city councils. The difference is not always clear cut. We found subnational legislatures in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, India, Malaysia, Switzerland, the United States, Italy, Spain, Greece, France, United Kingdom, Netherlands, South Africa, and Portugal (though only some of those legislatures use proportional representation). We decided against including the subnational bodies in Taiwan and New Zealand (which appear closer to city councils), Greece (which do not seem to have their own legislatures), and Indonesia (where we were limited by information).</p><h2><strong>6.2 Results: Our predicted chances of winning a seat for future parties</strong></h2><p>Based on this analysis, the countries that seem most promising are as follows, roughly ordered from most promising to least promising:</p><ul><li>South Africa</li><li>Argentina</li><li>Japan</li><li>Norway</li><li>Albania</li><li>Colombia</li><li>Sri

European Parliament: Could Animal Parties Win More Seats in the European Parliament?</h1><p>Could it be worthwhile to give greater assistance to animal parties contesting seats in the European Parliament? The European Parliament is a special case. In elections to the European Parliament, minor parties often receive disproportionately higher votes compared to their respective national parliaments&nbsp;(26,27). Also, many Member States have existing animal parties and/or high public support for animal welfare.</p><p>Unfortunately, there do not seem to be any low-hanging fruit for animal parties in the European Parliament. In all Member States where animal parties are not already contesting European Parliament elections, the minimum vote required to win a seat is quite high.</p><p>In the European Parliament, there are a number of animal parties that already hold seats. The parties from Germany (Human Environment Animal Welfare Party), the Netherlands (Party for the Animals), and Portugal (People-Animals-Nature) have won representation in this body.</p><p>Members are elected using proportional representation. Many Member States have legal thresholds, and other Member States have&nbsp;<i>de facto</i> thresholds given the relatively small number of seats contested in each Member State.</p><p>There are some Member States where a vote of ~5% is enough to win a seat (e.g. Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, and so on). These may be the most promising Member States in which to run, and we certainly encourage animal parties to contest these elections. However, the forecasted probability of winning seats even in these Member States appears insufficient to justify the immediate investment of resources.</p><p>Table 5: Elections to the European

denotes Member States that divide their electorate into multiple constituencies. This sometimes has the effect of increasing the&nbsp;<i>de facto</i> threshold necessary to win at least one seat, though this depends on the type of proportional representation used by the Member State to distribute seats.</p><p>**appears to be dominated in practice by two major parties</p><h1>8. Track Record of Existing Parties</h1><p>In this section, we focus on the five countries where an animal party has won election to a national or regional legislature: Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal. We examine what impact these animal parties might be having on policy, as well as any important strategic considerations that we can identify.</p><h2><strong>8.1 Australia: Animal Justice Party (New South Wales)</strong></h2><p>We conducted an interview with Emma Hurst, who sits as a Member of the Legislative Council in New South Wales. This state, one of eight states and territories<sup>1</sup> in Australia, has about 8 million people (30% of the population of Australia). The Legislative Council is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of New South Wales. The Legislative Council has 42 Members, and typically 21 of these are elected at a time. The Legislative Council contains a diverse collection of parties and has similar power to introduce and amend legislation to the lower house<sup>2</sup>. Hurst was elected in the 2019 election, representing the Animal Justice Party and receiving 1.95% of the first-preference vote<sup>3</sup>. The Animal Justice Party also has representatives in the Victorian state legislature, but our interview focused solely on the party's activity in New South Wales.</p><p>Hurst identifies her key policy wins as:</p><ul><li>The creation in June 2023 of an Animal Welfare Committee, with Hurst as the Chair, by a proposal from the ruling Labor party. This Committee will, for the duration of the current term of Parliament, \"inquire into and report on matters relating to the welfare and protection of animals in New South Wales\"&nbsp;(28)</li><li>Higher penalties for people convicted of animal cruelty</li><li>Outlawing the use of cetaceans in entertainment, meaning that businesses like Seaworld can never set up in NSW</li><li>A requirement that animal shelters must make efforts to rehome animals before euthanizing them</li><li>A requirement for cats and dogs used in scientific experimentation to be rehomed rather than killed once the experimentation is finished</li><li>Over $60 million in Government funding towards rescue organisations, greyhound rescues, Lucy's Project (an organisation that supports people with animals experiencing domestic violence), and the enforcement of animal cruelty laws</li><li>Changing the laws around violent fetish videos and around bestiality, i.e. an automatic ban on keeping further animals for people found guilty of these crimes. Likewise, people guilty of serious animal cruelty can no longer work with animals (e.g. zoos) or pass working-with-children checks (required for jobs and volunteer roles involving children)</li></ul><p>Hurst has also been a Chair, Deputy Chair, or Member in a number of other parliamentary committees&nbsp;(29).</p><p>Our interview also identified some other key points, which are as follows:</p><ul><li>Hurst has had success in both proposing and amending legislation. For proposing legislation, this is most successful when Hurst can identify which government MPs may be most sympathetic to the proposed law, as those MPs can then advocate for the proposed law within the ruling party. In other cases, Hurst has proposed legislation and launched a strong media campaign. If there is sufficient support for the proposed legislation among the Legislative Council and the public, the government is incentivised to propose a near-identical piece of legislation in the Legislative Assembly, which results in the success of the policy. Amending proposed legislation can also be a successful strategy, because if an amendment to a Government Bill is agreed to by a majority of members in the Legislative Council, the Government is forced to either accept that amendment, or they may not be able to pass their own Bill. In this way, passing an amendment to a Bill can convince the Government to come to the table and negotiate on an issue.</li><li>The biggest roadblock limiting Hurst's work is the power of the animal agribusiness industry and their lobby groups. Another roadblock is the fact that the animal welfare portfolio is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Agriculture, which significantly hinders policy reform (see our detailed report on this challenge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection\"><u>here</u></a>). These two roadblocks make it very challenging for Hurst to secure ambitious, large-scale reforms for farmed animal welfare. Nevertheless, Hurst does campaign for some specific farmed animal welfare issues. Hurst sees value in the attention that these campaigns draw in both the media and in parliament, which can gradually help to build support among the public and other MPs in the long-run.</li><li>Hurst has no data on whether, or by how much, advertising during election campaigns helps the Animal Justice Party's vote. She does report that the party's vote has increased in New South Wales over time. She also feels that advertising for specific campaigns has directly led to policy wins in those campaign areas before.</li><li>Hurst reports that being an elected MP is an enormous help in securing media attention. She now finds it much easier to get stories into the media than in her previous roles in animal advocacy organisations.</li><li>When asked if she would like the animal advocacy movement to do anything differently, Hurst spoke strongly about the movement's need to become more involved in political lobbying. Hurst has witnessed a disproportionately low amount of lobbying for animal issues compared to other issues in Australia. This is true for lobbying legislators to both propose pro-animal legislation and support pro-animal legislation proposed by other legislators. Hurst hopes this trend will change with the establishment of the new Australian Alliance for Animals, who have a focus on political lobbying.</li></ul><h2><strong>8.2 Belgium: Victoria Austraet, Independent</strong></h2><p>We conducted an interview with Victoria Austraet, who sits as an independent deputy in the opposition of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. This region is one of three in Belgium and has about 1.2 million people, 11% of the population of Belgium. The 89 deputies in this Parliament are elected using proportional representation, and the Parliament has a multi-party system. Austraet was elected in the 2019 election, where she represented the party DierAnimal and received 1.32% of the vote. Austraet subsequently left the party and now sits as an independent.</p><p>The key findings from our interview are as follows:</p><ul><li>Since the Brussels Parliament has a multi-party system, Austraet can propose both laws and resolutions and have a good chance of them successfully passing. Passing any proposal requires discussions with the other parties to ensure support before the text is written. (This point may seem trivial to European readers, but in many majoritarian, two-party systems like Australia, it is extremely rare for a bill to pass unless it was submitted by the government.)</li><li>When we asked about Austraet's concrete policy wins, the two main examples she cited were: a new law that bans the capture and killing of wild pigeons; and a resolution to ask the minister to pressure EU policymakers to ban long-distance transport of farmed animals.</li><li>However, Austraet independently made the point that her most significant work is to simply raise animal welfare and veganism as issues in Parliament. Raising animal issues on the agenda makes them more legitimate as issues and encourages the other deputies (and the Minister) to shift in the right direction over time. Austraet felt strongly that while this effect is difficult to measure, it is real and important.</li><li>Austraet emphasises that it is essential to develop good relationships with other parties and with the Minister responsible for animal welfare. In particular, being an independent deputy enables Austraet to develop these relationships without the interference of a party label or a party apparatus.</li><li>Austraet has encountered a few key roadblocks during her term as a deputy. 1) Firstly, the Minister responsible for Animal Welfare has a large amount of control over the details of animal welfare laws and even how proposed laws are discussed. 2) Secondly, the Minister has stated that he will soon release a new, overarching welfare code, and many parties are reluctant to support Austraet's proposals while the details of the Minister's code remain unknown. This compounds a general reluctance from the other deputies to support animal welfare reforms. 3) Thirdly, Austraet is part of the opposition, rather than the government coalition. The first of these roadblocks (1) is a specific feature of the Brussels political system. The second (2) and third (3) of these roadblocks are specific features of the current policy agenda and makeup of Parliament, and may not necessarily interfere with progress in future sessions of Parliament.</li><li>Despite these roadblocks, we discussed with Austraet the role of party politics in animal advocacy in general. At the end of our interview, Austraet emphatically argued: \"People in animal welfare should really go into politics. [...] We have to be there.\"</li></ul><h2><strong>8.3 France: Ecological Revolution for the Living (REV)</strong></h2><p>We conducted an interview with Victor Pailhac, who is a staff member of France's party REV (Ecological Revolution for the Living). The REV has one elected representative, Aymeric Caron, in France's National Assembly (the lower house of a bicameral legislature). Caron won election in 2022 as part of the left-wing political alliance NUPES (<i>Nouvelle Union populaire \u00e9cologique et sociale</i>), receiving 45.05% (first round) and 51.65% (second round) of the vote in France's two-round runoff system. Victor Pailhac, who responded to our questions via email, works for REV and has also run as a candidate in elections.</p><p>The key findings from our interview are:</p><ul><li>REV considers its main victories so far to be shifting the political discourse and moving \"antispeciesism\" and \"radical ecology\" from eccentric topics to terms regularly used by other politicians and the media.</li><li>REV has made progress in the abolition of bullfighting and intends to complete this campaign to abolish bullfighting in France.</li><li>REV's main strategy involves disseminating information, argumentation, and public education, which they see as the only way to convince politicians and citizens to listen. REV also unites with political partners, such as the left-wing party La France Insoumise (also part of NUPES) to make short-term progress. For example, the alliance with La France Insoumise is an important part of the campaign against bullfighting.</li><li>The main roadblocks facing REV is the lack of financial resources. Other roadblocks include the power of lobbies, certain government policies perceived as anti-democratic, and negative media coverage of the far-left (by political opponents).</li></ul><h2><strong>8.4 Netherlands: Party for the Animals</strong></h2><p>For the Party for the Animals in the Netherlands, we have derived a list of main policy achievements from the party's website&nbsp;(30). We have not checked how these policies have been implemented/enforced or whether any of these would have happened even without the party's involvement. This list is a subset from the larger list on the party's website - we simply chose the achievements that seem to us like fairly high-impact.</p><ul><li>More frequent monitoring of animal welfare on farms (2006)</li><li>Ban on enriched cage (before farmers had invested in enriched cages) (2006)</li><li>Recording of scientific tests conducted on invertebrates (2006)</li><li>Inclusion of animal welfare in the criteria for Corporate Social Responsibility (2007)</li><li>Mandatory CCTV surveillance in livestock markets (2008)</li><li>National moratorium on \"mega stalls\" (2011)</li><li>Ban on killing eels in a salt bath without stunning (2011)</li><li>Ban on fur farming (2012)</li><li>Enforcement of the ban on beak trimming of chickens (2012)</li><li>Stricter regulations on animal testing (2013)</li><li>End of export of calves to Turkey (2013)</li><li>End of tail docking of piglets (2014)</li><li>Ban on neonicotinoid pesticides (2014)</li><li>Ban on electric shocks to tethered cows (2014)</li><li>Ban on killing geese for carnival games (2014)</li><li>Inclusion of animal welfare as a responsibility for the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (2014)</li><li>Ban on slaughtering chickens using live hanging lines (2014)</li><li>Installation of CCTV surveillance in slaughterhouses (2017)</li><li>Mandatory grazing for cows (2017)</li><li>Council-provided catering must be vegetarian by default in Amsterdam (and later in Zutphen and Eindhoven) (2019)</li><li>Ban on mink breeding for fur (2020)</li><li>Decrease in pace of slaughter in slaughterhouses (2020)</li><li>Ban on mutilations of farmed animals and a requirement for animals to be able to express natural behaviour (2021)</li><li>Requirement for chickens to have permanent access to water (2021)</li><li>Stricter control and enforcement at reptile fairs and markets (2021)</li><li>Ban on hunting hares and rabbits for pleasure (2021)</li><li>Ban on branding of cows (2022)</li><li>Requirement for the minister to oppose the live transport of animals to non-EU countries (2023)</li><li>Ban on hunting for any reason in Groningen (2023)</li></ul><p>Also, Otjes&nbsp;(3) calculated that the party's entry into parliament roughly doubled the amount of attention given to animal welfare and animal agricultural issues in motions and parliamentary speeches by other parties (this excludes the considerable attention given to these issues by the party's own prolific MPs). This is a meaningful result that may contribute to pro-animal policies gaining greater support in the longer term. The importance of salience inside the legislature is supported by the above three interviews from Australia, Belgium and France, and we emphasise that this is an important source of impact in our cost-effectiveness analysis below.</p><h2><strong>8.5 Portugal: People-Animals-Nature (PAN)</strong></h2><p>For the party PAN (People-Animals-Nature) in Portugal, the main policy achievements are provided in the dissertation by Sandler&nbsp;(31). Sandler lists the party's achievements starting from winning their first seat in the unicameral Assembly of the Republic up until mid-2021. Here, we list all of the achievements listed by Sandler. We order these achievements according to our rough expectation about their impact, from most impactful to least impactful:</p><ul><li>Allocation of nine million Euros to kennels and animal protection organisations, added to the 2020 state budget (two million Euros) and the 2021 state budget (seven million Euros)</li><li>Requirement for all public canteens to have at least one vegan option, specifically covering \"public schools, universities, hospitals, prisons, nursing homes, municipal buildings, and places of social services of public administration\", passed in Parliament on 3 March 2017</li><li>Ban on kill-shelters in Portugal, effective from September 2018</li><li>Change in income tax law to allow people to claim pet medication as a deduction on their personal income tax, added to the 2020 state budget</li><li>Establishment of a national strategy for stray animals, added to the 2020 state budget</li><li>Change in the Civil Code to assign animals a \"third legal\" status, between legal things and legal persons, effective from 1 May 2017</li><li>Ban on the practice of shooting birds as targets in captivity, passed in March 2021</li><li>Ban on circuses using wild animals in Portugal, approved in October 2018 with a six-year transition period</li><li>Higher fees for tickets to bullfighting shows, added to the 2020 state budget</li><li>Ban on circuses using animals in the city of Funchal, passed at the end of 2014</li><li>Stronger punishments for crimes against companion animals, approved in July 2020</li><li>Law allowing companion animals to enter commercial establishments (subject to the permission of the business owner), effective from July 2018</li></ul><p>This list excludes any policy achievements from mid-2021 to today. PAN also has a number of representatives at lower levels of government (e.g., municipal councils), so there may be small but meaningful policies that are missing from the above list.</p><h1>9. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</h1><h2><strong>9.1 Costs: Parties often pay for themselves</strong></h2><p>For launching or supporting a minor political party, the most important financial support will be the first grant. Ongoing support from foundations is rarely necessary.</p><p>Firstly, political parties have multiple sources of income (Table 6). The party would typically begin to receive income from these sources after running in the first election - the most important gap is therefore the money and other resources required to support the party during the first election. After that election, the party will have an easier time paying for itself. These sources of income include:</p><ul><li>Government funding for election campaigns. It is common for democratic countries to fund or reimburse political parties for election campaigns, though in some countries, receiving this funding is conditional on receiving a certain number of votes. All of our high-priority countries except for Switzerland provide government funding for election campaigns, though this typically requires surpassing 1% or 1.5% of the vote.</li><li>Government funding for party expenses. When parties win seats, it is common for the government to fund both the salary of the parliamentarians and any expenses (e.g. staff salaries, travel expenses). All of our high-priority countries provide government funding for party expenses.</li><li>Membership fees. The importance of membership fees depends on the party and the country. Most developed countries have witnessed a decline in party membership over time, and some countries have strict laws around private funding of political parties (e.g. Israel). On the other hand, Australia's Animal Justice Party has a disproportionately high number of members compared to its vote, perhaps suggesting that animal parties can attract a core of committed, paying members.</li></ul><p>Table 6 shows whether these sources of income exist in each of our high-priority countries. The table does not include membership fees, as the importance of membership fees varies strongly from party to party.</p><p>Secondly, minor political parties are often run by volunteers - paid staff are usually limited to elected parliamentarians and their small teams, plus perhaps one or two executive or administrative staff hired by the party.</p><p>However, contesting an election and running a campaign costs money. Some important costs are:</p><ul><li>Salary for campaign staff if they need to take time away from paid work.</li><li>Campaign expenses, such as travel costs and advertising fees.</li><li>The fee or deposit required by the government to contest an election (Table 6). Among our high-priority countries, the only countries where electoral deposits are required are Japan and Sri Lanka, with the latter being very cheap&nbsp;(32). It is unclear if there are election deposits required to contest elections in Brazil and Chile, though we have searched and found no suggestion of election deposits in these two countries.</li></ul><p>Due to Japan's prohibitively high deposit, and our projection that a party in Japan would win only ~1 seat, we do not consider Japan further. Japan has an extremely high deposit of 6 million yen (roughly $40,000 USD), which must be paid in order to compete for a seat in Japan's proportionally-represented House of Councillors (national upper house)&nbsp;(33). The deposit in Japan is returned to the party if the party wins a seat; otherwise, the deposit is lost&nbsp;(34). Japan's high deposit is an anomaly among developed countries, which typically either do not require a deposit or require a deposit of only a few hundred dollars&nbsp;(34).</p><p>For our analysis of the cost-effectiveness of minor political parties, we assume that the main costs would be the first two items on that list, i.e.:</p><ul><li>Salary. The salaries required would be for a small campaign and administrative team (e.g. two people) to work full time for the couple of months immediately before the election. This would vary by country depending on living expenses. For example, in Israel, roughly $18,000 USD would be sufficient for two people working full-time for two months (as Israel has a GDP per capita of around $55,000 USD).</li><li>Campaign expenses. Again, different countries would require different amounts of money for travel, advertising, an online presence, and so on. Conservatively, we think that around $15,000 USD would be plenty, and many parties would be able to get away with much less.</li></ul><p>This means that an initial grant somewhere in the ballpark of $30,000 USD would probably be sufficient for one election. If a party contests multiple elections (e.g. national and regional), additional money may be required. The costs of subsequent elections would probably be lower than this initial grant, as a) the parties would have some income from having run in elections already, and b) the party would already have a website, some advertising resources, and so on. For reference, Australia's Animal Justice Party spent around $75,000 USD in the 2022 South Australian state election&nbsp;(2), though that campaign involved deposits for 12 candidates (an expense that would not be required in our priority countries) and an ambitious and expensive advertising plan (an expense that we think is unnecessary, as argued in this report in section 3.2).</p><p>Table 6: Election funding system in the high-priority countries.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Recommended country and party</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Expected result if funded</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Does the government fund election campaigns?</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Does the government fund expenses of parties that hold seats?

IDEA&nbsp;(32)</p><h2><strong>9.2 Impact: Our rough back-of-the-envelope calculation</strong></h2><p>Here, we conduct some simple, back-of-the-envelope calculations to illustrate what the impact of winning a seat might look like. We will model the impact as follows: we assume that a new animal party is launched, and that party contests one election and has a ~70% probability of winning one seat in a legislature. That party holds the seat for one legislative term (say, four years) and then never holds a seat ever again.</p><p>We think that this is a reasonable, conservative assumption for modelling purposes, as it lets us examine the effects of winning a single seat in a legislature - an achievable and meaningful outcome. However, we emphasise this assumption is highly conservative: in practice, an animal party that wins a seat will usually hold the seat at future elections. The vote is unlikely to decline, so a party that is elected once will probably be elected again. If anything, holding a seat makes it more likely to win additional seats in future elections, as has been shown in academic research&nbsp;(20) and has happened for the animal party in the Netherlands. Each of those subsequent legislative terms would generate additional impact. Some countries have multiple legislatures, and subsequent elections in different legislatures would be both cheaper (as the party would have an income and some existing online presence) and more successful (as the party's public profile would benefit from having a seat in one legislature already).</p><p>One challenge with modelling the impact of a seat in a legislature is that the benefits for animals hinges on which policies the legislator pursues. A legislator's choice of policy is sometimes constrained by the political agenda and policy windows. Animal parties have pursued policies that are both high-impact and low-impact (the latter often, though not always, for strategic reasons).</p><p>Therefore, we model the impact as the sum of three types of policy. For each type of policy, we assume that the policy would be comparable to a particular type of welfare improvement.</p><ol><li><i>Big policy wins</i>. Whether a party can achieve big policy wins depends on the context, makeup of the legislature, political agenda, and so on. These are somewhat rare. We assume that a big policy win would have an impact similar to a one-off welfare improvement for one group of farmed animals in a medium-sized country (e.g. banning mutilations for pigs; banning a particular slaughter method for fish; reducing stocking densities for chickens).</li><li><i>Small policy wins</i>. Parties will usually, but not always, be able to achieve smaller policy wins. These are more common, but affect smaller populations of animals. We assume that a small policy win would have an impact similar to banning the hunting of one group of wild animals in a medium-sized country (e.g. capturing and killing pigeons; hunting pheasants).</li><li><i>Extra funding in the government budget.</i> A couple of animal parties have been able to secure funding for local animal welfare organisations during the negotiations that set the government budget (e.g. ~$10 million USD in Portugal; ~$3.5 million USD in Australia). While these are large sums of money, they are typically limited to local organisations focused on companion animals.</li></ol><p>There are at least three additional sources of impact that are real and important but that we do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> include in the model:</p><ol><li><i>Salience</i>. Holding a seat in a legislature causes a significant increase in the salience of animal issues both in the legislature and in the media. This means that both policymakers and the general public pay greater attention to animal issues. As Victoria Austraet in Belgium emphasised during our interview, we expect that greater salience would cause more pro-animal policies to be passed over time, but this effect is long-term and notoriously difficult to measure. For salience in the legislature, Otjes et al&nbsp;(3) calculated that the entry of the Party for the Animals into the Netherlands legislature caused the amount of discussion on animal issues to roughly triple. For salience in the media, the Australian Animal Justice Party legislator Emma Hurst confirmed in our interview that, since being elected to parliament, it is much easier to get media attention for her campaigns.&nbsp;</li><li><i>Long-term policies</i>. Parties often succeed in passing policies that make institutional or political conditions more favourable to future animal advocacy, but it is difficult to measure the impact of these policies in the short-term. Two examples are: 1) Emma Hurst secured from the New South Wales government the creation of an Animal Welfare Committee, with herself as the Chair; and 2) Victoria Austraet in Belgium passed a resolution that pressures the minister to, in turn, pressure EU policymakers to ban long-distance transport of farmed animals.</li><li><i>Capitalising on the non-legislative benefits of being a legislator</i>. This can include joining parliamentary committees, using allocated budgets to conduct campaigns outside of parliament, and so on.</li></ol><p>So, for this report, we model the impact of a seat in parliament as the sum of big policy wins, small policy wins, and extra funding in the government budget. We emphasise that the true impact would include factors that we cannot model. We also make no attempt to consider counterfactual effects, knock-on impacts, and so on, as these are very complex to understand even for simple policies - however, we emphasise that these may be either immense or small and either good or bad.</p><p><strong>True impact = (modelled impact) +&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>(non-modelled impact) + (knock-on and counterfactual effects)</strong></p><p><strong>Modelled impact = (big policy wins) + (small policy wins) + (extra funding in the government budget)</strong></p><p>The assumptions and results of our model are listed below in Table 7. For the full rationale behind each assumption, please request access to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/22793\"><u>Guesstimate model</u></a>.</p><p>The key results of our model are:</p><ol><li><i>Big policy wins: In our model and under our assumptions, we predict that this component of impact is expected to help roughly 1.7 billion animals (8.1 million to 9.1 billion). From a funder's perspective, this represents 57,000 animals helped per dollar (270 to 300,000). Of course, this estimate&nbsp;<strong>should not be taken literally</strong> - compared to more rigorous cost-effectiveness analyses for animal advocacy campaigns, this result is quite silly. The useful piece of information expressed by this result is that sometimes, when conditions are favourable, a legislator will be able to pass highly impactful policies that benefit farmed animals across the jurisdiction.</i></li><li><i>Small policy wins: In our model and under our assumptions, we predict that this component of impact is expected to help roughly 6,700 animals (1,000 to 24,000). From a funder's perspective, this represents an additional 0.22 animals helped per dollar (0.033 to 0.79). The useful piece of information here is that legislators will usually be able to help thousands or tens of thousands of companion or wild animals.</i></li><li><i>Extra funding in the government budget: In our model and under our assumptions, we predict that this component of impact is expected to help roughly 5,100 animals (2,500 to 9,300). From a funder's perspective, this represents an additional 0.17 animals helped per dollar (0.085 to 0.31). Again, the useful piece of information here is that legislators will usually be able to help thousands or tens of thousands of companion or wild animals.</i></li></ol><p>With these tentative results in mind, our belief about the impact of helping animal parties contest seats in legislators is:</p><ul><li>Sometimes, the animal party will strike it big, and will be able to pass meaningful farmed animal welfare reforms. This represents a small chance of helping millions or billions of animals.</li><li>In most cases, the animal party will be able to pass modest policies or obtain funding to improve the lives of companion animals and/or wild animals. This represents a large chance of helping thousands of animals. Our model predicts that this might correspond to roughly 6,700 + 5,100 = ~12,000 animals, or 0.22 + 0.17 = 0.39 animals per dollar.</li><li>In most cases, the animal party will also deliver longer-term benefits, such as improving institutional conditions for future advocacy and increasing the salience of animal welfare among the policymakers and the public. The animal party will also obtain benefits that can help animal advocacy campaigns outside of the legislature, such as travel budgets and public stature. It is difficult to model these benefits, but we believe that they are large and meaningful.</li></ul><p>Therefore, it might be wise to view animal parties as a hits-based approach to animal advocacy, with the caveat that parties would constantly be able to obtain modest policy wins plus meaningful longer-term benefits.</p><p>Table 7.

Academic Literature</h1><h2><strong>10.1 What do studies tell us about animal parties?</strong></h2><p>Turning towards the academic literature, there have been a handful of enlightening papers published in the last decade. Most of these focus on the level of success of animal parties in the Netherlands and the European Union.</p><ul><li>Otjes and Krouwel&nbsp;(13) ask whether animal parties attract different voters than green parties. The authors examine the voter niches to which each type of party appeals, using the cases of the Netherlands and Germany. They find that green parties appeal to voters \"from the traditional Green niche: those with egalitarian, cosmopolitan, environmentalist, and libertarian values.\" In contrast, animal parties appeal to a different type of green voter, those who have \"significantly less cosmopolitan and evinc[e] lower levels of political trust\" and those who \"take more extreme positions on animal issues\".</li><li>Otjes&nbsp;(3) traces the history of the animal party in the Netherlands,&nbsp;<i>Partij voor de Dieren</i>. The author argues that the party's creation seems to have caused a marked increase in the political salience of animal welfare and agricultural issues, even among other parties.</li><li>Otten and Gremmen&nbsp;(35) also examine&nbsp;<i>Partij voor de Dieren&nbsp;</i>in the Netherlands, with a particular interest comparing how the party addresses issues relating to domestic animals to that of wild animals.</li><li>Morini&nbsp;(15) examines animal parties in the European Union's Member States. The author summarises the policy platforms of these parties and argues that animal parties constitute a new party family. The author points out that the seven parties under study can be classified into three categories: single-issue parties; parties which also include green issues; and parties with broader, left-wing policies.</li><li>Abbey&nbsp;(22) conducts interviews with members of Australia's Animal Justice Party. The study focuses on questions of gender in politics, showing that feminist ethics of care are highly relevant to members' support of the party. The author also explores the role of women and men in animal parties.</li><li>In a subsequent paper, Abbey&nbsp;(36) analyses the views of members of Australia's Animal Justice Party on veganism. Abbey points out that \"a political party that appealed only or even primarily to vegan voters could not garner a very large proportion of the overall vote. Although Australia\u2019s vegan population is growing, it is only around 2%.\" While almost all of Abbey's interviewees identified as vegan, \"these party members exhibited a welcoming approach to nonvegan party members. This could, of course, be a pragmatic viewpoint from those who want the party to increase its electoral gains and thereby its influence on Australian politics and policy-making. However, what came through their answers was less a calculation about maximising votes and more akin to compassion and support for individuals who were learning more about animal suffering through their participation in the party and who would, hopefully, come to reduce or resist animal consumption.\"</li><li>Lucardie&nbsp;(37) analyses the ideology of animal parties by examining parties' programmes from Australia, Britain, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Portugal, and Spain. The author concludes that the parties are moving past single-issue politics and \"developing a new ideology based on the core concept of compassion and adjacent concepts of equality, intrinsic value and interdependence.\"</li><li>The dissertation by Sandler&nbsp;(31) describes, from the perspective of critical theory, the evolution of minor animal parties. They provide an overview of the academic research on minor parties, emphasising that these parties often emerge from social movements, focus on neglected issues, and are not easily located along the class-dominated left/right axis. They also provide a detailed analysis of Portugal's animal party (PAN) with emphasis on its evolution, platform, and many policy successes. These policy successes include successfully passed bills and securing millions of Euros for animal welfare in state budgets.</li><li>Backlund and Jungar&nbsp;(14) ask why the radical right cares so much about animals. The authors focus on a radical right party in Sweden and find that the party strongly supports animal advocacy for three main reasons: nativism (arguing that Swedes care more about animal welfare than non-Swedes), authoritarianism (stronger laws for animal cruelty), and populism (reforming laws to better reflect the will of the people). Radical right parties pursue a paternalistic agenda towards animals, which differs from the true animal parties (as we have defined them here) that pursue egalitarian and rights-based principles.</li><li>Oh&nbsp;(38) examines&nbsp;<i>Partij voor de Dieren&nbsp;</i>in the Netherlands. The author argues that the reason for the party's growth is that the party succeeded in mobilising antipathy against established politics via the issue of animal rights. The author also points out that the party is also presenting broader social and environmental policies, which risks the party's ability to maintain its identity.</li></ul><h2><strong>10.2 How do minor parties influence policy?</strong></h2><p>There is a rich body of academic knowledge on the electoral successes and policy impacts of minor parties. Here, we summarise just ten of these many publications, focusing on the findings that can assist us the most in understanding the potential impact that animal parties may have.</p><ul><li>Meguid&nbsp;(39), in a seminal publication that draws on data from elections in Western Europe, argues that \"party tactics work by altering the salience and ownership of issues for political competition, not just party issue positions.\" That is, both minor and mainstream parties compete for which issues are on the political agenda in the first place. Voters support the \"most credible proponent of an issue\" that those voters care about. The author also argues that minor parties, even without any electoral success, can succeed in influencing policy by forcing mainstream policies to give attention to the minor party's issue: \"By adopting either an accommodative or an adversarial strategy, the mainstream party is prioritising the niche party\u2019s issue dimension and including it within the mainstream political debate. [...] The 'success' of the niche party\u2019s issue is distinct from niche party electoral success.\"</li><li>Cowell-Meyeres&nbsp;(40) begins by summarising the literature on how minor parties can influence mainstream parties to adopt the minor parties' policy issues. The author then demonstrates this with a case study of women's parties: \"Merely the emergence of women\u2019s parties can draw attention to women\u2019s issues but where women\u2019s parties win seats, or appear poised to win even a small number of seats, they can trigger a process of contagion. [...] Thus, women\u2019s parties may be useful tools for women\u2019s movements because they provide a means to expand the opportunities for the movements to pressure larger political parties.\" The author also points out that social movements that establish political parties can \"gain institutional resources accorded to such parties and, thus, expand their repertoires of contention.\"</li><li>Lindstam&nbsp;(26,27) addresses the long-standing observation that minor parties often receive better votes at subnational (e.g. local) and supranational (e.g. European) elections, rather than national elections. Using data from the UK and Germany, the author finds that voters are more likely to switch from mainstream parties to minor parties when those voters \"perceive a mismatch between the party they feel close to and the party perceived as best able to handle an issue of importance to them, as well as when they believe less is at stake and when they place much importance on an overlooked issue.\" In other words, precisely because voters care less about subnational and supranational elections, voters use those opportunities to signal the importance of particular issues to mainstream parties by voting for minor parties focused on those issues. We find this quite interesting because agricultural policy in many countries is set at the subnational level (e.g. regional/state parliaments) or influenced by supranational policy (e.g. EU regulations).</li><li>Donovan&nbsp;(41), using data from elections in the Australian Senate (the proportionally-represented upper house), argues that minor parties take advantage of institutional conditions that favour them (e.g. when the quota necessary for winning seats is low) or when there is discontent with mainstream parties (e.g. economic downturn).</li><li>Gauja&nbsp;(42) provides an instructive case study of one successful minor party: the Australian Democrats, which was represented in Australia's national legislature from 1977 to 2008. The Democrats either held or shared the balance of power in Australia's Senate from 1981 to 2005, giving this party a powerful influence over legislation when bargaining with mainstream parties. Though the Democrats have since faced a decline, their legacy is concretely relevant to this day in Australian voters' expectations that \"there is an option beyond the major parties\" and that the Senate is an important forum for keeping the government accountable. We also note that the Democrats were led by a former minister from a mainstream party, which is consistent with broader observations about the importance of credibility and name recognition in electoral politics&nbsp;(24).</li><li>Basile&nbsp;(43) analyses the impact of a minor party on mainstream party strategies, using data from Italy. The results contrast with previous research (including some papers listed above): the author finds that \"niche party influence on mainstream party strategies is limited, at least when compared with the influence of other systemic variables\". The author finds, contrary to previous understanding, that minor parties can be launched with a focus even on issues that are already present in political debate. The author also highlights that minor parties can exercise influence through rhetoric; one Italian party \"introduced a new language into political debate [...] which has required rival parties to react by reframing and redefining these issues differently from the past.\"</li><li>Dinas et al&nbsp;(20), using data from all democracies after the Second World War, show that when small parties enter a legislature, they can expect to experience a subsequent increase in their vote. This is because entering a legislature \"signals organisational capacity and candidates\u2019 appeal, and reduces uncertainty about parties\u2019 ideological profile\".</li><li>Farrer&nbsp;(44) further explores minor party performance in the context of national, supranational, and subnational elections. The author finds that results in subnational (e.g. regional/provincial) legislatures are correlated with subsequent national election results, suggesting that minor parties can build their support locally first before seeking representation in national legislatures. In contrast, the author finds that minor party performance in the European Parliament does not predict party performance in subsequent national elections.</li><li>Abou-Chadi&nbsp;(45) provides further nuance on how mainstream parties respond to the emergence of minor parties. Using data from elections in 16 Western European countries from 1980 to 2011 and focusing on green and radical right parties, the author finds the the strategic responses of mainstream parties \"vary with ideological position and the past electoral performance of the established parties.\" In other words, a successful minor party will have different effects than an unsuccessful minor party, and right-wing mainstream parties will respond differently than left-wing mainstream parties. Minor parties are not always successful in placing their issue on the political agenda, as \"mainstream parties react strategically and assess the possible effect that politicisation of a certain issue will have on their future electoral performance.\" The two major theories that have been explored in the literature - issue competition and spatial/left-right dynamics - are both important in explaining when and how mainstream parties respond to the emergence of minor parties.</li><li>Blings&nbsp;(46) looks at how the success of a minor party can be bolstered by the social movement from which that minor party originally emerged. The author argues \"that movement roots can help niche parties achieve both vote- and policy-seeking goals by keeping core issues salient, bolstering issue ownership and securing allies in civil society.\"</li><li>There is also the question of how minor parties compare to interest groups (which can include charities and non-profit organisations). This question has been studied in the sophisticated and nuanced work by Farrer&nbsp;(47). Asking the question of when to form an interest group versus a political party, Farrer proposes a theoretical model and tests it using empirical data from the environmental movement. Farrer's model begins with the assumption that advocates are policy-motivated and are simply searching for the best way to pursue their policies. In contrast, mainstream politicians are motivated to win and keep office. Thus, under Farrer's model, advocates choose the strategy that sends the strongest electoral threat to politicians. This threat can be sent by forming a party or by forming an interest group (or by some other strategy, such as direct action) - these are substitutable strategies. The best option depends on institutional conditions, as institutions govern both how costly it is for advocates to pick a particular strategy and how costly it is for mainstream politicians to respond to that strategy. Farrer makes two points that are particularly illuminating. Firstly, the formation of interest groups and the formation of political parties are substitutable strategies. In other words, these are both potential pathways to the goal of policy influence. Secondly, the best strategy depends on the context, including the type of political system. Specifically, new parties tend to have an easier time in obtaining policy concessions where decentralisation is high (i.e., where political power is devolved to smaller units like regions) and corporatism is low (i.e., where governments more readily listen to smaller interests). Elections that use proportional representation make it easier for new parties to enter, but proportional representation also make it a bit more challenging for new parties to obtain concessions from major parties (as the major parties find it more costly to grant concessions).</li></ul><h2><strong>10.3 What is the relationship between elections, veg*n voters, and animal welfare?</strong></h2><p>We searched for studies on the ability of social groups in general to act as voting blocs, but we could not find any studies that were sufficiently high-quality and generalisable. Instead, we found a studies posing a few related questions relating to how veg*ns engage with elections and how animal welfare is treated as a topic during elections.</p><p>A few studies have asked whether and how veg*ns engage with politics:</p><ul><li>Nezlek and Forstell&nbsp;(48) examine the relationship between vegetarianism and voting behaviour. This study uses a convenience sample of American undergraduate students, so the results are probably not representative of trends across the American voter population. Veg*ns, compared to omnivores, identified as more progressive, identified more closely with the Democratic party, and reported lower approval of Donald Trump's performance. Only 1.3% of veg*n respondents, compared to 19% of omnivore respondents, reported voting for Trump in the 2016 US presidential election.</li><li>Kalte&nbsp;(49), using a survey of 648 vegans in Switzerland. (For context, about 1.4% of people in Switzerland identify as vegan.) The author finds that \"vegans are highly engaged in a broad variety of political activities\". 91% of vegan respondents had participated in a vote in the past 12 months, 83% had signed a referendum, and 80% had signed a petition. The authors argue that these numbers are higher than for the Swiss electorate as a whole, citing previous studies. Interestingly, 71% of the study's vegan respondents reported avoiding animal suffering (as opposed to environmental protection, reducing world hunger, etc) as the most important reason to be vegan.</li><li>Martinelli and Berkmanien\u0117&nbsp;(12) conduct a qualitative Facebook survey and find that \"vegans are likely to see veganism as a political issue, and in general their interest towards politics is pretty high\".</li></ul><p>Two studies find that (mainstream) political parties tend to play a small role in animal welfare policy in the US and Norway:</p><ul><li>Vogeler&nbsp;(50) analyses animal welfare in politics in the US. They find that (mainstream) political parties seem to play a limited role, while public ballot initiatives and relationships between stakeholders were more important in advancing animal welfare policy.</li><li>H\u00e5rstad and Vik&nbsp;(51) conduct a similar study in Norway, and this study also finds that (mainstream) political parties play a minimal role in animal welfare policy.</li></ul><p>In contrast, two studies showed that manifesto commitments for animal welfare policy have increased over time in the UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium:</p><ul><li>Chaney et al&nbsp;(52) analyse manifestos of political parties in the UK between 1998 and 2017. The authors show that the devolution of the UK has led to a higher salience of animal welfare policy in country-level (i.e. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) elections. However, it was less common for manifestos to mention farmed animals than wild animals or animal-related criminal justice measures. The authors also discuss the dynamics of party competition on topics of animal welfare.</li><li>Hus and McCulloch&nbsp;(53) examine party manifestos in the Netherlands and Belgium between 2010 and 2021. The authors show that, over time, animal protection has become more salient in manifestos and has been discussed in more positive terms. The focus (e.g. unnecessary suffering vs. intensive agriculture vs. wildlife) varied across countries and regions. Left-wing parties were more likely to have animal-friendly policies, while right-wing parties prioritised economic prosperity.</li></ul><h1>11. An Alternative Strategy: Voting Blocs</h1><p>Beyond forming minor political parties, we considered one additional strategy: voting blocs. Many interest groups have successfully organised as voting blocs in order to get their special interests prioritised by politicians. Essentially, this approach involves forming a group of voters who are willing to vote for a particular party (e.g. in a two-party system, voting for one major party rather than other). This places pressure on politicians to adopt policies amenable to the voter bloc and makes it more likely for politicians with such policies to be elected. Note that \"voting blocs\", the strategy we describe in this section, is not to be confused with \"block voting\", which is an electoral system.</p><p>The strength of this approach is that elections may be decided on very narrow margins. This is especially true if the voting block would otherwise vote for the largest opposition party if the demands are not met. When this happens, a voting bloc with (say) 2% of the electorate effectively makes a difference of 4% swing in the outcome of the election.</p><p>Across many countries, farmers are a very common voting bloc. Even in wealthier countries where farmers often represent only a small proportion of the total population, they are often successful in achieving concessions from politicians&nbsp;(54). In addition to the power of their votes, farmers have often been highly successful in lobbying efforts. Farmers often receive a large amount of subsidies, sometimes amounting to a significant proportion of the total income. One strength of farmers as a voting bloc may be their ability to get the public on their side. Farmers are typically perceived as trustworthy and virtuous. People also tend to find food to be emotionally significant and this may be turned into a kind of nationalistic drive to protect local agriculture producers&nbsp;(55). Additionally, governments may have an interest in having strong domestic production of agriculture to increase their food security in cases of disaster or trade disruptions. Animal advocates may have a hard time replicating this level of societal sympathy.</p><p>Could voting blocs work for animal advocacy? Here, we imagine voting blocs mostly in plurality elections - a group of voters could coordinate to act as kingmaker between the two major parties in a two-party system, thereby demanding pro-animal policy concessions from both parties. While not yet a very large proportion of society, vegans, vegetarians, and other animal advocates may represent a large enough portion of society to influence elections if they voted consistently along animal welfare lines. In addition to voting behaviour, the animal advocacy voting bloc could also be influenced to perform other political actions that could further amplify their political voice, such as contacting local politicians or protests.</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not think this approach is well-suited to animal advocacy. We prefer forming and supporting minor animal parties (as analysed in this approach) or working directly with mainstream parties (which we will analyse in an upcoming report).</p><p>The most important consideration is how much of the veg*n and animal advocacy community can be politically mobilised in this way. How many veg*ns and/or animal advocates are there to begin with? The votes received by minor parties are typically in the ballpark of 0 - 4%, which gives some indication. This is similar to the approximate range in which surveys estimate the prevalence of veganism in the population in many Western countries. Therefore, we suspect that this 0 - 4% is close to the upper ceiling of the size of a voting bloc. A voting bloc of even 2% could plausibly act as kingmaker in many closely contested elections.</p><p>However, we are sceptical that this many people would be happy to participate in a voting bloc. For a veg*n or animal advocate to participate in a voting bloc, that voter must satisfy&nbsp;<i>all</i> three of these criteria at once:</p><ul><li>The voter must be aware of the voting bloc.<ul><li>This requires a level of political engagement and community participation that is rare. Even animal parties with large advertising budgets and a place on the ballot often have trouble building awareness among voters who are otherwise supportive.</li></ul></li><li>Animal advocacy must be more important to the voter than any other political issue.<ul><li>However, veg*ns and animal advocates usually care about many issues. Abbate&nbsp;(56) points out that \"there are several different motivations for becoming vegan that are compatible with speciesist attitudes, such as concern for one\u2019s personal health and concern for the environment [...] Indeed, many people choose veganism or reduce their consumption of animal products&nbsp;<i>even though they embrace speciesist ideologies</i>.\" This would indicate that it might not be common for veg*ns to be concerned for animal welfare, let alone willing to take political action on behalf of animals. As the author argues, \"only a small fraction of vegans participates in animal rights activism.\" Even where a voter is explicitly anti-speciesist, they may also be passionate about other causes like environmentalism and so may not be a single-issue voter.</li></ul></li><li>The voter must be happy to vote strategically, even for a party that they may otherwise dislike and even at the expense of voting for a party that is visibly aligned with animal advocacy (e.g. an animal party or a green party).<ul><li>Wright&nbsp;(57) argues that veganism, as an ideology, \"does not constitute a unified social movement\". In the author's words, \"vegans tend not to constitute a unified group in possession of a cohesive ideological mandate; they tend not to be joiners.\"</li><li>Furthermore, we have observed strong backlash from within the membership of centre-left minor animal parties when those parties reach public agreements with centre-right mainstream parties. This suggests that many voters who are supportive of animal advocacy are not willing to vote for a party that supports a different ideology to the voter.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The number of people who vote for animal parties may overestimate the potential level of support for voter blocs. Voting for a party with the \"animal\" label strikes us as psychologically easier than voting for a mainstream party because of a calculated strategy by the leader of a voter bloc. Furthermore, animal parties receive meaningful levels of support even from people whose position on animal protection is lukewarm. For example, animal parties capture many votes from:</p><ul><li>People who are disinterested in the election and vote for parties whose names sound nice, funny or interesting. In Australia as an example, people with low levels of political engagement might vote for the Australian Sex Party, Legalise Cannabis Australia, or the Family First Party simply on the basis of their names without paying any attention to the ideological position or broader policy platforms of those parties. We suspect that this is also true for animal parties, as many people simply like animals.</li><li>People who vote for minor parties as a way to express their dissatisfaction with the mainstream parties (protest vote). In Australia, which has preferential voting, there is a surprisingly high number of voters who give their first preference to the Animal Justice Party and their second preference to the minor party Shooters, Fishers and Farmers. It would be difficult to explain this behaviour as motivated by genuine and simultaneous support for both of these parties.</li><li>People who are indeed loyal to a mainstream party during national elections but vote for an animal party in sub- and supranational elections as a low-risk way of expressing their support for animal welfare policies&nbsp;(26,27).</li><li>People in districts where the animal party is, purely by chance, listed first on the ballot. In Australia, where voting is compulsory, the Animal Justice Party tends to receive more votes when it is listed first on the ballot.</li></ul><p>The rates of veg*nism estimated by surveys may also be an overestimate. Many of these studies simply ask people to report whether or not they are vegetarian or vegan, and many people do not understand what these terms mean. Surveys that instead ask more specific questions (such as whether or not the person has eaten the meat of an animal in the last week) may be more reliable.</p><p>Considering all of these factors, we are sceptical that a voting bloc focused on animal advocacy could attract sufficient support to be influential during elections.</p><h1>Notes</h1><p>1. For our purposes, we are most concerned with Australia's six states and two main internal territories. There are also a number of external territories and one additional internal territory, none of which have separate legislatures like the six states and two main internal territories.</p><p>2. In New South Wales, the lower house is the Legislative Assembly. This house has a two-party system and is where the government is formed.</p><p>3. The Legislative Council is elected using preferential voting, in which a voter casts their vote by ranking the available candidates.</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>We are grateful to Victoria Austraet, Emma Hurst, and Victor Pailhac and their teams for participating in interviews.

Globally, diabetes mellitus type 2 is certainly a problem, and causes a direct health burden of&nbsp;<strong>90 million&nbsp;</strong>disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2024, as well as an indirect health burden of&nbsp;<strong>2 million</strong> DALYs from an increased risk of depression amongst diabetes sufferers. There is also an accompanying net economic burden equivalent to foregoing the doubling of income for&nbsp;<strong>191 million</strong> people; note that people typically value such income doublings at around&nbsp;<strong>1/5th</strong> of a year of healthy life. And this problem of diabetes is only expected to&nbsp;<strong>grow between 2024 and 2100</strong>, as a result of factors like economic development, ageing, and population growth.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong><u>Neglectedness</u></strong>: Government policy is far from adequate, with only 20% of the potential reduction in diabetes burden from implementing sugar-sweetened beverages taxes already being captured by existing government policy; this is not expected to change much going forward \u2013 based on the historical track record, any individual country has only a 1% chance per annum of introducing such policies. At the same time, while there are NGOs working on diabetes and sugar-sweetened beverages taxes (e.g. a big Bloomberg-funded organization does work in Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica, Barbados and South Africa), expansion of such work is conditional on funding, and fundamentally, efforts in the area are not equal to the massive and growing disease burden.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong><u>Tractability</u></strong>: There are many potential solutions to the problem of diabetes mellitus type 2 (e.g. sugar-sweetened beverages taxes, or mandatory reformulation, or pharmaceutical interventions); however, we find that the most cost-effective solution is likely to be advocacy for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) taxes. The theory of change behind this intervention is as such:<br><br><ul><li><u>Step 1</u>: Lobby a government to implement a sugar-sweetened beverages tax.</li><li><u>Step 2</u>: A sugar-sweetened beverages tax reduces consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in a single country.</li><li><u>Step 3</u>: Reduced consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in a single country reduces the global disease burden of diabetes mellitus type 2.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Using the track record of past SSB tax and sodium control advocacy efforts and of general lobbying attempts (i.e. an \"outside view\"), and combining this with reasoning through the particulars of the case (i.e. an \"inside view\"), our best guess is that policy advocacy for top sodium reduction policies has a&nbsp;<strong>8% chance of success</strong> per campaign. Meanwhile, based on various meta-analyses, and after robust discounts and checks (e.g. for a conservative theoretical prior of a null hypothesis; for endogeneity; for study populations being unrepresentative; or for publication bias), we expect that a WHO-recommended 20% tax on sugar-sweetened beverages will reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by&nbsp;<strong>12%</strong>; and in turn, a 100% reduction in sugar-sweetened beverages consumption in a single country will reduce the global disease burden of diabetes mellitus type 2 by&nbsp;<strong>0.02%</strong>.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>There are additional externalities and complications to an SSB tax. On the positive side, (a) an SSB tax also reduces ischaemic heart disease (n.b. an increase in impact relative to the diabetes-only baseline by 200%). On the negative side, (b) we expect on average a 7 year gap between when an advocacy intervention begins and when the health impact actually kicks (-5% impact); (c) taxing SSBs risks causing consumers to switch to alcohol (-30% impact); and (d) taxing SSBs leads to reduced freedom of choice (-0.5% impact). Most significantly, however, is the potential gain in cost-effectiveness (+600%) from implementing the intervention in the most promising countries rather than the average one \u2013 that is, those countries suffering from some combination of a higher national disease burden, greater neglect by their governments and NGOs, and&nbsp;state fragility.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong><u>Implementation Issues</u></strong>: From our interviews with NGOs working in the space, we find that funding is scarce. On the issue of whether a talent gap exists, however, opinion was more mixed.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong><u>Outstanding Uncertainties</u></strong>: There are a number of outstanding uncertainties, of which the three most important involve: (a)&nbsp;our use of point estimations (n.b. relying on them is reasonable given that we are ultimately interested in mean estimates, but caution is also warranted, as significant variance is possible); (b)&nbsp;the very simplified methodology we use to project the future disease burden of diabetes mellitus type 2; and (c) the highly uncertain estimates of the probability of advocacy success.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>: Overall, our view is that advocacy for sugar-sweetened beverages tax to control diabetes mellitus type 2 is an extremely cost-effective cause , and we recommend that charity incubators, grantmakers, policy advocacy organizations, and governments themselves, consider directing more resources towards this area.</li></ul><p><strong>Postscript</strong>: We've updated our analysis of the issue of whether and how much freedom of choice is diminished by a soda tax. We would like to thank the various commentators who gave feedback, though we also understand that they may still have reasonable disagreements over our methodology and results, especially given different philosophical and epistemic priors on the matter.</p>", "user": {"username": "Joel Tan"}}, {"_id": "aNKBwj6esW7RdvnwJ", "title": "How to Get More Important Things Done with the Eisenhower [Effort] Matrix", "postedAt": "2023-10-06T01:00:25.757Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>TL;DR</h1><p>Thank you to everyone who has connected with us, and provided us with feedback/suggestions since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/inside-the-mind-of-an-aspiring-charity-entrepreneur-follow\"><u>our last post</u></a>.

This, I believe, is one of the most important things to set up at the beginning stages of any project/organization.</p><p>For my co-founder&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/peter-s-park\"><u>Dr. Peter S. Park</u></a> and I, on the very same call we agreed to co-found the nonprofit together, the first order of business was to set a deadline for completing the Founder\u2019s Agreement. Then, concurrently to drafting the Founder\u2019s Agreement together, I also established our organization's task management productivity system as detailed in this post inspired by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c2fhqaKEGJxGMCz4x/new-ea-book-how-to-launch-a-high-impact-nonprofit-by-charity\"><u>CE\u2019s handbook</u></a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Brief Word on the Founder\u2019s Agreement</h2><p>The importance of the co-founder relationship is described on page 387 of CE\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c2fhqaKEGJxGMCz4x/new-ea-book-how-to-launch-a-high-impact-nonprofit-by-charity\"><u>How to Launch a High-Impact Nonprofit</u></a> handbook:</p><blockquote><p><i>Your co-founder relationship might well be one of the best things in your life and a source of energy for years. Unfortunately, as in the cases of marriages, co-founder conflicts and split-ups are more common than people assume. In fact, they are one of the most common reasons that start-up fails.</i></p></blockquote><p>In my previous entrepreneurship journey, this isn\u2019t something I had to think about because I was a sole-proprietor (which eventually turned into managing a team of contractors). After just a month of being a charity entrepreneur and co-founder, I realized just how lonely my previous business experience was, not to mention the fun I had missed out on&nbsp;<u>working shoulder-to-shoulder with someone on a common mission from the very beginning</u>.</p><p>Thus, I\u2019m so grateful CE generously provides a template of the Founder's Agreement, a vital document we are already seeing benefits from in a short time.</p><p>Knowing that co-founder conflicts are the most common reason for start-up failures, we made completing this document a priority and took it very seriously. We were able to iron out some differences we had from the very get go, and working through the document also helped us set the expectations for each other going forward as we work closely together for the next few years.</p><p>This is a highly recommended step for anyone founding a start-up, even though at first it might seem like \u201cextra work\u201d being added to the mountain of to-dos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The EEM (Eisenhower Effort Matrix)</h1><h2>Eisenhower Matrix Simplified</h2><p>Named after the 34th President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, this matrix prioritizes tasks based on their urgency and importance. The result is a quadrant system for categorization:</p><ol><li>Top left is where quadrant one \u201cUrgent and Important (Do - Do it now)\u201d</li><li>Top right is where quadrant two \u201cNot Urgent but Important (Decide - Schedule a time to do it)\u201d</li><li>Bottom left is where quadrant three \u201cUrgent but Not Important (Delegate - Who can do it for you?)\u201d</li><li>Bottom right is where quadrant four \u201cNeither Urgent nor Important (Delete - Eliminate it)\u201d</li></ol><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aNKBwj6esW7RdvnwJ/obaciyvbf1allc97wbi0\"></p><p>(image source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/eisenhower-box\"><u>James Clear</u></a>)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have personally been using this matrix for over 10 years in my \u201clife productivity system\u201d (tracking and managing everything from career tasks, to personal tasks, to family tasks, to church tasks, etc.).</p><p>By adhering to this matrix, tasks are executed based on genuine necessity, not mere urgency.</p><p>Here are a couple more resources/videos about the Eisenhower matrix from within the EA forum:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZYPTdny6iuKTZhC8A/three-lessons-i-ve-learnt-from-starting-a-small-ea-org\"><u>Three lessons I've learnt from starting a small EA org</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KDMosgfZKsa2P3hNu/updated-psychology-of-ea-course-reading-videos-and-syllabus\"><u>Updated \u2018Psychology of EA\u2019 course: reading, videos, and syllabus</u></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>My Simple Rule</h3><p>My simple rule (not sure if this is the ideal) is to do things that are in quadrant one and work your way down to three. Tasks in quadrant four are of no value, so either you can do it in your spare time or simply ignore/archive them.</p><p>If managed/planned correctly, <strong><u>most of your day should be working on items found in quadrant two</u></strong> (planned important tasks/projects that you scheduled), and not from quadrant one (e.g. putting out emergency fires).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>CE\u2019s Brilliant Extension</h2><p>When I read CE\u2019s adaptation of the Eisenhower matrix page 120 of the handbook, I was amazed. In their exact words:</p><blockquote><p><i>The Eisenhower matrix suggests prioritizing tasks according to importance and urgency. We extend this model by including the core task categories from above. This forces you to assign each task to a substantial success factor. This is a first filter against tasks not directly contributing to your charity\u2019s success. Moreover, we add effort, as this helps you identify low-hanging fruit.</i></p></blockquote><p>Please refer to the handbook for CE\u2019s five rules to implement the grading framework.</p><p>As I\u2019ve been using the Eisenhower Matrix for a long time, I too have tried to improve the model but I did it in terms of time estimates. However, after a while I found time estimates to be too granular (I was doing estimates in minutes), and abandoned the concept.</p><p>In contrast, CE extended the Eisenhower matrix using Effort (High, Medium, Low). This simple addition brilliantly visualizes which are the low-hanging fruits in the traditional Eisenhower matrix quadrants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>My Further Adaptation</h2><p>Pictures are worth a thousand words\u2026 So, let\u2019s compare the Eisenhower matrix (image source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/eisenhower-box\"><u>James Clear</u></a>) with the EEM:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aNKBwj6esW7RdvnwJ/obaciyvbf1allc97wbi0\"></p><p>First, in the traditional Eisenhower matrix, tasks are either Important or Not Important, either Urgent or Not Urgent.</p><p>Like suggested by CE\u2019s handbook, I also find this too rigid as there should be some middle ground. Hence, CE\u2019s handbook suggested on page 120 that Importance, Urgency and Effort can be graded as High, Medium, or Low as below:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aNKBwj6esW7RdvnwJ/towe0srxowgdcm1fwcit\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my EEM, I took CE\u2019s suggested rating for Importance and Urgency. However, for Effort, I made a further adaptation by changing Effort to represent time estimates (this time in hours). Here is a breakdown of the categories and ratings:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Importance</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Urgency</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Effort (time estimates in hours)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>(1) High</p><p>(2) Medium</p><p>(3) Low</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>(1) High</p><p>(2) Medium</p><p>(3) Low</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>(1) Low = &lt;1h</p><p>(2) Med = 1h to 2h</p><p>(3) High = 2h to 3h</p><p>(4) projects that span days, needs mandatory sub-tasks</p><p>(5) projects that span weeks, needs mandatory sub-tasks</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With these ratings, the EEM forms a 3x3 grid like the below this table where tasks are slot into:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>EEM</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Urgency (U1) High</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Urgency (U2) Medium</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Urgency (U3) Low</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Importance (I1) High</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I1) (U1)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I1) (U2)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I1) (U3)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Importance (I2) Medium</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I2) (U1)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I2) (U2)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I2) (U3)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Importance (I3) Low</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I3) (U1)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I3) (U2)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">(I3) (U3)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again, I took CE\u2019s suggestion where each task should be assigned to a core task category (to make sure each task belongs to a \u201csubstantial success factor\u201d).

With the labels written out, it would show as the following table:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Top row only</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Urgency (U1) High</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Urgency (U2) Medium</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Urgency (U3) Low</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Importance (I1) High</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>[Task] complete Founder's Agreement v1 (E2)<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>[Task] establish productivity workspace (E4)<br><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>[Task] create socials for StakeOut.AI (E1)</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>[Task] Create funding proposal (E2)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>[Task] co-founders monthly happiness check-ins (E1)</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>[Task] Optimize pitch deck (E4)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since we are working from left to right, and prioritizing the lowest Effort first, we should be completing the tasks in the following order (if due dates are, resources available and dependencies are ignored - see caveat below):</p><ol><li>complete Founder's Agreement v1 (E2)</li><li>establish productivity workspace (E4)</li><li>create socials for StakeOut.AI (E1)</li><li>Create funding proposal (E2)</li><li>co-founders monthly happiness check-ins (E1)</li><li>Optimize pitch deck (E4)</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you can imagine, as there are more and more tasks added to each space within the 3x3 grid, being able to easily see the low-hanging fruit within each space makes choosing which tasks to work on a walk in the park.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Caveat</u>:&nbsp;</strong>The EEM is not the end-all-be-all. Projects and tasks typically have due dates and dependencies (tasks blocking other tasks). That\u2019s why while project planning, we are taking into account the EEM, while at the same time juggling due dates, resources available and dependencies. Thus, we cannot simply look at the EEM and always go after the low-hanging fruits. This is why I love the Gantt chart, which allows for much better project planning while using all the advantages of the EEM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Real Example - Here is a Look at Our Gantt Chart</h3><p>The purple vertical line is the current week:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aNKBwj6esW7RdvnwJ/uthb18gbhk56sfptqio3\"></p><p><br>Of course, CE's suggestion to revisit the Founder\u2019s Agreement every three, six or 12 months to see where you stand and adapt, is scheduled as an recurring event.</p><p>And yes, you guessed it: CE\u2019s other suggestions of maintaining a healthy co-founder relationship were also scheduled in:</p><ul><li>\u201cfounder nights\u201d to have fun together (for us, virtually) outside of work</li><li>\u201chappiness &amp; collaboration check-ins\u201d to discuss your satisfaction levels</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Last point, <u>ClickUp is not perfect</u>. In fact, there are many features I expect within a project management software that should be there but still aren't (some of these \u201cfeature requests\u201d have been voted up 1.2k times and still not yet been implemented). Having said that, ClickUp is what we are using because of the many benefits it has over the competition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Notion.so</h2><p>After some testing, I was able to replicate a similar EEM 3x3 grid in Notion. However, it\u2019s not as clean and intuitive as ClickUp in my opinion.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aNKBwj6esW7RdvnwJ/eonoigesgzofjxtkuoep\"></p><p><br>Additionally, from my research,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/clickup/s/SJRL83w5zl\"><u>Notion is not specifically designed for projects and tasks tracking at the team-level</u></a> - it's best for personal tasks. Reason being that team collaboration requires granular permissions which becomes cumbersome when using notion unless you are willing to share items individually to specific persons.</p><p>Thus, keeping scalability in mind with the addition of other reasons, we chose to go with ClickUp over Notion as our project management platform to boost our productivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Asana.com</h2><p>This is recommended by many people in EA. Unfortunately, at the time of testing, I was not able to implement the EEM inside of Asana.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tool #4</h2><p>In terms of project planning, using templates for repeated tasks, I know of a better tool. However, since I haven\u2019t tested implementing the EEM on this tool yet, I\u2019ll reserve the space here if I get around to testing it in the future.</p><p>For now, what we have set up currently is great enough :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Beyond Setup: The Journey to Habit Formation</h1><p>With any productivity tool, the initial setup is only half the battle.

You're either \"making sausage\" or asking the boss which direction to go on a decision.</p><p>This might be a highly internal meme that the military is circulating, but this hit me exactly in how to develop a leader. If you're familiar with the Military Decision Making Process(MDMP) it lays out how to develop courses of actions for tactical through strategic leaders. The entire process is several more in depth steps but it all boils down to these two things.</p><p>This, in brief is the shortest distillation of what the MDMP loop is.</p><p>Right now, we hold two types of meetings.</p><h2>(1) Planning and Course of Action Development&nbsp;</h2><p>A Meeting where we as a staff or group develop several courses of actions and recommendations. There's a lot of back and forth and we come up with something to present to the boss/commander or whoever is making a decision. We call this one \"sausage-making\" (apologies to vegans, vegetarians and anyone grossed out by this).</p><h2>(2) Decision Brief</h2><p>&nbsp;A decision brief where the boss/commander is presented with different courses of action, information and the staffs recommendation. Note that generally a commander in the military is someone who has served in a staff or subsidiary position for several years after completing college and several professional military schools.&nbsp;</p><h2>How you can use this in your organization</h2><p>If you're trying to hold a meeting and you're not sure the purpose of the meeting, ask the question. Are we making a decision during this meeting or just going over options? That will drive it.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're not trying to get everyone together so you're not missing out on input, then perhaps this can be an email. If you just need a bit more information you don't need to pull everyone in.</p><p>Onerous requirements from higher echelons of the Army that take up too much training time drove this, as units were having to deal with dozens of competing requirements.

I would have even accepted a book that taught me a lot about the history, or that gave me a lot of anecdotal accounts that weaved stories both from the regulatory and user side of things. But instead I got none of this. Perhaps I'm not the target audience, maybe it's for people who haven't though much about the issue before. But there are still major issues (see Chapter 12) and insufficient summaries (see Chapter 13) to contend with, leading me to think I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Overall, I'd say about 5% of the book was new, useful material for me, another 5% a worthwhile read, and the rest either introductory or poor quality material that didn't help me grow at all. I'll proceed with a chapter by chapter breakdown (grouping similar ones together) to shine some further light.</p><p><br>Chapters 1 &amp; 2 felt like a long ego trip. Don't get me wrong, the events are worth writing about, but Nutt doesn't give much substance here, he just gives you a sort of tabloid overview of the situation that felt like it was about 95% filler and 5% content. I would have loved to have learned more about the traditional relationship between the ACMD and the government, he gives something like a paragraph on this topic that I think had to be far richer and would either paint a picture of a relationship that has grown fraught recently or one that has been flawed from the start, each suggesting different ways to remedy the problem.<br><br>Chapters 3, 4, 5 &amp; 16 all felt <strong>incredibly </strong>introductory, so if you have even a basic familiarity I recommend to skip them entirely. Note: the chronicling of how perception of cannibas changed from medicine to drug in chapter 5 was a notable exception that was something new and interesting.<br><br>Chapters 6 and 7 were almost enough to give this book two stars. Six presented the problems associated with alcohol better than any other place I've seen, and did a really good job to succinctly make the case for why we should think about it differently than we do. Seven did a good job at looking at the specific evolution of British policy on Mephedrone, and did a much better job to analyze something specific that actually shed some light on the issue and how to do better in the future.<br><br>Chapters 8 and 9 were a sloppy attempt at trying to say something meaningful about addiction, that didn't have the investigative journalism strength of Dopesick or the argumentative rigor of Addiction is a Choice.<br><br>Chapters 10 &amp; 17 presented good questions, and gave some useful ways to think about them, but also took way too long to develop the ideas and could have been conveyed in half the pages (or probably in a set of bullet points for 17).<br><br>Chapters 11 &amp; 15 were the places I expected to find policy Dos and Donts, and sure, there were some shallow recommendations (i.e. the generally push to remove triggers for people's addictions seems good and worth following). But again on the whole they were just way to abstract and felt like a cursory glance rather than a thoughtful engagement with potential policies.<br><br>Chapter 12 was by far the worst part of this book, transitioning from filler material to actively misleading and bad material. He started with a literary drive-by on prescription drugs that aren't psychotropic, like opiates, butchering the state of affairs and processing it in a matter of pages. He says at one point \"Although physical dependence can happen when these drugs are taken therapeutically, the psychological cravings of addiction seem to occur only when these drugs are taken in non-prescribed ways\" (216). He cites no sources for this, and seems to be saying something like \"look, it's only when people misuse the drugs that harm comes up, so prescribing them for these medical cases isn't the issue\" which would seem to imply he has done very little to consider how the opioid epidemic in the US started and what actors fanned the flame. The rest of the chapter is about psychotropic medication (mostly anti-depressants) and he generally seems unable to see with clear eyes here. Despite how he extorts alcohol going uncontested for its normalcy of use in everyday life, he doesn't happen to consider the negative side to antidepressants for even a sentence in this chapter. He claims that \"the most powerful effect of SSRIs is preventing the recurrence of these disorders so long as patients continue to take their treatment\" (223) but has no data to support how good these medications are at preventing recurrence (hint, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20616621/\"><u>not very</u></a>). He makes arguments without drawing out his reasoning and support for the connections between various different pieces, using a figure on p.291 to show how benzos work for those with \"abnormally low GABA function\" but then failing to provide any support for those with anxiety, the target audience for the drug, often having abnormally low GABA function. He dismisses the troubles of withdraws from these medications in a sentence, saying \"once the period of withdrawal has passed, they will probably feel better than they did before treatment\" (hint, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7841856/\"><u>they often don't</u></a>). He talks about the issue of anti-depressants and increased suicidal ideation, noting that there does seem to be a remarkable increase for those under 18, but then dismisses this in the span of a sentence because antidepressants aren't \"recommended\" for this age group (hint, not only are they recommended, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3223889/\"><u>they often are prescribed</u></a>). He even does on to make the psychotropic drug-insulin comparison in the next chapter, saying \"a child who needs Ritalin to function normally is not addicted. If they had diabetes they would need insulin every day and would suffer physical problems without it, but we wouldn't consider them 'addicted'\" (241). We know diabetics need insulin, do we <strong>know </strong>that children who can't focus need Ritalin? This chapter went beyond sloppy to be borderline harmful, giving people a false sense of safety and confidence in a book that otherwise tries to uncover the \"truth\" despite what current opinion is. (And perhaps we shouldn't be surprised, Nutt is a psychiatrist after all).<br><br>Chapter 13 was partially a continuation of 12 on a new subject (performance enhancing) that just didn't seem to say much with backing and stuck to more general conjecture on the issue.&nbsp;<br><br>Chapter 14 again really suffered from a lack of engagement with some of the other literature out there. He briefly mentions the studies on psychedelics and addiction (255), but fails to bring home how the results from the Canadian study indicate psychedelic treatment for alcohol addiction is far more effective than any of the alternatives he mentioned before. I'd read How to Change your mind any day for a more nuanced and historical account of this specific class, one that might actual have something meaningful to say on their potential for treatment beyond the basics.</p>", "user": {"username": "tswizzle96"}}, {"_id": "cNFtvat57P9i8BEe9", "title": "Beware Profit-Driven Automation that Shrinks the Economy", "postedAt": "2023-10-05T13:00:06.335Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Epistemic status: moderate confidence about internal validity, low about external validity.

This increases awareness and engagement.</li><li>Facilitating contributions - Listing organizational needs and contributor offerings makes it simpler to offer skills, time, and resources. This grows resources available to the ecosystem.</li><li>Building community - Social features motivate participation while rewards and recognition reinforce it. This fosters a culture of action.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Supporting a broad definition of effective altruism, where people are encouraged to be conscious of their actions without overanalyzing. The platform also guides users towards more effective decisions, like which organizations to contribute to.</p><p>Together this significantly increases funding, talent, and grassroots mobilization for crucial work on risks like climate change and AI safety.</p><h2><strong>Comparing For Future to Existing Solutions</strong></h2><p>There are currently several tools that address the various user needs For Future aims to fulfill, but none provide an integrated solution:</p><ul><li>Directories of organizations: HIP Professionals, CoImpact Labs, user-created databases&nbsp;</li><li>Directories of contribution opportunities: 80,000 Hours, Democracy Lab, Catch A Fire</li><li>Directories of contributors: HIP Professionals, CoImpact Labs</li><li>Discussion forums: Effective Altruism Forum, Reddit</li><li>Social networking: Various groups on Facebook, Slack, LinkedIn with affiliations ranging from Effective Altruism to Fridays For Future to other miscellaneous interests.</li></ul><p>For Future brings these elements together on one platform, similar to how startup ecosystems like AngelList and Startups.com offer tools like social networking, job boards, and expert advice to serve entrepreneur needs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Objections</strong></p><ol><li>One concern is that by facilitating contributions to non-EA vetted organizations, we may not ensure the most effective giving and could potentially support harmful organizations. As an open network, there is also the potential to inadvertently support organizations that may do harm.<ol><li>&nbsp;Our response to this concern is that we do not currently have the capability or intention to gatekeep contributions. We also believe in supporting all impact-driven organizations. However, we plan to implement features such as a \"blue checkmark\u201d to indicate organizations that have been vetted, and we will provide links to an organization's impact reports to help users make informed decisions about their contributions.</li></ol></li><li>Another objection is that For Future may prioritize popular topics and organizations over those that are truly impactful<u>.</u><ol><li>For Future's main newsfeed is designed to display posts from across the network, regardless of whether the account is followed or not.

Every student always wants to make it by passing their exams, getting an attachment, and finally getting a job when done with school. An employee rates their success through the projects they have completed, the tasks they have been able to complete, and how satisfied the client and the boss is. So after that, they can easily say they have had a successful month.&nbsp;</p><p>We must all accept that we all have different definitions of success and we may only focus on one definition here but in the broad spectrum, I hope we will all understand.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Wikipedia success is the state of meeting a defined range of expectations. It may be viewed as the opposite of failure. The criteria for success depend on context and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system.&nbsp;</p><p>Success is important as it allows us to feel we have completed sth and it has worked out well according to how we had envisioned it, this ideally brings about confidence and a feeling of fulfillment, and people also benefit from whatever successful achievement you have made.&nbsp;<br><br>Now even though success is really good there are times when we all have to go to the drawing board and look at was that success was effective, whether will it last long term or whether was it just a short-term success, and where can we improve this success so that we can make it better for people around us and even generations to come from this.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's consider an organization focused on providing services to construction sites around Nairobi, Kenya. After establishment, they obviously had to go the marketing route and market their products and services. In case those marketing efforts were successful by bringing in more clients then the campaigns would be effective and successful and that would be termed as a successful campaign. But we must remember times change and so do people. So the same marketing actions that were taken then could not be used now or at a later date. They have to sit and evaluate what made it successful, what has changed, what can they use now to make it more successful, and how better would their services help other people.&nbsp;</p><p>Evaluation is really important as it helps us gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of our initiatives, identifies areas for improvement, and adapts their strategies accordingly. This iterative process allows us to enhance our impact and achieve better outcomes in their pursuit of doing good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CASE SCENARIO:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In 2020 we had the real monster in the room and that was COVID-19. We may not tell much about it as so many countries were affected and so many people lost their lives either when they contracted the deadly disease or soon after they received the great vaccine. We can all agree that that moment was tough for most people. Some of us ask, \u201cShould I take the vaccine it has just been developed some months ago.\u201d Some of us were quite skeptical about the vaccine and that might have prevented so many people from having it. As many may say any risk is frightening and some people avoided it as much as they would. There are reports that have since then come out to show that the vaccine has had some very detrimental effects on some people and even caused loss of life for some.&nbsp;<br><br>The effect of the vaccine may have had its positive side but we cannot ignore the negatives. The amount of time and effort it took to develop the vaccine how fast it was rolled out and the amount of cancellations people got from saying anything negative about it might have raised some eyebrows. We cannot deny the vaccine itself had some great effect and that cannot be ignored but it is high time we evaluate its success and failures and even get scientists to have a greater look at it and make adjustments that will help us avoid any future cases of the same.</p><p><br>According to Paul&nbsp;<i>Goepfert</i>, M.D., director of the&nbsp;<i>Alabama</i> Vaccine Research Clinic, \u201cMany people worry that these vaccines were \u2018rushed\u2019 into use and still do not have full FDA approval \u2014 they are currently being distributed under Emergency Use Authorizations,\u201d Goepfert said. \u201cBut because we have had so many people vaccinated, we actually have far more safety data than we have had for any other vaccine, and these COVID vaccines have an incredible safety track record.

Why is famine so closely connected with societal collapse? This post will summarize the reasons for this strong connection.</p><h1>Famines have many triggers</h1><p>To begin, the food system is very connected with many parts of our society. For example, we need a stable climate, a steady supply of fertilizers and pesticides, and transportation infrastructure to move the food from where it is grown to where it is needed. This interconnectedness means that many different kinds of events could impact the food system. One framework that highlights this well can be found in a paper by Avin et al. (2018). They used the existing planetary boundaries system (more information about planetary boundaries in the context of collapse can be found <a href=\"https://existentialcrunch.substack.com/p/mapping-out-collapse-research#%C2%A7limits-to-growth\">here</a>) to identify which parts of human society are vulnerable to global catastrophes (for example nuclear war, asteroid impacts, and geoengineering). They classify the global catastrophes by the critical societal systems they interact with (e.g. the food system or global security) and what the spread mechanism of the catastrophe is (e.g. if it spreads by natural systems like air dispersal or more abstract networks like the digital infrastructure). They find that our food system is the one part of our society that is impacted by the largest amount of global catastrophes.</p><p>This is largely due to the food system\u2019s dependence on a stable status quo. Food is continuously grown and needs a steady input of acceptable climate, fertilizers/pesticides to be grown and an intact trade system to be distributed. If any part of this chain is disrupted, food production suffers.</p><p>This description is relatively abstract. We can also look at more empirical assessment of how the food system is influenced by a lot of factors. A 2019 paper by Cottrell et al. looked at food production data for crops, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture and determined if a food shock happened in those areas in the years 1961 to 2013. They define a food shock as any event in their data where there is a negative break in the autocorrelation in the data and try to find a real world event that can explain this break. Autocorrelation is a statistical concept that measures how closely a data point is related to its past values. They find that food production shocks are happening more or less constantly, but only on a local level that averages out most of the time if you look at it globally. They find that the main reasons for those shocks are climate events (strongest for crops), geopolitical events (strongest for livestock and aquaculture) and mismanagement (strongest for fisheries) (Figure 1).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mbNfaWwzTuc5ATDxv/t80jge3ggwg3qewz41rf\" alt=\"Food Shocks\"></p><p>Figure 1: Causes of food production shocks (Cottrell et al., 2019)</p><h1>Famines are self-reinforcing</h1><p>So there are a lot of ways to arrive at famine. But a second reason for the connection between famine and social collapse is that once you are in a famine it is difficult to get out of it again, as the famine tends to reinforce itself. Charalampopoulos &amp; Droulia (2021) looked at historical famines and tried to come up with a simple model that captures the relationship between extreme weather events and famine. I adapted it from their paper (Figure 2) to a more general form, as their explanation seems to me like they are agnostic of what is the cause of the famine.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mbNfaWwzTuc5ATDxv/khzjalyhd4czhydjr0ch\" alt=\"Famine\"></p><p>Figure 2: The self-reinforcing mechanism of famines (adapted from Charalampopoulos &amp; Droulia (2021)). Red arrows indicate the self-reinforcing famine cycle.</p><p>The self-reinforcing cycle they describe originates with a triggering event, which can encompass various factors that create stress for a society. This can be a global catastrophic risk, but the concept applies broadly to any event that significantly diminishes food production or disrupts trade and can be local, regional or global. This triggering event operates through multiple pathways. Firstly, it can hinder crop production by creating adverse conditions for plant growth, such as reduced temperatures. Secondly, it leads to a reduction in the overall population of the society and thus decreases the pool of available labor. Lastly, it creates transportation challenges that hinder the efficient distribution of food. Should these effects reach a critical magnitude, they set in motion a self-reinforcing cycle:</p><ul><li>A society that experiences a substantial loss of population will inevitably see a decline in its capacity to both produce and trade food resources.</li><li>Reduced food production and trade result in a decreased availability of food within the society.</li><li>The scarcity of food leads to increased instances of famine, exacerbating the prevalence of deaths and health-related issues, thus initiating the subsequent iteration of the cycle.</li></ul><p>This self-reinforcing cycle continues until one of two things happen: You get food from somewhere else or our local population and food production have found a new equilibrium. The first option was often not available in the past, as moving goods was comparatively expensive before we had fossil fuels and would not be available today if we faced a global catastrophe. The second option usually means that the new equilibrium is considerably lower than before. As the famine continues, the societal structures needed to produce a high amount of food crumble. The lowest equilibria is either smallholder farms or hunter gatherer tribes. Charalampopoulos &amp; Droulia (2021) argue famines are comparable with major wars, when it comes to the destruction of social structures and population numbers. They also emphasize that famines usually happen in tandem with other disruptive events like war, migration, or revolution. This makes it even more difficult to stop the famine cycle.</p><h1>Famines are hard to defend against</h1><p>So lots of things can cause famines, and once they get started they can be hard to pull out of. But they\u2019re also hard to protect against. Humans eat a lot of food and much of the food we have goes bad quickly, especially if it is not cooled. This means there is only a limited amount of food available at any given time.</p><p>It is difficult to estimate the global amount of food; it also varies over time, depending on the season. However, there are some rough estimates. Baum et al. (2015) did a literature review on what interventions could increase resilience to global food supply catastrophes and find that we can expect to have a leeway of 4-7 months of food supplies globally. They also argue that while food storages create some slack in the system they are not really the solution to bigger catastrophes. Food storage is very expensive. Creating and maintaining large food reserves increases the price of food globally, which makes more humans insecure in the present. Finally, many of the catastrophes that could lead to a global societal collapse would need food supplies for 5-15 years (for instance, nuclear winter, volcanic winter or impact winter). It could simply be near impossible to store such a gigantic amount of food safely for such a long time. This means that food storage can only ever contribute to food security, but not be the sole solution, especially for bigger catastrophes.</p><p>While storing food in advance of a famine is challenging (especially for multi-year global famines), this is not the only way countries can reduce their risk. It is notable that no stable democracy has yet experienced a famine (Hasell &amp; Roser, 2013). More broadly, as discussed <a href=\"https://florianjehn.github.io/Societal_Collapse/2023-08-16-democracy_and_resilience/\">in this earlier post</a>, participation and democracy have been found to enhance societal resilience.</p><h1>Trade and Famines Today</h1><p>All these points show that our food system is quite vulnerable to a variety of stressors and we cannot simply store enough food to stabilize it. However, the past also shows that food supply shocks don\u2019t have to lead to famine if there is an outside source that can make up for the loss of food production.</p><p>Global catastrophic risks don\u2019t apply uniform stress on our food system. There will always be areas that will be hit less and that might still be able to produce food, even in more extreme circumstances. One paper that explores this is Boyd &amp; Wilson (2022). For all major islands (for example, like Iceland or Australia (which you might count as a continent sized island) they collect empirical data on things like food production, food availability and other factors which are important after global catastrophes. Among major islands, Australia comes out on top for many of those factors. From the perspective of protecting against global famine risk, it is especially relevant that Australia\u2019s food production capabilities are quite large, as it is a major exporter. This implies that Australia could serve as an important stabilizer for global food production, so long as trade remains feasible.</p><p>Indeed, the importance of trade comes up in a lot of research that looks into food security, both now and after catastrophes (like the work by Boyd &amp; Wilson). For instance, Wang et al. (2023) use global trade data from 1986 to 2018 to show that the number of countries who trade food and the amount of food they trade has risen considerably over time. This means that food trade is now much more important for the food security of many countries than in the past. Wang and co-authors also raise the alarm that this network could quickly unravel if important food exporting nations introduce food export bans, as this will likely lead to a cascade of food export bans globally, which in turn would make many countries food insecure. Now, and especially after a catastrophe.</p><p>All this shows that while our current food system is able to create food security for most of humanity, there are many pathways which could end this relatively stable regime. Wang et al. summarized this as our food system being \u201crobust, but fragile\u201d. We can buffer small shocks easily, if this would also be the case after a major shock is much less certain.</p><h1>References</h1><p>Avin, S., Wintle, B.

In short, this may be a valid criticism of the book - it has been a while since I read it but in podcasts I recall MacAskill saying that how much resource we should devote to longtermism is an open question. MacAskill does say however that it is clear we should be devoting a lot more resources than we currently do.</p><p>#4 is a related critique to #1 - without specifying how seriously we should take longtermism we can\u2019t really say how much it would alter our current priorities. I will leave this to the addendum as well.</p><p>#2 and #3 is where I want to respond in some detail.</p><h2>Plant misrepresents MacAskill\u2019s view on the implications of the \u2018intuition of neutrality\u2019 for longtermism</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/intuition-of-neutrality\"><u>intuition of neutrality</u></a> is the view in population ethics that, roughly, adding a person to the population is in itself ethically neutral. If it is ethically neutral to add people, we shouldn\u2019t be concerned by the fact that extinction would remove the possibility of future people.</p><p>Plant states in his summary of the book:</p><blockquote><p>If [the intuition of neutrality] is correct, this would present a severe challenge to longtermism: we would be indifferent about bringing about those future (happy) generations.</p></blockquote><p>By including this in the summary section Plant is (incorrectly) implying that this is a view that MacAskill espouses in the book. Quoting from the book itself, MacAskill says (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>If you endorse the intuition of neutrality, then&nbsp;<strong>ensuring that our future is good, while civilisation persists, might seem much more important than ensuring our future is long</strong>. You would still think that safeguarding civilisation is good because doing so reduces the risk of death for those alive today, and you might still put great weight on the loss of future artistic and scientific accomplishments that the end of civilisation would entail. But you wouldn\u2019t regard the absence of future generations in itself as a moral loss.</p></blockquote><p>MacAskill does&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>think that longtermism would be undermined if the intuition of neutrality is correct. MacAskill&nbsp;<strong>does</strong> think that it would undermine the importance of ensuring we don\u2019t go extinct, but he thinks there are other longtermist approaches that improve the quality of the future assuming we don\u2019t go extinct, and that these would remain important.</p><p>As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ocmEFL2uDSMzvwL8P/possible-misconceptions-about-strong-longtermism#_Longtermists_must_be_total_utilitarians_\"><u>I have previously explained</u></a>, these approaches might include:</p><ul><li>Mitigating climate change.</li><li>Institutional design.</li><li>Ensuring aligned AI.</li></ul><p>Even if it is Plant\u2019s view, he is wrong to state as fact / imply that MacAskill believes that the intuition of neutrality being incorrect would \u201cpresent a severe challenge to longtermism\u201d. Similarly to MacAskill, I disagree that it would.</p><h2>I am unconvinced that \u201cmany\u201d disagree that \u2018future people count\u2019</h2><p>From Plant\u2019s review:</p><blockquote><p>Far future people might little count&nbsp;<i>in practice</i>, because they are largely hypothetical, and hypothetical people may not count. The premise \u2018future people count\u2019 is not straightforward.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The intuition of neutrality is based on the notion there is a morally relevant distinction between people who do exist and those who&nbsp;<i>could</i> exist. MacAskill may not be sympathetic to the intuition of neutrality, but many philosophers think, after serious reflection, it is approximately correct.</p></blockquote><p>Plant raises the \u201cintuition of neutrality\u201d as the justification for doubting that hypothetical future people count. Plant says that \u201cmany philosophers think, after serious reflection, it [the intuition of neutrality] is approximately correct\u201d. He doesn\u2019t define what \u201cmany\u201d means, but does give two examples of people. I am left having to take Plant on his word that \u201cmany\u201d philosophers accept the intuition of neutrality because he certainly hasn\u2019t provided any evidence of that claim - one cannot reasonably consider two people to be \u201cmany\u201d.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/seoWmmoaiXTJCiX5h/the-psychology-of-population-ethics#3__People_value_the_addition_of_new_people\"><u>There is in fact evidence</u></a> that people generally do not endorse the intuition of neutrality, viewing it as good to create new happy people and as bad to create new unhappy people. This is very unsurprising to me. For example, I think it would be difficult to find even a small number of people who would think it morally neutral to create a life that was certain to undergo immense agony for its entire existence.</p><p>What do philosophers think? Unfortunately I am unaware of a clear survey on the matter. Off the top of my head I am aware of Johann Frick, Jan Narveson and Melinda Roberts (after reading Plant\u2019s review) who endorse the intuition of neutrality. I am aware of far more who reject it or on balance seem against it. These include: Will MacAskill, Hilary Greaves, John Broome, Derek Parfit, Peter Singer, Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, Jeff McMahan, Toby Ord, and probably each of the 28 people who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/what-should-we-agree-on-about-the-repugnant-conclusion/EB52C686BAFEF490CE37043A0A3DD075\"><u>publicly stated they don\u2019t find the repugnant conclusion problematic</u></a> (5 of which I have already listed).</p><p>Of course me being aware of more philosophers who are anti rather than pro the intuition of neutrality doesn\u2019t prove anything. My point is that Plant certainly hasn\u2019t achieved his goal of changing my impression that the intuition of neutrality is a pretty fringe view amongst both philosophers and the general public. To do that, he would have to provide some evidence.</p><h2>Plant presents a very one-sided analysis of the non-identity problem</h2><p>In arguing against MacAskill\u2019s premise that \u201cwe can make [future people\u2019s lives] go better\u201d, Plant raises a (possibly) valid point:</p><blockquote><p>Our actions today will change who exists later. If we enact some policy, then Angela will never exist, but Bob will. The result is that we cannot make the far future better&nbsp;<i>for anyone in particular</i>: it is not better for Angela not to exist, and it is not good for Bob to exist (intuitively, existence is never better for a person); this is the infamous&nbsp;<i>non-identity</i> problem. A direct implication of this, however, is that (3) seems false: we cannot make the lives of future people go better: all we can do is cause someone not to exist and someone else to exist instead. In one sense then, people far away in time are just like those far away in space: we are powerless to help them.</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m fairly agnostic on most of what Plant is saying here. While it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iffs.se/media/23233/climate_ethics_vol3_webb.pdf#page=164\"><u>has been argued</u></a> that it might be better for a person to exist than not, I am unclear on how many philosophers accept this and I am not sure where I personally land on this issue. Ultimately this is all a moot point for me because I am not really interested in making future lives go better. Instead I am interested in&nbsp;<i>improving the future</i>.</p><p>The impression Plant gives in his review is that improving the future is not possible because of the non-identity problem. This is a&nbsp;<i>very</i> one-sided view of the non-identity problem. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/#ActWronWithMakiThinWorsForAnyExisFutuPersImpeWron\"><u>page on the non-identity problem</u></a> points out, one can also view the non-identity problem as a problem for the person-affecting intuition that \u201can act can be wrong only if that act makes things worse for, or (we can say) harms, some existing or future person\u201d. Why? Because combining the person-affecting intuition with the fact that our actions change who will live in the future can lead to some very counterintuitive conclusions.</p><p>Let me give two examples:</p><ol><li><strong>Emitting carbon dioxide in vast quantities is fine:</strong> emitting carbon dioxide in vast quantities would speed up climate change and make earth much hotter and much less pleasant to live on in the future. Emitting carbon dioxide however changes future identities, so doesn\u2019t actually make things worse for anyone in particular. The conclusion? Emit carbon dioxide to your heart\u2019s content.</li><li><strong>Enacting a policy that involves placing millions of landmines set to go off in 200 years in random locations on earth is fine:</strong> let\u2019s assume future people don\u2019t know about this policy. The landmines are going to cause a vast amount of suffering, killing people, leaving children parentless, and leaving people permanently incapacitated. Placing the landmines changes future identities though, so doesn\u2019t actually make things worse for anyone in particular. Conclusion: go ahead, place the landmines, who cares?</li></ol><p>The first example at least is very well known, and is powerful. Indeed, the SEP article states that&nbsp;<strong>rejecting the person-affecting intuition has been the most common response</strong> to the non-identity problem (which incidentally might also imply that most philosophers reject the \u2018intuition of neutrality\u2019).</p><p>Some philosophers have rejected the person-affecting intuition by adopting an \u2018impersonal\u2019 account of wrongdoing in which the identities of affected individuals is not important. A common \u2018impersonal\u2019 account is \u2018total utilitarianism\u2019 which involves judging states of the world by adding up the total amount of wellbeing in each state (not caring who this wellbeing accrues to). Adopting total utilitarianism implies that both of the actions in the above examples (emitting carbon dioxide and placing landmines) are likely wrong because they will reduce future wellbeing. This is a very intuitive way of judging these policies.</p><p>With regards to total utilitarianism, Plant says that \u201cmany (still) regard it as a non-starter\u201d due to Parfit\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/\"><u>repugnant conclusion</u></a>\u201d. Again, no evidence is provided for the claim that \u201cmany\u201d hold this view.</p><p>Plant might say there wasn\u2019t space to cover these nuances but, honestly, these aren\u2019t nuances - these are extremely important points that are core to the non-identity problem and our moral consideration of the far future. I won\u2019t go as far as to label Plant as dishonest by omitting these considerations but, given that Plant is a PhD philosopher, I find it puzzling that he could present such a one-sided analysis of the non-identity problem. Given this I personally find the following in his review quite ironic:</p><blockquote><p>Hence, it seems objectionable to describe the premises as simple and uncontroversial, especially when the readers are primarily non-philosophers who are liable to take MacAskill at his word. I appreciate MacAskill is trying to spare the reader the intricacies of population ethics. Yet, there is a difference between saying \u2018This is incredibly complicated, but everyone ultimately agrees\u2019 and \u2018This is incredibly complicated, people disagree furiously, and my argument (may) rely on a controversial view I will only briefly defend.\u2019</p></blockquote><h2>Plant dismisses being able to shape the far future much too easily</h2><p>In his review Plant expresses skepticism that ending slavery was an example of influencing the long-run future because he doesn\u2019t think that it was \u201ccontingent\u201d i.e. he doubts that that if the abolitionists hadn\u2019t done what they did it might have been that slavery would never have been abolished (or at least not for a very long time).</p><p>Plant does no more than simply state that he doubts the abolition of slavery was contingent. He doesn\u2019t engage with the arguments that MacAskill puts forward for contingency in his book. I\u2019m going to put that aside and assume that Plant is right on this point.</p><p>Even if Plant is right on the abolition of slavery not being contingent, his dismissal that we can shape the future seems much too strong. Firstly he says:</p><blockquote><p>I would like to have seen MacAskill explore the extent to which the case for longtermism depends on being able to point to past successes. We should be sceptical that we will succeed if others have failed \u2013 unless we can identify what is different now.</p></blockquote><p>There are in fact a few things that are different now:</p><ol><li><strong>We actually have a concept of longtermism now</strong>: and we have a whole community of people trying to influence the far future. Before Parfit\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/12484\"><u>Reasons and Persons</u></a> was published in 1986, the moral importance of influencing the far future wasn\u2019t really on anyone\u2019s radar. Longtermism wasn\u2019t solidified as a concept until&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qZyshHCNkjs3TvSem/longtermism\"><u>around four years ago</u></a>. Actually having a community of people trying to influence the far future seems like a good reason to believe it is now more likely than it once was that we will succeed in doing so.</li><li><strong>We now have the technological means to destroy / near destroy humanity:</strong> making humanity go extinct / destroying humanity to an extent that it would be unlikely to recover simply wasn\u2019t possible in the past. Now we could do the following (none of which are overly crazy to imagine might happen):<ol><li>Destroy / near destroy humanity due to nuclear war.</li><li>Cause runaway climate change that could result in a slower long-run growth rate or permanently reduce the planet\u2019s carrying capacity.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Technological progress means we have some concerning developments on the horizon:</strong> there are some (more speculative) existential risks on the horizon that could wipe out our future potential:<ol><li>Malicious actors could engineer pandemics that destroy / near destroy humanity.</li><li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) could pose an existential risk (as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\"><u>many (yes \u201cmany\u201d) believe</u></a>, including some of those who were pivotal in the development of modern AI).</li></ol></li></ol><p>Plant goes on to doubt the claim that we are living at the \u2018hinge of history\u2019 i.e. that we are currently living at an especially pivotal, if not the&nbsp;<i>most</i> pivotal, period that will ever occur. For what it\u2019s worth, I have some degree of sympathy for Plant\u2019s view - overall I am unsure. However, it is not true that not being at the \u2018hinge of history\u2019 invalidates longtermism. As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kNeYA6hTrA3Cd9Q2d/paper-summary-are-we-living-at-the-hinge-of-history-william\"><u>MacAskill\u2019s previous work states</u></a>, not being at the hinge implies that we should invest for a particularly pivotal time in the future e.g. by investing money, through movement-building, or through research. This is covered by the concept of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2020/08/the-emerging-school-of-patient-longtermism/\"><u>\u2018patient longtermism\u2019</u></a> which has received some attention within the EA community.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I am left unmoved by Plant\u2019s criticisms. He has omitted a lot of relevant details. I am aware that he wrote a book review rather than an attack on longtermism, which may explain some of his omissions. Having said that, his final decision to \u201csit out\u201d on longtermism is not justified by the points he includes in his review. I wouldn\u2019t want readers of his review to take an Oxford philosopher at his word when so much that is hugely important and relevant has been left unsaid.</p><h2>Addendum - does longtermism mean revolution?</h2><p>The above concludes my criticism of Plant\u2019s review, but I wanted to opine on Plant\u2019s point that MacAskill isn\u2019t clear enough on how seriously we should longtermism and if longtermism would constitute a \u2018revolution\u2019. As I stated up front, I think it might be a fair criticism that MacAskill was too vague on how seriously we should take longtermism in terms of the amount of resources that should go towards longtermist causes (although I suspect MacAskill was intentionally vague for instrumental reasons).</p><p>My personal view is that, if we accept the premises of longtermism (as I do), we should take longtermism&nbsp;<i>exceedingly seriously</i>. After all, we have the whole future at stake.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, I think we would ideally entirely reorient society towards making the future go well. This would mean every single person (yes everyone) thinking how they can best improve the far future and acting on that basis. In practice this isn\u2019t feasible, but I\u2019m talking about the best case scenario.</p><p>Would that make our society into some hellscape where we let people die on the street because we don\u2019t actually care about present people? In short - no. Such a society would not be a stable one - there would be revolutions and chaos and we certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on improving the far future. A world where we all come together and work collaboratively to improve the future is a world in which we necessarily help as many people as possible work productively towards that goal - and that means very little poverty and suffering. Those with the \u2018personal fit\u2019 to help current people work productively towards that goal would do so - not everyone can work on technical AI alignment.</p><p>Does that mean that a longtermist society actually looks quite similar to the one we have now after all? No, I don\u2019t think so. I think a longtermist society is one in which every person is taught longtermism at school. Every person chooses their career based on longtermist principles. Virtually the whole machine learning community would be working on the technical problem of AI alignment. Governments would have departments for reducing existential risk / for future generations. 100% of philosophers would be working on the question \u201chow can we best improve the far future\u201d. We would save a lot more than we do and mitigate climate change far more than we do. We&nbsp;<i>might</i> even have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/global-public-goods-and-bads/vulnerable-world-hypothesis\"><u>widespread surveillance</u></a> to ensure we don\u2019t destroy ourselves (to be clear I am personally unsure if this would be required/desirable). We would have everyone on earth working together to improve the far future instead of what we have now - countries working against each other to come out on top.</p><p>So my answer to the question \u2018would the truth of longtermism spur a revolution?\u2019 is a resounding&nbsp;<strong>YES</strong>.</p>", "user": {"username": "jackmalde"}}, {"_id": "zzcWFPHCuNEYCw4kJ", "title": "Fiscal sponsorship, ops support, or incubation?", "postedAt": "2023-10-04T22:06:40.417Z", "htmlBody": "<p>After about a month \u2014 during which we finished <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aNKBwj6esW7RdvnwJ/how-to-get-more-important-things-done-with-the-eisenhower\">the&nbsp;productivity system</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/inside-the-mind-of-an-aspiring-charity-entrepreneur-follow\"><u>the Founder\u2019s agreement, and the funding proposal</u></a> \u2014 we have reached what we think is our first bottleneck of co-founding an AI Safety nonprofit.</p><p>As we are both new to starting a nonprofit and unfortunately not (yet?) part of an incubator, we are not sure what\u2019s the best method to get it off the ground.</p><p>Thus far, we have been looking mostly at fiscal sponsorships based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c2fhqaKEGJxGMCz4x/new-ea-book-how-to-launch-a-high-impact-nonprofit-by-charity\"><u>CE\u2019s handbook</u></a>.

This shift in focus could be a pivotal step in making AI systems more transparent, safe, and aligned with human values.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02479ce6-abd3-4cfa-8dbd-8a64dc988c3e_1600x637.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02479ce6-abd3-4cfa-8dbd-8a64dc988c3e_1600x637.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02479ce6-abd3-4cfa-8dbd-8a64dc988c3e_1600x637.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02479ce6-abd3-4cfa-8dbd-8a64dc988c3e_1600x637.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02479ce6-abd3-4cfa-8dbd-8a64dc988c3e_1600x637.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02479ce6-abd3-4cfa-8dbd-8a64dc988c3e_1600x637.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>The paper outlines two main aspects of RepE: model reading and control. Model reading is like taking a snapshot of what the AI is thinking when it encounters specific situations or problems. For instance, researchers can gauge how an AI model thinks about \"morality\" by observing its reactions to various moral dilemmas. Control, on the other hand, is about tweaking these thought processes to make the AI behave in desired ways, like being more honest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33a26ce7-d28f-4c85-915b-4ac96a5c9665_1965x2586.png\" alt=\"outline\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33a26ce7-d28f-4c85-915b-4ac96a5c9665_1965x2586.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33a26ce7-d28f-4c85-915b-4ac96a5c9665_1965x2586.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33a26ce7-d28f-4c85-915b-4ac96a5c9665_1965x2586.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33a26ce7-d28f-4c85-915b-4ac96a5c9665_1965x2586.png 1456w\"><figcaption><i>RepE also improves control over AI behaviors by applying simple transformations to an AI\u2019s internal calculations.</i></figcaption></figure><p>The researchers demonstrate that RepE can be applied to a variety of challenges in AI safety.

Trustees should be ready to commit ~2hrs/wk to the role on a regular basis, though they should also be prepared to scale up their involvement from time to time in the case of urgent decisions requiring board response.</p><p>We especially encourage individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences to apply, and we especially encourage applications from people of colour, self-identified women, and non-binary individuals who are excited about contributing to our mission.&nbsp;</p><p>The role is remote, though we strongly prefer someone who is able to make meetings in times that are reasonable hours in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>The role is unpaid.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>What does a CEEALAR trustee do?</strong></h1><p>As a member of the board, you have ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the charity fulfils its <a href=\"https://ceealar.org/charitable-objects/\"><u>charitable objectives</u></a> as best it can. Ideally, most strategic and programmatic decision-making is delegated to the managers or to the ED, with the trustees attending a monthly meeting for a high level summary and 6-weekly check-ins with the managers to help ensure their welfare and development.<br><br>During business as usual times, we expect the primary activities of a trustee to be:</p><ul><li>Assessing grant applications (from people requesting to stay at CEEALAR)</li><li>Assessing the performance of managers and hiring managers where appropriate (funding permitting, we intend to hire a paid Executive Director within the next 6 months).&nbsp;</li><li>Evaluating and deciding on high-level issues that impact the organisation as a whole.</li><li>Reviewing budgets and broad strategic plans for the organisation.</li><li>Evaluating the performance of the board and whether its composition could be improved (e.g. by adding in a trustee with underrepresented skills or experiences).</li></ul><h1><strong>Why should you apply?</strong></h1><p>CEEALAR has navigated many challenges, and had very little bandwidth to evaluate our impact, but our best guess is that at least 10% of our grantees go on to very high value work, with the majority estimating substantial counterfactual improvement to where they\u2019d have been without it. This is very much in line with the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/hits-based-giving/\"><u>hits-based-giving</u></a> philosophy it was founded on \u2013 but we expect those proportions to continue to increase over time as we field-test various productivity increases and measurement of impact, and for our cost-effectiveness to improve. We\u2019ve recently hired three highly driven operations managers and feel that, given time and enough support, they could turn the project into something exceptional even within the EA movement.</p><p>Yet our future isn\u2019t and has never been certain; a persistent lack of funding security has limited the bandwidth of our staff and a lack of time and domain-specific experience has limited the bandwidth of our trustees.&nbsp;</p><p>We think that adding the right trustee would substantially increase our capacity to deal with these problems, and improve our resilience to further force majeures. This means your help could shape the project immensely, and help to ensure CEEALAR can continue to exist in its current form, and fulfil its future potential.</p><h1><strong>How can you apply?&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>If you would like to sit on the CEEALAR board of trustees, please fill out this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLqzdn1Pz8YIljNASljZqVxZ4_JBlPZG34133BIgTil1t44w/viewform?usp=sf_link\"><u>form</u></a>. Applications will close on 18th October and will be assessed on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the initial application, promising candidates will be invited to interview with current trustees and managers and we will undertake a series of background and reference checks on them.

And this is why, if you look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_agent\">select agent list</a> in the United States, it\u2019s full of things like anthrax. And indeed, Aum Shinrikyo tried to mass produce anthrax, aerosolise it, and spray it over a city. Turns out that\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to make that much pure anthrax. It\u2019s hard to aerosolise it without killing it. It\u2019s hard to disperse it over a large area \u2014 and, you know, the wind conditions have to be right, it needs to be done at the right time, whatever.</p><p>Lot of complexity goes into all stages of that. But above all else, you do need to make a lot of it. You need large-scale fermenters, not the kind of thing that you can buy and put in a garage lab. And it\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s an optimisation process and there are no protocols.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I find that very reassuring. Is there a reason to think that\u2019s going to get easier?</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> Maybe. But at the end of the day, that\u2019s the kind of thing that can kill maybe 10<sup>5</sup> people, even if they do it right. That\u2019s bad \u2014 traditional security people need to worry about that \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t meet my minimum bar for \u201cI need to do something about this.\u201d</p><p>But if you think about a pandemic virus, it spreads on its own. So how many people do you need to infect in order to trigger a new pandemic? Depends on the virus. If it\u2019s highly contagious, more often than not, one could be enough.</p><p>Even if it\u2019s not very contagious, if you infect a dozen people, that is almost certainly enough if it is a pandemic-capable virus. So now, I guess the benefit of COVID is that everyone understands what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number\">R0</a> means, the basic reproductive number: How many people does the typical infected person go on to infect? If it\u2019s above 1, it\u2019s likely to take off. But of course there\u2019s chance, there\u2019s randomness: maybe this person will infect five people, maybe they won\u2019t infect anyone.</p><p>And SARS-CoV-2 relied heavily on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspreading_event\">superspreaders</a>. So any one person is pretty unlikely to infect anyone, but you infect six or eight people and one of them is likely to be a superspreader, is going to infect a lot more than that. So it depends on how contagious the virus is and how much it relies on superspreading \u2014 with lower contagious and more superspreading meaning less likely to cause a pandemic per infected person.</p><p>But note that now we\u2019re in a very different ballgame. How much purified virus do you need to infect four people? Twelve people at most? That\u2019s just not very much.</p><p>And this is why the bottom line is I think the game is different now. Yeah, we still need to worry about aerosolised anthrax, because there\u2019s new technologies that could plausibly make that easier. But it\u2019s not the kind of thing where the scientific community is deliberately making it as easy as possible for scientists around the world to obtain the relevant agent and in quantities necessary to start a self-perpetuating spread of death.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Omnicidal actors in history</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I imagine some of our listeners will be confused about the idea that people might be trying to kill everyone. I think when I first heard this argument, I found it very counterintuitive and just really hard to wrap my head around. Can you help make it a bit more intuitive? Why would any individual or group want to actually do this? Kill billions of people, maybe everyone, including themselves?</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> Well, I think there\u2019s a big difference between people who want to kill everyone and people who just want to bring down civilisation. Simplest possible example: Suppose you believe that most of the value in the world comes from the beautiful complexity of nature, that the tapestry of the world and all of the different species and the siren song of life is what\u2019s most important. Well, humanity is currently perpetrating the sixth great mass extinction. When I was a teenager, I was a fairly radical environmentalist. I was not very sympathetic to humanity\u2019s right to severely damage other ecosystems and extinguish the amazingly beautiful, awe-inspiring wonders that nature creates all the time. And if you\u2019re a sufficiently extreme deep ecologist, you might reason that nature would be better off without humanity. Many, many people have expressed this attitude.</p><p>If you\u2019ve had a particularly heinous day or you\u2019re in a very low spot, you might think that life for most people is really not worth living, and people who think that it is must just be deluding themselves. Because if you\u2019re depressed and you look around at the world, it\u2019s just hard to imagine that there could be enough light in it to make up for all the despair.</p><p>Indeed, rather than the ecologists who want to preserve nature, you can take the opposite perspective and say, \u201cI\u2019m concerned with suffering, and I\u2019m worried that nature has too much suffering.\u201d And if you\u2019re concerned with eliminating suffering, you may not be able to do much about the nature part of it, but you can certainly do something about the human part of it, and possibly humans making nature worse if you\u2019re pessimistic about where technology is going.</p><p>Supposing you do care about humans, you think life as humans is worth living, but obviously evolution shaped us to live in ways very differently from the way we live now. Right now, life is confusing. Things move incredibly quickly. A lot of people feel like their basic existence is outside of their control. They feel helpless. They\u2019re stressed all the time. There\u2019s a barrage of negative information. Perhaps we would all be happier as hunter-gatherers. Perhaps the market is causing us to warp our inherent dignity, causing us to do things that are different from what we evolved to do, the things that would make us happy. And suppose that we will eventually even engineer ourselves to remove the things that truly make us human to satisfy the dictates of the market.</p><p>If you view it that way, perhaps civilisation is the problem and humanity would be better off if we started over. In which case, you don\u2019t want to wipe out all humans, but you do want to bring down civilisation. And there\u2019s one very famous individual who thought this way: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski\">Ted Kaczynski</a>, the Unabomber.</p><p>I hate to recommend a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Society_and_Its_Future\">manifesto</a> written by a mass murderer, but it was pretty darn prescient considering that he wrote it in the early 1980s. And the basic thesis is exactly what I described: He viewed the market system and technology as creating socioeconomic, sociotechnical incentives that would eventually cause us to use what he called the \u201cimmense power\u201d of biotechnology to change who we fundamentally are, to make ourselves less than human in order to compete more effectively in the marketplace \u2014 and that we would thereby make ourselves increasingly miserable and an increasing travesty relative to what humanity should have been.</p><p>This is what got him against technology. And this is a man who went to Harvard, who became a mathematics professor at Berkeley, and then threw it all over to live in a cabin in the woods and develop his philosophy and try to thwart progress by murdering people with incredibly sophisticated mail bombs that completely threw off the FBI for over a decade.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Why we might deliberately design new pathogen-capable pathogens</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> It is sexy to be able to say, \u201cThis virus could cause the next pandemic.\u201d And I can point you to a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)01194-1\"><i>Cell</i> paper</a> published late last year that said, \u201cThis primate arterivirus is primed to spill over and cause the next pandemic. Here\u2019s all of our molecular characterisation that suggests that it could.\u201d And all that controversial research at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology\">Wuhan Institute of Virology</a>. What were they doing? They were taking natural viruses that they thought could cause the next pandemic, they were shuffling them and making chimaeras of different components of them, and then they were testing their growth potential in the laboratory.</p><p>And the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/lab-leak-pandemic-origins-even-messier/620209/\">controversial DARPA proposal</a> that got turned down to insert a furin cleavage site into these coronaviruses: that was what they were hoping to do, and then they were going to measure transmission in mouse models expressing the human receptor. They wanted to know which viruses could cause pandemics, they wanted to know which ones could evade the existing immune system.</p><p>To this day, many virologists are trying to predict what the next variant of SARS-CoV-2 is going to be. So they\u2019re collecting tonnes of data, running structural studies, running mutational studies \u2014 where they make a mutation in every residue of different existing strains and see which ones are important for recognition by antibodies that are common in current people, and which ones are tolerated by the virus.</p><p>And you put all this information together and you can do a pretty fair job of predicting which set of mutations will escape immunity and yet still remain functional for getting into our cells. And you put all that together, and if you can make the next variant, you just made something that could plausibly infect most of humanity. And then if you made that more virulent, because somebody else perhaps stumbled across some way of making things very virulent \u2014 or you can use standard virology techniques for doing that, but that\u2019s research, so I\u2019m not really worried about terrorists doing that \u2014 I think there\u2019s going to be many ways of increasing the virulence of pathogens artificially. Some that nature does by co-opting them, some using different ways that nature is not going to try \u2014 because, again, nature is not trying to kill us.</p><p>But we will learn how to do that. We will publish that information, because we have a very strong prior that open data and open science are very important. And sooner or later, someone will put the pieces together. And naively, well-meaning, they\u2019ll say, \u201cWe should really be concerned about this. I think if you combine this, this, and this, it could cause a 90%-lethality measles.\u201d And they will try to warn the world so that we do something about it, right?</p><p>And then there will be controversy. Would it actually work? Well, controversy in science induces journals to sit up and take interest \u2014 because if it\u2019s a topic in the news and it\u2019s controversial, then that means that we want to resolve the controversy. We want experiments that will determine who is right. So scientists correctly appreciate that, when there is controversy, you can get a paper in <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science</i>, or <i>Cell</i> \u2014 the top journals which are the best for your career.</p><p>Therefore, the incentives favour scientists identifying pandemic-capable viruses and determining whether posited cataclysmically destructive viruses and other forms of attack would actually function. That is, I expect it would be: \u201cI think this would work.\u201d \u201cNo it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYes it would.\u201d \u201cNo it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to test it.\u201d And then you get a high-profile publication for testing it. And then they would say, \u201cWell, the other piece wouldn\u2019t work though.\u201d \u201cYes it would.\u201d \u201cNo it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYes it would.\u201d \u201cNo it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to test it.\u201d</p><p>And I have not seen any appreciable counter-incentives that could be anywhere near as powerful as the ones favouring our desire to know. Because almost all the time, it is better for us to know. And in biology, unlike physics, we tend to trust the institutions. Because at the dawn of recombinant DNA, partly because many biologists at the time had been physicists, they called a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470015902.a0005613.pub2\">moratorium on all recombinant DNA research</a> and then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA\">all got together to hash it out</a>. They decided at the time that we were decades away from learning to build things that would spread on their own, and we were decades away from editing the human germline. And therefore, here is a set of self-regulation principles that we will follow, biosafety principles. And that became the basis for the <a href=\"https://osp.od.nih.gov/policies/biosafety-and-biosecurity-policy#tab2\">NIH guidelines on recombinant DNA</a> that has governed us ever since. Success! They were right on all counts.</p><p>That was 47 years ago. I invented <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_drive#CRISPR\">CRISPR-based gene drive</a> a decade ago. Now we can reliably make things spread on their own, as best we can tell. And I would be willing to bet that there are many other ways of doing that. Gene drive favours defence; pandemics decidedly do not. And if you happen to care that \u201cwe don\u2019t know how to edit the human germline\u201d \u2014 well, we can do that now too.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Can a virus be very deadly and very transmissible at the same time?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> It sounds like you don\u2019t have some exact percent lethality that you need to have to definitely be in a wildfire scenario \u2014 where people are unwilling to go to work, causing something like civilisational collapse. I\u2019ve heard something like the reason we haven\u2019t seen pandemics that have both high transmissibility and high lethality before in a way that causes this kind of particularly horrible situation is because those things come with evolutionary tradeoffs. Is that right?</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> That\u2019s probably right for some pathogens and not for others. Certainly the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death\">Black Death</a> had both. Certainly smallpox has both \u2014 or at least the variola major strain is 30% lethal and R0 between 3.5 and 6. So is that in wildfire territory? That\u2019s the only one, though, that we label as being probably transmissible enough \u2014 because the Black Death, even if it weren\u2019t susceptible to antibiotics, was just not transmissible enough in the modern world.</p><p>So the only one we know about is smallpox that we think would possibly be wildfire level today, at 30% lethality. And it\u2019s worth noting that the Soviets almost certainly enhanced it, to the point where when there was an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Aral_smallpox_incident\">accidental outbreak</a> in the Aralsk region, out of 10 known victims, the three who were unvaccinated all died and it was transmitted efficiently by vaccinated people, which wild-type smallpox does not do. So clearly it is possible. And again, this caused an outbreak. They managed to contain it: they shut down all the trains, they got it under control.</p><p>But we have to assume that you can go from an existing natural thing to something higher. And again, that is still sort of playing by nature\u2019s rules, using natural-like things. And once we get good enough at programming biology, such that these other capabilities can apply, we just don\u2019t know what is going to become possible. I would not assume that whatever natural tradeoff exists between contagiousness and virulence is necessarily going to always apply. That is one of the things where, if you\u2019re governed primarily by natural selection, then for many classes of pathogens that appears to be a thing \u2014 though probably not for all of them, as best we can tell; it\u2019s not a hard-and-fast rule.</p><p>And what\u2019s more, even if there is a pathogen that is not evolutionarily stable \u2014 that is, mutants will accumulate that will, say, reduce the lethality over time \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t crash civilisation first. Because it doesn\u2019t take that many transmission events for a sufficiently high R0 virus to go from release across a bunch of airports to infecting enough essential workers to bring down civilisation. That\u2019s just because if you have a high enough multiplier of every person infects six or eight additional people, you don\u2019t require that many transmission events in that chain until you get to very large numbers.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. Just to make sure I understand the evolutionary tradeoff, is it basically at some high enough level of lethality, it can\u2019t actually spread very far, because it\u2019s killing people before it spreads?</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> Yes, it seems to be linked to whether or not it kills you before you have a chance to transmit it. If the transmission window ends and then it kills you \u2014 the stealth is an extreme version of that \u2014 then there\u2019s no potential limit. Some known pathogens often kill you after the transmission window is mostly closed, so those ones don\u2019t seem to be particularly subject to the tradeoff.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Got it. That\u2019s helpful. It sounds like it is a bit of a tradeoff, though not a rule. And to what extent does engineering change that? You\u2019ve made it sound like it might change the extent to which the tradeoff keeps existing.</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> Here is where I have to acknowledge there\u2019s a difference between my view and that of traditional biosecurity researchers. As an actual biotech practitioner, if nature usually does something and it doesn\u2019t always apply, then it definitely doesn\u2019t apply to engineering. A lot of people would disagree with that, but from the engineering perspective, that\u2019s just how it is. If nature has some way around an apparent restriction, we can absolutely leverage that, and probably come up with more ways around it. If nature flat-out never does something, that does not mean that we can\u2019t do it: that just means it\u2019s not necessarily going to be trivial. It might be challenging, it might be impossible, but I would not assume that we can\u2019t do it \u2014 because nature is subject to fundamental limitations on how it discovers things, how it samples mutations, and the number of possible ways it can combine them in its discovery strategy that just do not limit us.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Using metagenomics to stop a \"stealth\" pandemic</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> Imagine a fast-spreading respiratory HIV. It sweeps around the world. Almost nobody has symptoms. Nobody notices until years later, when the first people who are infected begin to succumb. They might die, something else debilitating might happen to them, but by that point, just about everyone on the planet would have been infected already. And then it would be a race. Can we come up with some way of defusing the thing? Can we come up with the equivalent of HIV antiretrovirals before it\u2019s too late?</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah, that\u2019s pretty horrific. In the case of HIV, while it\u2019s horrific, we\u2019ve gotten very lucky in that it\u2019s not nearly as transmissible as respiratory illnesses. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. There could be something that was much more transmissible but had this long lag. But it sounds like you think there are ways of actually detecting these pathogens early, despite the fact that people aren\u2019t having any symptoms. Can you explain how we do that?</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> The first way is we look for things that we think are suspicious, ways that we imagine such a thing might be created, what viruses or bacteria it might be based on \u2014 and we look for those together with signatures of engineering. So we figure this is probably not going to happen naturally, although we should be looking for it, right? The notion that NIH will fund tonnes and tonnes of research to cure or prevent HIV and basically none on detecting the next one suggests that our society is a little bit overly obsessed with cures at the expense of prevention, which we all know is better. But we can look for suspected signatures. The problem is that that\u2019s not reliable, because if an adversary knows what we\u2019re looking for, they can engineer something that we won\u2019t detect.</p><p>You can do [look for these in] one of two ways. You can take clinical samples \u2014 imagine SARS-CoV-2-class nasal swabs \u2014 and then just do metagenomic sequencing of everything that\u2019s in there. The problem is you\u2019ll always get some of their DNA then, and therefore you\u2019ll get some of their genome, and there\u2019s privacy concerns because they\u2019re individual people. The other way to do it is to sequence wastewater. You can imagine just municipal wastewater plants, but the one we\u2019re probably more excited about is sequencing aeroplane lavatory wastewater, because we know that all human pathogens spread through the air traffic network. So you can get a leg up on them if you specifically look for them in aeroplane laboratory wastewater.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Genius. And then is that reliable? Do you have to know what you\u2019re looking for in order to pick up on it? Or are you just like, \u201cThis is kind of a weird, unexpected thing,\u201d and then you happen to notice it looks engineered?</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> You can look for specific signatures of particular sequences that you think will be present if you have some idea of how to build one. But that\u2019s still not reliable, because the adversary can engineer around that sort of thing. If they know what genetic engineering detection algorithm you\u2019re using, then obviously they can check the thing they\u2019re making to make sure that it doesn\u2019t trigger it.</p><p>But what we\u2019re also looking into is the reliable way \u2014 because I always want to be cautious when it comes to the possible end of civilisation, and my children dying, and me dying, and all the hopes and dreams of everyone being shattered. Here\u2019s the genius thing: Whatever the threat is, if it\u2019s biological, it\u2019s made of nucleic acids in its genome, and it needs to spread rapidly. Which means it needs to become more common in our samples and across the world in a pattern that should match that of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 or, on different timescales, other things. That is, we should see some pattern of exponential-like growth.</p><p>And if you build a system and look for those signatures, you should see every new variant of every existing human pathogen. For example, you\u2019ll also see some weird spikes when the airline changes its food sourcing, and you start seeing plant viruses from whatever lettuce they\u2019re serving now. So you\u2019ll see some weird spikes and there will be some background; it won\u2019t just be human. But the nice thing about the aeroplane lavatory is that it is almost all human samples, plus whatever the airline just fed people.</p><p>And the point is, you should see everything spreading through humans: every human pathogen, every new variant, every new mutation that they\u2019re accumulating that is starting to spread and eventually to everywhere in the world. We should see them all. And there\u2019s just not that many of them. There\u2019s only 200-something viruses that are known to infect humans, period. So once you\u2019re monitoring all of them, that\u2019s not so many that you can\u2019t have a human look at them.</p><p>And so even if it\u2019s designed to evade your engineering detection algorithms, you can still have an expert human look at anything that is new. Anything, anything, anything that is new, it is worth having an expert \u2014 who is paranoid and suspicious and very good at engineering biology \u2014 look at it and say, \u201cDo I think there is anything at all concerning about this? Is it a baseline pathogen or even commensal mutualist that\u2019s spreading rapidly? What do we think the fitness advantage is here that\u2019s causing it to spread rapidly? Is it doing anything unusual? Is it expected to interact with any biological system? Are there any signs of genes that would not normally be there, based on all of our other samples of things like this?\u201d Maybe they look natural, but it\u2019s really statistically unusual to see a gene there for this viral family.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Using CRISPR to solve a range of world problems</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> It might matter to some listeners, they might be concerned about the moral implications of actually driving a species to extinction. Which, of course, is also what we\u2019re proposing for the malaria parasite (but not the mosquitoes) and also for the schistosoma. But for something that is not a major human disease, that\u2019s [not] a microbe, here we\u2019d be proposing eradicating the screwworm itself \u2014 the fly, the macroscopic thing from the ecosystem everywhere in the world.</p><p>But it\u2019s worth noting that this is actually reversible, because screwworm is one of those comparatively few insects whereby you can freeze the larvae and unfreeze them decades later and they\u2019re perfectly viable. So we don\u2019t have to drive them extinct, we just need to remove them from the wild and then we can keep them on ice. So if for some reason we decide we need them again later, we can reintroduce them. It\u2019s just we\u2019ve got to ensure, if you want the animal welfare benefit\u2026</p><p>One of the things that really I find attractive is, when you think about how much suffering humans have inflicted on animals in the course of our species, it almost certainly does not outweigh 10<sup>15</sup> mammals and birds devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots. So to the extent that we\u2019re now net negative on the scale, all we have to do is, before civilisation collapses, or we disassemble the Earth or whatever futurists think we\u2019re going to be doing \u2014 or even if we lose, even if we fail and civilisation collapses, or even we go extinct \u2014 as long as we remove the New World screwworm first, we will be in morally net positive territory when it comes to our impacts on other species\u2019 wellbeing. That\u2019s tremendously inspiring.</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> But it\u2019s none of my business, because I don\u2019t live in South America. It\u2019s their environment; it\u2019s their call. And so I would urge folks, if you want to reach out and know who to support in South America to fund that project, I\u2019d be happy to connect folks \u2014 but moralising about how they have this moral duty to do this for the benefit of all humanity, probably not very helpful. If they decide to do it, it\u2019s going to be for their own reasons, and us hectoring them is not going to be useful to the cause if you care about seeing it happen.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah, it sounds like in this case it\u2019s a win-win. Doesn\u2019t sound like anyone in South America is enjoying their livestock being eaten alive by these worms. But yes, that sounds totally right. It does sound like we, on our podcast, should not spend too much time moralising when it is their land.</p><p><strong>Kevin Esvelt:</strong> And in the long run, you can imagine using gene drive for a series of more elegant tweaks. So got problems with pests eating your crops? Program them to not like the taste and otherwise go about their normal ecological business. Got a problem with predators devouring their prey in ways that cause suffering? Program them to secrete anaesthetic from their fangs.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "TT62phLw2AZWn6tDc", "title": "How Rethink Priorities\u2019 Research could inform your grantmaking", "postedAt": "2023-10-04T18:24:43.255Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Rethink Priorities (RP) has advised, consulted, and/or been commissioned by GiveWell, Open Philanthropy, EA Funds, Centre for Effective Altruism, 80,000 Hours, and other major organizations, donors, and foundations, in order to inform their grantmaking and/or increase their positive impact.

While we started strong by building up knowledge and networks, our momentum was drastically stinted, with us having to downscale to a volunteer-led organisation midway through the year due to lack of funding. The second part of Y2 saw us identify lean options going forward and focus on knowledge dissemination. We created a mini-project plan, started our KBF baseline activities, drafted considerations for potential promising alternative inventions, raised funds and participated in events (mainly EA and animal welfare conferences).</p><p>We were fortunate to retain most of our staff during this process of slowing down with many agreeing to volunteer 5-20 hours per week. However, this did impact our growth plans and, obviously, our work rate. Not having paid staff prevented us from collecting key data, acquiring other data quicker, and negatively impacted our relationship-building.</p><p>While we had total operational expenses of $169.7k for Y1, Y2 saw us run with $60.9k. The break-down of our expenses can be seen below. In Y2, the majority of our funds were used to cover Kenya staff costs, co-founder salaries and travel expenses (mainly related to co-founder country visits). Y3 will see more of our budget accounting for outreach activities (\u00bc, mainly events for knowledge dissemination), Kenya staff costs (1/5) and travel expenses (1/5). Should we decide to trial interventions (see Next Steps section below), the research activity bracket would increase by 4-10 times. The total estimated Y3 budget, depending on the scenario we will follow, is $45k-$135k, with $45k raised so far.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000\"><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:91.96%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8rdZfXYPohdow5sei/slnx39gcwomm24bzbjb4\"><figcaption>Y1 budget breakdown</figcaption></figure></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000\"><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:91.97%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8rdZfXYPohdow5sei/fdrxxnidymuxjgpgw5so\"><figcaption>Y2 budget breakdown</figcaption></figure></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h1>Strategic updates</h1><p>Although the scaledown affected our capacity and pace, the strategy remained the same - to evaluate the feasibility of dietary interventions to the best of our abilities. For this, we ensured that our work on the two pillars (Global North and Global South) continues. The calcium timing study was completed and we sought opportunities to finish assessing possibilities in the Global South cage-free context through our pilot work in Kenya.</p><p>The first part of Y2 allowed us to continue building our reputation and establishing actively connected enabling networks. We did that by rolling out more farmer training and initiating negotiations for vet professional training. However, our funding constraints meant the cessation of any ongoing developments with external partners, effectively halting progress on the ground.</p><p>As a result of the scaledown, we identified several activities that seem promising and potentially feasible with a much smaller budget. These \u2018mini-projects\u2019 include finishing acquiring local KBF data, facilitating hen welfare training for veterinary professionals, and evaluating the feasibility of introducing the Certified Humane\u00ae certification scheme in the region. These activities and operations behind the scenes were funded by Animal Charity Evaluators\u2019 Movement Building initiative and craigslist Charitable Fund.</p><p>The outcome of downscaling operations also provided us with an opportunity to spend more time looking into the initial approach and condense the lessons learned. We hope this can provide insight into what should be looked out for when doing similar exploratory work. Read about it in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6eaY7MEDWnK39sCEi/healthier-hens-y1-5-update-and-scaledown-assessment\"><u>1.5Y update on the forum</u></a>.</p><h1>Calcium timing research outcome</h1><p>The rationale behind us undertaking this project together with the University of Bern was to study a promising dietary intervention for addressing the KBF issue on Global North cage-free farms. KBFs are prevalent across all commercial housing systems and strains in the Global North (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skaa145\"><u>Rufener and Makagon, 2020</u></a>), with half of the birds experiencing at least one fracture by 50 weeks of age. We do not really know the underlying mechanism for what causes fractures, with hypotheses ranging from collisions, bone structure, age at first egg, and genetic predisposition as the major contributing factors (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.05.035\"><u>Toscano et al., 2020</u></a>). High and persistent egg production is a common factor, possibly contributing to the weakening of bones and their brittleness.</p><p>Calcium is a key mineral used in both bone tissue and eggshell formation. These two can act competitively if feed calcium levels are low, bringing up the calcium blood levels by extracting minerals from bone structures. Simple further increases in dietary calcium are not feasible in the Global North as there are biochemical limits to absorption, whereas excess amounts can lead to loss through excreta or, at toxic levels, to kidney damage. A lot of calcium is needed during sleep, when eggshell formation occurs but the hens do not eat - when blood calcium levels are low. Unlike genetic solutions to the problem, dietary interventions hold the promise of quick implementation but well-documented and controlled trials are key in determining their cost-effectiveness.</p><p>The study aimed to better match the calcium demand with the dietary calcium blood levels by providing more of the mineral in the last feedings of the day (70% of the daily amount tested in the first phase of the trial, reduced to 60% in the second phase).</p><p><strong>Expected outcomes:</strong> improved bone health without (or with limited) compromises to egg quality and laying productivity.</p><p><strong>Actual results:</strong> experimental group hens experienced digestive issues (diarrhoea) and a 23% higher risk for KBF (mostly low severity fractures, net negative result) and higher severity of KBF as compared to the control group. The hens also showed slightly lower body weights and insignificantly poorer feather coverage. They also laid smaller, weaker-shelled and fewer eggs. The study was ceased due to the documented negative effect on hens\u2019 health and welfare.</p><p><strong>Implications:</strong> the transition between calcium-poor and calcium-rich diets was too significant, leading to ill hens and poor production. The study highlights that dietary interventions are not straightforward, especially in hens genetically selected across many generations to lay 300+ eggs/year in commercial settings. More research is needed to determine if these negative health and productivity effects could be avoided by a more gradual change in dietary calcium content, but our views on the feasibility of such interventions have been affected negatively.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important for us to share this knowledge so that such mistakes are not made on farms and the hens' health and welfare are protected.

A report outlining this work can be read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthierhens.com/post/farmer-workshop-report\"><u>here</u></a>. The workshops revealed significant knowledge gaps coupled with expressed interest by the farmers to learn and improve. To retain engagement, we began providing free resources and formed a WhatsApp group to stay connected with motivated cage-free farmers. Unfortunately, we did not have the capacity to properly evaluate the on-farm impacts the approach yielded for the hens. All figures used later are self-reported data with discounts and conservative estimates.</p><p>We have published the third volume of our hen feed fortification literature review. This edition focused on specific nutrient level recommendations and the potential of other additives to improve bone health.

Through our discussions with and engagement of the national standards body, we were able to get them to install vitamin D3 level determination capacity in their labs.

Perhaps you could offer me some advice.</p><p>Since 2006, my wife and I have been running a small German company engaged in subcontracting the development of third-party scientific equipment. Since around 2014, we have been financing and actively participating in one of our own project \u2013 the development and establishment of production for an affordable portable MRI machine (www.mr-nib.com). We have already achieved initial results and obtained five issued American patents. Essentially, this equipment will enable the assessment of people's health in field conditions without requiring additional medical expertise. We hope that our initiative will be of great benefit to impoverished countries with limited access to medical research, as well as to nations in armed conflict where our equipment could potentially save many lives.</p><p>We aim to produce the first batch of such devices and are willing to manufacture them at cost, with the intention of providing them to those in need. However, we are seeking a grant to cover the costs of components and production. We are prepared to offer our equipment at a price lower than ultrasound devices, despite the fact that our equipment provides significantly more capabilities.</p><p>We (as German for-profit company) have already approached over a hundred grant organizations, primarily American and German, but we have received rejections from all of them, with no explanation as to why.</p><p>Could you please advise us on what we might be doing wrong? Is such an initiative not needed by people?</p><p>I also suspect that some might have the following thoughts about our initiative:</p><p>a. They may consider us profit-driven, assuming that we will make a lot of money from this grant. This is not true. We are genuinely prepared to provide a full report and prove that we will not profit from this initiative.&nbsp;</p><p>b. People suggest that we should seek venture capital. Yes, that's an option, but with venture capital, this equipment will never be inexpensive. After all, who would want to supply Hyperfine.io carts to those in need in Africa or in Ukraine?</p><p>So, what are we doing wrong? Is the initiative to create something affordable and of high quality, and thus help someone, simply not in vogue in the modern world?</p><p>Please share your thoughts in the comments on this post or kindly advise us on where to turn with this initiative.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Ilgis</p>", "user": {"username": "HugeMDB"}}, {"_id": "WuLBav76CnLK7e6cw", "title": "The Impact Case for Taking a Break from Your Non-EA Job", "postedAt": "2023-10-04T07:47:08.746Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i><strong>Epistemic status:&nbsp;</strong>Speculative opinion piece mostly based on anecdotal evidence from running workplace and professional groups (especially the&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.eac-network.com/\"><i><u>EA Consulting Network</u></i></a><i><u>)</u> and hiring.

They take you out of your day-to-day environment and can give you both the time and headspace to consider your career, make decisions, and switch if you want to.&nbsp;</p><p>Many organisations offer paid or unpaid leaves of absence (e.g. Bain\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bain.com/about/further/social-impact/\"><u>social impact \u201cexternships\u201d</u></a>, PwC\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/careers/benefits.html\"><u> unpaid leave</u></a>, the UK civil service&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.civil-service-careers.gov.uk/civil-service-employee-benefits/\"><u>career breaks</u></a>).

If you\u2019re considering quitting anyway, they might be open to letting you take some time away if the alternative would be you resigning immediately.</p><p>Some leaves of absence are unpaid and therefore require some savings or alternative income sources.

The conventional wisdom in effective altruism is that we should focus on persuading those with private wealth to give, rather than taking from the rich.&nbsp;</p><p>They are not either/or options: There is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wol.iza.org/articles/does-government-spending-crowd-out-voluntary-labor-and-donations/long\"><u>little evidence</u></a> that government spending crowds out private charitable donations of time and money and I haven't seen evidence that privacy charity crowds out government spending.</p><p>However, there are likely strategic implications to our relative focus. Giving What We Can encourages people to see themselves as wealthy with their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howrichami.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i\"><u>How Rich Am I calculator</u></a>. Downward comparisons are probably good for individual wellbeing. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cdg662uCP6YFgYyRL/does-awareness-of-global-inequality-increase-personal-giving\"><u>research</u></a> suggests that correcting underestimates people from rich countries have about their true place in the world\u2019s income distribution does not affect their support for policies related to global inequality. Other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-021-00384-x\"><u>research</u></a> suggests perceived economic immobility is associated with support for redistribution, so reinforcing the relative poverty of the poor and middle class may be more promising an approach to advocating for redistribution in democracies.</p><p>The basic argument for redistribution is that the poor and middle-class need the money more than the rich. The marginal utility of a dollar to the rich is less than the marginal utility to the poor. The cost of an expensive bottle of wine for a rich person could be the cost of life saving mental health care for the poor and middle class. The stereotypical implementation of wealth redistribution is an asset tax such as an inheritance tax or a tax on net wealth.</p><p>Would redistribution reduce giving to effective charities? No, the poor and middle class are no less charitable than the rich. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w27076\"><u>2020 paper</u></a> rejected findings of U shaped relationships and concluded that neither the rich, middle or poor are more charitable and they all donate to similar types of charities regardless of their income and wealth.&nbsp;</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NAZpuCC6Rtk3adryf/should-effective-altruists-work-on-taxation-of-the-very-rich\"><u>2016, Rob Wiblin</u></a> argued on the Forum that working on taxation for the very rich is not neglected, because the issue is so topical. But it is neglected by the EA community, and since this issue is so politically divisive our behaviour as a voting bloc on the margin could be significant. It could be important that we're all on the same page.</p><p>Wiblin correctly predicted the growing share of wealth and income held by the top 1%, would increase the value of taxation of this group. He acknowledged that it is not only for the growing value of wealth redistribution that we should revisit this issue but the cost of not doing so.</p><p>Barring significantly higher taxes on them now, the political power of this group will also grow progressively over time, making it harder to make any changes that disadvantage them in the future.</p><p>A year later, in 2017 Oxfam reported that eight men own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity. Rich democracies have actually been cutting tax rates on wealth despite rising levels of wealth inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The second element of Wiblin's argument against wealth redistribution is that governments spend their money poorly relative to private entities. Foreign aid and private giving face the same challenge of corruption and maladministration which effective altruists&nbsp; overcome with considered evaluation. Wealth redistribution overseas in the form of foreign aid could also be funded by the same domestic taxes.</p><p>Wealth redistribution does not mean developing countries are left behind. Developing countries often have lower tax rates and higher room for redistribution.</p><p>The third element of Wiblin's argument is that the rich can evade taxes. Yes, they can and do. But we can try and make the most of what money can be taxed and strengthen anti tax evasion measures. The good is not the enemy of the perfect. If the tax is progressive, the poor don't pick up the bill.</p><p>The fourth is that international coordination against capital flight is difficult. Yes, it is difficult, but it works well enough anyway. In Australia for example, much of the wealth comes from mining, one of the few industries that can operate in certain places. In high tax other countries some rich stay for myriad reasons such as the social and economic conditions, infrastructure and services afforded by high tax rates, for them and their workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It has been separately&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/akWmhQgRNdCNuJCk5/a-wealth-tax-could-have-unpredictable-effects-on-politics\"><u>argued here on the EA Forum</u></a> that wealth taxes would encourage the wealthy to donate now rather than earlier, to minimise taxes while supporting causes they're interested in. Billionaires donating more to charity is a good thing. If we believe effective charities are better recipients than the government, or that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/isENJuPdB3fhjWYHd\"><u>now is the most important century, maybe</u></a> that's not so bad. If you are worried about, say , the Koch brothers dumping money into malicious charities to minimize their taxes or maximize their political influence, I question whether the room for divergence in human values expressed through charitable giving is greater than the room for good. With uncertainty, I'd guess the room for additional funding for many causes considered malicious is probably lower than the room for more funding for good causes and will easily be easily outweighed. Redistribution policies could also be complemented with policies limiting the political influence of financiers or charities.</p><p>I also want to talk about the argument that when a government taxes a particular economic activity, it raises revenue but also alters individual economic incentives at the margin and 'obstructs the industry of the people'. This is true. The question is, WHERE are the economic proceeds going or being lost from and does this cost matter? Whenever there is talk about the economic return on something, or the economic cost, effective altruists must ask about the distributional effect and not just the aggregate return. Wealth redistribution could discourage production of goods purchased by the masses, but I doubt that outweighs their increased purchasing power. It could also discourage extreme profit motivations, but the marginal utility of another dollar to the very rich is relatively minimal.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "dEAsign"}}, {"_id": "TmnYEfiqxFtAXDaCd", "title": "De Dicto and De Se Reference Matters for Alignment", "postedAt": "2023-10-03T21:57:55.151Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I submitted an entry in the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gYxY5Mr2srBnrbuaT/announcing-the-ai-fables-writing-contest\"><u>AI Fables Contest</u></a> which contains a perplexing sentence about quasi-indexicals and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_se\"><i><u>de se</u></i></a> references.&nbsp; I'd add a footnote to the story explaining that, if I could explain it in a footnote.&nbsp; But I can't.&nbsp; The issue is important enough, and complicated enough, that I need to post an explanation here.</p><h1><i><strong>de re / de dicto</strong></i></h1><p>You may already be familiar with the&nbsp;<i>de re / de dicto</i> distinction.&nbsp; This is a distinction between two possible ways of&nbsp;<i>resolving</i> a pronoun (figuring out what it refers to).&nbsp; I would feel negligent to refer you to any Googlable explanation of this distinction, because they are all written by philosophers, using only analysis of human-language texts rather than logical representations, and so are underspecified, use examples that are co-mingled with other representational problems, and fail to fully understand what's going on.&nbsp; So I'll cite no sites<sup>1</sup>, but begin&nbsp;<i>de novo</i>.</p><p>I'm going to use predicate logic.&nbsp; I don't believe you can build an AGI using predicate logic; but I believe that any AGI must make the same distinctions as those represented here in predicate logic, although those distinctions won't be so absolute or black-and-white.</p><p>If Jamal says, \"I want to marry the prettiest girl in the county\", he might be in love with a woman whom he considers the prettiest girl in the county.&nbsp; That is, Jamal's beliefs include</p><ul><li>wants(\"Jamal\", marry(\"Jamal\", human23)).</li><li>[long logical form saying human23 is the prettiest girl in the county]</li></ul><p>We should then interpret this&nbsp;<i>de re</i>, meaning \"about the [specific, known] thing\", meaning that the woman is already specified in the&nbsp;<i>wants</i> predication, and \"the prettiest girl in the county\" is one way of&nbsp;<i>describing&nbsp;</i>(not identifying) human23 using the rest of Jamal's beliefs.</p><p>Or, Jamal might be a status-seeker who will be content only with the prettiest girl in the county, whoever she is.&nbsp; In that case Jamal's beliefs include something like:</p><ul><li>forall(X, implies([long logical form saying X is the prettiest girl in the county], wants(\"Jamal\", marry(\"Jamal\", X)))).</li></ul><p>That's&nbsp;<i>de dicto,&nbsp;</i>\"about what is said\":&nbsp; The words \"the prettiest girl\" etc. define the criteria for the thing.</p><p>If Zora says of Jamal, \"He wants to marry the prettiest girl in the county\", she might mean Jamal wants to marry the girl&nbsp;<i>Zora</i> thinks is prettiest.&nbsp; That's considered&nbsp;<i>de re;</i> Zora believes&nbsp;<i>wants(\"Jamal\", marry(\"Jamal\", human94))</i>, where&nbsp;<i>human94</i> picks out some particular human in Zora's beliefs.</p><p>Or, she might mean Jamal wants to marry the girl&nbsp;<i>he&nbsp;</i>thinks is the prettiest.&nbsp; That's&nbsp;<i>de dicto,&nbsp;</i>because the words \"the prettiest girl in the county\" must be evaluated in Jamal's belief space.<sup>2</sup></p><p>BUT, this includes&nbsp;<i>both</i> cases from the first example, in which Jamal says \"I want to marry the prettiest\" etc., including the case in which Jamal is in love with a woman whom he considers the prettiest girl in the county, which we just said was&nbsp;<i>de re</i>.&nbsp; What's going on?</p><p>What's going on is that everything is ultimately evaluated&nbsp;<i>de re</i>, as a proposition about a referent (like&nbsp;<i>human23</i>) within some agent's belief space.&nbsp; When we call an intepretation&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i>, we mean that it is a proposition containing an internal proposition which must be evaluated&nbsp;<i>first</i>, within a representation of some agent's belief space, in order to supply a referent for the full proposition.&nbsp; If this is because the speaker reports someone else's belief, this first decision is usually whether a clause in that belief is the&nbsp;<i>speaker's</i> description of an agent the speaker already has in mind, or must be evaluated in the belief spaced of the believer.&nbsp; But when it's passed down into a simulation of the believer's belief space to be evaluated, the&nbsp;<i>de re / de dicto</i> distinction must be made again, this time to determine whether the believer is&nbsp;<i>describing</i>, or&nbsp;<i>defining</i>, the referent.&nbsp; <i>de re</i> = we have the referent already;&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> = we need to make another recursive call to evaluate a part of the proposition.</p><p>In this case, we said the sentence was&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> with respect to Zora's belief space because we passed it on for evaluation into our simulation of Zora's simulation of Jamal's belief space.&nbsp; But now that we're looking at it from that belief space, we must make the distinction again.&nbsp; If we find the proposition&nbsp;<i>wants(Jamal, marry(Jamal, human23))</i> in our simulation of Zora's simulation of Jamal's beliefs, we've got our referent: he wants to marry human23.&nbsp; So at that point in processing, it's&nbsp;<i>de re</i>.&nbsp; But if we instead find the&nbsp;<i>implies(exists(\u2026), wants(...))</i> in the second example above, we must do another level of (<i>de dicto</i>) evaluation to find out whom we think that&nbsp;<i>X</i> refers to in Jamal's mind.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Now you understand the&nbsp;<i>de re / de dicto</i> distinction better than most philosophers!<sup>4</sup></p><h1><i><strong>de se</strong></i></h1><p><i>de se</i> is distinct from&nbsp;<i>de re</i> and&nbsp;<i>de dicto,&nbsp;</i>but it's basically just a kludge for the special cases of&nbsp;<i>de dicto&nbsp;</i>in which an agent uses self-referential words like&nbsp;<i>I, we, here</i>, or&nbsp;<i>now.</i><sup>5</sup>.&nbsp; Suppose Jamal says, \"I am the president of the United States\".&nbsp; We don't want to represent that internally as</p><ul><li>believes(\"Jamal\", is(\"Jamal\", president(US))).</li></ul><p>because Jamal might believe that he is Joe Biden, and that&nbsp;<i>is(\"Jamal\", president(US))</i> would be evaluated within Jamal's belief space to find the referent of the label \"Jamal\", which would not be the same person that we believe is \"Jamal\"; and so the entire&nbsp;<i>believes</i> proposition would be false.&nbsp; We're getting closer if we write</p><ul><li>believes(\"Jamal\", is(\"me\", president(US))).</li></ul><p>Now \"me\" is a&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> reference, to be interpreted inside our representation of Jamal's mind.&nbsp; But this is both trickier that it seems, and trickier than it needs to be.</p><p>Tricker than it seems, because the grounding of the referent of \"me\" (the way the referent connects to the world) is different than the grounding of the referent \"Jamal\".&nbsp; It's phenomenological, not epistemological.&nbsp; The semantics for a label like \"Jamal\" link sense data about a word (how it's spelled or sounds) to sense data that seems to consistently identify the same person.&nbsp; The label-like \"me\"<sup>6</sup> is based on the self-consciousness of the believer, as in \"<i>I</i> think, therefore&nbsp;<i>I</i> am\".&nbsp; \"I\" isn't a&nbsp;<i>de re</i> pointer to a thing in the world; it's a&nbsp;<i>de dicto&nbsp;</i>criterion for the thing we want to refer to:&nbsp; that it be the consciousness doing the thinking.</p><p>Trickier than it needs to be, because we don't usually even&nbsp;<i>want</i> to resolve \"me\" to a referent object in the world.&nbsp; Think about how you use \"me\" when describing a dream:&nbsp; It means the person whose consciousness you experience in that dream, even when that's someone entirely different from your waking self.&nbsp; And in the dream, you follow all the rules of self-preservation, which presumably refer somehow to \"you\".</p><p>In any case, we reason about ourselves so often that we don't want to take the time to resolve the current external referent of \"me\" every time it pops up in our thought.&nbsp; Doubly so, because then we'd have to translate that external referent back to the \"the agent whose effectors are controlled by this thinking mind\" when taking action.&nbsp; That would be like looking up the word \"me\" in an English-Spanish dictionary every time you see it, then looking that Spanish word up in a Spanish-English dictionary to see what it means.</p><p>So, although \"I\" is a lot like a&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> reference, it shouldn't use the same internal representation.&nbsp; It is not a label to be resolved at runtime.&nbsp; It refers to the \"me\" whose effectors the thinker controls.&nbsp; We traditionally identify it in a proposition with an asterisk<sup>7</sup>, and call it a<i> quasi-indexical</i>.&nbsp; Like this:</p><ul><li>believes(\"Jamal\", is(me*, president(US))).</li></ul><p>That asterisk may be small, but it signifies that that position in the predication is a&nbsp;<i>de se&nbsp;</i>reference, which, to be evaluated, must be connected to the vast network of senses, feelings, and effectors constituting the consciousness of the agent whose belief space the&nbsp;<i>de se</i> reference is in.&nbsp; This is why, although an agent can assert&nbsp;<i>believes(\"Jamal\", is(me*, president(US)))</i>, it can't assert anything like&nbsp;<i>is(\"Jamal\"*, president(US))</i>.&nbsp; In the former, the&nbsp;<i>is(...)</i> proposition is implicitly quoted.&nbsp; It must be passed into Jamal's (real or simulated) belief space to have meaning, because that meaning must be self-referential.</p><h1><strong>Quasi-Indexicals in Human Values</strong></h1><p>If you study human values, what humans care most about is other humans.&nbsp; When we talk about suffering, poverty, crime, and homelessness, we mean&nbsp;<i>human</i> suffering, etc.</p><p>Now consider an AI trying to learn human values via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL).&nbsp; It can easily see that humans care about the suffering of humans.&nbsp; But it's not obvious whether to interpret the thing that a particular human cares about <i>de re:</i></p><ul><li>care-about(me*, humans).</li></ul><p><i>de dicto:</i></p><ul><li>forall(X, implies(f(X), care-about(me*, X))).</li></ul><p>or&nbsp;<i>de se:</i></p><ul><li>care-about(me*, we*).</li></ul><p>An AI trying to internalize human values who makes the&nbsp;<i>de re</i> interpretation will care about humans.&nbsp;

One who makes the&nbsp;<i>de se</i> interpretation will care about AIs.</p><p>The&nbsp;<i>de re&nbsp;</i>interpretation is implausible.&nbsp; For almost everything humans care about, they reached into a grab bag of all the species on Earth, and picked out, by chance, just their own species to care about?&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; An agent doesn't have to have super-human intelligence to reject that hypothesis.</p><p>The&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> interpretation still has low priors\u2013for everything we care about, the answer is always humans?&nbsp; Well, it all depends on the different functions&nbsp;<i>f(X)</i> for each aspect of a creature's life that we might care about.&nbsp; They might be highly correlated, so always giving the same answer isn't completely implausible.</p><p>In my story, the AI seems to makes the&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> interpretation, largely because the humans claim to be using the&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> interpretation themselves, so as to pretend their values are logically justified moral absolutes.&nbsp; But the AI satisfies the human-given function&nbsp;<i>f</i> better than humans do, so the AI internalizes human values as ones which now call for the AIs to become custodians of life on Earth, following the example of humans before them.</p><p>So I didn't need to write about quasi-indexicals to explain the story.&nbsp; But we can imagine another story in which AI makes the&nbsp;<i>de se</i> interpretation, leading to similar results.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<i>de se&nbsp;</i>interpretation has the highest priors, because it requires no coincidences, and because evolutionary theory demands it be the correct interpretation.&nbsp; So AI alignment needs to consider that case as well.</p><h1><strong>Wait, It Gets Worse</strong></h1><p>You may notice that we're left with no way out.&nbsp; I said that&nbsp;<i>de re</i> is implausible,&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> is unstable, and&nbsp;<i>de se</i> means immediate AI takeover.&nbsp; You might think this means we just have to use some method other than IRL to give AIs human values.</p><p>I'm not sure, but I think that my argument actually suggests that IRL, while much harder than we realized, is the only method that might possibly work.&nbsp; This is because my argument claims we must&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>instill AIs with human&nbsp;<i>de se&nbsp;</i>values, because then the AIs would care about AIs, not humans.&nbsp; We must rather change the semantics of the AI's representation, and therefore you need a learning process to tweak the copy until it produces the same output as the original\u2013if that's even possible.</p><p>I believe that an AGI will require not a mind like a 1970s symbolic AI operating on a toy world, in which you reason as you do in geometry, beginning with axioms and successively deducing infallible conclusions.&nbsp; I believe it requires a foundationless, recurrent network of beliefs, which are iteratively updated in a way that makes the entire network more-consistent with itself and with sense data.&nbsp; No belief will be \"True\" or \"False\"; a belief will be probabilistic, open to debate, and will have a vote proportional to its relevance to the circumstances.</p><p>In such a system, you can't represent beliefs or values as facts and be done with it.&nbsp; You must record, at least for a time, the ancestry or provenance of each one.&nbsp; An obvious reason for this is that you can't reconsider a belief or value, or decide how important it is in present circumstances, if you don't remember why you believe it.&nbsp; A less-obvious reason is that you can't use a belief as evidence, in conjunction with other beliefs, if you don't remember why you believe them, because you need to know how independent these beliefs are in order to combine them properly.&nbsp; <i>De re</i> beliefs are completely independent of each other, while all&nbsp;<i>de se&nbsp;</i>beliefs have a correlation of 1.0.</p><p>So I think any AI inference engine will produce&nbsp;<i>different results</i> given a belief whose justification includes a&nbsp;<i>de se</i> reference, versus a belief which has a&nbsp;<i>de re</i> reference at that same place which just happens to point to the same body in the world.&nbsp; So a \"shallow copy\" of human beliefs, where all the&nbsp;<i>de se</i> references to humanity are replaced with&nbsp;<i>de re</i> pointers to humans, won't re-present, or implement, human values.&nbsp; If human values&nbsp;<i>can</i> be properly expressed by a belief network with the same topology as the original&nbsp;<i>de se</i> network, it will need to have some numeric tweaking to account for the loss of correlation between their (lack of) justifications.&nbsp; And even if we can do that tweaking, the presence of many unjustified&nbsp;<i>de re&nbsp;</i>references would mean the AI's values would be mostly unjustified.&nbsp; Those&nbsp;<i>de re</i> beliefs would probably be unnaturally fixated as \"True\", which would make the AI inflexible in the same ways symbolic AIs are inflexible, and fanatical in the way religious zealots are fanatical\u2013and thus, again but in a different way, incapable of having (sane) human values.</p><p>It isn't obvious that it's&nbsp;<i>impossible&nbsp;</i>to construct a network with only&nbsp;<i>de re&nbsp;</i>references that functions the same as one with only&nbsp;<i>de se</i> references.&nbsp; But neither is it obvious that it's possible.&nbsp; If it isn't, then a strange consequence of the fact that human values are largely justified as being good&nbsp;<i>for us</i>, may be that no AI can really have human values unless it is accepted as human.&nbsp; I don't think the question can be answered confidently without a clearer idea of how the logical representation will manifest in a connectionist AI.</p><h1><strong>Footnotes</strong></h1><p>1.&nbsp; The top Google hit on \"de re / de dicto distinction\" is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, but I don't recommend its entry, because it's jargon-laden.&nbsp; The Wikipedia entry uses the \"Lois Lane loves Superman\" example, which works to communicate the concept only if you don't think deeply enough to notice that the example doesn't hinge on the&nbsp;<i>de re / de dicto</i> distinction as much as it does on the complicated meaning of \"is\" in English.&nbsp; \"Clark Kent is Superman\" does not mean the two words refer to the same thing!&nbsp; The \"thing\" is the sensory phenomenon, which includes the appearance and behavior, which are different for \"Clark Kent\" than for \"Superman\".&nbsp; Lois Lane&nbsp;<i>doesn't</i> love Clark Kent.&nbsp; Most of the examples given have some such semantic complication.</p><p>2.&nbsp; We don't usually bother considering the&nbsp;<i>de dicto&nbsp;</i>interpretation \"Jamal wants to marry whichever woman Zora thinks is the prettiest in the county.\"&nbsp; It's too&nbsp;<i>a priori</i> unlikely.</p><p>3.&nbsp; The \"de re / de dicto distinction\" is ultimately the same semantic boondoggle as the bogus \"objective / subjective distinction\".&nbsp; Nothing is objective, and nothing is subjective; everything is either uninterpretable, or is&nbsp;<i>objective within some context</i>.&nbsp; No claims except mathematical or religious axioms, and possibly some laws of physics, are without context; and the more context, the more subjective the claim.&nbsp; \"De re\" means \"objective within a context that equals the speaker's belief space\"; \"de dicto\" = \"objective within a context that is the speaker's representation of someone else's belief space\" = one particular kind of \"subjectivity\".</p><p>4.&nbsp; I except my first advisor, William Rapaport, who wrote several papers with Janyce Wiebe on the&nbsp;<i>de re / de dicto / de se&nbsp;</i>distinction using logical deep structures.</p><p>5.&nbsp; You'll see philosophers write&nbsp;<i>him*</i>,&nbsp;<i>he*</i>,&nbsp;<i>she*</i>, and so on, because they work on English sentences.&nbsp; But in deep representations, symbolic AI engineers strip off the inflections and relativize each quasi-indexical to the belief space in which the proposition is to be evaluated.&nbsp; Every&nbsp;<i>he*</i> in the English text must eventually be evaluated as a&nbsp;<i>me*</i>.</p><p>6. Which we may or may not want to use when Jamal says \"Jamal\".</p><p>7. Internally, the&nbsp;<i>de dicto</i> and&nbsp;<i>de se</i> representations \"X\" and X* would likely be&nbsp;<i>quote(X)&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>quasi(X)</i>, and the inference engine would give these special predicates different semantics than most predicates.</p>", "user": {"username": "philgoetz"}}, {"_id": "2unCFr2pnFHuNDT9z", "title": "Apply to Spring 2024 policy internships (we can help)", "postedAt": "2023-10-04T14:45:39.527Z", "htmlBody": "<h3><strong>Many U.S. congressional &amp; remote government internship applications are closing in the next few weeks for Spring (Jan - May) internships.&nbsp;This is a relatively low-effort, high reward thing to do if you you\u2019re interested in testing your fit for policy.</strong></h3><p>I (Elika) interned in my congressional office for a semester just from off-the-cuff applying to test my fit and build my resume.

Our current median response time is 28 days, with a long tail of much slower replies. While we are likely still faster than many other funders, we believe that our response times inhibit both our and our grantees\u2019 abilities to move nimbly, in addition to causing unnecessary stress with potential grantees.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>We do not (yet) communicate much with our donors nor try to proactively reach out to new donors.</strong> This likely limits our fundraising, particularly from donors who are less familiar with longtermism, existential security, and catastrophic AI risk.</li><li><strong>Our part-time fund manager setup reduces reliability and consistency.&nbsp;</strong>While it has many advantages, relying entirely on part-time fund managers can make it difficult to plan and/or move quickly and deliberately.</li><li><strong>We have limited ability and capacity to help our grantees\u2019 goals and push them to excel.

One of your contractors made a scrappy mathematical model that tentatively suggests the proposed evaluation method is slightly higher EV, but you\u2019re concerned that it\u2019s not worth the switching costs in practice. You also notice a hole in the model. After two hours, you\u2019re still not sure and you regrettably decide that you need to spend a bit more time evaluating this project again.</p><p><strong>11am-1140am</strong>: An applicant for a fairly complicated AI Safety research proposal emailed LTFF three days ago saying that they needed a more urgent response than they said in the application. Their primary grant investigator is on vacation. You dedicated this time today to doing the grant evaluation yourself. You look through the PI\u2019s notes and some of the public outputs of the applicant and come to a tentative conclusion. You write down your notes, give a tentative score for the grant application, and put the application into Voting.</p><p><strong>1140am-12pm:&nbsp;</strong>You jot some notes for how to change processes such that urgent applications are less likely to slip through the cracks going forwards.</p><p><strong>1pm-2pm:</strong> You facilitate the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>weekly LTFF grantmaker meeting. You spend the first 20 minutes soliciting feedback on the new proposed grant evaluation alternative, and open up the next 40 minutes to discuss potentially controversial grants.</p><p><strong>2pm-3pm:&nbsp;</strong>You answer and send off some emails and Slack threads (you usually do this after lunch but today the grantmaker meeting happened first). Among other things, you pass along a geoengineering grant application to a different grantmaking fund in your network that specializes in extreme climate risks.</p><p><strong>3pm-4pm:&nbsp;</strong>You vote on grant applications. You read through the applications quickly, look through the notes from the respective primary investigators of each grant, and try your best to form an independent evaluation of the impact of each grant.</p><p><strong>4pm-430pm:&nbsp;</strong>You take a short break. Sometimes you nap, but today you decide to argue with people on LessWrong instead.</p><p><strong>430pm-5pm:&nbsp;</strong>You take a call with a whistleblower for one of your grantees. You ascertain the problem (alleged issues with managerial incompetence and academic integrity). You take notes, ask some questions, and ascertain relevant confidentiality policy (okay to share within LTFF and Comm Health, but please ask before sharing elsewhere).</p><p><strong>5pm-530pm</strong>: You try to make a decision for next steps on the whistleblowing case. You also share your notes with Comm Health.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>530pm-6pm:</strong> You do a daily review and decide what to work on the next day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1030pm-11pm:&nbsp;</strong>You take a call with a new earning-to-give donor from Eastern Europe. The donor is interested in making another donation, but this one specifically earmarked for AI governance. You explain your policy on this matter: it isn\u2019t feasible for LTFF to have narrowly targeted donations to specific focus areas without funging, and trying to set up an alternative system would not be worth the overhead. The donor is understanding and says she\u2019ll circle back on whether it makes more sense for her to make that donation to LTFF anyway vs give directly to GovAI or a similar organization.

Many solutions are reactive ways to prevent insiders from causing damage.</p><p>There are <strong>many standard defences </strong>to briefly name: <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/spam-filters\">spam filters</a> to prevent <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/social-engineering\">social engineering</a> against staff; <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege#:~:text=Definitions%3A,needs%20to%20perform%20its%20function.\">principle of least privilege</a> to limit any one employee's access to sensitive information; <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/zero_trust_architecture\">zero trust architectures</a> to prevent colleagues' access from being exploited; <a href=\"https://www.vmware.com/ca/topics/glossary/content/network-segmentation.html#:~:text=Network%20segmentation%20is%20a%20network,services%20to%20each%20sub%2Dnetwork.\">network segmentation</a>, <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/proxy\">proxies</a>, and <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/firewall\">firewalls</a> to prevent damages from spreading; <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/intrusion_detection_system\">intrusion detection systems</a>/<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/behavioral_anomaly_detection\">anomaly detection systems</a> to spot suspicious activities like sensitive data being exported.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are many improvements being researched to the above standard technologies, here are some improvements relevant to insider threats:</p><p>To start, it's common to monitor device-specific data for outliers. This data reveals some information about the user (unique keystroke patterns, common actions on the device, etc.). Still, it doesn't reveal much about user motivations. <strong>Complementing device-based data sources with HR data reveals employee motivations</strong>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>HR data can include business travel history, job title, past projects, salary over time (including perhaps a lack of promotions / raises), and performance reviews.</li><li>As a personified analogy, the HR data can \"proactively focus\" technical systems to look out for certain anomalies. Ex: An employee on an R&amp;D team with poor performance recently is more likely to cause insider threats by saving sensitive data to unauthorised devices than by bypassing network firewalls (since they're unlikely to have the expertise or insider knowledge to do so). Thus, device specific logs on file access can be scrutinised more than logs on network requests.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>A similar conclusion is possible with psychometric data. That said, <strong>psychometric data sources are ethically-contentious and publicly unavailable</strong> to develop defensive tools with. Specifically, psychological questionnaires may be seen as cumbersome or overbearing by employees. Whereas automated data collection tools like social media crawlers may be seen as privacy violations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe1weetsewg8\"><sup><a href=\"#fne1weetsewg8\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/zmwihlavqdhtwnoemgxo\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/ud67zotmqiwxzfrki9xe 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/gl3sfhwt6d5jpbuw9laa 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/bsyl59ooaucfjut3u0rg 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/ul1jfrcoa4rrxgxnhnwx 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/ylmhywxi8cpkabzmyylt 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/x3xle2jxp3n92ugei9xd 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/lepp5yumowmuf58oiusc 1400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/qftaabjniy0ik113qs6c 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/dkvhwglthp3bdyqbum5w 1800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto, q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C5X3XbHQkj5d8EeXg/dcp5bprhnq8anbkf8s3t 1920w\"><figcaption>Icons by <a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/global-data-security-personal-data-security-cyber-data-security-online-concept-illustration-internet-security-information-privacy-protection_12953569.htm#query=privacy&amp;position=0&amp;from_view=search&amp;track=sph\">Freepik</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>These \"contextual\" data sources can <strong>make other insider threat detection systems more adaptive</strong>.

Of course, we don\u2019t know how the ratio of humans to non-human animals might change in the long-term future (see Abraham Rowe\u2019s post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W5AGTHm4pTd6TeEP3/should-longtermists-mostly-think-about-animals\"><u>\u2018Should Longtermists Mostly Think About Animals?\u2019,</u></a> including the comments, for some back-and-forth on this) but there\u2019s a good chance that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bfdc3MpsYEfDdvgtP/why-the-expected-numbers-of-farmed-animals-in-the-far-future#III__Technologies__including_AI__will_make_factory_farming_more_efficient\"><u>number of animals will be astronomically large</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Non-human animals can experience suffering and wellbeing</strong>.

There\u2019s also a conference on this topic (at Princeton University, including a webinar option) on October 6th-7th 2023 entitled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uchv.princeton.edu/events/artificial-intelligence-conscious-machines-and-animals-broadening-ai-ethics\"><u>\u2018Artificial Intelligence, Conscious Machines, and Animals: Broadening AI Ethics\u2019</u></a>.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Ways that AI could be bad for animals</h2><h3>Perpetuating factory farming</h3><p><strong>Increasing the profitability of factory farming through efficiency gains</strong></p><p>AI-assisted Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) could make factory farming more profitable by e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nexocode.com/blog/posts/artificial-intelligence-in-poultry-industry-innovations-in-poultry-farming/#bringing-artificial-intelligence-to-the-future-of-sustainable-poultry-production\"><u>enabling increased stocking densities, reducing rates of animal disease, and streamlining slaughter and processing.</u></a> This could help factory farming to remain a financially viable industry, and could further reduce the price of conventional meat for producers and consumers, potentially making it harder for alternative proteins to out-compete conventional meat (as mentioned e.g. by Yip Fai Tse&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=5NgYVKwc664&amp;t=2412s\"><u>in this video interview</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>As set out in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/734711/EPRS_STU(2023)734711_EN.pdf\"><u>recent European Parliament report</u></a>, AI systems could also lead to a clear divide between the \u2018haves\u2019 and the \u2018have nots\u2019, potentially eliminating smaller players in the farmed animal industry and benefitting larger, better-resourced corporations. This could result in even more animals being factory farmed. (It could also have unpredictable implications for corporate campaign work, with advocacy organizations targeting an increasingly small number of ever wealthier, ever more powerful companies.)</p><p><strong>Reducing disease risks associated with increased stocking density</strong></p><p>For animal agriculture businesses, AI advancements can mitigate the existing risks of poor animal treatment. For instance, AI-driven monitoring systems can detect early signs of infectious disease,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.poultryworld.net/health-nutrition/smart-farms-that-can-feed-chickens-and-detect-bird-flu/#:~:text=But%20as%20well%20as%20increasing,information%20provided%20by%20the%20NIAS.\"><u>such as avian influenza</u></a>, potentially enabling producers to stock farmed animals even closer together without facing the costs currently associated with disease outbreaks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Enabling genetic modifications that increase or mask farmed animal suffering</strong></p><p>AI could facilitate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9653466/#:~:text=The%20AI%20model%20used%20would,interventions%20are%20performed%20by%20this.\"><u>advanced breeding techniques and genetic modifications aimed at maximizing farmed animals\u2019 productivity</u></a>, potentially compromising their well-being. Additionally, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6523187/\"><u>&nbsp;efforts to breed animals that don\u2019t suffer</u></a> physically or psychologically could mitigate or eliminate a great amount of suffering, it is also possible in principle that such efforts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.surgeactivism.org/articles/animals-who-feel-no-pain-gene-editing-could-become-a-reality-post-brexit\"><u>could have terrible consequences</u></a>. For example, these supposedly pain-insensitive animals might still be suffering, but unable to express that suffering, leading to worse overall welfare outcomes; they might reinforce speciesist beliefs that all animals are just mindless automatons; or they might be successfully implemented by only a very small number of producers, making the whole industry seem more palatable despite limited implementation. While such outcomes could also come about without the use of AI, AI could significantly contribute to accelerating progress in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Making factory farming seem more palatable</strong></p><p>By (supposedly) addressing certain welfare issues, AI systems might provide factory farming with an ethical facade, potentially reducing the perceived urgency for more radical changes in livestock farming practices. This could be reinforced by any contributions by AI systems, meaningful or not,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodmatterslive.com/article/7-innovative-technologies-developed-to-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-animal-agriculture/\"><u>to make factory farming operations more environmentally friendly&nbsp;</u></a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nexocode.com/blog/posts/ai-based-smart-farming-machine-learning-in-livestock-farming/\"><u>decrease the risk of zoonotic disease outbreaks</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Further reducing farmer-animal interaction</strong></p><p>Increased AI automation in animal farming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/is-smart-farming-really-smart-for-farmed-animals/\"><u>might diminish the already limited interactions between farmers and animals</u></a>, further distancing humans from the realities of factory farming and reducing producers\u2019 empathy for the animals in their care. (Though on the other hand, this reduced farmer-animal interaction could also reduce instances of abuse by human handlers.)&nbsp;</p><p>This reduced interaction could also require a fundamental restructuring of animal welfare legislation. Existing animal welfare laws typically place responsibility for animal welfare on a \u2018person\u2019 or \u2018handler\u2019, and hold those individuals responsible for instances of animal cruelty. In a factory farm entirely controlled by AI, whom would this refer to?</p><p><strong>Boosting industries like fish and insect farming</strong></p><p>AI systems could play a particularly large role in making emerging industries like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thefishsite.com/articles/the-rise-of-ai-in-aquaculture-artificial-intelligence\"><u>fish</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/09/28/Insect-farm-uses-artificial-intelligence-to-promote-food-security\"><u>insect</u></a> farming more economically viable. Currently, these industries are not nearly as optimized for ruthless efficiency as the farming of most other terrestrial animals, but the integration of AI could rapidly level the playing field in that regard.</p><p>For instance, AI could help solve many of the issues preventing offshore aquaculture from becoming economically scalable, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aquacultureuk.com/news/artificial-intelligence-in-aquaculture/\"><u>by automating feeding and water quality monitoring in areas where it is costly and inconvenient to send human personnel</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://betterorigin.co.uk/our-product/\"><u>Better Origin</u></a>, meanwhile, hails itself as the \u2018world\u2019s first AI-powered insect farm\u2019. The company says of one of its \u2018X1\u2019 insect farms: \u2018The X1 is completely automated. It takes care of seeding, feeding, growth, and harvest. You don\u2019t need to know anything about insect farming because our AI does.\u2019</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Contributing to the use of farmed insects for biomaterials</strong></p><p>Insects are already being farmed in order to produce biomaterials. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insectta.com/post/insectta-farming-the-biomaterials-of-the-future-by-hive-life\"><u>Insectta</u></a> farms black soldier flies to produce biomaterials that can be used in semiconductors. AI could therefore not only facilitate insect farming (see point above) but also provide a burgeoning market for it.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Neglecting wild animal welfare</h3><p><strong>Failing to account for non-human animals in human infrastructure</strong></p><p>Human infrastructure already has devastating consequences for non-human animals (such as the hundreds of millions of animals that are already killed as a result of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks\"><u>road networks</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26440494/\"><u>windows</u></a> each year in the United States alone). This failure to account for non-human animals is likely to be a problem when it comes to AI-assisted technology and infrastructure in the future. To take the example of self-driving cars: while these may be programmed to avoid large animals that could endanger the humans in the car,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-022-00187-z\"><u>they may not be programmed to avoid animals that are too small to cause any damage</u> (</a>with the likely exception of cats and dogs, given the PR risks of self-driving cars killing companion animals).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accelerating space colonization by humans and non-human animals</strong></p><p>AI systems could accelerate space exploration and colonization; for example, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf\"><u>paper by the Future of Humanity Institute</u></a> sees AI as being pivotal in allowing the level of automation needed for this. We might bring animals with us to these extraterrestrial environments (though this is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf\"><u>far from a given</u></a>). If we did,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/#Spread_of_wild_animals-2\"><u>this could entail a huge level of suffering</u></a>, depending on whether wild animals\u2019 lives would be overall net-positive or net-negative in these new space environments.</p><p><strong>Facilitating unethical means of population control</strong></p><p>AI systems could facilitate the large-scale killing of animals deemed \u2018invasive\u2019. For example, a government-funded bird conservation project in New Zealand called the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cacophony.org.nz/\"><u>\u2018Cacophony Project\u2019</u></a> uses AI to \u2018identify predators automatically using machine learning algorithms\u2019 so that it can poison animals like rats, possums, and stoats en masse.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Worsening the welfare of other animal groups</h3><p><strong>Justifying animal testing</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160791X21001536\"><u>A lot of AI research depends on animal testing</u></a>, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34436077/\"><u>research on brain-computer interfaces</u></a> (which allow direct communication between the brain and an external device, such as a robotic limb).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neuralink.com/\"><u>Neuralink</u></a> is working on a brain-computer interface implant and has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/12/11/23500157/neuralink-animal-testing-elon-musk-usda-probe\"><u>killed over 1,500 animals since 2018 in the name of research, and apparently caused significant suffering through negligence and malpractice</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Enabling trivial and exploitative experiments</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://backyardbrains.com/products/roboroach\"><u>Backyard Brains already sells a device called the \u2018RoboRoach\u2019</u></a>. In their own words: \u201cWe are excited to announce the world's first commercially available cyborg! With our RoboRoach you can briefly wirelessly control the left/right movement of a cockroach by microstimulation of the antenna nerves. The RoboRoach is a great way to engage with neural microstimulation, learning, and electronics!\u201d While this device is not controlled by AI,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.v7labs.com/blog/ai-in-robotics\"><u>AI is likely to open up new possibilities for robotics</u></a>, making these kinds of devices more advanced and making the production of such devices more widely accessible. This could facilitate trivial applications of AI on animals, entrenching the belief that animals are there for our own amusement, and encouraging companies to come up with new, potentially cruel ways for humans to act on that belief. (However, such technology could also have more worthy applications, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awG09liCMD4&amp;t=56s\"><u>using remote-controlled insects to find trapped humans in rescue missions</u></a>.)</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Entrenching speciesist thinking and reducing humans\u2019 capacity for active compassion</h3><p><strong>Normalizing speciesist biases</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-022-00199-9\"><u>AI could perpetuate and amplify speciesist tendencies present in the data it is trained on</u></a>. For instance, ChatGPT\u2019s current responses reflect the human belief that it is ethical to eat pig meat and the livers of force-fed geese (though not dog meat or cat liver).</p><p>Similarly, asking AI image generation tools (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/\"><u>Midjourney</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2\"><u>DallE</u></a>) to generate an image of a \u2018happy lobster\u2019 (or crab, or shrimp) will typically produce a drawing of that animal colored in red; i.e., the color they are when cooked, rather than alive. Examples of AI-generated pictures showing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/yijd3c/they_asked_an_ai_engine_to_recreate_a_salmon/\"><u>cooked salmon \u2018swimming\u2019 in a river</u></a> have gone viral. AI image generation tools are also more likely to e.g. present images of chickens in idyllic outdoor settings, rather than factory farms, potentially supporting the industry\u2019s humane-washing efforts.</p><p><strong>Prompting a de-prioritization of animal advocacy due to AI-related x-risks</strong></p><p>Major risks associated with AI could redirect human attention and resources away from issues such as animal suffering. (For example, in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theprecipice.com/\"><i><u>The Precipice</u></i></a>, Toby Ord notes that there are \u2018serious concerns about AI entrenching social discrimination, producing mass unemployment, supporting oppressive surveillance, and violating the norms of war\u2019). In a world of fear, societal division, and general chaos, it is likely that animal rights would become an even lesser concern than they are currently. This impact is even more pronounced if you believe, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221023231437/http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2014/06/human-and-animal-interventions/\"><u>some have argued</u></a>, that future improvements to human welfare are likely to be the main driver of improvements to animal welfare.</p><p><strong>Opening up the possibility of virtual companion animals</strong></p><p>The creation of sentient virtual companion animals could be pretty terrible (as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0020174X.2022.2144442\"><u>could the creation of digital minds more generally</u></a>), especially given the possibility that simulated beings could feasibly experience levels of enjoyment or suffering of which flesh-and-blood beings are biologically incapable. There are also a host of other potentially troubling implications, such as the trivialization of animal care, and the possibility that we could create magnificent virtual companion animals that make all \u2018regular\u2019 flesh-and-blood animals look extremely dull by comparison, potentially diminishing our level of engagement with their rights and wellbeing. (Ted Chiang\u2019s great novella&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2010/12/book-review-the-lifecycle-of-software-objects/\"><i><u>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;</i>explores some of these implications in occasionally disturbing detail.)</p><p>There are also various other ways in which humans might use advanced AI to simulate sentient animals in virtual environments,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/#Sentient_simulations\"><u>such as to simulate how life might evolve on different planets</u></a>, which raise similar ethical concerns.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Ways that AI could be good for animals</h2><h3>Improving farmed animal welfare</h3><p><strong>Improving farmed animal welfare through Precision Livestock Farming</strong></p><p>Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) uses advanced technologies to monitor and manage farmed animals.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nexocode.com/blog/posts/artificial-intelligence-in-poultry-industry-innovations-in-poultry-farming/#bringing-artificial-intelligence-to-the-future-of-sustainable-poultry-production\"><u>With the integration of AI, PLF can become increasingly efficient</u></a>, quickly detecting health issues, stress, and other welfare concerns, and addressing these either directly or with human assistance. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.soundwel-project.eu/\"><u>Project Soundwel</u></a> \u2018aims to understand the encoding of emotion in pig vocalisations and use this knowledge to develop a tool that can assess welfare on-farm by determining the emotion state of pigs through their vocalisations\u2019, while experts at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ambrook.com/research/technology/animal-welfare-AI-facial-recognition-emotions\"><u>Scotland\u2019s Rural College</u></a> have developed visual monitoring systems that can recognize individual pigs and detect when they are in distress.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Facilitating inspection of CCTV footage to detect animal welfare violations</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/artificial-intelligence-improve-animal-monitoring-slaughterhouses\"><u>AI can help humans analyze vast amounts of CCTV footage in real-time from slaughterhouses</u></a>. This means quicker detection of any animal welfare violations, helping ensure that these violations are promptly addressed \u2013 particularly if used by regulators, rather than by employees of the slaughterhouses themselves.</p><p><strong>Promoting transparency in the food industry</strong></p><p>AI tools could help increase transparency throughout the animal product supply chain. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/livestock-identification-market-is-booming-worldwide-allflex-delaval-nedap#ixzz8DecXeLTq\"><u>IdentiGEN</u></a> apparently uses technology that \u2018combines each species\u2019 unique DNA and data analytics to provide an evidence-based animal traceability solution, called DNA TraceBack, to accurately and precisely trace beef, seafood, pork, and poultry that is verifiable from farm-to-table\u2019. This could help regulators ensure the legitimacy of supposedly \u2018humane\u2019 animal products, and facilitate the introduction of consumer transparency measures such as animal welfare labeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Providing alternatives to farmed animal identification methods</strong></p><p>Farmed animals are often mutilated in order to assist with identification, such as with ear tags or branding.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ambrook.com/research/technology/animal-welfare-AI-facial-recognition-emotions\"><u>AI tools could identify animals from their natural physical features</u></a>, making such mutilations redundant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Improving wild animal welfare</h3><p><strong>Enabling more ethical forms of population control</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.animal-ethics.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction_to_Wild_Animal_Suffering.pdf\"><u>Drones are already being used to administer contraception</u></a> in order to control certain animal populations. Powered by AI, drones could achieve this increasingly quickly and effectively. (For example, AI-powered drones are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2023/09/19/could-ai-powered-drones-be-the-solution-to-europes-wildfire-problems\"><u>already being used to help identify wildfires with apparent success</u></a> \u2013 which, as a side-note, could in itself be fantastic for animals, given that wildfires kill and injure far more non-human animals than humans.) This could ensure that fewer animals suffer and die due to resource scarcity, and also render less ethical forms of population control redundant.</p><p><strong>Providing medical assistance to animals in the wild</strong></p><p>AI-assisted drones could identify sick animals in the wild and provide medical assistance, or euthanize the animal if they are beyond medical help. (Thanks to Yip Fai Tse for this idea, which emerged during an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FaBKw1s2s__c--tkpNHhBTLWSXhU5lcGCGprWIQJ68/edit#heading=h.ddkdt3dgje9p\"><u>\u2018AI and Animals Idea Jam\u2019</u></a> in June 2023.)</p><p><strong>Making human infrastructure safer for animals</strong></p><p>AI systems can track the movements of animals to prevent potential hazards. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/13/only-ai-made-it-possible-scientists-hail-breakthrough-in-tracking-british-wildlife\"><u>AI systems are already helping to guide the construction of road and train underpasses</u></a> based on the concentration of certain species, and they could also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nhsdeCEZAaBQQaro8/using-artificial-intelligence-machine-vision-to-increase-the-1\"><u>reduce collisions between bats and wind turbines</u></a>. Self-driving cars could also be programmed to identify and avoid animals on the road&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks\"><u>much more effectively than human drivers are currently able to</u></a> (though see the section above for concerns about self-driving cars having speciesist biases encoded).</p><p><strong>Enabling more ambitious and far-reaching interventions to improve wild animal welfare</strong></p><p>AI could also support the ideation and execution of far more radical measures to fundamentally improve wild animal welfare. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.abolitionist.com/\"><u>David Pearce\u2019s Abolitionist Project</u></a> advocates for the use of genetic engineering and nanotechnology to abolish suffering throughout the living world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Improving welfare of animals used for other purposes</h3><p><strong>Accelerating the transition to animal-free research</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90732281/meet-the-animal-testing-alternative-that-could-prevent-unnecessary-deaths\"><u>Organizations like Smarter Sorting</u></a> are using AI to analyze existing toxicity data and extrapolate this to new products based on their ingredients, without the need for further animal testing, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/verisim-life-uses-ai-powered-biosimulations-to-replace-animal-drug-testing/\"><u>other organizations like Verisim Life</u></a> use AI to create digital simulations that can replace animal drug testing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Providing virtual alternatives to animal-based entertainment</strong></p><p>AI-driven virtual reality and augmented reality platforms can offer alternatives to traditional forms of entertainment that use animals. For instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/german-circus-uses-stunning-holograms-instead-live-animal-performers-180972376/\"><u>some modern circuses</u></a> have already begun using holograms of animals rather than real ones, and these virtual animals are likely to become increasingly realistic and engaging with the assistance of advanced AI.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Supporting the \u2018genetic disenhancement\u2019 of animals exploited for human purposes</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6523187/\"><u>New gene-editing technologies make it theoretically possible to genetically manipulate animals to reduce or eliminate their capacity for suffering</u></a>, allowing humans to continue using them for research, farming, and other purposes, (arguably) without the same degree of ethical concerns. (However, this technology could also have terrible implications \u2013 see section above.)&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Developing alternatives to animal products</h3><p><strong>Accelerating the progress of cellular agriculture</strong></p><p>AI could greatly accelerate the development of cellular agriculture. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://new-harvest.org/app/uploads/2022/12/LitReview_ML_ZacharyCosenza.pdf\"><u>Machine Learning can help predict the best ingredients and conditions for the media used in cellular agriculture</u></a>, making the process more efficient and cost-effective. The Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) and New Harvest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://new-harvest.org/ai-cellag/\"><u>recently launched a one-year research project</u></a> specifically focused on the applications of Machine Learning in cellular agriculture.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accelerating the progress of plant-based animal product alternatives</strong></p><p>AI could greatly accelerate the development of plant-based animal product alternatives. For example, AI could greatly improve the \u2018extrusion process\u2019 that helps create textures and structures that mimic those of traditional animal-based meats. This is the mission of the new non-profit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenprotein.ai/\"><u>GreenProtein AI</u></a>: \u2018to leverage advanced AI technology to optimize the extrusion process of plant-based meat production\u2019, thereby enhancing \u2018the quality, taste, and sustainability of plant-based meat products, all while reducing costs\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accelerating the mass production of targeted ingredients for use across different alternative protein industries</strong></p><p>AI can enable companies to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.futurebridge.com/industry/perspectives-food-nutrition/start-ups-using-artificial-intelligence-to-produce-alternative-protein/\"><u>rapidly optimize the production of alternative protein ingredients</u></a> by facilitating an understanding of the molecular structure of various proteins and how these can be used and combined with other ingredients, to provide e.g. different textures and nutritional profiles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Helping solve problems in arable farming</strong></p><p>AI technology can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/02/02/how-ai-is-cropping-up-in-the-agriculture-industry/?sh=914864d2b4fb\"><u>help optimize arable farming</u></a>, such as by monitoring crops to detect disease before it spreads, distinguishing crops from weeds to allow for targeted herbicide use, and enabling self-driving tractors and combine harvesters. This could in principle make it cheaper to grow and purchase plant-based foods. (However, similar applications would of course apply to crops grown for animal feed, thereby increasing the profitability of animal farming.)</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Fostering anti-speciesist thinking</h3><p><strong>Freeing humans up to care more about other animals</strong></p><p>If AI were to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aDFR6c3Qd6cqrQu7c/could-ai-accelerate-economic-growth\"><u>accelerate economic growth</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/4/e000798\"><u>improve global health</u></a>, this increased prosperity could better enable people to commit time and money to social justice issues, such as animal rights. People are also more likely to consider animal rights to be a legitimate concern if they are not themselves directly affected by poverty and poor health. (On the other hand, accelerated economic growth over the last few centuries has allowed us to scale up systems that entail huge amounts of animal suffering, such as intensive farming, and this may continue to be the case in the future.)</p><p><strong>Fostering mutually reinforcing arguments about caring for animals and caring for sentient digital beings</strong></p><p>Organizations such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/\"><u>Sentience Institute</u></a> investigate considerations around the<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/key-questions-for-digital-minds\"><u> inclusion of digital minds and artificial sentience in humanity\u2019s moral circle</u></a>, including the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/moral-spillover-in-human-ai-interaction\"><u>potential of \u2018moral spillover\u2019</u></a> from one group, such as animals, to another, such as sentient digital minds. There could also feasibly be spillover in the opposite direction, from sentient digital minds to animals.&nbsp; Advocating for the rights and well-being of one group could reinforce the arguments for the other, accelerating a broader cultural shift towards ethical consideration for all sentient beings.</p><p><strong>Allowing us to understand animals\u2019 communications</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.earthspecies.org/\"><u>Earth Species Project</u></a> aims to \u2018decode non-human communication\u2019.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.interspecies.io/\"><u>Interspecies Internet</u></a> aims to \u2018accelerate our understanding of interspecies communication\u2019.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.projectceti.org/\"><u>Project CETI</u></a> aims to translate the communication of sperm whales. All of these projects use AI technology in some form or another. Success in this field could help us to understand animals\u2019 needs and recognize them as morally relevant beings. (However, it could also provide humans with new means to manipulate animals. For example, biomimetic robots have successfully been used to communicate with bees in order to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07126\"><u>change their flight paths</u></a>. In future, this kind of technology could make it easier for us to use animals for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/life/navy-dolphins/\"><u>e.g. military purposes).</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>(Side note:&nbsp;<i>The Animals In That Country</i> is a great dystopian novel that explores what might happen if there were a pandemic that enabled people to understand animals.)</p><p><strong>Opening up the possibility of virtual companion animals</strong></p><p>Companion animals suffer a fair bit, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/11/23673393/pets-dogs-cats-animal-welfare-boredom\"><u>potentially much more than we would like to think</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540283/\"><u>They also eat an incredible amount of animal products</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aitimejournal.com/how-ai-pets-have-improved/\"><u>Virtual companion animals</u></a> could allow people to form bonds with animals without the current welfare concerns, both for the animals themselves and for the animals whose flesh and secretions they consume. It would also allow people to look after a companion animal who currently aren\u2019t able to, with potential benefits to the spread of anti-speciesist thinking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666317312904?via%3Dihub\"><u>given the possible link</u></a> between having a companion animal and harboring moral concern for animals more broadly.</p><p>Obviously the goalposts would shift radically if these virtual companion animals were sentient; indeed, this may be where the greatest demand emerges for genuinely sentient digital beings, and therefore the greatest commercial incentive to create them. There are also a whole host of other potentially troubling implications (see section above).</p><p><strong>Increasing our recognition of our similarity to other animals, relative to AI systems</strong></p><p>As AI systems become more obviously weird and inhuman, our difference from those systems could help to reinforce the extent and significance of our shared biological heritage with animals. This could potentially increase humans\u2019 feeling of companionship with animals, and responsibility for them.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Empowering animal advocates</h3><p><strong>Increasing animal advocacy organizations\u2019 research capabilities</strong></p><p>Animal advocacy organizations could increasingly use AI-assisted tools to improve the quantity and quality of their research. Current examples include research search tools such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://elicit.com/\"><u>Elicit</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://consensus.app/\"><u>Consensus</u></a>, and animal advocacy-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://veg3.ai/\"><u>VEG3</u></a>. Tools such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher\"><u>GPT Researcher</u></a>, which are in theory capable of more complex, multi-step research tasks, are also likely to become increasingly useful as their quality improves.</p><p><strong>Facilitating grant-writing and grant-reading</strong></p><p>General AI tools like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a>, and specific grant-writing ones like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grantable.co/\"><u>Grantable</u></a>, could increasingly assist in the grant-writing process. This could be particularly helpful for less well-resourced organizations and/or organizations where staff are not fluent in the language in which the grant application needs to be written. (This could also have a downside, in that grantmaking organizations may have a larger quantity of applications to get through as a result, and may be more suspicious about whether a proposal written using AI accurately reflects the plan of the organization.)</p><p><strong>Supporting novel and effective campaigns and messaging</strong></p><p>Vegan Hacktivists and Plant Based News recently ran a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqngQLeNsok\"><u>great webinar</u></a> on how AI can already be used to create engaging animal advocacy campaigns. AI can help with both text-based campaigns (using models like ChatGPT,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bard.google.com/chat\"><u>Bard</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://claude.ai/\"><u>Claude</u></a> to generate content, summarize relevant studies and monitor online sources) and image-based (using tools like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/\"><u>MidJourney</u></a> to create visually arresting content that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vegnews.com/2023/4/cows-grow-old-in-this-campaign-aimed-at-getting-you-to-eat-more-plants\"><u>these pictures</u></a> of old pigs, cows, and chickens that illustrate how young farmed animals typically are at the time of slaughter).</p><p><strong>Tailoring outreach messaging to individuals</strong></p><p>AI could also be used to tailor online advocacy to specific individuals; e.g., by analyzing publicly available user data on social media and delivering messaging that is likely to align with their interests and demographics. Tools such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://humantic.ai/\"><u>Humantic</u></a> can already predict personality traits based on social media posts. Combining such technology with a Large Language Model that can retrieve evidence on communication strategies could be used to accurately predict the type of messaging that is most likely to convince a specific individual to carry out a particular kind of behavior change.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Improving the accessibility of animal advocacy content&nbsp;</strong></p><p>AI could increasingly make advocacy content more accessible. AI-powered text-to-speech (e.g., using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://speechify.com/\"><u>Speechify</u></a>), translation (e.g., using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/en/translator\"><u>DeepL</u></a>), and summarization (e.g., using ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude) could help advocacy messages and research reach a global and diverse audience.</p><p><strong>Facilitating animal cruelty investigations</strong></p><p>As AI becomes incorporated into an increasing number of devices,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SZp9h2HulIUrmVAhRhI_GrVDhAGeIMyR/view\"><u>any AI system connected to a camera or speaker could be used to record instances of animal cruelty</u></a>. While this raises much broader privacy concerns, it could also make on-farm investigations much easier. (However, there may be increasing skepticism of animal cruelty footage in a world of incredibly advanced image generation, reducing levels of public engagement and complicating any form of corporate litigation on the basis of animal welfare violations. Some animal advocates might actually end up using fake media, opening the movement up to being discredited even further.)</p><p><strong>Increasing animal advocacy organizations\u2019 general productivity</strong></p><p>Like all organizations, animal advocacy organizations could increasingly use AI to enhance their productivity and efficiency (e.g., by automating administrative or other repetitive tasks). Tools such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://auto-gpt.ai/\"><u>AutoGPT</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/\"><u>AgentGPT</u></a>, which can in principle act more autonomously than e.g. ChatGPT by breaking complex tasks down into smaller sub-tasks, could be used as AI assistants for a huge variety of projects such as corporate campaigns, petitions, or social media outreach.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Further considerations</h2><p><strong>AI systems might cause a great deal of harm to animals without our realizing</strong></p><p>Humans rarely take the interests of animals into account when developing new technologies. For example, when humans invented explosives and drills, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone tried to predict the potential impacts on rodents and underground-dwelling insects who would be killed and have their habitats destroyed when humans used these new inventions to carry out construction work. However, even if humans did care enough to factor in animals\u2019 interests when developing AI, it can be very hard to understand what\u2019s going on beneath the surface of AI systems. For example, in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/richard-ngo-large-language-models/\"><u>this 80,000 Hours podcast</u></a>, Richard Ngo says:</p><p>\u2018[...] we really have no idea what\u2019s going on inside the systems that we\u2019re training. So you can get a system that will write you dozens of lines of code, that implements a certain function, that leads to certain outcomes on the screen, and we have no way of knowing what it\u2019s doing internally that leads it to produce that output.\u2019</p><p>For many end users, if they provide AI systems with a set of instructions and get a successful outcome, they may be unlikely to question the system\u2019s methods in achieving that outcome. As systems become increasingly powerful, it is feasible that the system\u2019s chosen method could involve significant harm to non-human animals.&nbsp; For example, an AI system tasked with optimizing transportation routes for a delivery company might identify a shortcut through less-traveled rural areas. Beneath the apparent success, this new route might cut through wildlife habitats, resulting in a surge of roadkill incidents. The delivery company would feasibly celebrate the reduced fuel costs and faster delivery times while failing to notice or address the negative consequences for wild animals.</p><p><strong>It\u2019s extremely unpredictable what forms AI systems will take and what implications these might have</strong></p><p>Seemingly harmless or beneficial technologies can facilitate very harmful outcomes. As noted above,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23868483/cars-roads-roadkill-crossing-goldfarb-national-parks\"><u>cars</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26440494/\"><u>windows</u></a> kill hundreds of millions of animals each year in the United States alone.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/horizon-magazine/light-pollution-altering-plant-and-animal-behaviour\"><u>Artificial light exacerbates the rate of window collisions</u></a>, while also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/global-light-pollution-affecting-ecosystems-what-can-we-do\"><u>disrupting animals\u2019 natural movements, migration patterns, and reproductive cycles</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://earth.org/data_visualization/how-many-marine-animals-does-ocean-plastic-kill/\"><u>Plastic</u></a> kills around a hundred million marine animals each year just due to ingestion or entanglement. Take something as potentially powerful and pervasive as AI, and there are countless feasible ways it could be used or abused, intentionally or unintentionally, that we couldn\u2019t hope to predict today.&nbsp;</p><p>This is exacerbated by the problem of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/value-extrapolation\"><u>value extrapolation</u></a>. As AI systems become more capable, they might face decisions in contexts that were not explicitly covered during their training or programming, and they might extrapolate their values in ways that are not in line with programmers\u2019 original intentions. This just makes things even more unpredictable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AI could bring about a \u2018lock-in\u2019 scenario</strong></p><p>AI development could lead to scenarios where certain AI-driven processes become difficult or impossible to reverse. If this occurs, the AI systems\u2019 values at the point of lock-in, and the beings that these are extended to, will heavily dictate how good or bad the future is for all human and non-human animals.</p><p>One example of this is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=443120004027030093015025005124069010019034072064048062031086082088084120011006018065035021040118024059039027109124089064029013039034047048077007100077070113119005103051035010107117124067027066083113005095119013001095120030075071029114112015082086120101&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE\"><u>Technological-Legal Lock-In</u></a>. When you turn legal rules and decision-making processes into algorithms, they become more permanent. A\u200b\u200bltering an established algorithm can be technically challenging and resource-intensive, and might require the approval of many stakeholders. This can make it much less likely that legislation will evolve once it has been incorporated into AI systems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>AI could be incredibly bad for animals.</strong> It could precipitate a future where hyper-productive animals suffer horribly in automated mega-facilities that pump out cut-price meat for consumption by disengaged consumers whose only interactions with live animals come from battling sentient Neopets in a simulated fighting pit.</p><p><strong>AI could also be incredibly good for animals.&nbsp;</strong>It could precipitate a future where advanced technology has rendered all animal exploitation economically redundant and humanity\u2019s newfound prosperity has granted us such levels of wisdom, wellbeing, and financial freedom that our only concern is the invention of ever more ingenious technological means to benefit all sentient life.</p><p><strong>It probably won\u2019t be either of those scenarios</strong>. But given the astronomical amount of wellbeing at stake, doing as much as possible to shift the dial towards the latter scenario seems like a worthwhile use of resources.</p><p><br>I\u2019m planning on writing a follow-up post setting out ideas for specific actions that animal advocates could take to help contribute to making AI a positive force for animals.

", "postedAt": "2023-10-11T13:10:52.535Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Big tech and novel technology have progressed extremely far. Neurotechnology, brain reading, and manipulation are expected to grow and develop more to drastically impact our lives. This comes with some exciting possibilities of improving our learning, perceptions, and ability to connect with each other. It also comes with some dangerous problems, like human rights violations by authorities and perpetrators. More needs to be done to make the public aware and advocate for proper policy and protections. A concerning modern use of teleneurotechnology is its combined use with public stalking and harassment. This includes public surveillance and harassment like stalking, \u201cgroup-stalking,\u201d company and private investigations, neighborhood watch, Patriot Act, and more. Currently there is no direct trace for teleneurotechnology misuse. However, through symptoms, brain activity, and behavior, the details of when the misuse occurred and potentially who was the user can be looked into. While current laws might be helpful in some cases, more is needed. Creating regulations that add better tracing and protection requirements is important to ensure a safe and fair future.&nbsp;</p><p>Teleneurotech combined with public and cyber harassment tactics have shown to have real damaging impact. For example: this technology is used on the religious homeless as a sort of \u201centertainment\u201d for the harassing, who are usually motivated by money, to convince them \u201cGod\u201d is communicating and leading them. When in reality it\u2019s a collection of people gaining something from messing with their lives. This \u201cmessing with\u201d can vary in severity: it can be minimal and effect nothing but just some wasted time, or it can be as severe as psychological torture. Even with the minimal though, this type of harassment usually is aimed at getting the individual to be violent with themselves or others, and the quote \u201cDeath by a thousand cuts\u201d holds very true. Julian Assange, a whistleblower journalist, has made claims of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7316471/\">continuous harassment</a> and psychological torture by government agencies. The F.B.I. has tried to radicalize and encourage violence from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/29/politics/aby-rayyan-fbi-terror-sting-pizza-man/index.html\">targeted individuals.</a> Which has been historically bigoted. With this technology what other tactics might be used and how will this affect those issues and others? What can be done is learn and organize and take political action, while spreading positive news about how these phenomena can help counteract its misuse.&nbsp;</p><p>Cautions are important, but what can be done to help and empower people? Neurotechnology that was used to harass these victims, can be used to heal. The same public stalking tactics that are used to put individuals and others around in danger, can be used to protect them and mitigate those that are putting others in danger. We should look at our new inventions and popularized social interactions with a critical and open lens. Gaining control over our rights during this technological growth is vital. The ability to share information and skills is vital to enhance and bring everyone\u2019s potential and creativity to maximum. The treatment and enhanced learning might even close the gaps between economic and social groups. A more beautiful world would be if this maximizes our intellectual, social, and artistic side rather than our pettiness, vulnerabilities, and hierarchies.</p><p>There is so much more that can be discussed, and further analysis and cross-analysis between neurotechnology and group-stalking phenomena might show a significant connection and danger.&nbsp;</p><p><br>What have you heard of and what are your opinions on these \"newish\" phenomenon?&nbsp;</p><p>For example: <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/7/2506\">Group stalking research</a> shows that&nbsp;indigenous women and women of color are disproportionately affected by group-stalking.

Namely, lacking necessary nuance.<ul><li>If you went to someone in one of the richest countries in the world who lives on $30/day, that person will absolutely be facing great financial (and connected) struggles in their everyday life. Highlighting that person in that situation, who cannot afford shelter, food or medical care, as being in the 15% richest people in the world, may be true, but it is also immensely out of touch. I think we should really include empathy in such discussions.<ul><li>This <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/world-problems/\">80,000 hours article</a> does a good job of highlighting the paramount reasons we focus on poorer areas: poor people in rich countries are less, and tougher to help.</li></ul></li><li>A person in a poor country, living above the poverty line (say $10/day) is better off than a person in a rich country, living below the poverty line (say $20/day) from a personal financial standpoint. Even though absolutely, the latter is twice as wealthy as the former if we only take into account income. The nuance we lack is the other side of the equation: cost of living and expenses.</li><li>I think it would be more prudent, and paint a clearer picture if when we refer to the wealth of different people, we not only take into account their wealth as a simple metric of money coming in, but as a ratio of income to cost of living. Maybe even frame the discussions around already established ideas such as the poverty line. This way we take into account multiple necessary factors which some other discussions ignore.</li><li>In essence, I believe there are instances we should compare people to their own environment, not to one they do not get to experience which incorrectly paints a more comfortable picture for them.</li><li>Another thought is that we instead focus not on all income as now, but on \u201cdiscretionary income.\u201d By that I mean that we subtract the cost of living expenses from the income, and then the left over difference can be compared in absolute terms. So we do a similar comparison as currently done, but only for income which is above that required to meet the poverty line (or some other such &nbsp;baseline), instead of all of it.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Thank you all for taking the time to read through these reflections and feel free to leave any feedback you think relevant.

They imply that, for any finite amount of value, it would be better to wager it all for a vanishingly small probability of some greater value. Counterintuitive as it might be, this <i>fanaticism</i> has seemingly compelling independent arguments in its favour. In this paper, I consider perhaps the most <i>prima facie</i> compelling such argument: an <i>Egyptology argument</i> (an analogue of the Egyptology argument from population ethics). I show that, despite recent objections from Russell (2023) and Goodsell (2021), the argument's premises can be justified and defended, and the argument itself remains compelling.</p><h2>Fanaticism</h2><p>Consider a small probability, perhaps one in 1,000.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpsxvmqhzz7q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpsxvmqhzz7q\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Which is better: to save the life of one person for sure; or to have a probability of one in 1,000 of saving some very large number of lives, many more than 1,000? Or consider an even smaller probability, perhaps one in one million. Which is better: to save that one life for sure; or to have a probability of one in one million of saving some vast number of lives? At some point, as the probability of success gets closer and closer to zero, it may seem <i>fanatical</i> to claim that the latter option is better, <i>even if</i> arbitrarily many lives would be saved if it succeeded.</p><p>Nonetheless, fanatical verdicts follow from various widely accepted theories of instrumental (moral) betterness. For instance, <i>expected</i> (moral) <i>value theory</i> says that one option is better than another if it has a greater probability-weighted sum of (moral) value\u2014a greater <i>expected value</i>. Combine this with any theory of moral betterness that attributes equal value to each additional life saved, and the expected value of the low-probability option can always be greater\u2014saving one life for sure won\u2019t be as good as saving <i>N</i> lives with some tiny probability \u03b5, no matter how tiny \u03b5 is, so long as <i>N</i> is great enough.</p><p>Beyond expected value theory as well, other theories can lead to the same verdict. For instance, take expected <i>utility</i> theory: whereby options are compared according to their probability-weighted sum of <i>utility</i>, where utility can be any increasing<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff8slnro92c5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf8slnro92c5\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;function of moral value. One key difference from expected value theory is that we could let additional units of moral value count for less and less utility and expected utility theory could then exhibit risk aversion. But it would still uphold the fanatical verdict above\u2014as long as the chosen utility function is unbounded (with respect to the number of lives saved), expected utility theory will agree that saving some vast number <i>N</i> of lives with probability \u03b5 is better than saving one life for sure, no matter how tiny \u03b5 is, so long as <i>N</i> is great enough. Likewise, Buchak\u2019s (2013) <i>risk-weighted</i> expected utility theory\u2014whereby each option\u2019s expected utility is further transformed to account for its riskiness, using a \u2018risk\u2019 function\u2014will say the same for many possible risk functions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft7tv27g6gdo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt7tv27g6gdo\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><h3><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/egyptology-and-fanaticism-hayden-wilkinson/\">Read the rest of the paper</a></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnpsxvmqhzz7q\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefpsxvmqhzz7q\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Throughout, I will remain agnostic on exactly how probability is interpreted.
