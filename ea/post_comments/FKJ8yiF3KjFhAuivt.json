Because they either were worried about sullying EA's name, or they were worried about social punishment from others who didn't want EA's name sullied.</p><p>IMO, trying super hard to never have your brand's name sullied, at the expense of ordinary moral goals like \"be honest\", tends to sully one's brand far more than if you'd just ignored the brand and prioritized other concerns. Especially insofar as the people you're trying to appeal to are very smart, informed, careful thinkers; you might be able to trick the Median Voter that EA is cool via a shallow PR campaign and attempts to strategically manipulate the narrative, but you'll have a far harder time tricking the sorts of extremely smart, educated, morally scrupulous people who EA is <i>actually</i> mostly trying to recruit and persuade.</p><p>And this is especially especially true insofar as you're trying to get a huge diffuse community to all play along with your fake narrative! It's not as though you can send out a memo to all EAs to dissemble in a specific way that furthers your narrative; the memo will just leak and cause more harm than good. EA needs to give up on this \"have an immaculate brand\" mirage and shift its mindset toward goals more like \"exemplify real virtues\", \"focus on the object level\", and \"specialize in the niche of being The Group That Speaks Truth Even When It's Uncomfortable\".
