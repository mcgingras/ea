I.e., the formula as you have it now does not constrain the space of possibilities the way you want it to.</p>\n<p>Another way to see it is that \"For all x in X, x is green\" gets formalized as forall(x, implies(x in X, x is green)), which in broad brush strokes is the form you want here.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "rhollerith"}}, {"_id": "sDsbGLc6hC34vRxmD", "postedAt": "2023-10-04T00:47:50.415Z", "postId": "TmnYEfiqxFtAXDaCd", "htmlBody": "<p>You're right.
