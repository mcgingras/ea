While funder/board members drive the direction of an organization and help determine its general funding priorities, being the point person on decisions about <i>specific grants</i> is quite different from this. In the latter case, a funder/board member would also, effectively, be serving as an employee of the organization, because these organizations<i> </i>have full-time grantmakers. That would (likely) make them intimately involved in the day-to-day workings of the organization, and could more easily introduce serious COIs.

When acting as a nonprofit board member, for instance, the individual owes a duty of loyalty to the nonprofit. They need to be particularly alert to situations in which recusal or even resignation may be required.</li><li>In each case, the potential conflicts of interest need to be analyzed. If a conflict exists but is waivable, then it needs to first be waived by someone who can legitimately do so. For instance, in the Claire example, I think there is a conflict between Claire being involved in proposing a grant and in making a recommendation on whether to fund that grant. I also think that conflict is waivable by the ultimate donor. In contrast, if the funds were coming out of a publicly-supported charity, I would likely find the conflict non-waivable because there is no practical way to get ultimate-donor consent.</li><li>It's undesirable to have too large a proportion of funder-linked seats in a public charity. Many larger non-EA nonprofits have rather large boards, which allows them to absorb several seats for major donors (or big fundraisers) without creating too many downsides. For example, having one funder-linked seat out of five seats total would bring this closer to neutral for me. If the board were smaller than that, it would probably move me into negative territory.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "RpuSPHtym7wFDRmt5", "postedAt": "2023-05-25T14:35:54.035Z", "postId": "bPXmomt5boy72Pfre", "htmlBody": "<p>One way in which the Claire example could differ from other examples is that she owes both a duty of loyalty to EVF and a duty of loyalty to the donors to whom she is making the grant recommendation.
