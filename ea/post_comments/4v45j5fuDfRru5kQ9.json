I have been thinking for very long that this is a bad translation in both the Japanese and Chinese contexts (for those who don't know these languages: \"\u529f\u5229\u4e3b\u7fa9\" is the most popular translation for \"utilitarianism\" in both Japanese and Chinese). The bad thing seems to be that the words \"\u529f\u5229\" has a bad connotation, and one that is almost the reverse of utlitarianism, therefore causing people to misunderstand utilitarianism, or have bad impression against it.&nbsp;</p><p>My question is then: <strong>Do you think \"\u529f\u5229\u4e3b\u7fa9\" is a bad translation?&nbsp;</strong> (not bad as in it is bad that you, or any translator chose this as the translation. But bad that it was, historically speaking, chosen and established as the popular translation.)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "tseyipfai@gmail.com"}}, {"_id": "cXxjRfjz3JfukdR5c", "postedAt": "2024-01-10T12:51:49.973Z", "postId": "4v45j5fuDfRru5kQ9", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you, Fai.

Even if we change this translation with, e.g., \u5927\u798f\u4e3b\u7fa9 and people understand utilitarianism as not egoism but maximizing overall well-being, people probably think utilitarianism leads to a counter-intuitive conclusion and also think it is a wrong moral theory. The problem is not in translation but in their understanding of utilitarianism itself.</p>", "parentCommentId": "36JgApbyfox8MDE7m", "user": {"username": "Masashi Takeshita"}}]
