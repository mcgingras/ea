Over time, we expect some of our charities to shut down, with our general estimate being that one in five will.</p><p>Regarding cost-effective ideas, we recognize this as a legitimate concern and something we think about quite a bit. There might be some diminishing returns on the impact of ideas we can find, but researching multiple cause areas has slowed this down a lot. We expect some level of a natural refresh rate as more studies and new evidence comes out on what are the most effective things to do. For example, we expect one new great idea per cause area to become newly available per year.

I used the word \"reach\" because it is difficult to objectively measure the impact of some of our charities, given their age. We wanted to give people a sense of their current progress despite this. Reach can also give a sense of the potential scale of the intervention. We also tried to include some estimated cost effectiveness to show the sense of level of impact per dollar. However, overall we do agree with the general sentiment that, sadly, people tend to look at more vanity level metrics like reach, funding, etc. Of course, many of our organizations will need to run an RCT (which some are already planning) before we can get a real sense of their impact, and we believe our organizations are committed to do this.&nbsp;<br><br>We indeed agree that Fortify Health has done a really great job, but we had to limit the number of charities we could talk to for this post, and some charities were more cautious about being associated with the EA movement.

I think the better solution is external evaluation, someone like GiveWell or Founders Pledge who does not have any reason to value CE charities. Typically, these organizations do their own independent research and compare it across their current portfolio of projects. If CE can, for example, fairly consistently incubate charities that GW/FP/etc. rank as best in the world, I think that is at least not organizationally tautological (it is assuming that these charity evaluators are in fact identifying the best areas/charities, and replicating any flaws they have though).<br><br>In terms of success rate, I agree 40% is high but I would expect many NGO incubators to be considerably higher than in the for-profit space, for a few reasons (a couple listed below):<br><br>General competition: There are just not that many charities aiming for pure impact (in an EA way), unlike the for-profit market. The general efficiency of the charity market is pretty low, and thus there are lots of fairly easy wins.<br><br>Scale sensitivity: Generally, successful for-profits are seen as really large-scale ventures (e.g., unicorns) and the market is consistently hunting for that. Debatably, the only charity currently seen as highly impactful that can get to that sort of scale is GiveDirectly. Thus the bar for success in the charity sector is significantly lower in terms of a money spent scale. For example, if we founded a charity running with a 1m a year budget, that was x2 as effective as top GW ones, we could count that as a success. But an organization of the same size would be considered a rounding error by YC. If we take size expectations into account, it might be like 1/25 charities that we incubated that have any significant chance of getting to unicorn-level size.</p>", "parentCommentId": "chZaPpX2YG3q5LT9C", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "C4gb9KdzquE53gWso", "postedAt": "2023-03-08T13:26:58.779Z", "postId": "cHDz2R5FfWGoZgWoZ", "htmlBody": "<p>We have thought about this but we are not confident weaker charities would not crowd out stronger ones with funders and thus lead to less overall impact.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "CZM6b9C7obxzJ3gjh", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "Yk5pnzHe3PcMi8763", "postedAt": "2023-03-08T23:12:13.100Z", "postId": "cHDz2R5FfWGoZgWoZ", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks, Joey.

Given this, I suspect that some of the 40% of cost-effective charities are not cost-effective, and that many of the\"steady state\" charities should be reclassified as \"might shut down in the future\" charities, although these three categories (\"highly cost-effective\", \"having impact\", and \"might shut down\") are vague and do not cover the range of possible outcomes here.</li><li>The fact that this post pitches the program to potential applicants (\"Applications are now open\") also makes me somewhat more skeptical about the positive gloss.</li></ol><p>I have read your response <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cHDz2R5FfWGoZgWoZ/?commentId=hYyigzzrSMsk5YScB\">here</a>, and agree that it'd be good to have an external organization do a comprehensive evaluation.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "hobbes"}}, {"_id": "KSrM5Lkg9PjB3Bgek", "postedAt": "2023-03-10T22:15:09.767Z", "postId": "cHDz2R5FfWGoZgWoZ", "htmlBody": "<p>The CE incubatees are an absolutely amazing bunch and exactly the types of people I would want on these world-bettering projects. &nbsp;Charity Entrepreneurship is no doubt one of the EA projects I am most excited about due to pure impact, research prowess and future potential.</p><p>When I compare the CE program to <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/yc-stats/\">YC</a> (see also <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/owid-at-ycombinator\">OWID@YC</a>), it feels even better due to the great co-founder matching process and the success rate along with the excellence within the focus areas (people don't come with their own esoteric tech startups).</p><p>For other commenters who talk about the use of reach numbers instead of e.g. QALY or WELLBYs, having seen some of their spreadsheets and programs, I am in deep awe and respect of some of the superheroes that have saved hundreds of lives (with many of these being counterfactual given the effectiveness and new vectors of impact) though I'll let them summarize their numbers.</p><p>I am very excited about where the projects will be in one and even five years and commend everyone involved.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "esben-kran"}}]
