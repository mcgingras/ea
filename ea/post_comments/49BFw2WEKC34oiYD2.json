It is obviously common sense, but I have the feeling that in the human world, there are a lot of exceptions, haha. Ego and foolish ambitions often led people to poorly evaluate their chances and die prematurely.</p><p>I really liked the part about sneaking! I believe such strategies fall under intelligent fighting if I'm not wrong. One may not have physical strength, but they outsmart their enemy. Speaking of which, I believe in Asian combat styles, intelligent fighting is quite common. For instance, aged fighters who go against younger ones. The veterans don't move very much and use their blows efficiently. They don't hit often, but their hits are impactful. Also, female fighters can act deceiving and make a deadly weapon out of a simple pin or a fan.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Konoko Asada"}}]
