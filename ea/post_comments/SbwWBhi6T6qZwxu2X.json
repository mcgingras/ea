Really like (a) the visual metaphors in bullet points and (b) the critical commentary with updates on replication. As someone who's only skimmed the Righteous Mind (didn't feel worth reading after Moral Tribes), I got a really good picture of the core concepts from this review (which I typically don't - it's really hard to efficiently compress the whole book).

Even though we bought the argumentation by MacAskill about triaging being the best thing to do and something we must not look away from it felt conflicting.
