How long has it been since humans had the tools to even attempt genetic engineering.

This can cost many millions, and is essentially so much liability that only a government could afford to practice genetic engineering.</p>\n<p>Governments are slow, remember it's only been about 10 years since it has been even feasible.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: the risk to benefits ratio for human genetic engineering offers minimal gain and even in the best case is slow, which means little annual roi.

Together with Joep from PauseAI, I wrote down my thoughts on the topic <a href=\"https://time.com/6295879/ai-pause-is-humanitys-best-bet-for-preventing-extinction/\">here</a>.</p><p>Since then, I have been thinking a bit on the pause and comparing it to a more <a href=\"https://jack-clark.net/2023/07/05/what-should-the-uks-100-million-foundation-model-taskforce-do/\">frequently mentioned</a> option, namely to apply model evaluations (evals) to see how dangerous a model is after training.</p><p>I think the difference between the supposedly more reasonable approach of evals and the supposedly more radical approach of a pause is actually smaller than it seems. Evals aim to detect dangerous capabilities. What will need to happen when those evals find that, indeed, a model has developed such capabilities? Then we'll need to implement a pause. Evals or a pause is mostly a choice about timing, not a fundamentally different approach.</p><p>With evals, however, we'll move precisely to the brink, look straight into the abyss, and then we plan to halt at the last possible moment. Unfortunately, though, we're in thick mist and we can't see the abyss (this is true even when we apply evals, since we don't know which capabilities will prove existentially dangerous, and since an existential event may already occur before running the evals).</p><p>And even if we would know where to halt: we'll need to make sure that the leading labs will practically succeed in pausing themselves (there may be thousands of people working there), that the models aren't getting leaked, that we'll implement the policy that's needed, that we'll sign international agreements, and that we gain support from the general public. This is all difficult work that will realistically take time.</p><p>Pausing isn't as simple as pressing a button, it's a social process. No one knowns how long that process of getting everyone on the same page will take, but it could be quite a while. Is it wise to start that process at the last possible moment, namely when the evals turn red? I don't think so. The sooner we start, the higher our chance of survival.</p><p>Also, there's a separate point that I think is not sufficiently addressed yet: we don't know how to implement a pause beyond a few years duration. If hardware and algorithms improve, frontier models could democratize. While I believe this problem can be solved by international (peaceful) regulation, I also think this will be hard and we will need good plans (hardware or data regulation proposals) for how to do this in advance. We currently don't have these, so I think working on them should be a much higher priority.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Otto"}}, {"_id": "a6jnwtrKAeFZciWqQ", "postedAt": "2023-09-16T02:00:53.265Z", "postId": "6SvZPHAvhT5dtqefF", "htmlBody": "<p>PSA: the term \"compute overhang\" or \"hardware overhang\" <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/icR53xeAkeuzgzsWP/taboo-compute-overhang\">has been used in many ways</a>.
