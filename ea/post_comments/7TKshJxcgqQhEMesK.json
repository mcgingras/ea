Most of the content I've seen from them has (in my reading) dealt pretty frankly with the massive negative externalities that AI labs could be generating. In fact, my reading of their article \"<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-an-ai-lab/\">Should you work at a leading AI lab?</a>\" is that they don't <i>broadly</i> recommend it at all. Here's their 1-sentence summary verbatim:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;<strong>Recommendation: it's complicated</strong></p><p>We think there are people in our audience for whom this is their highest impact option \u2014 but some of these roles might also be very harmful for some people. This means it's important to take real care figuring out whether you're in a harmful role, and, if not, whether the role is a good fit for you.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Hopefully this is helpful. It also sounds like these questions could be rhetorical / you have suspicions about their recommendation, so it could be worth writing up the affirmative case <i>against</i> working at labs if you have ideas about that. I know there was a post last week about this, so that thread could be a good place for this.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Tyler Johnston"}}, {"_id": "2XzQeJWJ7wZrtJAhE", "postedAt": "2024-02-15T00:44:24.634Z", "postId": "7TKshJxcgqQhEMesK", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey Tyler - I agree that this solves for the case where somebody engages deeply with 80k's content (System 2 thinking).
