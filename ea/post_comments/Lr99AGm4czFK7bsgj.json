Indeed, I'd say that there's more value overall in seeing EAs' actual cognitive processes than in seeing EAs' ultimate conclusions, when it comes to the domains that are most uncertain and disagreement-heavy (which include a lot of the most important domains for EAs to focus on today, in my view).</p><blockquote><p>This in not the paradigmatic example of someone who feels worried about making public mistakes.

In that context, I think building conversations about heavily polished, \"final\" (rather than in-process) cognition, tends to be insufficient for fast and reliable intellectual progress:</p><ul><li>Highly polished content tends to obscure the real reasons and causes behind people's views, in favor of reasons that are more legible, respectable, impressive, etc. (See <a href=\"https://unstableontology.com/2017/04/21/beware-defensibility/\">Beware defensibility</a>.)<ul><li>AGI alignment is a pre-paradigmatic proto-field where making good decisions will probably depend heavily on people having good technical intuitions, intuiting patterns before they know how to verbalize those patterns, and generally becoming adept at noticing what their gut says about a topic and putting their gut in contact with useful feedback loops so it can update and learn.</li><li>In that context, I'm pretty worried about an EA where everyone is hyper-cautious about saying anything that sounds subjective, \"feelings-ish\", hard-to-immediately-transmit-to-others, etc. That might work if EA's path to improving the world is via donating more money to AMF or developing better vaccine tech, but it doesn't fly if making (and fostering) conceptual progress on AI alignment is the path to impact.</li><li>Ideally, it shouldn't merely be the case that EA technically allows people to candidly blurt out their imperfect, in-process thoughts about things. Rather, EA as a whole <i>should be organized around </i>making this the expected and default culture (at least to the degree that EAs agree with me about AI being a top priority), and this should be reflected in a thousand small ways in how we structure our conversation. Normal EA Forum conversations should look more like casual exchanges between peers at an academic conference, and less like polished academic papers (because polished academic papers are too inefficient a vehicle for making early-stage conceptual progress).</li><li>I think this is not only true for making direct AGI alignment progress, but is also true for converging about key macrostrategy questions (hard vs. soft takeoff; overall difficulty of the alignment; probability of a sharp left turn; impressiveness of GPT-3; etc.). Insofar as we haven't already converged a lot on these questions, I think a major bottleneck is that we've tried too much to make our reasoning sound academic-paper-ish before it's really in that format, with the result that we confuse ourselves about our real cruxes, and people end up updating a lot less than they would in a normal back-and-forth.</li></ul></li><li>Highly polished, heavily privately reviewed and edited content tends to reflect the beliefs of larger groups, rather than the beliefs of a specific individual.<ul><li>This often results in deference cascades, double-counting evidence, and herding: everyone is trying (to some degree) to bend their statements in the direction of what everyone else thinks. I think it also often creates \"phantom updates\" in EA, where there's a common <i>belief</i> that X is widely believed, but the belief is wrong to some degree (at least until everyone updates their outside views because they <i>think</i> other EAs believe X).</li><li>It also has various directly distortionary effects (e.g., a belief might seem straightforwardly true to all the individuals at an org, but doesn't feel like \"the kind of thing\" an organization writ large should endorse).</li></ul></li></ul><p>In principle, it's not impossible to push EA in those directions <i>while also</i> passing drafts a lot more in private.
