Though these conversations are, so far, based on few data points, we continue to notice patterns that tell us we need to do more work in this area. We have decided to post about these one-by-one on the forum to start conversation. They are not very researched or exhaustive.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Conversation 1 - </strong>Hiring practices at some impact-minded organizations may be driving away talented mid-career people</h2><p>Within our work at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wx9GgKGWqksvMWjg2/successif-helping-mid-career-and-senior-professionals-have\"><u>Successif</u></a>, we\u2019ve heard several stories from program participants who have interviewed at well-regarded, impact-minded organizations and who have had significant negative experiences during the process. The claims include a combination of unreasonable asks, poor communication, mismanagement, and offers retracted at the last-minute. This has led talented individuals to reconsider their decision to invest time in the very difficult and costly task of finding impactful work.</p><p>These stories seem to mostly be caused by the fact that small organizations sometimes rely on recent graduates, with no prior experience in hiring, to find the most promising candidates to work on the world\u2019s most pressing problems. Unfortunately, hiring processes that are not handled adequately can drive out people with the highest professional standards and the most experience, since they will be more likely to recognize these processes as problematic. We are thus concerned that it is creating a selection bias and driving out people with certain skills and backgrounds that are less common in the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Many mid-careers balance their existing full-time workloads and at-home responsibilities with upskilling, searching for opportunities, interviewing, engaging with programs and other material, and others, who can afford it, take a sabbatical and dedicate themselves fully to this process. For those who make it to the interview process, our hope is that they are met with a reasonable experience so that they are not discouraged from finding impactful work.</p><p>Successif\u2019s core activities rely on indirect impact (helping others maximize their own impact), especially in the mitigation of AI catastrophic and existential risks. We are not hiring experts, and we got interested in this question because we think organizations with good hiring practices and internal culture will retain better talent and maximize their impact. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll be exploring this further with the HITE community (mentioned below) at monthly events, and we intend to post our findings on the forum.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s start the conversation!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>How you can help</h2><p>We\u2019d like your help continuing these conversations or challenging them, surfacing relevant data points, sharing your own experiences, or telling us about current efforts to make changes.

Endangered parrot I planned to help make less endangered.</figcaption></figure><h2>Before I got into EA</h2><h3>Fluke 1: Born into immense privilege by global standards (and reasonable privilege by rich country standards)</h3><h3>Mistake 1:&nbsp; Not doing something with that privilege. I wish someone (maybe me?) sat me down and said (maybe a more polite version of)<i>\u201cYou&nbsp;<strong>know</strong> which part of the bell curve you\u2019re on. Try doing something more useful for the world!\u201d</i>.&nbsp;</h3><p>At school and university I was mostly just driven by curiosity about the world (plus avoiding situations where I would screw up important things). That led me to study physics and a smattering of philosophy in undergraduate, and then started a PhD in theoretical physics.&nbsp; I conveniently chose a subject area that meant few people would read my work, and the impact on the world would be ~zero (in my mind this was a feature, not a bug).&nbsp;</p><h3>Good call 1: I talked to other students in the research group before choosing a PhD supervisor</h3><p>This led me to have an unusually attentive and supportive team.&nbsp; I think this made a HUGE difference in my enjoyment and productivity during that time. It still wasn\u2019t incredibly enjoyable and productive, but I was much better off than most PhD students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Mistake 2: Mistaking my interest in the&nbsp;<i>ideas&nbsp;</i>with interest in the&nbsp;<i>day to day work</i></h3><p>I\u2019m very extroverted \u2013 and I knew that before starting the PhD. Theoretical physics research is very solitary \u2013 which I also knew. Did I think that through? Turns out no.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Not giving up sooner&nbsp;</h3><p>I was pretty sure research wasn\u2019t for me after 1.5 years. I should have stopped then.&nbsp;</p><p>The obvious signs happened at the end of each holiday:</p><p>The whole department: <i>\u201cOh man, the undergrads are coming back, I\u2019m so annoyed I have to teach, I wish I could just keep doing my research\u201d</i>&nbsp;<br>Me: <i>\u201cOh thank Christ! The undergraduates are coming back! I\u2019ll get to talk to people, and have some escape from the interminable research\u201d&nbsp;</i></p><p>I could have even written up a Master's thesis at that stage so I didn't even need to go home with nothing to show. But I was stubborn and spent another 2 years finishing my PhD.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mistake 4: Not exploring more options (even though they were scary)</h3><p>I went straight into teacher training. It was hard at first, but overall a pretty good fit for me. But I wish I explored other paths too.</p><h3>Good Call 2: Got really good at a valuable(ish) thing, and then used that as leverage to branch out a little</h3><p>I spent 11 years teaching. At first I worked hard on my regular teaching job and got good at it. Then that led me to be able to do lots of extra things; writing resources and assessments, then leading teams of writers and assessors, running science camps, getting involved in physics competitions, and consulting with government authorities. I became one of the go-to people in my little field \u2013 a moderately big fish in a teency pond. This was great for giving me more confidence and gave me more of a sense of my varied skills.&nbsp;</p><h2>After learning about EA</h2><p>EA sparked a big change in how I thought about my career (and my life more generally).&nbsp;</p><h3>Good call 3: I didn\u2019t let my age put me off changing careers&nbsp;</h3><p>In EA there is so much focus on students and young professionals - one of the reasons is because if we influence a young person to pursue a high impact career path, they will have many years of high impact work ahead of them. But I roughly reject that reason<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0f3f71e2dnxa\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0f3f71e2dnxa\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;as most people have several career changes in their life<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpotfo42guq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpotfo42guq\">[2]</a></sup></span>, and my best guess was that the expected length of my next career would be similar (if not longer) than the expected length of a 20 year old undergraduate student\u2019s first career.&nbsp;</p><p>I continue to worry a bit about a bias against older people in our community.&nbsp;</p><h3>Good call 4: I reliably did stuff that seemed to need doing, even if they were boring, low status, or unpaid. I tried to be of service to others.&nbsp;</h3><p>I generally didn\u2019t do this to advance my career (at least not consciously) but it was helpful in my career. My ability to do this was due to Fluke 1!</p><p>I internalised moral responsibility when I got into EA. I was very influenced by some earlier EAs like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html\"><u>Julia and Jeff</u></a> - who gave up significant resources to make a big difference with not a lot of encouragement from the world. And I too gave up a lot of free time (and some money) to EA causes.&nbsp;</p><p>It was hard but good. &nbsp;A bonus was that (slowly) more people trusted me and were keen to work with me.</p><p>Sometimes I\u2019ve thought <i>\u201coh these young EA whippersnappers, expecting so much! They don\u2019t know how good they got it. Back in the old days we used to &lt;insert financial or personal sacrifice&gt; and didn't expect anything back\u201d</i>. I don\u2019t endorse this thought, but it crossed my mind quite regularly through the time of (apparent) plenty in the EA movement, and occasionally the thought still pops up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/ue7wM0QC5LE?si=17qqBdy77cvn31_H&amp;t=20\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ue7wM0QC5LE\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h3>Mistake 5: Thought too narrowly about my absolute advantage and didn't consider where my largest impact was.&nbsp;</h3><p>My best guess at my absolute advantage in the world was designing and delivering physics education. I therefore figured that designing and delivering EA education might be what I should do in the EA world. But I was most likely wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect I think it would have been higher impact for me to have had a different approach: To identify really impactful projects/orgs/people that I think are doing exceptional work, and see if/how I could help with them, rather than narrowly thinking about my obvious skills and current roles (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/to34jb5LuWo4fM9gC/taking-prioritisation-within-ea-seriously#Anchoring_too_much_on_what_opportunities_you_have_in_the_short_term\"><u>this post articulates this thought well</u></a>).</p><p>I did a lot of voluntary work. I volunteered&nbsp;for <a href=\"https://shicschools.org/\"><u>Students for High-Impact Charity</u></a> for about 1.5 years. &nbsp;I co-founded a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effectivealtruism.nz/\"><u>national</u></a> and city EA group, helped run an EAGx, co-set up and did the admin for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effectivealtruism.nz/eanzct\"><u>donation funnelling charity</u></a>, and gave a LOT of introductory EA workshops and talks. During this time I dropped from full time to part time teaching to do more volunteer work.</p><p>This was mostly great. I enjoyed teaching people about EA, and I had satisfaction from seeing EA Aotearoa New Zealand grow.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, what I guess was the counterfactually highest impact thing during this time (bringing Kiwi EAs together at retreats) didn\u2019t leverage my most obvious skills.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/jti6m9fxrz7hinlns44g\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/wbscjvjhomscpob4xlkj 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/nrmeenkdhccjrynzlvvu 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/y4xs43vxrxnjizfmuvnz 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/cum0iu2bohqesh7epwfl 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/smc8ogqcsmdwdnjg7lss 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/n9pv6gazknir4dzrmkca 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/frqrhmulhqpusycl41lh 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/srhf6txoimmtoi9zjiue 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/fn1n2xfjnx38kifmgcpd 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/w59DkYCJYqaYDpEqG/lob7qyw3bp5xnqudbfri 1242w\"><figcaption>Shady spot for lunch at an EA Aotearoa New Zealand retreat</figcaption></figure><h3>Good Call 5: I took a scary step - quitting my secure job without another guaranteed paid opportunity lined up (but with runway and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-planning/#plan-Z\"><u>plan Z</u></a>).&nbsp;</h3><p>After I quit my secure job, we secured enough funding to pay me (for 1.5 years) to work on Students for High Impact Charity full time. It was great not to have split focus between paid work and volunteer work. I taught (usually very fun) or facilitated the teaching of (a little less fun) a bunch of students, mostly in NZ, Canada and the UK.</p><h3>Mistake 6: Not giving up sooner (again)</h3><p>But Students for High-Impact Charity eventually shut up shop - it had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L5t3EPnWSj7D3DpGt/high-school-ea-outreach\"><u>little impact as far as I could tell</u></a>. I should have come to that conclusion much earlier than I did. At the time I was keen to pivot the program to try something different, but we didn\u2019t have the funding (and current-Catherine probably wouldn\u2019t have funded a pivoted version either).&nbsp;</p><h3>Mistake 7: Over updating on a few rejections</h3><p>After stopping Students for High Impact Charity, I fell into some part time work for other projects of Rethink Charity (mostly the EA Hub,&nbsp;working on resources for EA groups), but that was always only going to be temporary.</p><p>I applied for a couple of grants to get paid for various EA projects that I had been doing as a volunteer, and I applied for two animal advocacy roles. But I wasn\u2019t successful. This felt pretty shit. I had worked really hard, but I felt \u201cEA\u201d wasn't \u201csupporting me\u201d. I think this was a really unfair characterisation, but it is what it felt like at the time. Then I worried I just wasn\u2019t very useful or worthy.&nbsp;</p><p>I still kept doing voluntary work, including continuing to work on my EA groups and helping to start&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.magnifymentoring.org/\"><u>Magnify Mentoring</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect it is crazy that I updated so much on only four rejections! Many people go for tons of roles before being successful or changing their plans. I'm a bit annoyed with myself that I was so dejected based on very little information.&nbsp;</p><h3>Fluke 2: Stumbling into a role at the Groups team at CEA</h3><p>I asked the Groups team if they were interested in funding me to keep working on resources for EA groups. But they instead decided to offer me a half time contracting position, in part because they heard I had been helpful to many people going through their EA journeys. Within weeks that became a full time contract, and later an employee role.&nbsp;</p><h3>Good call 6 (the best call): Doing what people I trusted thought would be most valuable</h3><p>At one point the Community Health team at CEA was very low in capacity, so I was asked to help out for a bit. It was difficult. It felt important. I felt underprepared. After a time, two of the people whose judgments I trust the most (the previously mentioned Julia Wise, and the team lead Nicole Ross) asked me to come full time onto the team. So I did.&nbsp;</p><p>I was careful in making my decision; weighing up all the considerations I could think of, getting advice from friends and colleagues, attempting to do all the expected value calculations and counterfactual reasoning. But in the end the clincher was that two people that I thought very highly of thought it was the right call. This sounds too defer-y but I think it made sense. I had spent enough time witnessing Julia and Nicole thinking and getting things done (live or through reading their work) to have a good sense of their judgement, they were sufficiently aware of my skills to know how I could bring value, and most importantly, they gave me the confidence and support to do hard things that I would not have previously dared to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0f3f71e2dnxa\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0f3f71e2dnxa\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>There are other reasons to focus recruitment on students and young professionals that I do buy.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnpotfo42guq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefpotfo42guq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Random quick googling gave me a variety of probably untrustworthy websites with claims that I\u2019m sceptical of and didn\u2019t check like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.apollotechnical.com/career-change-statistics/\"><u>most people will have 12 jobs during their lives</u></a>\u201d. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.apollotechnical.com/career-change-statistics/\"><u>As people get older they change jobs less and less</u></a>\u201d. \u201c<a href=\"https://novoresume.com/career-blog/career-change-statistics\"><u>The average person will change careers 5-7 times during their working life</u></a>\u201d</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "cafelow"}}, {"_id": "syvBpqYijtDSEyke6", "title": "Writing About My Job(s): Research Assistant at World Bank / IMF", "postedAt": "2023-09-15T19:44:06.210Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is actually about two distinct roles at international organizations. <strong>If there's one thing you take away from this, it's that Research Assistant roles at policy organizations can vary a lot!</strong></p><p>I'll abbreviate Research Assistant as RA throughout.</p><h1>My Current Role at World Bank DIME</h1><p>One is a job I currently hold as a RA at World Bank DIME, an impact evaluation and research unit. I assist on a research project whose ideal goal is publication in a top journal. This includes data cleaning, analysis, scripting, checking data quality, running regressions, offering suggestions in analysis calls, figuring out what the Principal Investigators want, and so forth. It\u2019s very close to an academic \u201cpredoc\u201d Research Assistant role that students do between undergrad / Master\u2019s programs and PhDs.</p><p>The project revolves around development economics and causal inference, with a focus on infrastructure and structural transformation. It\u2019s a blend of policy, research, development, impact evaluation and growth-adjacent topics.</p><h1>My Previous Role at International Monetary Fund (IMF)</h1><p>The other is a job I formerly held as a Research Assistant at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). I pilot-tested a software tool for better forecasting and data management. This included quality assurance testing, data migration, data entry, and scripting. My RA role was about as opposite from research as you could get and the tasks I was given was quite unconventional. The day-to-day was closer to that of a Quality Assurance Engineer or Data Engineer.</p><p>The project revolved around macroeconomics and international finance, with a focus on how to best organize data for scenario planning and technical assistance. It\u2019s a blend of public finance, debt sustainability, fiscal policies, natural resource policies, and international macro.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>I currently work at World Bank DIME, an impact evaluation and research unit. I've only been here a few months, starting from July 2023. Before that, I worked at the IMF for about a year. Prior to both roles, I did a Master\u2019s degree in International Economics and Finance at Johns Hopkins SAIS, a policy school in Washington DC. Before that, I was a Software Engineer for 4 years and before that I was teaching myself to code after a very unsuccessful post-college job search. I am strongly considering an academic career in economics and may apply to Econ PhDs next year. But I am also considering non-academic roles in development, and also PhDs in other fields like Public Policy, Statistics, and Political Economy.</p><p>I went into the Master\u2019s program after many unsuccessful attempts to switch into development work. I had no exact plan coming in but I chose this program in particular because of:</p><ul><li>It was a 1-year program, which meant less tuition and less foregone earnings.</li><li>International Economics sounded close enough to Development Economics that I thought I\u2019d be learning similar stuff. (It\u2019s very different! International Economics is more macro and finance. Development Economics is more applied micro and impact evaluation).</li><li>I saw my program had high placement rates in the IMF</li><li>I wanted to explore the \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-randomista-development\">working on growth is better than global health</a>\" argument a bit more and thought, \u201cWhat better way than by working on macroeconomics?\u201d</li></ul><p>At the time, I thought Econ PhDs didn\u2019t influence policy much, that they were beyond my abilities, and that I wouldn\u2019t really like it. All three turned out to be false once I started taking classes. While I was still interested in macro-finance policy, I found myself being more interested in the development research focus so I pivoted my focus towards that. In the Spring, I applied for a mix of academic and policy predocs. I landed the RA role at the IMF, found it wasn\u2019t the best fit for me, and then got the RA role at World Bank DIME where I\u2019m working now.</p><h1>Getting the Job</h1><p>That\u2019s a quick and stylized summary of the journey. Excluded here, mostly for my own sanity, is the hundreds of job rejections I faced over the past decade. There is a tremendous amount of luck, competition, and prestige-bias in getting a role like mine. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d recommend my own path to many others and if I knew how much time and energy it would take, I\u2019m unsure if I would have embarked in the first place.</p><p>There's a lot of information online about how to get an econ RA job (such as <a href=\"https://raguide.github.io/\">this one</a>) so I won't talk too much about this. But one thing I will emphasize is to apply very early. Start checking deadlines now if you're considering this for 2024 summer or fall. Even if you don\u2019t land a job in the Fall cycle, you\u2019ll have a better idea of what to do for the Spring hiring cycle. Interviewers evaluate you on some outside-the-classroom knowledge and judgment calls with their data tasks and interviews. Getting practice with these is useful.</p><p>Large agencies to tend have standardized procedures with early deadlines. (I missed the hiring cycles for the Federal Reserve Board and World Bank DIME deadlines in my first RA search.)&nbsp;</p><p>For the IMF, you submit a single job application that then gets viewed by multiple departments. If you already reside in the DC area, you can apply year-round. If you reside elsewhere, there\u2019s a deadline which I\u2019m less familiar with. If a department likes your application, they\u2019ll choose you for an interview. From there, it\u2019s up to the department how they conduct the process. My Master\u2019s degree is highly valued at the IMF, so I ended up with 5 different interviews in a single month. My classmates had similar stories.</p><p>The World Bank is decentralized in its hiring processes, so I don\u2019t know anything about how hiring works outside my unit. I know of two RAs who got their jobs through connections, one who was highly recommended by a SAIS professor and another who was highly recommended by a Fed Economist. My unit in particular does have a standardized hiring process and should be putting up applications soon.</p><h1>What is a (multilateral) Research Assistant anyways?</h1><p>In academia, a RA is someone who works under a professor for 1-3 years before doing a PhD. In economics, this includes data cleaning and exploratory analyses in service of an academic publication.&nbsp;</p><p>At policy organizations like think tanks, multilaterals, and government agencies, the role is still a time-limited role done before a PhD. But the responsibilities are broader and overlaps with \u201cpolicy\u201d. I put that in quotes because \u201cpolicy\u201d itself is a broad term but loosely speaking, you\u2019ll usually be assisting economists on data-oriented tasks that are more \u201coperationally relevant\u201d rather than \u201cpublication focused\u201d. (This wording is shamelessly stolen by a bureaucrat who prefaced they were trying to be delicate when asking me about my job.)</p><p>The upside is exposure to technocratic policy-making. Some lessons I\u2019ve learned:</p><ul><li>Success in policy is a function of how good you are at understanding a proposal\u2019s relation to dozens of crucial considerations (both in terms of people and the connotations of a choice). I was routinely awe-struck at how some middle managers could succinctly summarize how a choice would affect all of these in a few sentences. Having broad situational awareness is very helpful for coming up with solutions that handle tradeoffs well.<ul><li>Relationships matter a lot, even when the job is supposed to be quantitative.</li><li>Technical discussions are mostly about intuition and communication. Diving into details doesn\u2019t really happen unless you\u2019re in one-on-ones. And when it does happen, it\u2019s usually a fun dance between intuition and precision.</li><li>One example of connotations is saying you think development practitioners should focus more on economic growth. This tends to be an implicit critique of the global health and metrics focus. Now it\u2019s entirely consistent to think global health is the best way to spur economic growth! But that position is rarely expressed so you\u2019d have to pay extra attention to how you\u2019re communicating if this is your proposal.</li></ul></li><li>Things move slowly but once they stick, they stick around for a long time.</li><li>Publications don\u2019t have to be academically prestigious or rigorous to be influential. One example is the ad hoc reports that are tailored to individual countries. These doesn\u2019t make for great classroom discussion but it does help a government think about, say, a budgeting decision they need to make next month based on their messy incomplete data. Another example may be broad descriptive reports of a new monitoring tool to warn people of disasters. These are also faster to write. While there still may be a peer review process of some kind, it's not the slog that journal peer review is.<ul><li>Rachel Glennerster has a great blog post <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/02/11/policy-world-versus-academia/\">here</a> on the difference between policy research and academic research.</li></ul></li><li>Harmonious communication is crucial. Your career depends on gaining buy-in from a medium-sized pond that you swim in for the rest of your life. You only get to die on a hill a few times in your life. Depending on the issue, you might only get one hill to die on.</li><li>While I am still a \u201crandomnista\u201d and want more RCTs in the world, these roles did hammer home how many decisions need to be made \u201cwithout evidence\u201d. Clean statistics are hard to get, so not every question has a nice question. This is well-known in macroeconomics but it's also true in more \"applied micro\" questions. It's even true in easily testable interventions like cash transfers.</li></ul><p>The downside is that the analytical challenge and skill development of your job can vary a lot. This came as an enormous surprise in my IMF job. I figured that ~25% of my time would be on a policy research project of some kind. I ended up doing little of this, though partly this was because I never took any initiative to partner with an economist which was partly because I ended up not developing a strong interest in macro-finance. The project I was hired for did have an interesting mission, but ultimately didn't develop the skills I wanted.&nbsp;My current role at DIME has been the opposite of that.</p><p>Overall, I would frame policy RA roles as trading off between tasks that have \u201coperational relevance\u201d versus a \u201cpublications focus\u201d. If you care a lot about potentially having an ambitious academic career, you\u2019ll probably want to get a RA role with a \u201cpublications focus\u201d, as the PhD admissions process cares about letters from active researchers. These are much less common, as research departments are a small part of policy organizations and may not even exist in the first place. If you\u2019re feeling undecided on academic research or leaning more towards stuff with immediate relevance, you'll probably get better career development with the faster pace and quicker deadlines in roles leaning towards \u201coperational relevance\u201d.</p><p>That said, switching departments within an organization after a year or two or experience is doable, as you\u2019ll be a known quantity with less risk than an outside hire. However, this probably varies by organization and the role you want to switch into.&nbsp;</p><h1>Pros</h1><ul><li><strong>Autonomy&nbsp;</strong>Besides a few scheduled meetings and the expectation that I respond to Slack messages within a few hours, I have enormous flexibility in how I approach my work. I do try to adhere to a 30-60 hour work week but I take full advantage of shuffling these hours through the week.</li><li><strong>Flexibility in how much effort I put into the job</strong> Some RA jobs expect more of you than others but generally speaking, you have the choice between making it a basic 9-5 job or one where you dedicate a ton of time to it. I even know someone who intentionally puts in less time because they realized they wanted a career outside economics and policy and use that time for online classes. But understandably, they get more of the monotonous tasks at work.</li><li><strong>Academically stimulating work, coworkers and internal seminars</strong>. Even at the RA level, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities for networking, discussion, and a few occasional interesting problems. It's a nice intersection of policy-focused and research-focused topics.</li><li><strong>Working on important problems.</strong> It\u2019s weird finally being the one talking about my cool job. I\u2019ve been hearing about other people\u2019s jobs for years and now I get to be the one with a captive audience once in a while.</li><li><strong>Exposure to what a policy economist lifestyle would be like.</strong> Knowing this is an option if I strive for the tenure-track academic job and \u201cfail\u201d is psychologically useful.</li><li><strong>A wide range of solid exit options.</strong> This results from (1) a widely recognized name in the resume, and (2) training. Large organizations can offer standardized trainings that smaller organizations and one-on-one RA roles cannot.</li></ul><h1>Cons</h1><ul><li><strong>Loss of structure</strong>. The flip side to autonomy is needing to self-organize.This creates a lot of day-to-day uncertainty on if I\u2019m spending my time correctly and if I\u2019m prioritizing correctly. My managers at World Bank DIME and IMF have been supportive and responsive to emails, but it remains a role with very little oversight.<ul><li>This does serve a useful purpose. PhDs and academic careers require a lot of self-direction, so early exposure is good for skill development and discovery of whether you\u2019d like this lifestyle.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Slow bureaucracy and arcane rules</strong>. Stuff moves very slow and I will occasionally get sidetracked by an infuriating process that nobody understands. And from what my colleagues told me, I've already been exposed to the top end of efficiency in international organizations at the IMF.</li><li><strong>Location inflexibility if I strive for academia</strong>. Budding academics go to where they get admitted for the PhD and then where they get their job offer (assuming they get either in the first place). I have an insanely good support network in DC so relocating would be an enormous sacrifice.</li><li><strong>Lower wages and benefits for a while</strong>. I make okay-to-good money right now (~$50,000 in World Bank, ~$80,000 in IMF), but it\u2019s definitely a lot lower than what I could be making. And if / when I start my PhD, I\u2019ll be getting a smaller stipend. When I finish the PhD, I\u2019ll have a very good salary. But there\u2019s definitely a period of reduced financial earnings. I've been keeping intentionally not paying off some student loans so I have some extra money to use during the low periods.</li><li><strong>Impact uncertainty.</strong> People don\u2019t get good indicators of how good they are at research until maybe the end of the PhD. Even if I turn out to be amazing at research, it will still be the case that most of my findings are useless. There\u2019s a large iteration process to finding something novel and impactful. And even after that, there\u2019s still replication, generalizability, scalability, and implementation. This makes research very disconnected from the end result of social impact.</li><li><strong>Elitism and Lack of Diversity.</strong> I have some complicated feelings about this that I'm still figuring out. So I won't go into detail. But I'll say quickly this has overall been a negative for me ever since I started the Master's program.</li></ul><h1>Skills Developed</h1><ul><li><strong>Time Management</strong> I have a manager on paper but it\u2019s a very self-directed role with many competing priorities and many stakeholders. It is rarely the case that I have a hard deadline. Motivating myself, creating mini-deadlines, and managing the emotional swings is something I am constantly working on.</li><li><strong>Managing Up</strong> Since the time of Principal Investigators is scarce, I\u2019ve paid increasingly close attention to what people say in the few meetings I have with them. It\u2019s also made me better at initiating 1-on-1s and raising issues in a concise way. Additionally, I'm learning to manage the trade-off between more frequent low-quality discussion versus less frequent high-quality discussion. I haven\u2019t always gotten these decisions right and I still have a lot of room for improvement. But I\u2019ve definitely improved.</li><li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> In data work, there\u2019s potentially hundreds of choices of what I can do at any given moment. The choice of where you should be laser-focused and where you should just get the gist of it is tricky. I can spend a ton of time verifying the data quality today. Or I can clean this other data set and get quick descriptive statistics there. This is another trade-off I have to decide on regularly.</li><li><strong>Statistical Writing and Communication:</strong> I do formal presentations on analytical results to Principal Investigators on a somewhat regular basis (1-3x a month) and informal discussions on blockers more frequently. It\u2019s been both a skill and challenge to pick out the right regression table formatting and data visualization configuration.</li><li><strong>Learning to Express Disagreements</strong>: Economics has an unusual culture in how people can disagree with each other. This is strongly encouraged of juniors as well. I play-acted this style for a while over small disagreements at first while feeling like it wasn't that big of a deal. Then I actually felt like something was wrong and struggled to articulate it. Then I finally got to a point where I could sense discrepancies and express them.</li></ul><p>Overall, I love my job. I\u2019ve found the pros to outweigh the cons. While my job is not yet leading research, my experience feels very similar to what Kevin Kuruc described in his blog post, \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yFLc9ZqmQPGaQJ5ro/writing-about-my-job-economics-professor\">Writing about my job: Economics Professor</a>\". (I also reused a lot of wording and formatting from that post.) Being able to shift around my work hours as needed is a big perk and I don\u2019t have much of a taste for things that require money. I also find I\u2019m developing more transferable career capital (that is, skills that would be good in other roles) than I initially thought. Mostly, that's liking the job a lot, wanting to be very good at it, and thus trying to excel at the soft skills that every job benefits from.</p><h1>What about the impact?</h1><p>My current philosophy to careers is building skills and experience since most people have their biggest social impact in their mid-to-late career. High personal fit means this is plausibly where I\u2019d have the most impact even though I'm highly uncertain on the value of research (and academic research in particular).&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, I\u2019m also realizing the skills that help me succeed in empirical research also would help me elsewhere. These projects are increasingly done in large teams where partnerships, initiative, and a general entrepreneurial spirit is useful. The world in which I'd good at this kind of research is probably also a world where I'd be good at working / founding a startup. There's also returning to software engineering doing direct work and/or earning-to-give.</p><p>But for now, I\u2019m spending the next 1-2 years being the best at my job as I possibly can and doing some informational interviews to see what other options there are for me.</p><h1>Contact Me</h1><p>I am more than happy to give advice.

But what does it mean to do politics with animals, particularly wild animals?</p><p>Will begins with two recent proposals in the literature. The first focuses on the institutional representation of animals\u2019 interests in human political decision-making processes. The second focuses on the growing ethological evidence that wild animals have their own sophisticated capacities for collective decision making, and proposes that they should be seen as forming their own self-determining communities.</p><p>While both of these proposals are important, neither offers an account of politics as something that humans and animals do together, of how humans and animals can co-author shared norms about shared spaces. Will concludes with some speculations about what joint human-animal politics might look like, including ideas about how humans and other animals can jointly govern an interspecies commons.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the speaker</strong></p><p>Will Kymlicka is the Canada Research Chair in Political Philosophy in the Philosophy Department at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada, where he has taught since 1998.

Given a single descriptive premise, a normative premise is semantically entailed.</p><h3>Prior\u2019s Dilemma</h3><p>The dilemma give by A.N. Prior is as follows:</p><ol><li>Tea Drinking is common in England.</li><li>Therefore, Tea Drinking is common in England or all New-Zealanders ought be shot.</li></ol><p>This inference is valid in classical logic using the inferential rule Disjunctive Addition. I think we would agree that (1) is descriptive. Now consider the following dilemma. Either &nbsp;(2) is normative or descriptive. If it's normative this inference is a violation of the gap. If it's descriptive consider the following deduction:</p><ol><li>Tea Drinking is common in England or all New-Zealanders ought be shot.</li><li>Tea Drinking is not common in England</li><li>Therefore, all New-Zealanders ought be shot.</li></ol><p>This inference is valid in classical logic using the inferential rule Disjunctive Syllogism. Both (1) and (2) are descriptive, and (3) is normative. This would be a violation of the gap. The general form of Prior's dilemma is as follows: Let D refer to a descriptive proposition and N a normative proposition.</p><ol><li>D</li><li>Therefore, D or N</li></ol><p>(D or N) is either descriptive or normative, if normative it's a violation of the gap, if descriptive the following inference is a violation:</p><ol><li>D or N</li><li>Not D</li><li>therefore N&nbsp;</li></ol><h3>Explosion</h3><p>I'll be the first to admit this counter-example is kind of cheeky, but it would constitute a violation of the Gap. Let D be a descriptive premise (and by extension Not D is descriptive). Consider the following inference:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;D and Not D</li><li>therefore N</li></ol><p>Where N is normative. Now I'll be the first to admit, this inference isn't sound. But Explosion is a valid inference, and serves as a counter-example to the is-ought gap as we've construed it.</p><h3>Logical Truths</h3><p>Consider a deontic logic with a standard Kripke Semantic. Recall the Obligatory operator is closed under Logical consequence. This is to say that if OA is true and that A entails B, that OB is true. Given that logical truths are logically entailed by everything, it follow that all logical truths are obligatory. Consider the following:</p><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"q \\models Op \\lor \\neg Op\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em; padding-right: 0.014em;\">q</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">\u22a8</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">O</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">p</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">\u2228</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u00ac</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">O</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p>This would seem to be a violation of the gap.</p><h3>Non-Formal Counter-Examples</h3><p>There are a list of purported counter-examples that are given in Natural language by opponents of the Gap.

In what sense could we defend it? We should explicate Hume\u2019s gap. To do so we should first ask, what does it mean for a sentence to be normative? T. Karmo<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref55ed7l6a42t\"><sup><a href=\"#fn55ed7l6a42t\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;gives us an answer, what it means for a sentence to be normative is for its truth value to be dependent upon the normative standards. That is to say, we would expect normative sentences to be the sentences that are breakable (truth value changes) with changes in the normative standards. That\u2019s still unclear but a step in the right to direction. To clarify this, Gillian Russell constructs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxqkwvt7k96m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxqkwvt7k96m\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;a Deontic Modal Logic called DML. The primitive expressions of DML consist of the modal operators of necessity and possibility, the deontic operators of obligation and permission, and sentence letters. The DML model is a tuple:</p><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\langle W, S, @, I \\rangle\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

Disputes over the is-ought gap is an approach certain realists and anti-realists go to. Establishing a limited normative barrier seems to limit the realist to abduction over philosophical datum as their methodological approach in metaethics.</p><p>To finish this, I want to point to an insight that Russell has<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefju62oa1cg9h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnju62oa1cg9h\">[5]</a></sup></span>. Barriers like Hume\u2019s Law as commonly constructed may serve as intuitive and accessible rules of reasoning classified as \u201cFolk Logic\u201d. Similar to claims of the inability to prove negative claims, they are intuitive claims that over-state the truth. Formal logic shows such claims to be incorrect and hyperbolic. We can prove negatives, for example a proof that there are no square circles is trivial. The insight however is that there is more difficulty in proving negative claims, which is probably true despite being over-stated. The same can be said for Hume\u2019s law.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn55ed7l6a42t\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref55ed7l6a42t\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/KARSVB\">https://philpapers.org/rec/KARSVB</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnxqkwvt7k96m\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefxqkwvt7k96m\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/RUSHTP-2\">https://philpapers.org/archive/RUSHTP-2</a> p. 22</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnu1qfqrleuan\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefu1qfqrleuan\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>ibid, p. 12</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fns775bcfgg4\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefs775bcfgg4\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>You can find the variety of these barrier proofs in her paper.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnju62oa1cg9h\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefju62oa1cg9h\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>ibid, p. 28</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Azad Ellafi"}}, {"_id": "rigxWZcSEX3QQWPQk", "title": "About My Job: Staff Support Associate", "postedAt": "2023-09-15T14:00:11.532Z", "htmlBody": "<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p>I\u2019ve been working for around a year and a half on the Operations team at <a href=\"https://ev.org/\">Effective Ventures</a>, on the Staff Support team. This has been an incredible rollercoaster of experiences, with wonderful colleagues and many lessons learned. I often reflect on how differently the past few years might have gone if I hadn\u2019t taken a chance on a role I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be good at. I\u2019m glad I did! It\u2019s given me a much broader perspective on how different organisations within EA run, allowed me to meet and support so many kind and impactful people, and given me the space to grow and develop skills I didn\u2019t know I had.</p><p>We are <strong>hiring someone to join our Staff Support team for a similar role</strong>. If you\u2019re interested, please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ev.org/ops/position/us-hr-legal-operations-associate/\">apply here</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:careers@ev.org\">get in touch</a>&nbsp;with <a href=\"mailto:careers@ev.org\">careers@ev.org</a> if you have questions.</p><p>We are also hiring for two roles on our US legal team: <a href=\"https://ev.org/ops/position/us-general-counsel/\">US General Counsel</a> and <a href=\"https://ev.org/ops/position/us-assistant-general-counsel/\">US Assistant General Counsel</a>.</p><h3><strong>The Job</strong></h3><p>As an HR Associate, my role, broadly, has been:</p><ul><li>To manage the process, administration and bookkeeping of onboarding and offboarding of employees and contractors, ensuring these were smooth and positive for the employees and that they had all the relevant information and support</li><li>To oversee the payroll processes for US and UK employees, incorporating salary changes, bonuses, leave and expenses</li><li>Miscellaneous systems administration and requests (e.g. Google Workspace, Notion, Slack), responding to HR questions on Slack, staff data reports, verification letters, pension opt-outs\u2026</li></ul><p>The job wasn\u2019t quite what I expected. A few surprises included:</p><ul><li><strong>The company structure</strong></li></ul><p>Until my first day, I thought I would be working at \u201clittle CEA\u201d, i.e. the current Centre for Effective Altruism, rather than the legal entity, eventually renamed Effective Ventures. In practice, this meant that instead of taking on an HR role for one organisation, I quickly discovered that I would actually be supporting the HR operations for around 150 employees across 11 different EA organisations. Luckily for me, this made the role more interesting, complex and challenging than I had expected.</p><ul><li><strong>The ownership and responsibilities</strong></li></ul><p>I was pleasantly surprised by how much ownership I was able to take of projects in this role. I was presented with the challenge of creating a workflow to efficiently track and execute the onboarding of around 10 employees per month across the different organisations, each with slightly different system access requirements and onboarding needs. I was managed by the Head of Staff Support, who would give direction, advice and feedback when requested, but otherwise it was empowering to be given the space to create a system from the ground up. The role slowly incorporated more processes, until I was tracking not only the joining experience, but the entire employee (and contractor) life-cycle from first day to last, and the various developments along their journey.</p><p>A year and a half later, most of the steps that I started off doing manually (creating contracts and modifications, drafting welcome emails, creating calendar events and reminders to managers, etc.) I have now been able to automate using a web of interacting automations on Zapier (a no-code automation software). If you work in operations, I can\u2019t recommend Zapier enough.</p><ul><li><strong>That HR is neither evil nor boring</strong></li></ul><p>Going into the role, I knew that there would be a large administrative aspect. I was prepared to seek motivation from the \u2018multiplier effect\u2019 impact alone, and to possibly reach an excitement plateau pretty quickly. But I was wrong on both accounts. As well as finding purpose and value in saving many people a lot of time on work that they would find tedious or time-consuming, I found the work itself satisfying and engaging. Interacting with lovely, time-pressed people everyday, I was surprised and heart-warmed by how appreciative people are for a question to be simply answered or a task to be taken off their plate. I started to notice patterns and would continuously tweak instructions and our Handbook wording to make information easier to find in the future. My understanding of the intricacies of UK and US payroll systems grew; how pension and payroll interact; how maternity leave, probation and dismissals work. I started to understand how various processes fit together and was able to problem-solve when something went wrong. I learned how much of a difference it makes to an employee\u2019s ability to focus on their work when they know that the technical aspects of their employment have been taken care of, and that they have an easy way to ask questions and seek advice.</p><h3><strong>My Background</strong></h3><ul><li>I studied Experimental Psychology for my undergrad</li><li>I taught English as a foreign language in various countries (Spain, Vietnam, Cambodia)</li><li>I worked as an executive assistant to the (eccentric) director of a boutique sunglasses company</li><li>For 6 months, I volunteered as a researcher/script/audio editor/narrator for a then-new podcast that explores the biological underpinnings of suffering and its ethical/moral implications - Invincible Wellbeing</li><li>After officially deciding that a) I wanted to work in EA and b) that my skillset seemed to fit the \u2018generalist\u2019 description, I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Fahv9knHhPi6pWPEB/don-t-think-just-apply-usually\">applied for around 30</a> entry-level operations roles across the spectrum of EA (an excellent crash-course in organisations and cause areas!), and found myself at Effective Ventures (UK).</li></ul><h3><strong>Day in the life</strong></h3><p>Certain days in a given month will follow a routine, e.g. if it\u2019s the day to run any of the four different payrolls, it will involve a fair amount of collecting information on new joiners and pending leavers, checking data, downloading expense reports, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Other days will usually be a patchwork of small to medium-sized tasks, and some work on a more long-term project (e.g. exploring different service providers or writing up instructions to make our internal processes more \u2018bus-proof\u2019).</p><p>My first hour of the day, I usually spend scanning my email and Slack for requests and updates; executing any small-and-urgent tasks (e.g. re-setting a Gmail password if someone is locked out, replying to a question if it\u2019s bottlenecking someone), and writing a plan for the day of tasks I want to prioritise.&nbsp;</p><p>I track my tasks on Trello, in lists called things like \u2018This week\u2019, \u2018Optimistically This Week\u2019 \u2018Today\u2019, and \u2018<i>Actually</i> Today\u2019 - in ops work, I\u2019ve found that the to-do lists never really get shorter; they just get more complex. As do my methods of trying to complete them all.</p><p>I have the most energy and creativity in the mornings, so I try to use the next few hours to do deep work on a project I\u2019m currently working on. This could be, for example, brainstorming and creating a new Zapier automation based on a problem I want to solve (e.g. streamlining job update requests, notifying relevant parties and propagating these changes across different databases); updating onboarding instruction templates; or writing up communications and recommendations for a nuanced HR situation.</p><p>After lunch and for the rest of the day, I will complete as many of my prioritised tasks as I can, some related to onboarding or offboarding; answering questions on Slack, sometimes communicating with the rest of the Staff Support team or other Ops team members to problem-solve; responding to data requests, etc.</p><p>Here is a random selection of small tasks that I completed last week:</p><ul><li>Create and send an employment verification letter for an employee applying for a Schengen visa</li><li>Calculate the remaining leave to be paid out for an employee who is leaving next month</li><li>Email our payroll provider with a question about taxation on different types of expenses</li><li>Create a work email address for a new joiner and add them to relevant email groups</li><li>Remind a line manager that their direct report will come to the end of their contract soon, and ask whether they want this contract to be extended (send the draft email that was created automatically)</li><li>Answer a question on Slack to explain the process and timeline for option out of a pension</li><li>Ask our legal team a question regarding data privacy and how this applies to sharing certain types of information within our organisation.</li><li>Upload a signed salary modification letter and make a note about the change on our HRS</li><li>Update someone\u2019s leave allowance and salary according to a change in working hours</li></ul><p>Sprinkle in a handful of meetings across the week - with my manager, the Staff Support team, new joiners, pending leavers, employment lawyers, organisation\u2019s ops liaisons, payroll providers, and collaborating team members - and you can get a picture of the life of a Staff Support Associate at EV.</p><h3>Some downsides of the job</h3><p><strong>Small</strong> <strong>Task overload</strong></p><p>As I said, no two days are the same, and any given day will depend on what is most pressing.</p><p>This has its advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I find that days often speed by - a bit like working in a busy restaurant where you\u2019re rushed off your feet: the variety and number of tasks completed in a day keep things interesting, and I usually feel accomplished at the progress I\u2019ve made at the end of a given day. One downside to the nature of this work is that my time doesn\u2019t always feel like my own - my day is sculpted by the requests of others, and can sometimes feel reactive rather than proactive. I have to intentionally block time for longer, less urgent projects, lest they fall to the bottom of a to-do list. And when doing a meatier task, there is always the risk of getting distracted by the tempting pile of small, easy and satisfying tasks that give a burst of serotonin upon completion.</p><p><strong>Mistakes are more visible than successes</strong></p><p>It\u2019s a common complaint about ops work, but still worth noting - that often, the status quo (where things are all working smoothly), or even big improvements in a system, aren't given much attention, but a small mistake quickly becomes glaringly apparent.</p><p><strong>Being the middle-man messenger</strong></p><p>The nature of the role involves a lot of being the go-between in various conversations to save other employees time. This can include, for example, fielding questions to another department of the Ops team and relaying the response, calling our health insurance provider on behalf of an employee, or relaying payslip questions to our payroll provider. This can be frustrating at times, particularly if the response of one person is bottlenecking the action of the other, or if one/both sides have clarifying questions that eventually tip the balance from 'useful information broker' to \u2018you should probably just discuss this with each other directly.\u2019</p><h3><strong>Skills developed</strong></h3><p><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> This role has certainly developed my ability to look at various processes from above, see how they interact, and build structures to enable these processes to fit together more efficiently. To me, systems thinking is about deeply understanding a process, its bottlenecks, possible pathways and outcomes, and coming up with creative ways to interlock these in a way that the end result requires minimal manual input, friction and space for error.</p><p>When a new problem or challenge arises, the system may need to adapt to incorporate new elements, and the consequences on the entire process need to be considered.</p><p>An example of the need to build a new system that would fit in to our current flow was with our hiring process - it was decided that new hire requests should go through a pre-approval process to ensure different stakeholders could ensure that certain requirements had been fulfilled (budgets and immigration compliance in this case). This posed the challenge of creating a system that would ask stakeholders for approval in a way that required minimal manual input from both me and the stakeholders to save capacity, and wouldn't keep hiring managers waiting. I eventually achieved this after lots of trial and error, continuous tweaks and updates, and a combination of 6 multi-layer Zapier automations that connect a google form and two spreadsheets with email and slack.</p><p><strong>Efficiency mindset:</strong> I learned early on that, although I\u2019m not as averse to admin as most people, I don\u2019t like to spend time unnecesarily on repetitive tasks. Simple efficiency tools like the text expanders (I use Textblaze), Slack and Gmail shortcuts, Trello automations and window organisers (e.g. Moom) have saved me more hours than I\u2019d like to imagine, and this role has me primed to incorporate these wherever I can.</p><p>Similarly, when faced with a pile of tasks, prioritising efficiently is key - assessing the value and/or urgency according to current projects and bigger-picture goals, breaking tasks down to help reduce bottlenecks for myself and others, and playing to my own energy patterns have all helped me to keep on top of my tasks and goals.</p><p><strong>Problem-solving:</strong> The role has definitely involved more \u2018fire-fighting\u2019 than I expected. When working with lots of moving parts and lots of humans who can make mistakes (including myself), a large part of the role has been quickly assessing a problem, finding it\u2019s cause, solving the issue, and, in some cases, identifying any flaw in our systems that allowed such an error to arise.</p><p>Learning to loudly own up to my own mistakes and actively track them in order to continuously design better systems has been a personal growth milestone.</p><p>Mistakes happen, and in Staff Support one error can have lots of knock-on effects. This has really pushed us as a team to keep improving systems to avoid similar errors and \u2018red team\u2019 ideas - thinking about scenarios where New Idea X or New System Y goes wrong. Even so, many things are out of our control, and problems will always pop up; so keeping calm in the face of \u2018fire\u2019 is essential in a role like this.</p><p><strong>Communication</strong>: A large part of this role is communication - within the team to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that nothing has fallen through the cracks. With ops contacts from different organisations to communicate policy changes or arrange updates to salaries. With individual joiners to ensure they feel welcomed, supported and informed from before their first day and throughout their employment. Part of the challenge of this role has been in finding the balance between friendly and efficient, informative and concise, thorough and quick.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Overall, working as an associate on the staff support team has been a great experience, with many curve balls and opportunities for learning and professional growth. I\u2019ve met passionate and kind people across various EA organisations, and had the joy of making their days run a little bit smoother.</p><p>If you\u2019re interested in joining the EV Ops team, check out our open positions <a href=\"https://ev.org/ops/careers/\">here</a>.</p><p><i>Thanks to Jana and Jonathan for your comments and suggestions!</i></p>", "user": {"username": "Phoebe F Freidin"}}, {"_id": "4qMC5c4Y7g3yJQJe8", "title": "How to manage up using these delegation tips", "postedAt": "2023-09-15T11:06:47.979Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I've heard that if you've said something twice, you should write it down.

I've set up a substack called 'Said Twice' to practice writing (feedback is very welcome!!) and to have a place where I can write down things I've said at least twice. The <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/career-conversations-week-2023\">Career conversations week </a>on the forum gave me the final push to actually finish some drafts and publish them here and <a href=\"https://saidtwice.substack.com/\">on my substack</a>. This is my second post, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2iFfx99CbHC45oC4R/four-productivity-techniques-if-you-love-working-with-others\">see here for my first one</a>!</p><p>--</p><p>Managing up can be worth the investment if you want to demonstrate or practice your management skills but don\u2019t have direct reports of your own, or if you\u2019re currently not getting what you need from your own manager. By managing up, I mean proactively helping your manager to achieve your goals. In many roles, managing up might also just be part of your job \u2014 it certainly is in my current role as chief of staff and previously as executive assistant, where I\u2019m trying to take on as many of my manager\u2019s tasks as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>I also have experience being on the other side of this: The more my employees \u201cmanage up\u201d or help me delegate to them, the more responsibility I\u2019ve given them and it also broadens the scope of what I think they could do in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three practices related to delegation that I find useful when thinking about managing up and supporting my employees:</p><h2><strong>1. Your manager's small tasks become your big tasks</strong></h2><p>Even though it may seem like a small task when your manager is doing it, unless you\u2019ve done it many times yourself, it will be a big task for you. <a href=\"https://www.manager-tools.com/\"><u>Manager Tools</u></a> have a useful image for this: Imagine all your manager's tasks as different sized balls. The bigger the ball, the more complex and time consuming that task is for your manager. Very often, the type of task you're delegated will be your manager's smaller balls which often don't require their particular skills and they've come to the conclusion that they should focus on something bigger and more complex.&nbsp;</p><p>The important thing about this is that when that smaller task is given to you it becomes a big and complex ball. This means that, compared to when your manager is doing the task, you will have to spend longer on the task, you'll need more support, and you might have to use tools to help you. Your manager might just use thirty minutes to do the task, when it takes you three hours. The more you do the task, the smaller it becomes, until it becomes a small enough ball that you also spend thirty minutes on, or perhaps even automate or delegate to someone else.</p><p>Getting a new big and complex ball will also push out other balls because you only have so much space. When you get a task from your manager, you need to carve out sufficient time to do the task and identify what type of support and tools you need. This may mean pausing, delegating, or altogether removing one or more of your other tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>It also means identifying the type of support you need, which I\u2019ll talk about next.</p><h2><strong>2. Identify what type of support and direction you will need from your manager</strong></h2><p>A useful concept when thinking about delegation is <a href=\"https://medicine.hofstra.edu/pdf/faculty/facdev/facdev-clinical-blanchard.pdf\"><u>situational leadership</u></a>, which entails adapting the level of support and direction an employee receives for every new project or task. You can see a simplified quadrant below which shows the four different combinations of supportiveness and direction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:72.68%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4qMC5c4Y7g3yJQJe8/zkduusxhwcorvazqosif\" alt=\"An illustration of a quadrant with two axis. The x axis is Directive behavior going from low to high. The y axis is Supportive behavior going from low to high. High directive behavior and low supportive behavior is S1: Directing. High directive behavior and high supportive behavior is S2: Coaching. Low directive behavior and high supportive behavior is S3: Supporting. Low directive behavior and low supportive behavior is S4: Delegating.\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Figure_of_Situational_Leadership.jpg\"><i><u>Ftsn, CC BY-SA 4.0</u></i></a><i>, via Wikimedia Commons</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the one axis we have directive behaviour, or to what extent your manager is telling you how to complete the project. On the other axis there\u2019s supportive behaviour, which means to what extent your manager engages in two-way communication with you and supports you with the project. Which of the squares is most appropriate will vary depending on the project or task at hand. To understand the quadrant above, let\u2019s use the example of sending out multiple similar emails to 20-50 people.</p><p>Projects in \u201cS1: Directing\u201d are types of projects where the manager tells you exactly what to do, and you execute the tasks. These are often projects where you can follow a strict checklist, and where you\u2019re not expected to make any decisions yourself. Using our example, in this instance your manager would make a template and create a list of who to email, and you would copy the templates to email drafts, and make sure everyone on the list is sent an email.&nbsp;</p><p>For projects in \u201cS2: Coaching\u201d, your manager still gives directions and makes the final decisions, but she asks you for input. This often entails having checkpoints or meetings whenever there\u2019s a decision to be made. You can provide options and suggestions for what steps to take, but your manager will make the final call. In this case, maybe the manager asks you to draft a few example templates and brainstorm a list of who to send it to, and then she makes edits to and approves the final template and mailing list.&nbsp;</p><p>In projects in \u201cS3: Supporting\u201d, you\u2019re the one making the decisions, but will ask your manager for input. These are usually projects that you have some experience with, but there are multiple decision points where it\u2019s important for your manager to be involved. To solve our example task, perhaps you have a meeting with your manager where you ask her what the goals are for the emails and the types of people that should be on the mailing list. You might also share the template and mailing list that you\u2019ve drafted with her, not to get her sign-off but to someone else\u2019s eyes on it and see if there\u2019s anything you might\u2019ve missed.</p><p>Projects in \u201cS4: Delegating\u201d are completely delegated to you \u2014 you make the decisions, and aren\u2019t required to check in with your manager throughout the project. These are projects where you have substantive prior experience, and your manager doesn\u2019t need to be involved. In this case, the manager isn\u2019t really involved other than for example being told whether you\u2019re on track and when the emails have been sent.</p><p>It\u2019s important that you and your manager have a shared understanding of which square the particular project you\u2019re working on is in: How will your manager be involved? Who makes the decisions? How much direction will your manager give? If you\u2019re unsure which square the project should be in, it\u2019s generally better to start off with more support and direction, and then move along onto less support and direction as you get on, following the arrow in the illustration above.</p><h2>3. If your manager doesn\u2019t have the relevant experience, get support from someone who has</h2><p>Sometimes, you\u2019ll be delegated or proactively take on a task that your manager doesn\u2019t have experience with themselves. In these cases, I recommend trying to get support from others with relevant experience. Either on your own or together with your manager, you can start by first identifying the particular skills or expertise needed for the project, and then generate ideas for where you can get what you need. Is there someone at another org who is doing similar tasks? Perhaps there are online courses, or a book you can read and learn from? Could you ask someone to be a coach, for example through <a href=\"https://www.magnifymentoring.org/\"><u>Magnify Mentoring</u></a> or other EA coaches, or coaches outside of EA?&nbsp;</p><p>In my experience, people are surprisingly open to help out, and there will very often be something in a podcast or book that can help you. If I need help with something related to operations or management, my first step is usually to look it up on <a href=\"https://www.manager-tools.com/\"><u>Manager Tools</u></a> \u2014 like they say themselves, there\u2019s usually \u201ca \u2018cast for that\u201d, meaning they have a <a href=\"https://www.manager-tools.com/all-podcasts\"><u>podcast episode</u></a> covering the topic. (I\u2019ll flag that their advice is very centred around middle management at companies in the US, and so you have to adapt what they say to your own situation.)</p><p>I\u2019ll also frequently reach out to experts to ask for their advice, or if they have any policies or how-tos. Up until recently, I\u2019ve had regular meetings with coaches with relevant ops and management experience. That was very helpful, and is where I first learned about situational leadership. My first coach was someone who had a type of job that I wanted someday, that I reached out to myself. I\u2019ve also had a mentor through Magniy Mentoring, and am also a mentor there myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Identifying skills needed and people to talk to should also be part of your project description template, if you have one of those. I might talk more about that and provide a template another time!</p><hr><p>Using these best practices in delegation isn\u2019t the only way to practice managing up, but I\u2019ve found them particularly useful. I often return to the image of all my responsibilities being smaller or bigger balls when thinking about my task load, and try to remember that the further down that ball goes in the organisational hierarchy, the bigger and more complex it gets. The situational leadership framework helps me figure out how much direction and support I need on a particular project, and is useful to manage expectations between me and my employees, or me and my manager, about how often and what areas we need to check in with each other about. Lastly, reaching out to experts or getting advice from my coaches have greatly helped me making those big and complex tasks smaller and more manageable. It\u2019s also made me more deeply understand the phrase \u201cstanding on the shoulders of giants\u201d, which I\u2019m fortunate to do very often.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntrhj55urx3d\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftrhj55urx3d\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>By 'operations' I mean project management and administrative work.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "eirine"}}, {"_id": "2iFfx99CbHC45oC4R", "title": "Four productivity techniques if you love working with others but work alone", "postedAt": "2023-09-15T11:01:49.489Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I've heard that if you've said something twice, you should write it down.

I\u2019m the most focused and have my best ideas when talking out loud, and I often rely on others to hold myself accountable. However, I work on a small team where we have each our own separate responsibilities, and so most of the time I work alone. The past five years I\u2019ve found some workarounds that I thought I\u2019d share. I use them daily at my job to cover parts of what I enjoy about working with others: talking through difficult issues out loud with someone else, building on each other\u2019s ideas through brainwriting, delegating tasks that I find hard to do myself, and being held accountable by others.</p><h2><strong>1. Have meetings with myself (ideally walking)</strong></h2><p>Whenever I get stuck on something, or notice I'm struggling to wrap my head around a difficult issue, I schedule a meeting with myself. Most often, this means I go on a walk with my over-ear headphones and talk out loud, pretending I'm on a meeting call with someone else. If you worry less about what others think of you, you can of course do it without the headphones.&nbsp;</p><p>I start the walking meeting by stating the purpose: \u201cWhy are me and myself meeting?\u201d, \u201cWhat are we hoping to get out of it?\u201d. Sometimes it\u2019s not clear what the purpose of the walk is, and in those cases I start with the questions: \u201cWhat\u2019s on my mind at the moment?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s holding me back from making more progress on the projects I\u2019m working on?\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>I then talk around the chosen topic(s), while I summarise the progress I make throughout the walk. I end the meeting by stating what we've decided and any next steps, which I write down as soon as I come back from the walk.&nbsp;</p><p>I prefer using a familiar route for these meeting walks, so that I'm not distracted by having to find the way or look at new things. The walks last between 10-45 minutes, depending on how much me and myself have to talk about. I sometimes just talk to myself in the office or at my desk when I\u2019m working from home, but I find that I\u2019m more easily distracted inside \u2014 especially if I have my computer in front of me.</p><p>A very similar concept is <a href=\"https://rubberduckdebugging.com/\"><u>rubber duck debugging</u></a>, which you might be familiar with. This is more common for people working in tech where e.g. someone developing a program will go through their code line by line to figure out where the bug is, talking out loud to a rubber duck sitting on their desk. I personally have a crocheted turtle that my sister gave me that I use for this purpose:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:49.55%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2iFfx99CbHC45oC4R/jmfuzhpcgq5wvgwakjwv\" alt=\"Photo of a small crocheted turtle on a desk\"></figure><h2><strong>2. Brainstorm (or -write) with myself</strong></h2><p>If I want to brainstorm ideas or options, and don't have anyone to do it with, I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xRyXfJrwXkJ8mwc96/doing-brainstorming-better\"><u>brainwrite</u></a>. I do this for all kinds of tasks, and of different sizes. I\u2019ll sometimes use it when I feel stuck with how to respond to an email. I\u2019ve also used it for identifying possible goals and metrics for my work or our team. I mostly do it on paper or use my <a href=\"https://remarkable.com/\"><u>reMarkable</u></a>, but you can also do it in Word or Google Docs.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\u2019s how I brainwrite with myself:</p><ol><li>Identify the exact topic I want more ideas on or options for.</li><li>Create a mind map with the chosen topic in the middle.</li><li>Set a timer for 2-5 minutes, and write down as many ideas as I can.</li><li>Take a short break, e.g. get something to drink, walk around the block, go to the bathroom, do some stretches.</li><li>Do a second round of 2-5 minutes where I either build on my previous ideas, e.g. add more details, or write down new ideas.</li><li>When the time is up, if I feel like I have more ideas and thoughts, I\u2019ll do a third round with another short break in between.</li></ol><p>There are two important benefits to this technique. Firstly, setting a timer gives me some pressure and reduces the risk of spending too much time on the task. I also find that I produce more ideas through having a time pressure, as it lowers the stakes or amount of time I can spend to think whether it\u2019s a good idea or not. Secondly, taking a break before adding new ideas allows me to reset my mind, and I find that it increases the chances of me coming up with additional ideas if I had just done it in one go.</p><h2><strong>3. Delegate to my other selves</strong></h2><p>I sometimes think of myself as three different people at work:</p><ul><li>\u201cMorning Eirin\u201d who is confident, find it easy to make decisions, and can take on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/ugh-fields-or-why-you-can-t-even-bear-to-think-about-that-task-5941837dac62\"><u>ughy</u></a> or difficult tasks.</li><li>\u201cPost lunch Eirin\u201d who is easily distracted and is great at doing menial and small tasks.</li><li>\u201cAfternoon Eirin\u201d who gets in deep work-mode and can work on the same thing for hours.</li></ul><p>I find it useful to \"delegate'' different types of tasks to these three different versions of myself. If there\u2019s a difficult email or a decision I need to make that I\u2019m not sure about, I\u2019ll leave it to \u201cMorning Eirin\u201d to figure out \u2014 she\u2019s a lot more decisive and assertive. If I have multiple easy emails or admin tasks, I\u2019ll assign them to \u201cPost lunch Eirin\u201d who might do them while listening to a podcast, watching a comedy show, or listening to the same one song on repeat (my current go-to song is a cover of Simply The Best by Billianne). \u201cPost lunch Eirin\u201d finds that listening to something or watching something helps her stay motivated as it directs all her non-work thoughts to one thing. If I need to work on a bigger project, I\u2019ll carve out time later in the day, e.g. by moving meetings or going someplace where there are few distractions, and let \u201cAfternoon Eirin\u201d give her full attention to it.</p><p>For me, this technique helps me delegate a task I don\u2019t feel as well-equipped to do at the time, which I might\u2019ve delegated to other colleagues instead if I worked in a bigger team.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>4. Productivity check-ins</strong></h2><p>I\u2019ll admit that it doesn\u2019t always work like this \u2014 some days or weeks are more or less productive than others. Some days, only \u201cPost lunch Eirin\u201d shows up, and I need to use other techniques. One thing that\u2019s really helped me to have fewer full weeks of unproductivity are weekly productivity check-ins. The past couple years I\u2019ve had a 30 min productivity check-in with the same person almost every week.&nbsp;</p><p>We each have our own checklists that we go through, and we then take turns talking about whatever is useful to talk about that week. We use a Google Spreadsheet as some of the questions we check in on ask us to put in a number (you\u2019ll see below), and it makes it easier to compare over time and create charts. We also use conditional formatting on the number responses (good score is green, bad score is red), to make it more obvious how we\u2019re doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\u2019s my checklist:</p><ul><li>Have you done your goals since the last check-in?</li><li>On a scale from 1-5, how motivated do you feel? (1 = not motivated, 5 = very motivated)</li><li>On a scale from 1-5, how tired or drained do you feel? (1= very tired, 5 = not tired at all)</li><li>On a scale from 1-5, do you feel like you can say what the most important projects you're working on are? (1 = not at all, 5 = I have full control)</li><li>On a scale from 1-5, is there anything you're worried about, or might be falling through the cracks? (1 = a lot, 5 = nothing)</li><li>On a scale from 1-5, to what extent are you doing things someone else could be doing? (1 = a lot, 5 = nothing)</li><li>Are you procrastinating on anything? Do you know what the roadblocks are, and are you working on removing them?</li><li>What are you most proud of last week?</li><li>What lessons did you learn this week that you\u2019d like to share?</li><li>What do you not want to do / any <a href=\"https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/ugh-fields-or-why-you-can-t-even-bear-to-think-about-that-task-5941837dac62\"><u>ugh fields</u></a> / anything you feel ashamed about?</li><li>Are there any habits that aren\u2019t serving you well?</li><li>Anything else you want to discuss that isn\u2019t covered elsewhere?</li><li>Goals for next time:</li></ul><p>Here are a few direct quotes from our spreadsheet that will give you an idea of the things I bring up every week:</p><ul><li>Working on something this week that feels like such a big project and like I need to set aside a bunch of time to work on, but it\u2019s hard to get started and I\u2019ve kept postponing it. I think the size of the project is making me procrastinate. I should reduce the size!</li><li>I feel like I don't have enough time to do all of my tasks this week, and yet I want to do all of them.&nbsp;What should I do?</li><li>So many emails \ud83d\ude22 How can I get to <a href=\"https://blog.superhuman.com/inbox-zero-method/\"><u>inbox zero</u></a>?? (this one comes up a lot)</li><li>There are some smaller todos that come out of our meeting that it\u2019ll take me days to do when I could\u2019ve just done them during the meeting or right after. I want to set aside 5 min after each meeting to get through as many todos as I can.</li><li>I'm considering deleting TikTok again, I\u2019m spending a lot of time on it. Won't for now, but want to check in next week on whether I should.</li></ul><p>Sometimes the thing that helps the most is just writing down what I\u2019m feeling and thinking about, and from that I\u2019ll figure out what the solution is. My productivity partner will also ask great questions such as \u201cHow important is it?\u201d, \u201cIs that actually true?\u201d, and \u201cWhat would you tell someone else in your position to do?\u201d. Very often she\u2019ll also provide useful advice from a time she struggled with something similar.&nbsp;</p><p>We have our check-ins on Wednesdays at the same time every week, though move them if necessary. I\u2019m confident that having these check-ins have increased my productivity on average, and because of them I very rarely have more than half an unproductive week.&nbsp;</p><p>If you\u2019re looking for someone to do these check-ins with, I recommend starting with people who are in similar roles to you. My productivity partner and I have similar backgrounds in EA community building, and both our jobs involve a lot of admin tasks and project management. It\u2019s not necessary to have similar roles for this to be useful, but it means we can to a larger extent give each other helpful tips and share lessons learned. That being said, the biggest factor is definitely just having <i>someone</i> who expects you to meet up every week who\u2019ll ask you questions about your productivity.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fns2atdgmynl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefs2atdgmynl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>By 'operations' I mean project management and administrative work.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "eirine"}}, {"_id": "68mDiCpWCpCegELbY", "title": "Personal fit is extremely important when assessing animal advocacy career paths", "postedAt": "2023-09-15T09:01:53.886Z", "htmlBody": "<p>When it comes to deciding which career path is more impactful for animals, it is important to figure out which career path&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>will be better at.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There is a lot of variance between individuals when it comes to skills, traits, preferences and values.&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Some people are better at communicating with others, some are not. Some people are comfortable with confrontation, some are not.&nbsp;</li><li>Some animal advocates like to focus on diet change, some like to focus on welfare reforms or movement building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Some people are cool with high risk while others are more risk-averse, etc.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These variances also apply to your performance at your work. A job or an organisation may be impactful, but if it is not the right fit for you, it may be much less impactful than opportunities that fit&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you are really good at something, your performance may be multiple times better than what you are not just as good at. If you are just average at your job, your impact would be limited even if the potential impact of the relevant position is high. Therefore making good judgments about what you are good at and making decisions that can allow you to capitalise your strengths is crucial for creating high impact for animals through your career.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So when assessing the impact opportunities, you should consider:</p><ol><li><strong>The average impact potential of the career option&nbsp;</strong>(say working as a campaigner in an organisation that aims for institutional animal welfare reforms, or as a supply chain officer in an alternative protein company or as an educator in movement building group), and&nbsp;</li><li><i><strong>Your personal&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>fit for that role.&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>Just as it would be mistake to choose your career path by only following where your passion lies or what you like or what you seem to be good at, and ignoring the impact of the work you would be doing; it would also be a mistake to consider the impact of career paths in isolation and not taking into account whether these are the right fit for&nbsp;<i>you</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>These considerations are of course naturally relevant for your personal welfare too. We wouldn\u2019t want anyone to selflessly sacrifice their own wellbeing just because they might have a slightly higher impact for animals. Ideally, your career should be simultaneously impactful and enjoyable. People who are satisfied with their jobs also tend to perform better, so in order to achieve high impact you should also take these into consideration as well.&nbsp;</p><h2>Some pointers to assess your personal fit</h2><p>You might think that figuring out your personal fit is easy, but it is usually hard to make perfectly accurate judgements about ourselves. So it is reasonable to ask some questions and to think about them open mindedly.&nbsp;</p><h3>What are you really good at?</h3><p><strong>Your impact is naturally tied to your performance, and your performance is also tied to your strengths.</strong> In order to optimise your performance and your impact, it is important to figure out what your strengths are.&nbsp;</p><p>To track your strengths, you can look at your previous successes. Of course, success depends on many factors so a good way of looking at this is to compare your track record with other people\u2019s performance that were in similar circumstances and timeframes. Here are some examples:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If you had a good academic CV, it might be a good sign that you are good at research related roles.&nbsp;</li><li>If you had experience and success at leading a student organisation, or a business, it might be a good indicator of your strengths in leadership or entrepreneurship.</li><li>If you had joined activist groups (not necessarily in animal advocacy), and you enjoyed being there and achieved your goals, then maybe campaigner roles are a good fit for you.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have a wide network of people who look up to you and have good relationships with, it might be a sign of you being good at working with people.&nbsp;</li><li>If you were successful in earning significantly more and accumulating more money than your peers, then maybe career paths like providing financial resources for the movement might fit you.</li><li>If a lot of people around you (your friends, colleagues or managers) inform you that you are really good at something, then maybe you really are good at it. You can also actively ask them to hear their views.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, don\u2019t take one single or some small data as definitive. Especially if you are young and at the beginning phase of your career, it may be hard to determine with confidence what you are good at since there is not enough information available and you can\u2019t really make a lot of comparisons since you had little experience in different fields. Taking some time to try more things and see how you perform in those areas might be a good approach.&nbsp;</p><h3>What do you enjoy doing?</h3><p><strong>High performance usually correlates with obsession-like focus and effort.</strong> People who are very good at what they do, usually don\u2019t see their job as something that needs to be done just to pay the bills or just something that they \u201chave to\u201d do in their workshifts. They enjoy what they are working on.&nbsp;</p><p>For this reason, in order to be successful, it is important to find work that you enjoy, or at the very least don\u2019t dislike doing. If you can do that, you can perform much better than the alternatives where you cannot wait for the end of your working hours, or don\u2019t give it your best effort simply because your job doesn\u2019t energise you.&nbsp;</p><p>Another long term aspect of this point is that it is important to work on something for a decent amount of time in order to excel at that role. It is unlikely that you will continue to do the same things unless you really like the things that you typically do.&nbsp;<strong>So choosing a career path where you enjoy your work and continue in that path for a long period of time, can allow you to excel at your role which is necessary for delivering high impact.</strong></p><p><strong>It is relatively easy to figure out what you enjoy in general. Here are some ways:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Do you feel highly motivated for a protest or get stressed?</li><li>Are you comfortable with remote work or do you prefer working alongside other people?</li><li>Are you more interested in ideas and arguments, or things and systems?</li><li>Do you always refrain from confrontation? Or are you comfortable with it?</li><li>Do you enjoy handling money and business?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Your answers to these and similar questions, may predict how you might fare in roles (like campaigning, management, fundraising, communications, marketing, research etc.) that typically put you in similar circumstances.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are your other personal goals and how do you prioritise them?</h2><p>Speaking of what you enjoy, you might also enjoy and value things other than your work!&nbsp;</p><p>One can think of many things here: having children, being able to afford certain things (like a house, car, or travel), not worrying about money, having a certain type of status by your peers and family, having lots of freetime, having a stable routine, caring about other social problems, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>These and other goals differ from individual to individual, and everyone can rightly value them.&nbsp;</p><p>While some roles may be impactful for helping animals, they may not allow you to achieve your personal goals. Your personal goals are also important, and you should consider whether certain roles are compatible with these.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to progress in your career for a long time, it is reasonable to have a coherent life plan that allows at least the possibility to pursue other goals that you value.&nbsp;<strong>Here are some questions to consider about other personal goals:</strong></p><ul><li>Would this career path allow me to earn as much as I aim to earn in the short term and in the long term?</li><li>How would my peers and family respond if I take this job? And how would I react to these?</li><li>How much time and money do I want to spend on animal causes?&nbsp;</li><li>How do I value my personal goals relative to my (animal advocacy) career goals?</li></ul><h2>What\u2019s your attitude toward risk?&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Almost all advocacy work involves some risks:</strong></p><h3>One aspect of this is the uncertainties about the impact.&nbsp;</h3><p>Even if you have a clear understanding and agreement about the general approach for change, it does not guarantee that your work and the efforts of your organisation will definitely achieve its objectives. For example, you might believe that alternative proteins are really the future. But it is entirely possible that the alternative protein company or NGO you choose to work at may not be successful, your research project may lead to nowhere, etc.&nbsp;</p><h3>Another source of risk may be about your performance or job satisfaction.&nbsp;</h3><p>Even if you do your best to assess your personal fit, there will be some uncertainties that you can only resolve after you experience first hand how it is to work in an animal advocacy organisation. It may turn out that this is not for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>On the other hand, you should also consider the upsides that can make up for certain risks.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Some career paths and jobs may be worth the risks, but how to find the right balance for you is something that you should decide for yourself. Here are some questions to assess your risk appetite:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Would it be cool to work on a project or a campaign even if its results will be unclear, uncertain? How would I react if at the end, there will be little or no impact?</li><li>Would my career and wellbeing be severely affected if this new job or career path doesn\u2019t work out? How would I fare financially and emotionally?</li><li>Do I have backup plans to cover these risks? (more on that below)</li><li>How much can you do good for animals in the best (or in a really good) case scenario, and how does that weigh against the risks for you?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Do you really believe in the cause and the approach to create change?&nbsp;</h2><p>If you are seriously considering a career path for helping animals, it is safe to say that you value animals highly. That said, there are a variety of approaches and fields to help animals and people have differing views and emotional connections about them.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not particularly enthusiastic about an approach, and you don\u2019t seem to change your mind even if you think about it thoroughly, maybe this is not the best fit for you, even if it is an impactful role for someone else who believes in that project or approach.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost all approaches involve some level of uncertainty about the future impact that they will deliver. And eventually, you have to make your own judgement about these and decide which one is better overall.&nbsp;<strong>So your personal views on social change and animal liberation is also an indicator of personal fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Some organisations, for instance, aim to create change for animals by building good relationships with other decision makers like corporations or legislators. Some people would find this reasonable, but some might not (with good reasons of their own).&nbsp;</li><li>Some organisations aim for decreasing the suffering of animals in factory farms while some organisations aim for substituting animal products from the food system altogether. Some people find the former approach unsatisfactory, while others find the latter unrealistic.&nbsp;</li><li>Some people forecast and aim for a larger and stronger movement that will deliver rights for animals in the future via advocacy and social change. Some people, on the other hand, are more pessimistic about social change via advocacy and more optimistic about technological progress that may make animal products obsolete without necessarily a significant moral circle expansion for animals.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Your views about these different avenues of change can have an impact on your drive to work so it is reasonable to contemplate on these topics and come to some informed conclusions for yourself. It would be a shame if after a long time in your career, you realise that you don\u2019t really believe in the impact of your work.</strong></p><ul><li>Lastly, some organisations may focus on certain animal groups like fish or shrimps, or insects. While some people are drawn to the idea of helping millions or even billions of animals and excited about very large numbers, some people doubt the sentience or the moral weight of these animals or simply, do not feel that connection.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For example, some advocates may not find the emotional attraction in themselves to dedicate their career for insect or shrimp welfare. It is reasonable to ask yourself whether you can see yourself highly motivated in your field for years, even if the animals you are trying to help are not necessarily the same animals you typically bond with like cats or dogs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Your immediate answers may be wrong - don\u2019t just follow your instincts</h2><p>While asking these questions and giving your own answers is an inevitable part of the thinking process, it is entirely possible that you may be misjudging certain elements about yourself and your career options.&nbsp;</p><p>You might be over or underestimating some issues. Or you might be close minded about certain options and fixating on a few. Or you might be short sighted or not paying enough attention to some practicalities.&nbsp;</p><p>For that reason, don\u2019t fall into the trap of giving quick answers in order to reach a fast conclusion. When thinking about your career path, be as open minded as possible when acknowledging possibilities and uncertainties.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a good idea to purposefully challenge your immediate answers with counter questions and arguments. Here are some ideas:</p><ul><li>Make a list of at least 10 career options (including options outside of animal advocacy), not just one or two.&nbsp;</li><li>Purposefully and genuinely provide pros and cons for each of them.&nbsp;</li><li>When assessing your strengths and weaknesses, make sure to have a list of&nbsp;<i>both</i>. Don\u2019t just focus on solely your strengths or weaknesses.&nbsp;</li><li>Don\u2019t think of yourself as someone who can never change. Think about your potential to adapt, grow and also the possibility to deteriorate or to be bored.&nbsp;</li><li>When assessing good and bad possible outcomes, take into consideration the&nbsp;<i>best&nbsp;</i>and the&nbsp;<i>worst&nbsp;</i>outcomes too, within realistic boundaries.&nbsp;</li><li>Make a budget for your current expenses and your future financial needs and goals. Take out and use a calculator to see whether expected incomes in your options really meet targets.</li><li>When assessing different approaches to change and the track record of certain organisations, don\u2019t inform yourself from one or few sources. Purposefully look for other sources of information that challenge these viewpoints and your beliefs.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Weighing your options in animal advocacy that fit you&nbsp;</h2><p>When people think about animal advocacy careers, they tend to think of one or a few stereotypes: like a campaigner or a community builder. That is a misconception. There is a huge variety of jobs available in the movement.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Some of them involve more confrontation (like campaigner or policy positions), some of them are more peaceful (like researcher, or operations positions).&nbsp;</li><li>Some of them require more generalist skills, some of them require more special ones.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of them are in the for profit companies in the alternative protein sector, while others are in non profit.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of them are viewed as more \u201cnormal\u201d by society while others are seen as more \u201ccrazy\u201d.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of them have really high salaries while others may allow a more frugal lifestyle.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of them allow you to work remotely, while some of them may require you to move abroad.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of them require previous experience while others don\u2019t.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of them involve higher risks and uncertainties, while others offer more stability and have a more solid track record.&nbsp;</li><li>Some of them have more ambitious goals and possibilities while others have more modest (or realistic) expectations.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>And as we explained in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/donate-to-animal-charities\"><i>donating to animal charities&nbsp;</i><u>piece</u></a>, you can also help animals in other jobs outside of animal movement, that allow you to earn reasonable amounts of money and donate a portion of it to advocacy groups.&nbsp;</p><p>So when thinking about animal advocacy careers, don\u2019t just think of it as general questions like \u201cDo I want to join animal advocacy?\u201d or \u201cWould I do well as an activist?\u201d. Also consider particular questions like this:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Would you want to join&nbsp;<i>this&nbsp;</i>particular field of animal advocacy (like alternative proteins, or movement building)?&nbsp;</li><li>Is&nbsp;<i>this&nbsp;</i>particular organisation good for you?&nbsp;</li><li>Does this particular organisation\u2019s culture fit your preferences? Do you expect to get on well with the managers and colleagues in this particular organisation?&nbsp;</li><li>Would you be hired by&nbsp;<i>these&nbsp;</i>organisations given your current skills and credentials?</li><li>Would you perform well and enjoy yourself in&nbsp;<i>this&nbsp;</i>particular position with these particular benefits and working conditions?</li><li>Does the salary range of&nbsp;<i>this&nbsp;</i>position really meet your expectations and the needs of your current and possibly future dependents?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Exposing yourself to these more concrete questions about your career options and thinking open mindedly about the high variety of options can give you a better sense of which paths are better for you in reality. And answering these questions would inevitably require some research on certain fields and organisations, as well as actively asking direct questions to people on the other side of the hiring process to get a better understanding of your options, such as questions about pay, culture, working conditions, responsibilities and expectations. Overlooking these might result in making bad choices that may affect your performance, job satisfaction, and your willingness to continue your career in that organisation.&nbsp;</p><h2>Avoiding pitfalls</h2><p><strong>Even if you do your best to assess your personal fit, it is almost impossible to predict the future perfectly.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is possible that your personal fit analysis turns out to be wrong, and you happen to be fit for some roles due to a variety of reasons that you did or did not foresee. These scenarios are real, normal and expected, so it is also reasonable to make some arrangements, and manage your expectations accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>That way, you can be more able to take acceptable risks and mitigate certain damages to your welfare. Here are some ideas to do that:</p><ul><li>Have a clear plan B and C in case your career decision doesn't work out: can you or would you go back to your previous job or sector? Would you search and apply for other jobs?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Be financially prepared. Make a \u201cworst case scenario budget\u201d and make enough savings before taking on risks. Don\u2019t accept salaries that don\u2019t cover your minimum expenses just to get in the movement and don\u2019t make unrealistic assumptions about your future pay or your ability to budget. Also, feel free to negotiate your salary with your potential employer to meet your needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Be emotionally prepared. Don\u2019t overrate the importance or the meaning of a single job in case you get rejected or you don't like it when you are hired. Maintain your connections with friends, family and other sources of positive emotions and meaning. Don\u2019t forget that there are and will always be many other options available to you inside and outside of the animal movement even if one particular job doesn\u2019t work for you.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>What can you do other than asking questions and thinking by yourself?&nbsp;</h2><p>Naturally, you have to introspect in order to have a better idea about your personal fit. But this should not be the only source of information. You may be biased or suffer from imposter syndrome or be ignorant about certain important data. To mitigate this, it is reasonable to look for other sources. Here are some suggestions:</p><ul><li>Reach out and talk to people who work in the organisations that you consider to pursue careers. Ask them about their daily routines, salary patterns, and things they enjoy and don\u2019t enjoy doing (Don\u2019t be shy to reach out to people you don\u2019t know, a lot of people would be happy to help). We recently launched the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/blog/categories/animal-advocate-series\"><i><u>Animal Advocate Stories series</u></i></a>, where you can read about the daily life of different animal advocacy professionals working on a diverse range of roles and organisations.</li><li>Consider volunteering or starting a part-time job or a time-limited contract.&nbsp;</li><li>Apply for roles in impact focused organisations and see where you get to. This will help you to get a good idea of what it\u2019s like to work in the role through test tasks and your comparative fit. (This only works if the organisation you apply for has a strong hiring process)&nbsp;</li><li>Consider&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGT8BY5aKIEwoot1pzkaNGIfpZvcrvEjNR5NAtOC93E_Jh0w/viewform\"><u>applying</u></a> for career advice from us (But please note we have limited capacity and might not be able to offer you a call).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Assessing your personal fit is definitely not easy, but it is definitely worth trying to make a well thought, informed and comprehensive assessment. If successful, you can make much better career decisions that can allow you to have a great impact for animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br><i>This article was written largely following the ideas and the structure of another article, \u201c</i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/personal-fit/\"><i><u>Personal fit: why being good at your job is even more important than people think</u></i></a><i>\u201d&nbsp; by Benjamin Todd and&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/?int_campaign=2023-05--primary-navigation__career-guide\"><i><u>80,000 Hours career guide</u></i></a><i>.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "Animal Advocacy Careers"}}, {"_id": "GKqR8r7TCdwwXASXv", "title": "SPAR seeks advisors and students for AI safety projects (Second Wave)", "postedAt": "2023-09-14T23:09:25.964Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "michaelchen"}}, {"_id": "ALZfHadk2A32EFpsw", "title": "Organ Donation", "postedAt": "2023-09-14T18:00:39.576Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Anybody seen any good studies or reasons to believe organ donation to science may be more effective than organ donation to people or vice versa (or any better alternatives?)?</p><p>Lmk.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Daniel Birnbaum"}}, {"_id": "qANrwXP94HJdWZwcx", "title": "Is EA a well-intentioned version of 'survival of the fittest' (or largest)?", "postedAt": "2023-09-14T17:39:49.030Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm fairly new to EA, greatly enjoying the 80,000 hours podcasts on 10 global problems.&nbsp; I have been pondering on the EA philosophy of using resources to do the most good and therefore having the greatest impact numerically.</p><p>So I'm wondering - taken to it's logical conclusion, is this not effectively a well intentioned version of survival of the fittest?&nbsp; What if your cause or issue is niche or that the people affected are low in numbers?&nbsp; How is their validity built in to the model?&nbsp; How does EA value diversity of issues?</p><p>So to give a concrete example: less than 1% of the population worldwide have type 1 diabetes.&nbsp; Maybe your money would be better spent on type 2 diabetes, with 8% of the world's population having that.&nbsp; Does this mean those with type 1 are unimportant or unworthy of funding?</p><p>Within EA would the solution be looking for the most impactful way to 'solve' type 1 (be that through advocacy for affordable insulin and supplies or via a cure), or would you simply focus on the larger population (type 2) and fund that for greater impact?</p><p>The lack of scope for diversity of smaller causes in the model troubles me, but I'm here to learn and very interested to hear views!</p>", "user": {"username": "FionaConner"}}, {"_id": "BvTzqdMtcgLnDBzJb", "title": "Best Practices for early-career Research Management", "postedAt": "2023-09-15T13:31:20.827Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This post is part of the \u201c</i><a href=\"/posts/waS5NaJjqdYugW8am/introducing-the-insights-of-an-era-forum-sequence\"><i><u>Insights of an ERA: Existential Risk Research Talent Development</u></i></a><i>\u201d sequence, outlining lessons learned from running the Existential Risk Alliance (ERA) Fellowship programme in 2023.

The practices used to support and guide fellows have a direct impact on their progress, learning, and overall success during formative periods.</p><p>Effective management is crucial for aligning research efforts with strategic goals, addressing bottlenecks, facilitating important connections, and ensuring work remains on track to achieve its intended impact. For those just embarking on an academic or cause-focused career, the guidance, oversight, and relationship with a Research Manager (RM) can be instrumental in shaping their skills, networks, and long-term trajectory.</p><p>This post examines the research management model used in the ERA Cambridge Fellowship. First, we cover general recommendations for effective research management, drawing from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dpjCwMwKEPqK3TPnC/notes-on-managing-to-change-the-world\">Managing to Change the World</a> (and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dpjCwMwKEPqK3TPnC/notes-on-managing-to-change-the-world\">these notes</a> by Peter Wildeford) and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/et/book/show/27316166\">other sources</a>. After outlining established practices, we make some notes on how full-time research management is different from research management for fellowships. With this in mind, we focus on our experience managing researchers, insights gained, and areas for improvement. This post is long, so feel free to only read the relevant sections.&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to not only document our learnings but also foster thoughtful discussion around how to support early-career researchers best. We aim to iteratively strengthen our model through open collaboration with the research community.</p><h2>Research Management Setup at ERA</h2><p>The ERA Fellowship structure is fellow, Mentor, and Research Manager, as outlined in the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9tG7daTLzyxArfQev/era-s-theory-of-change#To_achieve_these_objectives__ERA_engages_in_the_following_strategic_activities_\">previous post</a>.</p><p>Mentor:</p><ul><li>(before the fellowship) adjusting the scope of the research project,</li><li>(during the fellowship) discussing domain-specific research with the fellow, and</li><li>Giving feedback on research output.</li></ul><p>Research Manager:</p><ul><li>(before the fellowship) hires fellows, advises on the research proposal, helps to figure out mentorship,</li><li>(during the fellowship) keeps track of research progress, helps to solve bottlenecks of research fellows, helps to improve Mentor-fellow communication, and gives additional project or cause-specific advice.</li></ul><h2>What is Research Management?</h2><p>The goal of research management is <strong>to improve the research output of researchers.</strong></p><h3>Mindset of a Manager</h3><ul><li>Do what is most important to do and prioritise the most important task over other, perhaps easier, tasks.<ul><li>Even if some tasks are simple to address upfront, their importance - often measured by urgency or impact - should be the primary consideration.</li></ul></li><li>Delegate work to other people as much as possible.<ul><li>If tasks can be delegated, they&nbsp;<i>should</i> be. Tasks should be handed down the managing pipeline (imagine, e.g., CEO \u2192 Head of Development \u2192 Project Manager \u2192 Engineer).</li><li>Handing down tasks should happen until you reach the person who can do the task well enough.</li></ul></li><li>Managers spend time managing and don\u2019t necessarily do direct work. That encompasses reviewing documents, revisiting meetings- and overarching goals notes, 1-1 meetings, etc.<ul><li>A common failure mode for new managers is trying to squeeze in managing between their other work commitments.&nbsp;</li><li>Managing shouldn\u2019t be an inconvenience.</li></ul></li><li>The people you manage shouldn\u2019t think your meetings are a waste of time.</li></ul><h3>Key Responsibilities</h3><p><strong>Scoping a research project</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>(usually takes some context on the research itself. Also, managers usually lack domain-specific knowledge)</li><li>Managers help clarify the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PwnkYncoUsA\">theory of change</a> for a project</li><li>Managers help create a project plan when researchers expect to achieve goals/milestones.</li><li>Helpful mnemonic \u201cFive W\u2019s and an H\u201d:<ul><li><strong>Who</strong> should be involved?</li><li><strong>What</strong> does success look like?</li><li><strong>When</strong> is the project due?</li><li><strong>Where</strong> might the fellow go for help?</li><li><strong>Why</strong> does this project matter?<ul><li><strong>How</strong> should the fellow approach it?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Weekly check-ins</strong></p><ul><li>Staying engaged with the research is important to ensure all deadlines are met.</li><li>Meetings should cover check-in, current bottlenecks, progress on last week\u2019s task, and next week's goals.<ul><li>Personal preference over these meetings plays a role.</li></ul></li><li>Managers should value these meetings highly since this is the main uninterrupted interaction they get with their fellows.</li><li>Best practices:<ul><li>Recurring meetings at the same time (e.g., every Friday at 3:30 PM)</li><li>Meetings should start on a light note.</li><li>Preparing meetings with agendas of what to cover during the meetings (there might be a default structure). Try to avoid adding things spontaneously during the meetings since you want your fellow to be as prepared as possible for these meetings.<ul><li>An example of a prepared meeting agenda can be found in the appendix.</li></ul></li><li>The manager leads the meeting and takes notes. Ask your fellow whether they want to add anything to the notes.</li></ul></li><li>Managers and fellows should together agree on the next goals.</li></ul><p><strong>How to help researchers improve skills</strong></p><ul><li>Managing encompasses improving the staff\u2019s performance in some specific skill.</li><li>How to coach researchers effectively<ul><li>Step 1: Collaborate to set a goal<ul><li>Describe a behaviour or result you want to achieve by a date when you want it achieved.</li><li>Urgency: Create short-term tasks and give short deadlines</li></ul></li><li>Step 2: Collaborate to brainstorm resources</li><li>Step 3: Collaborate to create a plan</li><li>Step 4: The researcher acts and reports in the weekly meetings on the plan</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Building Relationships and Hiring</strong></p><ul><li>Create and encourage Work-with-me-docs</li><li>Feedback Mechanisms<ul><li>Getting feedback is super important for the health of an organisation</li><li>Create enough room for staff and researchers to give feedback.</li><li>See <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9tG7daTLzyxArfQev/era-s-theory-of-change\">ToC for ERA</a></li></ul></li><li>Hiring<ul><li>See <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5DR89AbnjGjEcYvu8/hiring-retrospective-era-fellowship-2023\">hiring retrospective</a></li><li>In short: Try to be as fair as possible and reasonable.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Fellowship vs. full-time research management</h2><ul><li>Since we accept fellows without pre-existing mentorship arrangements, a big part of the role of the RM before the fellowship consists of<ul><li>Refining the research proposal of the fellow</li><li>Clarifying the theory of change of the research</li><li>Getting suitable mentorship for the fellows</li></ul></li><li><strong>Less focus on long-term satisfaction</strong><ul><li>In normal research management, there is a big focus on retaining talent for your organisation.</li><li>That means you want to ensure that the person you manage is happy with their work and, more crucially, is satisfied with their work over an extended period.<ul><li>That usually means that you want your researcher to grow over time and be regularly excited about their challenges.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqaz6fqxfb8c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqaz6fqxfb8c\">[1]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li><li>Since fellowships only run between 8-12 weeks, usually, there is less time to discuss and support the overall growth of the researcher.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Less focus on fitting research into an overall agenda&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Because the Fellowship is agnostic to specific agendas and focuses on improving researchers, usually, there is little thought spent on how research fits into a holistic picture (besides being generally useful for mitigating x-risk).</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Research Managers\u2019 Perspectives</h2><p>This section outlines insights directly from the RMs at ERA. It covers their key responsibilities and techniques found valuable for supporting fellows during the programme. Our goal is to share hands-on experiences that may inform effective research management, especially for short-term, intensive fellowships like ERA.</p><ul><li><strong>Preamble: The needs of individual fellows varied widely</strong><ul><li>One valuable lesson for most RMs was to \u2018<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gKeHcikcXA3bApyoM/opening-session-tips-and-advice#Adjust_your_seat\">adjust the seat</a>\u2019 to each fellow</li><li>It is helpful to ask before starting the management relationship what type of adjustments are most suitable for the fellow</li><li>However, there is also the dynamic of adjusting practices during the run of the fellowship. Partially, this is because both the fellow and RM learned about one another, but also, the requirements of research management changed depending on when it was in the fellowship, the availability and role of the mentor, and other surrounding factors (e.g., the fellow\u2019s changing interests over the fellowship)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Weekly meetings</strong><ul><li>Having weekly meetings with prepared action items made it easier to stay on track with important topics, like recurring issues, accountability for various tasks, or overarching goals for the fellowship.</li><li>Most RMs used a pre-prepared template to cover the significant issues for the week before discussing other concerns or ideas that fellows had (see Appendix for an example template).</li><li>Discussing next-week\u2019s goals in these meetings was for some participants crucial for not falling prey to planning fallacies (\u201cWriting this section will only take a day\u201d) and unwelcome surprises (\u201cI\u2019ll use the existing implementation in the library\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkuc1vwiaor\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkuc1vwiaor\">[2]</a></sup></span>)<ul><li>Realistic self-assessment and goal-setting regularly help with pre-emptively mitigating blockers by aligning expectations with actual outcomes.</li></ul></li><li><i>Per fellow:1 meeting-hour per week, 30min/week preparation&nbsp;</i></li></ul></li><li><strong>Clarifying the theory of change</strong> of the research before(/early) on during the fellowship<ul><li>This was helpful in the cases where research pivoted during the fellowship</li><li>Having a theory of change laid out made it easier to figure out where to \u201cstart again\u201d and rethink where assumptions were wrong</li><li><i>Per fellow: 1-3 meeting-hours before the fellowship, 1-2 hours reading documents</i></li></ul></li><li><strong>Giving feedback on work</strong><ul><li>This covered reading sections of text, important mail, or erroneous code.</li><li>We also created a set of criteria by which to give feedback, specifically around reasoning transparency, etc.</li><li><i>Per fellow: 0-30 minutes per week, 1-2 hours post-fellowship for the deliverables</i></li></ul></li><li><strong>Exploring ideas with fellows</strong><ul><li>This covered discussing personal development with the fellows, including their career options and biggest uncertainties.</li><li>It also included discussing ideas around x-risk and their views on it in general and within the cause area.</li><li><i>Per fellow: 0-60 minutes per week&nbsp;</i></li></ul></li><li><strong>Random encounters</strong><ul><li>Chatting on random encounters about work, as well as chatting about issues on Slack, was noticeably more than we expected and also varied a lot between fellows.</li><li>Some fellows explicitly wanted to be asked about their projects during coffee breaks.<ul><li>We assume it would be stressful for others, so the default was only to do it if it came naturally (or through the fellow).</li></ul></li><li>This also sometimes involved talking about their general ideas on important issues, as discussed above.</li><li><i>Per fellow: 0-1h randomly chatting per week, 0-30min chatting on Slack&nbsp;</i><ul><li>Note that this varied most between RMs that were a lot in-office and remote&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Preparing the Programme for fellows</strong><ul><li>This will be covered thoroughly in a future post (stay tuned!).</li><li><i>3 hours before the fellowship, 3 hours throughout the fellowship&nbsp;</i><ul><li>Not including time spent during the events</li><li>Note that one team member who owns programming spent significantly more time on these tasks.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Connecting fellows with the research community at large</strong><ul><li>Providing introductions between fellows and other researchers was deemed valuable.</li><li>The need for introductions varied a lot across cause areas.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Impact of Research Management at ERA</h2><p>This section outlines insights on the impact of research management during the ERA Fellowship <strong>based on survey responses</strong> from ERA fellows after completing the fellowship. We sent out anonymous surveys and received responses from the majority.&nbsp;</p><p>While the survey results were largely positive regarding the role of RMs, it is important to note that some fellows did not fill out the survey. Those with more critical perspectives may have been less inclined to provide feedback. We aim to mitigate this potential bias by also gathering candid verbal input and being self-reflective when reviewing areas needing improvement.</p><p>With that context, here are the key themes on research management that emerged from the survey responses:</p><h3>Managers provide valuable holistic support for fellows</h3><ul><li>Multiple fellows praised the proactiveness and availability of their managers, and this was often considered much of the value RMs provided.</li><li>RMs provided technical and emotional support. This included attempting to increase the confidence of the fellows when necessary. Helping combat imposter syndrome was one important aspect of the RM\u2019s role; approaches here included highlighting the work the fellows had done so far, our excitement about their projects, and highlighting how given how personalised the interactions in the programme and rigorous the application process we knew the fellows clearly deserved to be at ERA.</li><li>Fellows noted that RMs made them feel safe to speak up with ideas, questions, and concerns on a variety of topics.</li><li>Having multiple managers around the office was deemed valuable, with fellows appreciating having multiple people to ask for advice.</li></ul><h3>Fast Feedback through the Manager</h3><ul><li>RMs were seen as supportive, providing timely and detailed feedback.</li><li>Feedback mechanisms like regular updates, goal setting, and checking the viability of plans were appreciated.</li><li>Commenting on documents was seen as a mechanism for useful feedback alongside meetings and conversations.</li><li>Helping to formulate and manage the project structure, including reminding fellows of their original goals, was a key management role.</li><li>Questioning of the fellows' ideas, research, and plans by a supportive manager also provided large amounts of value in refining their projects.</li><li>RMs were not perceived to be pressuring, and some fellows appreciated a more \u2018hands-off\u2019 approach from their RM.</li><li>Having a \u2018second pair of eyes\u2019 or someone to bounce ideas off was one of the most useful aspects of the RM.</li></ul><h3>Connecting fellows to the broader community</h3><ul><li>Fellows appreciated opportunities for 1-1 sessions with researchers, enabled through RMs</li><li>Job opportunities shared by the RMs were also useful to them.</li><li>The RMs were useful in connecting the fellows to others in their networks, which may lead to further future collaboration, research, or jobs.</li><li>There were positive remarks on conversations (often informal, \u2018water-cooler\u2019 conversations) with RMs about their cause area and x-risk. Some fellows found this the most valuable part of their interaction with RMs.</li></ul><h3>Time Management &amp; Goal Setting</h3><ul><li>Fellows expressed a need for guidance in setting realistic goals, defining the scope of their projects, and managing time.</li><li>RMs were useful in helping fellows prioritise between ideas.</li><li>Generally, more clarity over what would be expected at different times was seen as needed, including laying out what the schedule would look like to fellows before the fellowship.</li><li>Some fellows suggested that there should have been more engagement with fellows before the fellowship, although whether this would have been feasible with many fellows is unclear.</li><li>Some fellows wished for more reminders about their original, ambitious goals for the fellowship.</li><li>One fellow noted a mismatch between the level of ambition that they had for their project and the level of ambition their RM had for their project. While this didn't cause any major problems, ensuring fellow and RM are aligned on the goals for the project may be beneficial. Consistent clarity of communication around these goals and making more space for feedback around them may have been useful to help solve this problem.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Cause Area Expertise</h3><ul><li>Fellows differed in how important they felt it was for their RM to have object-level knowledge about their project. For some fellows, this was very helpful and profoundly shaped the direction of the projects, while for others, such input was less necessary.</li><li>This seemed to differ depending on both the mentor and the project type. While most fellows felt that object-level interactions with their mentors were considerably more valuable than with their RMs, this was not universally the case, and most fellows found object-level interactions with RMs somewhat useful.</li><li>Many fellows commented on the importance of having the RM to discuss specific issues around their cause area, even if this wasn\u2019t specifically responsible for the project. In general, having knowledgeable people around seemed to be of high value.</li></ul><h3>Juniority</h3><ul><li>The juniority of the RMs was noted as a negative by some fellows; however, it is unclear whether more senior RMs would have wanted to participate in ERA.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgrowdfsg4c8\"><sup><a href=\"#fngrowdfsg4c8\">[3]</a></sup></span></li><li>It was noted that having RMs with expertise in topics they were willing to talk to fellows about was deeply useful; it is possible for junior RMs to have such expertise, although this is obviously less common than in more senior individuals.</li><li>One way this may have been particularly impactful is a general feeling that some aspects of the fellowship were less \u2018professional\u2019 than may have been optimal; for example, last-minute urgent messages or the non-standardised/streamlined process for reaching out to possible mentors.</li></ul><h3>Mentorship and Support by RM</h3><ul><li>Some fellows felt that their weekly meetings with RMs could have included more open, unstructured time, focusing more on quick feedback and reflections.</li><li>Proposals were made for more frequent meetings involving the fellow, RM, and Mentor.</li><li>Fellows desired more non-work related interactions with the RMs; other fellows praised how well RMs from all cause areas interacted with them.</li><li>While most fellows had a solid connection to their RM, one reported feeling that their RM was not very invested in the project, seemingly due to a mismatch in perceived worldviews/culture. This is something that ERA would have to rectify in future iterations, including working on ways to pick this up earlier in the programme. Notably, however, this didn\u2019t seem to reduce the fellow's satisfaction with the programme as a whole substantially.</li></ul><h3>So, how valuable were RMs?</h3><ul><li>In general, <strong>the fellows rated the research management of the fellowship highly.</strong></li><li>However, how valuable fellows felt the RMs were significantly differed, likely due to several factors, including:<ul><li>The involvement and availability of their Mentor</li><li>The RM\u2019s experience in their area</li><li>How much support they felt they needed from their RM</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The ERA Fellowship is an ongoing endeavour to support and grow the existential risk research community. While we have outlined our learnings and insights to the best of our ability, we recognise there is always room for improvement.</p><p>We believe open discussion and collaboration are crucial for refining our approach. Thus, we warmly invite feedback from researchers, managers, and others. By incorporating different perspectives, we can enhance the fellowship programme and contribute more effectively to building capacity for existential risk reduction.</p><p>If you have thoughts to share, please comment below or email us directly at <a href=\"mailto:tilman@erafellowship.org\">tilman@erafellowship.org</a>.

Long-term thinking, as they define it, is an \u2018ethical practice and commitment\u2019; it requires deep reflection on the meaning of life; and it requires care for other humans, for future humans, and for our planet.

So it\u2019s a double-edged sword\u2026 and one would have to be very careful when following theories like that.</i></p><p>- Toby Ord</p></blockquote><p>Effective altruism is associated with the slogan \u201cdo the most good.\u201d On one level, this has to be unobjectionable: What could be bad about helping people more and more?</p><p>But in today\u2019s interview, Toby Ord \u2014 moral philosopher at the University of Oxford and one of the founding figures of effective altruism \u2014 lays out three reasons to be cautious about the idea of maximising the good that you do. He suggests that rather than \u201cdoing the most good that we can,\u201d perhaps we should be happy with a more modest and manageable goal: \u201cdoing most of the good that we can.\u201d</p><p>Toby was inspired to revisit these ideas by the possibility that Sam Bankman-Fried, who stands accused of committing severe fraud as CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was motivated to break the law by a desire to give away as much money as possible to worthy causes.</p><p>Toby\u2019s top reason not to fully maximise is the following: if the goal you\u2019re aiming at is subtly wrong or incomplete, then going all the way towards maximising it will usually cause you to start doing some very harmful things.</p><p>This result can be shown mathematically, but can also be made intuitive, and may explain why we feel instinctively wary of going \u201call-in\u201d on any idea, or goal, or way of living \u2014 even something as benign as helping other people as much as possible.</p><p>Toby gives the example of someone pursuing a career as a professional swimmer. Initially, as our swimmer takes their training and performance more seriously, they adjust their diet, hire a better trainer, and pay more attention to their technique. While swimming is the main focus of their life, they feel fit and healthy and also enjoy other aspects of their life as well \u2014 family, friends, and personal projects.</p><p>But if they decide to increase their commitment further and really go all-in on their swimming career, holding back nothing back, then this picture can radically change. Their effort was already substantial, so how can they shave those final few seconds off their racing time? The only remaining options are those which were so costly they were loath to consider them before.</p><p>To eke out those final gains \u2014 and go from 80% effort to 100% \u2014 our swimmer must sacrifice other hobbies, deprioritise their relationships, neglect their career, ignore food preferences, accept a higher risk of injury, and maybe even consider using steroids.</p><p>Now, if maximising one\u2019s speed at swimming really were the only goal they ought to be pursuing, there\u2019d be no problem with this. But if it\u2019s the wrong goal, or only one of many things they should be aiming for, then the outcome is disastrous. In going from 80% to 100% effort, their swimming speed was only increased by a tiny amount, while everything else they were accomplishing dropped off a cliff.</p><p>The bottom line is simple: a dash of moderation makes you much more robust to uncertainty and error.</p><p>As Toby notes, this is similar to the observation that a sufficiently capable superintelligent AI, given any one goal, would ruin the world if it maximised it to the exclusion of everything else. And it follows a similar pattern to performance falling off a cliff when a statistical model is \u2018overfit\u2019 to its data.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pyrpuTNDaP8kPER8H/dt8txwnorwodqj0xnz5o\" alt=\"cliff\"></p><p>In the full interview, Toby also explains the \u201c<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/ORDMT\">moral trade</a>\u201d argument against pursuing narrow goals at the expense of everything else, and how consequentialism changes if you judge not just outcomes or acts, but <a href=\"https://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/papers/beyond-action.pdf\">everything</a> according to its impacts on the world.</p><p>Toby and Rob also discuss:</p><ul><li>The rise and fall of FTX and some of its impacts</li><li>What Toby hoped effective altruism would and wouldn\u2019t become when he helped to get it off the ground</li><li>What utilitarianism has going for it, and what\u2019s wrong with it in Toby\u2019s view</li><li>How to mathematically model the importance of personal integrity</li><li>Which AI labs Toby thinks have been acting more responsibly than others</li><li>How having a young child affects Toby\u2019s feelings about AI risk</li><li>Whether infinities present a fundamental problem for any theory of ethics that aspire to be fully impartial</li><li>How Toby ended up being the source of the highest quality images of the Earth from space</li></ul><p>Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world\u2019s most pressing problems and how to solve them: type \u201880,000 Hours\u2019 into your podcasting app. Or read the transcript.</p><p><i>Producer and editor: Keiran Harris</i><br><i>Audio Engineering Lead: Ben Cordell</i><br><i>Technical editing: Simon Monsour</i><br><i>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</i></p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><h3><strong>Maximisation is perilous</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. So what goes wrong when you try to go from doing most of the good that you can, to trying to do the absolute maximum?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Here\u2019s how I think of it. Even on, let\u2019s say, utilitarianism, if you try to do that, you generally get diminishing returns. So you could imagine trying to ramp up the amount of optimising that you\u2019re doing from 0% to 100%. And as you do so, the value that you can create starts going up pretty steeply at the start, but then it starts tapering off as you\u2019ve used up a lot of the best opportunities, and there\u2019s fewer things that you\u2019re actually able to bring to bear in order to help improve the situation. As you get towards the end, you\u2019ve already used up the good opportunities.</p><p>But then it gets even worse when you consider other moral theories \u2014 if you\u2019ve got moral uncertainty, as I think you should \u2014 and you also have some credence that maybe there are some other things that fundamentally matter apart from happiness or whatever theory that you like most says. There are these tradeoffs as you optimise for the main thing; there can be these tradeoffs to these other components that get steeper and steeper as you get further along.</p><p>So maybe, suppose as well as happiness, it also matters how much you achieve in your life or something like that. Then it may be that many of the ways that you can improve happiness, let\u2019s say in this case, involve achievements \u2014 perhaps achievements in terms of charity, and achievements in terms of going out in the world and accomplishing stuff. But as you get further, you can start to get these tradeoffs between the two, and it can be the case for this other thing that it starts going down. If instead we were comparing happiness first and then freedom, maybe the ways that you could create the most happiness involve, when you try to crank up that optimisation right to 100%, just giving up everything else if need be. So maybe there could be massive sacrifices in terms of freedom or other things right at the end there.</p><p>And perhaps a real-world example to make that concrete is if you think about, say, trying to become a good athlete: maybe you\u2019ve taken up running, and you want to get faster and faster times, and achieve well in that. As you start doing more running, your fitness goes up and you\u2019re also feeling pretty good about it. You\u2019ve got a new exciting mission in your life. You can see your times going down, and it makes you happy and excited. And so a lot of metrics are going up at the start, but then if you keep pushing it and you make running faster times the only thing you care about, and you\u2019re willing to give up anything in order to get that faster time, then you may well get the absolute optimum. Of all the lives that you could live, if you only care about the life that has the best running time, it may be that you end up making massive sacrifices in relationships, or career, or in that case, helping people.</p><p>So you can see that it\u2019s a generic concept. I think that the reason it comes up is that we\u2019ve got all of these different opportunities for improving this metric that we care about, and we sort them in some kind of order from the ones that give you the biggest bang for their buck through to the ones that give you the least. And in doing so, at the end of that list, there are some ones that just give you a very marginal benefit but absolutely trash a whole lot of other metrics of your life. So if you\u2019re only tracking that one thing, if you go all the way to those very final options, while it does make your primary metric go up, it can make these other ones that you weren\u2019t tracking go down steeply.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, so the basic idea is if there\u2019s multiple different things that you care about\u2026 So we\u2019ll talk about happiness in life versus everything else that you care about \u2014 having good relationships, achieving things, helping others, say. Early on, when you think, \u201cHow can I be happier?,\u201d you take the low-hanging fruit: you do things that make you happier in some sensible way that don\u2019t come at massive cost to the rest of your life. And why is it that when you go from trying to achieve 90% of the happiness that you could possibly have to 100%, it comes at this massive cost to everything else? It\u2019s because those are the things that you were most loath to do: to just give up your job and start taking heroin all the time. That was extremely unappealing, and you wouldn\u2019t do it unless you were absolutely only focused on happiness, because you\u2019re giving up such an incredible amount.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Exactly. And this is closely related to the problem with targets in government, where you pick a couple of things, like hospital waiting times, and you target that. And at first, the target does a pretty good job. But when you\u2019re really just sacrificing everything else, such as quality of care, in order to get those people through the waiting room as quickly as possible, then actually you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot with this target.</p><p>And the same kind of issue is one of the arguments for risk from AI, if we try to include a lot of things into what the AI would want to optimise. And maybe we hope we\u2019ve got everything that matters in there. We better be right, because if we\u2019re not, and there\u2019s something that mattered that we left out, or that we\u2019ve got the balance between those things wrong, then as it completely optimises, things could move from, \u201cThe system\u2019s working well; everything\u2019s getting better and better\u201d to \u201cThings have gone catastrophically badly.\u201d</p><p>I think Holden Karnofsky used this term \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\">maximization is perilous</a>.\u201d I like that. I think that captures both what\u2019s one of these big problems if you have an AI agent that is maximising something, and if you have a human agent \u2014 perhaps a friend or you yourself \u2014 who is just maximising one thing. Whereas if you just ease off a little bit on the maximising, then you\u2019ve got a strategy that\u2019s much more robust.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How moral uncertainty protects against the perils of utilitarianism</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> One thing that you can say in general with moral philosophy is that the more extreme theories \u2014 which are, say, less in keeping with all of our current moral beliefs \u2014 are also less likely to encode the prejudices of our times. So what we say in the philosophy business is that they\u2019ve got more \u201creformative power\u201d: they\u2019ve got more ability to actually take us somewhere new and better than where we currently are. Like if we\u2019ve currently got moral blinkers on, and there\u2019s some group who we\u2019re not paying proper attention to and their plight, then a theory with reformative power might be able to help us actually make moral progress. But it comes with the risk that by having more clashes with our intuitions, we will end up perhaps doing things that are more often intuitively bad or wrong \u2014 and that they might actually be bad or wrong. So it\u2019s a double-edged sword in this area, and one would have to be very careful when following theories like that.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. So you say in your talk that for these reasons, among others, you couldn\u2019t embrace utilitarianism, but you nonetheless thought that there were some valuable parts of it. Basically, there are some parts of utilitarianism that are appealing and good, and other parts about which you are extremely wary. And I guess in your vision, effective altruism was meant to take the good and leave the bad, more or less. Can you explain that?</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah, I certainly wouldn\u2019t call myself a utilitarian, and I don\u2019t think that I am. But I think there\u2019s a lot to admire in it as a moral theory. And I think that a bunch of utilitarians, such as John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, had a lot of great ideas that really helped move society forwards. But in part of my studies \u2014 in fact, what I did after all of this \u2014 was to start looking at something called <a href=\"https://www.moraluncertainty.com/\">moral uncertainty</a>, where you take seriously that we don\u2019t know which of these moral theories, if any, is the right way to act.</p><p>And that in some of these cases, if you\u2019ve got a bit of doubt about it\u2026 you know, it might tell you to do something: a classic example is if it tells the surgeon to kill one patient in order to transplant their organs into five other patients. In practice, the utilitarians tend to argue that actually the negative consequences of doing that would actually make it not worth doing. But in any event, let\u2019s suppose there was some situation like that, where it suggested that you do it and you couldn\u2019t see a good reason not to. If you\u2019re wrong about utilitarianism, then you\u2019re probably doing something really badly wrong. Or another example would be, say, killing a million people to save a million and one people. Utilitarianism might say, well, it\u2019s just plus one. That\u2019s just like saving a life. Whereas every other theory would say this is absolutely terrible.</p><p>The idea with moral uncertainty is that you hedge against that, and in some manner \u2014 up for debate as to how you do it \u2014 you consider a bunch of different moral theories or moral principles, and then you think about how convinced you are by each of them, and then you try to look at how they each apply to the situation at hand and work out some kind of best compromise between them. And the simplest view is just pick the theory that you\u2019ve got the highest credence in and just do whatever it says. But most people who\u2019ve thought about this don\u2019t endorse that, and they think you\u2019ve got to do something more complicated where you have to, in some ways, mix them together in the case at hand.</p><p>And so while I think that there is a lot going for utilitarianism, I think that on some of these most unintuitive cases, they\u2019re the cases where I trust it least, and they\u2019re also the cases where I think that the other theories that I have some confidence in would say that it\u2019s going deeply wrong. And so I would actually just never be tempted in doing those things.</p><p>It\u2019s interesting, actually. Before I thought about moral uncertainty, I thought, if I think utilitarianism is a pretty good theory, even if I feel like I shouldn\u2019t do those things, my theory is telling me I have to. Something along those lines, and there\u2019s this weird conflict. Whereas it\u2019s actually quite a relief to have this additional humility of, well, hang on a second, I don\u2019t know which theory is right. No one does. And so if the theory would tell you to really go out on a limb and do something that could well be terrible, actually, a more sober analysis suggests don\u2019t do that.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The right decision process for doing the most good</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Many people think that utilitarianism tells us, when we\u2019re making decisions, to sit there and calculate, for each of the possible options available to you, how much happiness it\u2019s going to create \u2014 and then to pick the one that leads to the best outcome. Now, if you haven\u2019t encountered this before, you may think that\u2019s exactly what I said earlier that utilitarianism is, but I hope I didn\u2019t make this mistake back then, and I think I probably got it right.</p><p>So naive utilitarianism is treating the standard of what leads to the best happiness as a decision procedure: it\u2019s saying that the way we should make our decisions is in virtue of that. Whereas what utilitarianism says is that it\u2019s a criterion of rightness for different actions \u2014 so it\u2019s kind of the gold standard, the ultimate arbiter of whether you did act rightly or wrongly \u2014 but it may be that in attempting to do it, you systematically fail.</p><p>And this can be made clear through something called the \u201cparadox of hedonism\u201d: where, even just in your own life, suppose you think that having more happiness makes your life go better, and so you\u2019re always trying to have more happiness. And so every day when you get up you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat would make me happy today?\u201d And then you think, \u201cWhich of these breakfast cereals would make me happiest?\u201d And then you\u2019re having it and you\u2019re like, \u201cWould chewing it slower make me happier?\u201d And so on. Well, you\u2019re probably going to end up with less happiness than if you were just doing things a bit more normally. And it\u2019s not really a paradox; it\u2019s just that constantly thinking about some particular standard is not always the best way to achieve it.</p><p>And that was known to the early utilitarians. In fact, they wrote about this quite eloquently. They suggested that there could be other decision procedures which are better ways of making our decisions. So it could be that even on utilitarian standards, more happiness would be created if we made our decisions in some other way. Perhaps if we are trying this naive approach of always calculating what would be best, our biases will creep in, and so we\u2019ll tend to distribute benefits to people like us instead of to those perhaps who actually would need it more. Indeed, there is a lot of opportunity for that, including your self-serving biases. You might think, \u201cActually, that nice thing that my friend has would create more happiness if I had it, and so I\u2019m just going to swipe it on the way out the door.\u201d</p><p>The concern is that actually there is quite a lot of this self-regarding and in-group bias with people, and so if they were all trying to directly apply this criterion and to treat it as a decision procedure, they probably would do worse than they would do under some other methods. And for a thoroughgoing utilitarian, the best decision procedure is whichever one would lead to the most happiness. If that turns out to be to make my decisions like a Kantian would, if that really would lead to more of what I value, then fine, I don\u2019t have a problem with it.</p><p>And so one thing that\u2019s quite interesting is that utilitarianism, in some sense, is in less conflict than people might think with other moral theories, because the other moral theories are normally trying to provide a way of making the decisions. Whereas utilitarianism is potentially open to agreeing with them about their way of making decisions, if that could be grounded in the idea that it produces more happiness.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Moral trade</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Suppose you\u2019re completely certain, and you think only happiness matters. So you\u2019re not worried about the moral uncertainty case, and you\u2019re not worried about this idea that other things might go down in that last 1% of optimisation, because you think this really is the only thing that matters.</p><p>Well, at least if you\u2019re interested in effective altruism, then you\u2019re part of a movement that involves people who care about other things, and you\u2019re trying to work with them towards helping the world. And so this last bit of optimisation that you\u2019re doing would be very uncooperative with the other people who are part of that movement.</p><p>So this can be connected to a broader idea that I\u2019ve written about called <a href=\"https://amirrorclear.net/files/moral-trade.pdf\">moral trade</a>, where the idea is that, just as people often exchange goods or services in order to make both of them better off \u2014 this is the idea that Adam Smith talked about: if you pay the baker for some bread, you\u2019re making this exchange because you both think that you\u2019re better off with the thing the other person had \u2014 you could do that not just about your self-interested preferences, but with your moral preferences. And in fact, the theory of trade works equally well in that context.</p><p>For example, suppose there were two friends, one of whom used to be a vegetarian but had stopped doing it because maybe they got disillusioned with some of the arguments about it. But they\u2019d kind of gone off meat to some degree anyway, and so it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a burden if they went back to being a vegetarian. That person cares a lot about global poverty, and their friend cares about factory farming and vegetarianism. Well, they could potentially make a deal and say, \u201cIf you go back to being a vegetarian, I will donate to this charity that you keep telling me about.\u201d They might each not be quite willing to do that on their own moral views, but to think that if the other person changed their behaviour as well, that the world really would be better off.</p><p>And you can even get cases where they\u2019ve got diametrically opposed views. Perhaps there\u2019s some big issue \u2014 such as abortion or gun rights or something \u2014 where people have diametrically opposed positions, and there are charities which are diametrically opposed. And they\u2019re both thinking of donating to a pair of charities which are opposed with each other. And then maybe they catch up for dinner and notice that this is going to happen. And they say, \u201cHang on a second. How about if instead of both donating $1,000 to this thing, we instead donate our $2,000 to a charity that, while not as high on our list of priorities for charities, is one that we actually both care about? And then instead of these effects basically cancelling out, we\u2019ll be able to produce good in the world.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s the general idea of moral trade. And you can see why the moral trade would be a good thing if it\u2019s the case that even though people have different ideas about what\u2019s right, and these ideas can\u2019t all be correct, if they\u2019re generally, more often than not, pointing in a similar direction or something \u2014 such that when we better satisfy the overall moral preferences of the people in the world \u2014 I think we\u2019ve got some reason to expect the world to be getting better in that process. In which case, moral trade would be a good thing. And it\u2019s an idea that can also lead to that kind of behaviour where you don\u2019t do that last little bit of maximising.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The value of personal character and integrity</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> So the reason that effective altruism focuses so much on impact and doing good \u2014 for example, through donation \u2014 is that we\u2019re aware that there\u2019s this extremely wide variation in different ways of doing good, whether that be perhaps the good that\u2019s done by different careers or how much good is done by donating $1,000 to different charities.</p><p>And it\u2019s not as clear that one can get these kinds of improvements in terms of character. So if you imagine an undergraduate, just finishing their degree, about to go off and start a career. If you do get them to give 10 times more than the average person, and to give it 10 times more effectively, they may be able to do 100 times as much good with their giving, and that may be more value than they produce in all other aspects of their life. But if you told them to be a really good character in their life, and that was the only advice, and you didn\u2019t change their career or anything else, it\u2019s not clear that you could get them to produce outcomes like that. And then there\u2019s a question about how much goodness does the virtue create or something, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it comes from the same kind of distribution. It\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019s a version of me out there with some table calculating log-normal distributions of virtue or something like that.</p><p>And I think that\u2019s right. But how I think about it is that, ultimately, in terms of the impact we end up having in the world, you could think of virtue as being a multiplier \u2014 not by some number between 1 and 10,000 or something with this huge variation, but maybe as a number between -1 and +1 or something like that, or maybe most of the values in that range. Maybe if you\u2019re really, really virtuous, you\u2019re a 3 or something.</p><p>But the fact that there is this negative bit is really relevant: it\u2019s very much possible to actually just produce bad outcomes. Clearly, Sam Bankman-Fried seems to be an example of this. And if you\u2019ve scaled up your impact, then you could end up with massive negative effects through having a bad character. Maybe by taking too many risks, maybe by trampling over people on your way to trying to achieve those good outcomes, or various other aspects.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. So the point here is that even though virtue in practice doesn\u2019t seem to vary in these enormous ways \u2014 in the same way that, say, the cost effectiveness of different health treatments might, or some problems being far more important or neglected than others \u2014 all of the other stuff that you do ends up getting multiplied by this number between -1 and 1, which represents the kind of character that you have, and therefore the sort of effects that you have on the project that you\u2019re a part of and the people around you.</p><p>And maybe we\u2019ll say a typical level of virtue might be 0.3 or 0.4, but some meaningful fraction of people have a kind of character that\u2019s below zero. Which means that usually, when those people get involved in a project, they\u2019re actually causing harm, even though people might not appreciate it \u2014 because they\u2019re just inclined to act like jerks, or they lie too much, or when push comes to shove they\u2019re just going to do something disgraceful that basically sets back their entire enterprise. Or there might be various other mechanisms as well. And then obviously it\u2019s very clear that going from -0.2 to 2 is extremely important, because it determines whether you have a positive or negative impact at all.</p><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> Yeah. And another way to see some of that is when you\u2019re scaling up on the raw impact. For example, suppose you\u2019ve noticed that when founders set up their companies, some of these companies end up making a million dollars for the founders, some make a billion dollars: 1,000 times as much. This is one of these heavy-tailed distributions. And then if you\u2019ve got a person with bad character, the amount of damage they could do with a billion-dollar company is like 1,000 times higher as well as the amount of good they could do with it is 1,000 times higher.</p><p>So it\u2019s especially important if someone is going to go and try to just do generically high-impact things that have a positive sign on that overall equation and not a negative one. Another way to look at that is when you have something like earning to give, because there\u2019s an intermediate step where it turns into dollars \u2014 and dollars are kind of morally neutral depending on what you do with them, or at least morally ambiguous, as opposed to it directly helping people \u2014 then there\u2019s more need to vet those people for having a good character and before joining their project or something like that.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How Toby released some of the highest quality photos of the Earth</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Toby Ord:</strong> I\u2019d been looking at some <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/galleries/images/?page=0&amp;per_page=25&amp;order=created_at+desc&amp;search=&amp;tags=cassini&amp;condition_1=1%3Ais_in_resource_list&amp;category=51\">beautiful pictures of Saturn</a> by the Cassini spacecraft. Amazing. Just incredible, awe-inspiring photographs. And I thought, this is great. And just as I\u2019d finished my collection of them and we had a slideshow, I thought, I\u2019ve got to go and find a whole lot of the best pictures of the Earth. The equivalent, right? Like fill a folder with amazing pictures of the Earth.</p><p>And the pictures I found were nowhere near as good. Often much lower resolution, but also often JPEG-y with compression artefacts or burnt-out highlights where you couldn\u2019t see any details in the bright areas. All kinds of problems. The colours were off. And I thought, this is crazy. And the more I looked into it, I got a bit obsessed in my evenings downloading these pictures of the Earth from space.</p><p>I eventually had a pretty good idea of all of the photographs that have been taken of the Earth from space, and it turns out that there aren\u2019t that many spacecraft that have taken good photos. Very few, actually.</p><p>If you think about a portrait of a human, the best distance to take a photo of someone is from a couple of metres away. Maybe one metre away would be OK, but any closer than that, they look distorted. And if you go much farther, then you won\u2019t get a good photo; they\u2019ll be too small in the shot. But the equivalent is partway from the Earth to the moon. Low Earth orbit, where the International Space Station is, is too close in: it\u2019s the equivalent to being about a centimetre away from someone\u2019s face. And the moon is a bit too far out, although you can get an OK photograph.</p><p>And so it turned out that it was mainly the Apollo programme, where they sent humans with extremely good cameras, with these Hasselblads, up into space, and they trained them in photography. Their photos are just way better than anything else that\u2019s been done, and it\u2019s just this very short period, a small number of years. And I ended up going through all \u2014 more than 15,000 \u2014 photographs from the Apollo programme and finding the best ones of the Earth from space.</p><p>And then I found that there were these archives where people had scanned the negatives, and even then some of the scans were messed up. Some of them were compressed too badly, some of them had blown-out highlights, some of them were out of focus. And for every one of my favourite images, I went and found the very best version that\u2019s been scanned.</p><p>And then I found that, surprisingly, using Aperture, a program for fixing up photographs, that I could actually restore them better than had been done before. I was very shocked that all of a sudden my photograph of the blue marble was as good or a little bit better than the one on Wikipedia or the NASA website. And for other photographs that were less well known, I could do much better than had been done before.</p><p>And I eventually went through and put in a lot of hours into creating this really nice collection, and made a website for them called <a href=\"https://www.tobyord.com/earth\">Earth Restored</a>, which you can easily find, where you can just go and browse through them all.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "Lb2TjSsjpqA8rQ7dP", "title": "The state of AI in different countries \u2014 an overview", "postedAt": "2023-09-14T10:37:00.006Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Note: I wrote this some weeks ago for the </i><a href=\"https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance\"><i>AI Safety Fundamentals Governance Course</i></a><i> syllabus and figured I'd share it here.</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz6pclq2vw0o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz6pclq2vw0o\">[1]</a></sup></span><i>&nbsp;It might be outdated, and corrections are appreciated!&nbsp;</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefamytbo0vgq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnamytbo0vgq\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><hr><p>Some are concerned that regulating AI progress in one country will slow that country down, putting it at a disadvantage in a global AI arms race.

In 2019, the World Intellectual Property Organization released a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/tech_trends/en/artificial_intelligence/story.html\"><u>report</u></a> showing that the number of new AI patents in China had surpassed the number in the United States. (As with academic publications,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mondaq.com/china/patent/1150552/ending-patent-subsidies-in-china\"><u>financial incentives for patent registrations</u></a> might have led to this growth.) But the rankings look very different when metrics for patent&nbsp;<i>quality</i> are taken into account. Only 4% of the Chinese patents were subsequently filed in another jurisdiction, compared with 25% to 63% of the patents initially filed in other countries, suggesting that the patents are less important on average \u2014 when an invention looks especially promising, applicants often file further patents in other jurisdictions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3z0c9kr79r1\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3z0c9kr79r1\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The number of other patents citing an older patent can also be a measure of quality.

According to a Chinese government white paper cited in the testimony, 66% of the world\u2019s AI open-source software (like the ML framework&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch\"><u>PyTorch</u></a>) was developed mainly by U.S. developers, compared to the 12% that was developed by Chinese developers. Most assessments of national AI capabilities inflate China\u2019s performance by focusing on technological development and specific applications, like new products (e.g. smart speakers) and startups.</p><h2>How all of this might change in the future</h2><p>The top labs of today (or of 2022) might not stay the top labs forever, so it is helpful to examine how AI progress in different countries will change in the future. There are many different approaches to this question.&nbsp;<i>Tortoise Media</i>\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tortoisemedia.com/intelligence/global-ai/\"><u>Global AI Index</u></a> scores nations on their levels of investment, innovation, and implementation of AI (in its 2023 report, the U.S. ranked first on all three dimensions, followed by China, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Canada, which ranked better and worse on different factors). Other analysts focus on national investments in AI development, or on different states\u2019 announced plans to speed up AI progress \u2014 a lot of media coverage has focused on China\u2019s well-publicized goals and government partnerships with labs. Other researchers build models that look at factors like the availability of computing resources and training data, the state of technological and intellectual progress in different nations, and what other factors might affect the development and release of powerful AI models.&nbsp;</p><p>These approaches and the people taking them have many disagreements, but it seems that&nbsp;<strong>the United States has an advantage in terms of access to key resources needed for frontier AI development (funding, top AI talent, the semiconductor supply chain), and China has some specific political and economic qualities that might hinder AI development.&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>The United States invests more in AI than any other state</strong></h3><p>The United States&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cat.eto.tech/?expanded=Summary-metrics%2CChanges-over-time%2CTop-companies&amp;dataset=Investment&amp;countries=United+Kingdom%2CChina+%28mainland%29&amp;countryGroups=Quad&amp;companyField=General+purpose\"><u>invests</u></a> more in AI development than any other state.

Only three companies can currently produce the most advanced chips (semiconductors), and all are based in the United States or allied countries:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC\"><u>TSMC</u></a> (Taiwan),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung\"><u>Samsung</u></a> (South Korea), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel\"><u>Intel</u></a> (United States). Manufacturing these chips, in turn, relies on three broader processes: design, fabrication, and \u201cATP\u201d \u2014 assembly, testing, and packaging. And production&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/The-Semiconductor-Supply-Chain-Issue-Brief.pdf\"><u>requires</u></a> technologically complex equipment, materials like highly pure silicon and xenon gas, and intellectual property related to the chip designs (which can involve billions of interconnected components).&nbsp;</p><p>As described in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/The-Semiconductor-Supply-Chain-Issue-Brief.pdf\"><u>a CSET brief</u></a>,<strong> semiconductor manufacturing is currently dominated by the United States and its allies</strong>; Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Europe. In brief, advanced chip design and development (mostly by AMD and Nvidia), as well as the software for that design, is based in the United States.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref052bisinj53f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn052bisinj53f\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The US, South Korea, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, and China lead on the&nbsp;<i>production</i> of semiconductors, but key steps are dominated by specific countries and groups. Critically,&nbsp;<strong>the US, Japan, and the Netherlands dominate the production of semiconductor manufacturing equipment</strong>, which includes tools for tasks like wafer manufacturing and marking, ion implantation, lithography, etc.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb39ncjzeo15\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb39ncjzeo15\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These are key chokepoints for China. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is responsible for over 90% of the manufacturing of the most advanced chips; South Korea makes the rest. ASML (based in the Netherlands) is the only company that makes the most advanced photolithography machines (needed to draw circuit patterns on layers of silicon used in a chip), a key part of the process. Japan and the Netherlands control advanced photolithography equipment; China cannot produce any advanced lithography equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover,&nbsp;<strong>recent (and expanding) export controls will make it much harder for China to catch up.</strong> An&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai\"><u>analysis for the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies</u></a> (CSIS) explains that late 2022 controls passed by the U.S. government will \u201cstrangle\u201d the Chinese semiconductor industry, specifically targeting the production of chips designed to be linked together for large AI models. The controls limit Chinese groups\u2019 ability to buy high-end AI chips, remove access to key chip design software (which is almost entirely designed in the United States), prohibit sales of U.S.-built semiconductor manufacturing equipment (Chinese alternatives are estimated to be more than a decade and a half behind the U.S. state of the art), and control other important components. (The controls affect all companies operating in China in part because the Chinese military sometimes uses shell companies to buy products companies are not allowed to sell directly to the military.) Other governments are also adopting controls \u2014 most notably the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/csis-translation-updated-dutch-export-controls-semiconductor-manufacturing-equipment-and\"><u>Dutch</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/csis-translation-updated-japanese-export-controls-high-performance-semiconductor\"><u>Japanese</u></a> governments, which have already announced export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (those two countries, together with the United States, account for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/mapping-semiconductor-supply-chain-critical-role-indo-pacific-region\"><u>90% of global sales</u></a> of such equipment). The effects of these controls compound existing&nbsp;<strong>economies of scale and network effects</strong>; new products have to be compatible with other parts of the supply chain and with older chips (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA\"><u>CUDA</u></a>), and need to work with a tight network of established firms, making it harder for any new companies or groups to start a profitable business in this area.&nbsp;</p><p>China leads in assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP). This is important and labor-intensive but is less technically complicated. (Packaging might become more of a bottleneck for chip performance in the future.) Japan, Singapore, the US, and some other countries are also involved. And China has the largest share of many raw materials required for chip manufacturing but faces chokepoints in the production of manufactured materials (300 mm wafers, photomasks, and photoresists), which are primarily produced by Japan, the US, Taiwan, South Korea, and Germany. (The U.S. and its allies also produce a sizable share of all raw materials except for three.)</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Lb2TjSsjpqA8rQ7dP/ey76b03mrihhkfjx6oal\"><figcaption>From CSET: semiconductor value add and market shares by segment and firm headquarters</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Censorship and other political and economic factors might hinder AI progress in China</strong></h3><p>China\u2019s unusual political and economic environment might significantly affect Chinese AI development.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Censorship will have a significant impact on the viability of most generative AI products in China.&nbsp;</strong>China\u2019s ruling Communist Party censors public discourse in China. Citizens cannot access sites like Google and Facebook, and some topics and political stances are strictly forbidden. Large language models cannot be trained on datasets that include forbidden discourse (which is important because limiting data harms performance), and if an AI product like a chatbot (like ChatGPT) outputs responses critical of the Chinese government or similar, it could be suspended,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4vgdzbv215d\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4vgdzbv215d\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and companies are liable if their AI products share content that violates censorship laws.

Additionally, some evidence suggests that AI progress in China is especially reliant on AI progress elsewhere. If this is true, slowing AI progress in countries like the United States<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref83efaw6pqqw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn83efaw6pqqw\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;would also slow down progress in China.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/illusion-chinas-ai-prowess-regulation\"><u>In one article</u></a>, researchers argued that \u201cAI advances in China rely a great deal on reproducing and tweaking research published abroad, a dependence that could make it hard for Chinese companies to assume a leading role in the field. If the pace of innovation slackened elsewhere, China\u2019s efforts to build LLMs\u2014like a slower cyclist coasting in the leaders\u2019 slipstream\u2014would likely decelerate.\u201d They pointed out that on one occasion in 2021, over 100 researchers at Stanford collaborated on a major paper about \u201cfoundation models.\u201d Half a year later, \u201cthe Beijing Academy of AI released a similarly lengthy literature review on a related subject, with almost as many co-authors. But within a few weeks, a researcher at Google discovered that large sections of the Chinese paper had been plagiarized from a handful of international papers\u2014perhaps, Chinese-language media speculated, because the graduate students involved in drafting the paper faced extreme pressure and were up against very short deadlines.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, concerns that if one country regulates AI, it will be at a disadvantage compared to others seem oversimplified, if only because many governments are beginning to regulate AI. According to the AI Index, at least 31 countries have passed an AI-related bill since 2016.

As I'm wrapping up this project, I want to share my personal perspective, and share some final thoughts.</p><p>This post mostly has some thoughts and context that didn't fit into the previous post. I also wish to accurately set expectations that I'm not working on this investigation any more.</p><h2>Why I Got Into Doing an Investigation</h2><p>From literally the very first day, my goal has been to openly share some credible allegations I had heard, so as to contribute to a communal epistemic accounting.&nbsp;</p><p>On the Tuesday of the week Kat Woods first visited (March 7th), someone in the office contacted me with concerns about their presence (the second person in good standing to do so). I replied proposing to post the following one-paragraph draft in a public Lightcone Offices slack channel.</p><blockquote><p>I have heard anonymized reports from prior employees that they felt very much taken advantage of while working at Nonlinear under Kat. I can't vouch for them personally, I don't know the people, but I take them pretty seriously and think it's more likely than not that something seriously bad happened. I don't think uncheckable anonymized reports should be sufficient to boot someone from community spaces, especially when they've invested a bunch into this ecosystem and seems to me to plausibly be doing pretty good work, so I'm still inviting them here, but I would feel bad not warning people that working with them might go pretty badly.</p></blockquote><p>(Note that I don't think the above is a <i>great</i> message, nonetheless I'm sharing it here as info about my thinking at the time.)</p><p>That would not have represented any particular vendetta against Nonlinear. It would not have been an especially unusual act, or even much of a call out. Rather it was intended as the kind of normal sharing of information that I would expect from any member of an epistemic community that is trying to collectively figure out what's true.</p><p>But the person who shared the concerns with me recommended that I not post that, because it could trigger severe repercussions for Alice and Chloe. They responded as follows.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Person A</strong><i><strong>:</strong> </i>I'm trying to formulate my thoughts on this, but something about this makes me very uncomfortable.</p><p>...</p><p><strong>Person A:</strong><i> </i>In the time that I have been involved in EA spaces I have gotten the sense that unless abuse is extremely public and well documented nothing much gets done about it. I understand the \"innocent until proven guilty\" mentality, and I'm not disagreeing with that, but the result of this is a strong bias toward letting the perpetrators of abuse off the hook, and continue to take advantage of what should be safe spaces. I don't think that we should condemn people on the basis of hearsay, but I think we have a responsibility to counteract this bias in every other way possible. It is very scary to be a victim, when the perpetrator has status and influence and can so easily destroy your career and reputation (especially given that they have directly threatened one of my friends with this).</p><p>Could you please not speak to Kat directly? One of my friends is very worried about direct reprisal.</p><p><strong>BP:</strong> I'm afraid I can't do that, insofar as I'm considering uninviting her, I want to talk to her and give her a space to say her piece to me. Also I already brought up these concerns with her when I told her she was invited.</p><p>I am not going to name you or anyone else who raised concerns to me, and I don't plan to give any info that isn't essentially already in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L4S2NCysoJxgCBuB6/announcing-nonlinear-emergency-funding?commentId=5P75dFuKLo894MQFf\">the EA Forum thread</a>. I don't know who the people are who are starting this info.</p></blockquote><p>This first instance is an example of a generalized dynamic. At virtually every step of this process, I wanted to share, publicly, what information I had, but there kept being (in my opinion, legitimate) reasons why I couldn't.</p><p>(I've added a few more example chat logs in the footnotes here<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1nw35y1mitg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1nw35y1mitg\">[1]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref65vxnfu7hai\"><sup><a href=\"#fn65vxnfu7hai\">[2]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuqigbrd0n8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuqigbrd0n8\">[3]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcpgcpc2wm3\"><sup><a href=\"#fncpgcpc2wm3\">[4]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxdpjyu8z9jp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxdpjyu8z9jp\">[5]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdiaj0sso5n5\"><sup><a href=\"#fndiaj0sso5n5\">[6]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflw5me1zdodm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlw5me1zdodm\">[7]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefion9b598yyr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnion9b598yyr\">[8]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvilhgzaha3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvilhgzaha3\">[9]</a></sup></span>.)</p><p>Eventually, after getting to talk with Alice and Chloe, it seemed to me Alice and Chloe would be satisfied to share a post containing accusations that were received as <i>credible</i>. They expected that the default trajectory, if someone wrote up a post, was that the community wouldn't take any serious action, that Nonlinear would be angry for \"bad-mouthing\" them, and quietly retaliate against them (by, for instance, reaching out to their employer and recommending firing them, and confidentially sharing very negative stories). They wanted to be confident that any accusations made would be strong enough that people wouldn't just shrug and move on with their lives. If that happened, the main effect would be to hurt them further and drive them out of the ecosystem.</p><p>It seemed to me that I could not personally vouch for any of the claims (at the time), but also that if I <i>did</i> vouch for them, then people would take them seriously. I didn't know either Alice or Chloe before, and I didn't know Nonlinear, so I needed to do a relatively effortful investigation to get a better picture of what Nonlinear was like, in order to share the accusations that I had heard.</p><p>I did not work on this post because it was easy. I worked on it because I <i>thought it would be easy</i>. I kept wanting to just share what I'd learned. I ended up spending about ~320 hours (two months of work), over the span of six calendar months, to get to a place where I was personally confident of the basic dynamics (even though I expect I have some of the details wrong), and that Alice and Chloe felt comfortable with my publishing.</p><p>On June 15th I completed the first draft of the post, which I'd roughly say had ~40% overlap in terms of content with the final post. On Wednesday August 30th, after several more edits, I received private written consent from both Alice and Chloe to publish. A week later I published.</p><p>I worked on this for far too long. Had I been correctly calibrated about how much work this was at the beginning, I likely wouldn't have pursued it. But once I got started I couldn't see a way to share what I knew without finishing, and I didn't want to let down Alice and Chloe.</p><p>My goal here was not to punish Nonlinear, per se. My goal was to get to the point where the accusations I'd found credible could be discussed, openly, at all.&nbsp;</p><p>When I saw on Monday that Chloe had decided to write <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=gvjKdRaRaggRrxFjH\">a comment</a> on the post, I felt a sense of \"Ah, the job is done.\" That's all I wanted. For both sides to be able to share their perspective openly without getting dismissed, and for others to be able to come to their own conclusions.</p><p>I have no plans to do more investigations of this sort. I am not investigating Nonlinear further. If someone else wants to pick it up, well, now you know a lot of what I know!</p><p>Please don't think that because I took the time to follow up on these accusations on <i>this</i> occasion, that there is \"a lifeguard on duty\", that either bad behavior or info suppression will be reliably noticed or called out. We've <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rsnrpvKofps5Py7di/shutting-down-the-lightcone-offices\">shut down the Lightcone Offices</a>, I've no plans to do this again, and don't particularly want to.</p><p>My sense is that there are a good number more injustices and predators in the EA ecosystem, most of which do not look exactly like this case. But it is not my job to uncover them and I am not making it my job. If you want to have an immune system that ferrets out bad behavior, you'll have to take responsibility for building that.</p><h2>Assorted Closing Thoughts</h2><p><strong>Some final thoughts about Nonlinear</strong></p><ul><li>I\u2019ve still got a lot of genuine uncertainty about who did what and how responsible the core Nonlinear team are for all the horrible experiences Alice and Chloe had. I just wanted to get it out into a state where Nonlinear weren't in a position to just attack their former employees' characters and push the post away. I hope for Nonlinear's sakes that they are able to show that they're not as culpable for the harms as it seems. I\u2019ve had to work pretty hard to be confident that the harms won't be inappropriately pushed under the rug.</li><li>For the record, a bunch of the stuff that Nonlinear tried, if they were to apologize for, seems forgivable to me, and not obviously norm-violating ex ante. Traveling around the world in a small group sounds fun (though after seeing how it went down here I'd now be much more worried about it). I have been very financially dependent on my cofounder in the past, and worked without a legal structure. I think it's generally quite hard to have a personal assistant that actual solves your personal problems and stays out of your way where there isn't a bunch of friction and a bit of a strange power dynamic. I think all of these things went quite badly wrong here and I think they should've tried to make that up to the ex-employees, but I don't think these things should never be tried again (though not all at once), and that if they had made it up to them that would've been okay.</li><li>The primary thing that really isn't okay according to my ethical norms, is silencing and intimidating people who were harmed and who disagree with you about why. That's why I tried so hard to communicate Alice and Chloe's perspective here, so that won't happen.</li><li>In general, I think it's fine for teams to try really weird things. But I think Nonlinear in particular needs to credibly signal that, if someone works with them and feels burned afterward, or get into some other conflict, they will be free to share openly that they feel that way and why, without fearing retaliation professionally or otherwise.</li><li>(Also everyone involved should write things down more! I think things go better when people jot down verbal agreements in writing. Makes it much easier months later to check in on what expectations were set.)</li><li>To be clear I think there\u2019s a good chance that Kat and Emerson are very straightforwardly responsible for basically all the messed up things that happened here, and their best response is to stop trying to manage people, admit to themselves that they have major character flaws that are not easily patched, and focus on projects that don\u2019t involve having much power over other people or paying people tiny-or-no-salaries. And most people's best response is to keep a safe distance from them.</li><li>Kat and Emerson seem to me to be in denial. Most of their comments seem to me to have been sustaining a narrative that this is all just malicious lies from Alice and Chloe. At no point in either conversation that I had with them did I feel that they could see the harms I was worried about. I hope they can see now. Then they can actually respond to that, and grow/change.</li><li>By default, when ex-employees criticize an organization, I don't think the ex-employees have a right to anonymity. However in this instance my opinion is that Kat and Emerson have erred way too high on the side of signaling that they will be retributive, and I think if they want to be trusted around this ecosystem in future years right now they clearly should avoid actions that seem obviously retributive. As I said, the personal costs of working at Nonlinear have haunted Alice and Chloe for 1.5 years, and I would consider it an exceedingly inappropriate escalation for Nonlinear to dox them in response to my post, even if they have valid criticisms.</li><li>Sometimes I'm concerned that I portrayed Nonlinear in an overly unpleasant light, given that I don't know a lot of details and am painting a broad picture. Sometimes I re-read my many interview notes and remember pretty concerning things I didn't include (due to reasons like privacy (on all sides) or because it's from a 3rd hand report), and I start forming a hunch that if all was revealed their actions would turn out to have been much worse than what I display in the post. (What I'm saying is that I have a lot of uncertainty still in both directions.)</li></ul><p><strong>Some final thoughts about this investigation</strong></p><ul><li>One of the hard things for me was being respectful of Alice and Chloe whilst also trying to work with them on something I knew was painful for them. My relationship to them in this whole thing has felt pretty confusing to me. From one perspective I'm just a stranger showing up in their life repeatedly interviewing them about terrible things that happened to them and saying I'm gonna try to do something about it. I was generally pretty confused about the boundaries of what sort of input from them made sense to ask for \u2014 is it appropriate to ask them to spend much time searching through texts and emails to answer some questions about what happened? I'll admit to also having some concerns about them not being the best at asserting their boundaries. I moved more slowly and carefully on that account. My guess is that had I got it all done much faster, this could have been much more painful during the process but overall they\u2019d get past it faster and that would\u2019ve been better for them. It would also have increased the risk of them regretting ever talking to me, which I was pretty worried about. I'm pretty sure I made some notable mistake here but I still don't know what precisely I wish I'd done differently.</li><li>One guess is that I should've said something like \"I am willing to spend N hours working with you to make a serious case here, and if I believe it, then I'll publish it, and if I don't believe it at that point I'm going to move on\" and then have them decide how much effort they wanted to put into that, and if it wasn't worth it, move on. But man, it felt wrong to have serious and credible accusations and not be able to let other people know. I didn't really feel I could let it go.</li><li>New people have started giving me more surprising information about Kat/Emerson that suggests other bad situations have occurred, but I'm not doing this job any more. And anyway, I think my last post gives people <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sTwW3QLptTQKuyRXx/the-first-sample-gives-the-most-information\">most of what they need to know</a>.</li><li>Another sign to me that it was right for me to do this, was that many of the people I interviewed said things like \"I have felt ethical concerns about Nonlinear but I didn't know what to do about them\" and reported feeling relieved that they could share their thoughts with someone (me).</li><li>Generally, everyone who I spoke with, or got references from, seemed honest and open. But, of course, it may eventually come out that there is someone who I was mistaken to put my trust in.</li><li>In my last post, I advised people not to bother Alice and Chloe about this situation. I would like to revise this to say that, while I wouldn't want people to bother them about their experiences with Nonlinear, I\u2019ll say I think it\u2019d be pretty nice for people who are friendly with them to send them messages of warmth and friendship and support. I got a fair few of them when I wrote the post and that was helpful for me (sorry I didn't reply to most of them).</li></ul><p><strong>On the CEA Community Health Team (and the EA ecosystem in general)</strong></p><ul><li><i>[Edit: </i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS/the-importance-of-saying-oops\"><i>Oops</i></a><i>, I've edited the first few bullets out, I'll check some things privately and come back to edit this in the next couple days.

Sorry for the confusion, I'll leave a comment saying so when I've returned them.]</i></li><li>I think the CEA Community Health team is much more like an institutionalized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_network\">whisper network</a> than it is like the police, where lots of people will quietly give it sensitive information, but it mostly isn't in a position to use it, and on the rare occasions that it does it's not via an accountable and inspectable procedure. I think that everyone should be very clear that CEA Community Health basically doesn't police the EA ecosystem, in the sense of reliably investigating and prosecuting credible accusations of wrongdoing or injustice. There are a swath of well-intentioned people in the EA ecosystem, but I think it's pretty clear there is no reliable justice system for when things go wrong.</li><li>Relatedly, four interviewees who gave me some pretty helpful info would only talk to me on the condition that I not share my info with the CEA Community Health team. They didn't trust (what I'm calling) the \"institutionalized whisper network\" to respect them, and some expected that it would hurt their ability to get funding to share any info.</li><li>My current impression is that many people in the EA ecosystem feel a false sense of safety from the existence of CEA Community Health, hoping that it will pursue justice for them, when (to a first approximation) it will not. While I respect many people on the team and consider some of them friends, my current sense is that the world would probably be better if the CEA Community Health team was disbanded and it was transparent that there is little-to-no institutional protection from bullies in the EA ecosystem, and more people do not get burned by assuming or hoping that it will play that role.</li></ul><p><strong>Going forward, for me, personally</strong></p><p>I\u2019m basically finished winding down my investigator sub-process, and plan to get back to other work starting Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned above, I have had a few calls with other people about some strongly negative experiences with some of the relevant Nonlinear team. I don\u2019t plan to investigate those stories or any of the other people in them, though it did give me some more bayesian evidence about some of the dynamics I'd written about being accurate.</p><p>Perhaps Kat and Emerson will be able to provide helpful evidence that changes how their time with Alice and Chloe reflects on them. I hope so. But either way it\u2019s a part of their reputation now, and that seems right to me.</p><p>If Nonlinear writes up their account of things, or a critique of my post, I'll probably read it, but I'm not committing to any substantial engagement.</p><p>I don't really want to do more of this kind of work. Our civilization is hurtling toward extinction by building increasingly capable, general, and unalignable ML systems, and I hope to do something about that. Still, I'm open to trades, and my guess is that if you wanted to pay Lightcone around $800k/year, it would be worth it to continue having someone (e.g. me) do this kind of work full-time. I guess if anyone thinks that that's a good trade, they should email me.</p><p>Right now, I'm getting back to working on LessWrong.com, after a long detour into office spaces in Berkeley, hotel renovations, and a little investigative work.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn1nw35y1mitg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref1nw35y1mitg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><i>Meta: The footnote editor kept crashing due to length, so I've included 5 chat logs spread over 9 footnotes.</i></p><p><strong>March</strong> <strong>7th</strong>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Person A:</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>I just wanted to flag a concern I have about some of guests currently at Lightcone. Yesterday and today I saw both Drew Spartz and Kat Woods using the Lightcone spaces, and this worries me a lot. Their company Nonlinear has a history of illegal and unethical behavior, where they will attract young and naive people to come work for them, and subject them to inhumane working conditions when they arrive, fail to pay them what was promised, and ask them to do illegal things as a part of their internship. I personally know two people who went through this, and they are scared to speak out due to the threat of reprisal, specifically by Kat Woods and Emerson Spartz.

Many EA\u2019s are interested in philosophy. Some may be interested in a career in philosophy: this requires a graduate degree in philosophy. I will give a brief description of my situation first. I will then give a brief description of the possible impact through philosophy. I will end with a brief description of philosophy careers, and some practical advice for those considering a career in philosophy. I then conclude.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Graduate Studies</h1><p>I am a graduate student in philosophy in the US. Before coming to the US for my graduate studies, I studied in Germany, my home country. US graduate studies are typically funded by a mix of teaching appointments (generally capped at 20 hours/week) and fellowships. Both pay the same amount of money, leading to a constant source of income. The exact amounts vary between universities. I would describe my financial situation as comfortable, but by no means luxurious. My current yearly pre-tax income by the university is around $36.000, and I receive roughly $8000 a year in external funding.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>As a graduate student, teaching and research are the two main responsibilities. You will teach either as an assistant (i.e. teach discussion sections while a professor teaches the lecture), or as a primary instructor. The latter is significantly more work. Teaching is a passion of mine, but it is less important for my job prospects than research: hence, I am incentivized to spend more time on my research than on my teaching.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Research consists of trying to write papers that make it into good philosophy journals. Ideally, this is done in close cooperation with one\u2019s advisor. Often, work is presented at conferences before it is sent out for publication. Philosophy is quite a prestige-driven discipline: the journal's ranking matters a lot. A single top-3 publication is likely to outweigh 5 top-30 publications, for example. A publication outside of a top-30 or so venue matters comparatively little. This leads to a focus on few high-quality works rather than a \u201cspray and pray\u201d strategy.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from teaching and research, it is expected that one takes up some service work in the department, such as organizing events, workshops, or reading groups. This does not take a lot of time unless you passionately organize things that take a lot of time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I feel immensely privileged to be paid to teach and research philosophy. I also greatly enjoy the liberty I have in self-allocating my time, be it to research, teaching, service work, or my personal life.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Possible Impact</h1><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Possible impact through philosophy is somewhat hard to assess. I did not choose to study philosophy because of impact considerations - it is simply the only career path that seemed bearable to me. Take the following to be my spontaneous considerations, rather than a detailed impact analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>There are philosophical works that have had a significant impact.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://petersinger.info/\"><u>Peter Singer</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls\"><u>John Rawls</u></a> are two ethicists that had a considerable impact through their writing. It strikes me as unlikely that work done outside of very specific fields (ethics/animal sentience/longtermisty stuff) will have a direct impact. Even if one works in these fields, the odds of achieving significant impact through research seem low to me: I think of such impact as a quite heavy-tailed distribution, with e.g. Rawls\u2019 research impact likely dwarfing the impact of fifty good but non-famous political philosophers following in his wake. I do not hold this view with high confidence.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of contemporary philosophers aiming for impact through public engagement or blogging are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/\"><u>Richard Chappell</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/\"><u>David Thorstad</u></a>, both of whom do high-quality work that engages directly with the EA community, which I take to be taking philosophical worries much more seriously than other communities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The main impact one can have in philosophy, I think, stems from teaching. Each year, one has the pleasure of teaching a hundred or so starry-eyed undergraduates who want to change the world. Helping these students find ways of changing the world by encouraging them, providing them with career advice, or helping them prioritize between different ways of changing the world has a significant positive impact. Some philosophers are especially good at this and have constructed classes that directly aim to facilitate helping students in such pursuits: At my institution, two good examples are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://davidmanley.squarespace.com/teaching\"><u>David Manley</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.annaedmonds.com/teaching.html\"><u>Anna Edmonds</u></a>. I\u2019d say someone who is good at teaching can easily help 5-10 students a year in making career changes that would not otherwise take place. It strikes me as comparatively easier to help people at the start of their studies than when they have already embraced on a career path, which is a benefit of teaching university students.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>One can also attempt to have an impact through more indirect means. For example, I organize an international&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/philosophers\"><u>fundraiser</u></a> for malaria prevention each year, which is held across philosophy departments. It raised $15.000 last year. I hope to continue to organize it yearly. This takes almost no time, and if you\u2019re a philosopher wanting to team up on organizing this, do reach out to me.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Based on these considerations, from an impact perspective, I reckon that being a good philosophy teacher makes a bigger difference to one\u2019s impact than being a good philosophy researcher. Of course, if you\u2019re not a good philosophy researcher, you will not get a job as a philosopher.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>When considering philosophy from an impact perspective, you should compare the impact you would have through philosophy with the impact of your alternative career paths that you are evaluating. For example, you may want to consider direct charity work, charity entrepreneurship, or earning to give. Note that all of these, too, provide you with possibilities for advising and mentoring other people. Given that my impression is that the main impact of philosophy comes through teaching, I believe that philosophy is unlikely to realistically outperform any of these alternative career paths unless you are a very effective teacher or mentor. I consider myself a pretty good teacher, but I still reckon I would have chosen another career path had I maximized for impact. Note that unlike in other career paths, a philosophy Ph.D. does not offer a fallback option: it is harder to do e.g. earning to give or a policy career with a philosophy Ph.D. than with an economics or comp sci Ph.D. This should factor into your considerations because the likelihood of not succeeding in the academic job market is high. This brings me to my next point:</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Philosophy Job Market</h1><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The philosophy job market is utterly f\u2019d.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This is not hyperbole. Most philosophy PhD\u2019s do not find a permanent position in academia. This is despite them desperately trying to find a permanent position in academia, and despite them being good philosophers. It is common for even a top-30 program to have only one graduate of a given cohort\u2019s year to find a job. It is common for a non-top-30 program to not have any graduates of a given year find a job. It is common to see extremely talented people drop out of a career in their mid-30s or 40s. There is no alternative career path for philosophy PhD\u2019s in the way that there is for economists, neuroscientists, or computer scientists.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>There are simply far fewer jobs than there are graduates. Generally, a successful applicant to any university will come from a top-ranked US or UK institution, have a few top-ranked publications, and a few top-dog letters of recommendation. All of these are incredibly hard to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Career paths differ between countries. On the European market, it is typical to be working in several short-term Postdoc positions before (hopefully!) receiving a permanent job. This makes it very difficult to e.g. plan your life, have a long-term relationship, settle down, or have kids. On the American market, this is similar, but there exist tenure-track positions for earlier job safety. These positions are extremely competitive. There also exist rare non-university jobs, such as at think-tanks. These positions are extremely competitive.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>I could continue on this harp for a long time, listing sacrifices involved in studying philosophy. I myself have left my home country and am spending 2/3rds of my life far away from my partner, friends, and family to pursue my dream career. I am happy to discuss more aspects in the comments section. But the practical takeaway is:</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Unless you have independent means of financing your life without a job, a career in philosophy comes at great sacrifice and involves great risks.&nbsp;<i><strong>I recommend to only do philosophy graduate studies if you are accepted at a top 10 program, or have strong independent evidence</strong></i>.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>What is a top 10 program? They are listed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall-rankings/\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>What is strong independent evidence? Look at other PhD students your advisor had. Look specifically at how many of them have achieved a permanent position. Look specifically for how many of them have not: note that this second number is harder to establish. If it looks like most advisees got a permanent position at some point, this may be strong independent evidence for job prospects. Do not trust official data on this: departments are incentivized to undercount people that did not find permanent employment.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Practical Advice</h1><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are an undergraduate student considering a career in philosophy, you need 3 things.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>An amazing writing sample by the time you apply.

Counterintuitively, demographic factors may also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dailynous.com/2022/10/04/gender-in-philosophy-hiring/\"><u>help</u></a>: philosophy has long been lagging behind significantly in matters of diversity and is trying to correct that trend. As a consequence, the job chances for people from marginalized communities currently look better than for e.g. straight white males. I would expect this to affect grad school applications similarly, but I have not seen data on this. It is unclear whether this trend will continue. It is also noteworthy that the experience as an e.g. black philosopher or female philosopher may be negatively affected by the fact that fewer of your colleagues and mentors will be e.g. black or female. A third factor I want to address is that, by my current best understanding, having a writing sample that is legibly EA (e.g. \u201cmentions the word Effective Altruism\u201d; \u201cCites EA sources\u201d; \u201cis on a topic only EA\u2019s engage with\u201d) is more likely to hurt than help your chances. I would currently advise undergraduate mentees to not be legibly EA&nbsp;<i>in the writing sample</i>. I have made similar decisions myself in the past when thinking about what areas to specialize in before entering graduate school. It is fine to be legibly EA otherwise (e.g., have EA stuff on your CV). You will, however, be able to \u201crespec\u201d and focus on whatever you want in graduate school.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some resources that may be helpful</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>1.

Experiments show a tradeoff between truthfulness and helpfulness, as more truthful models are more likely to refuse to answer a given question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[</strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03341\"><strong>Link</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><h3>Training Socially Aligned Language Models in Simulated Human Society</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F522ece18-79e5-4517-9c17-6c1878902103_1600x1504.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F522ece18-79e5-4517-9c17-6c1878902103_1600x1504.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F522ece18-79e5-4517-9c17-6c1878902103_1600x1504.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F522ece18-79e5-4517-9c17-6c1878902103_1600x1504.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F522ece18-79e5-4517-9c17-6c1878902103_1600x1504.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F522ece18-79e5-4517-9c17-6c1878902103_1600x1504.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Language model alignment techniques usually focus on pleasing a single conversational partner. This paper instead develops a technique for aligning language models in a social setting. Models generate answers to questions, send those answers to other models, and receive feedback on their answers. Then models are trained to mimic the outputs and ratings provided by other models in their simulated society. This technique improves generalization and robustness against adversarial attacks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[</strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16960\"><strong>Link</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><hr><h1>Systemic Safety</h1><h3>Can large language models democratize access to dual-use biotechnology?</h3><p>ChatGPT can be prompted into providing information about how to generate pandemic pathogens.

Animal advocacy careers can impact millions of animals anywhere in the world", "postedAt": "2023-09-13T13:34:16.163Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Some effective altruists focus on their donations, or just follow EA as a matter of intellectual pursuit. But for those who&nbsp;<i>want&nbsp;</i>to do direct work in an organisation, finding a job is not usually easy. This is also a big reason why a lot of people simply do not even consider looking for a job in an EA organisation in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We think that a considerable number of effective altruists who couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t even try to get a job in EA organisations (due to high competition, lack of expertise, or distant location) may be overlooking extremely impactful career opportunities in animal advocacy.</strong> In this post, we\u2019ll show how these career opportunities might be a good fit for many effective altruists that experience similar difficulties and bottlenecks in their career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We are not claiming that effective altruists should necessarily pursue a job in EA organisations, or stop looking for jobs in other EA cause areas, or prioritise animal advocacy over other causes or vice versa. Nor do we suggest that animal advocacy is inherently easier or that people should invariably pick more convenient options. Our goal is to simply point out additional possibilities for those who may be a good (or even better) fit for them.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Challenges in securing EA jobs</h2><p><strong>It is not easy to get a job in the EA space, especially if you don\u2019t have the right qualifications or live in high income countries.</strong></p><p>While 80,000 Hours constantly updates EAs with hundreds of new roles in its job board, there are hundreds of thousands of people who apply for these roles too. As a result of this high demand, most hiring rounds are extremely competitive, which lowers the probability of getting hired.</p><p>In addition, regardless of the competitive nature of these jobs, required or desired qualifications are sometimes quite high and specific. For example, many AI safety positions typically require qualifications related to computer science and programming, while pandemic preparedness positions may require qualifications related to medicine or governance, and so forth.&nbsp;</p><p>While this doesn\u2019t imply that these fields exclude job opportunities for other skill sets, the available positions are limited and extremely competitive due to the sheer number of applicants.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of these challenges, geographical constraints can complicate matters. While some job opportunities are remote, most are not. Unless you are willing to relocate and have working permits, these job postings do not really count as opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This can be especially true for people who do not live in high income countries.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>For those in countries like Australia or Germany, obtaining work permits for the US or the UK may be relatively easier. However, it\u2019s not as simple for individuals residing in places like Peru, Thailand or T\u00fcrkiye (previously Turkey). Moreover, demonstrating your credentials can be comparatively tougher if you were born and raised in developing countries, as educational institutions or domestic firms may lack international recognition.</p><p>This is not to say that it is impossible to get a job in EA organisations, or that you should simply give up.&nbsp;<strong>Regardless of the challenges, you may very well overcome them and it may be worth it, especially considering the potential for meaningful impact.</strong> We are just&nbsp;<i>describing&nbsp;</i>how difficult it&nbsp;<i>can be</i>. And our guess is that this is how at least some people in the community experience their pursuit of jobs in the EA space (or the lack of it due to these high challenges).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>There are high impact opportunities available in the animal advocacy space</h2><p>In the animal advocacy field, there are numerous high-impact opportunities available. These organisations work towards ending the worst forms of factory farming via welfare reforms, developing alternatives to animal products, researching new and better ways to help animals, and building a stronger and larger movement for animals.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these organisations are large, some of them are small. Overall, we estimate that about 400 new job openings emerge annually. Moreover, the potential for substantial impact extends beyond traditional roles within existing organisations. As we'll explain further below, you also have the chance to make a significant impact by founding your own organisation.</p><p>Impact opportunities within these organisations, as well as potential new organisations, hold substantial promise. Animal suffering is a very pressing problem: it involves the suffering of billions of animals and is highly neglected.&nbsp;</p><p>Highly tractable interventions (such as corporate animal welfare campaigns), as well as relatively less tractable but potentially more transformative and long term interventions, (such as developing competitive alternative proteins or movement building programs) are available for advocates who want to make a difference for animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By having a role in these efforts, you can contribute to helping&nbsp;<i>millions&nbsp;</i>of suffering animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Animal advocacy organisations need more talent&nbsp;</h3><p>While animal advocacy organisations have many bottlenecks and face various challenges, such as lack of funding or low public awareness,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/animal-advocacy-bottlenecks\"><u>a lot of them report</u></a> that they are also constrained by lack of competent and passionate advocates.&nbsp;</p><p>This shortage is crucial because advocates are the ones who drive change. Without a strong team working on tough problems and carrying out complex tasks for long periods of time, the organisation (and the movement) can struggle to achieve their objectives, regardless of funding or favourable social conditions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Therefore, the animal advocacy movement needs many talented advocates that commit their&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>career&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>to make a sizable contribution to its progress.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, animal advocacy work is often seen and expected as \u201cvolunteering\u201d rather than a viable \u201ccareer\u201d. Due to these misconceptions (which we\u2019ll clarify below), many people don\u2019t consider careers in animal advocacy organisations seriously. This naturally leads to a smaller candidate pool and a talent shortage for these organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, you can even have a higher comparative impact potential if you have skills that are relatively rare in the movement. Our previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/animal-advocacy-bottlenecks\"><u>survey</u></a> shows that fundraising and leadership roles are especially harder to hire. Many organisations struggle to hire for these positions,&nbsp; which often go unfilled and tend to be less competitive than roles where there is a surplus of qualified candidates.</p><p>For these reasons, bringing additional talent into animal advocacy is crucial, and can have a high marginal utility and (counterfactually adjusted) value. This is why Animal Advocacy Careers focuses on channelling more talented and passionate people into the movement, who can impact animals and have a fulfilling career.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Some upsides related to animal advocacy careers</h2><h3>You don\u2019t necessarily need to have a certain degree&nbsp;</h3><p>Many successful animal advocates don\u2019t have degrees directly aligned with their roles in the organisations they work for. The majority of skills required in those roles can be learned and developed. A lot of organisations typically look for generalist skills and credentials rather than special expertise in a certain field.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if your degree seems unrelated to animal advocacy roles (such as engineering, law, business, philosophy, economics, etc.), don\u2019t assume these roles aren\u2019t suitable for you. There is no \u201canimal advocacy studies\u201d degree that perfectly fits these roles. (Besides that, there might be some roles in animal advocacy organisations that match with your education). What truly matters is using the skills you developed and will develop over time to help animals, regardless of your educational background.&nbsp;</p><h3>You don\u2019t necessarily need to be a seasoned activist or vegan&nbsp;</h3><p>While most organisations seek mission aligned candidates, what they primarily look for are individuals who&nbsp; can excel in their job with passion, and impact animals as a result. So, while having a history of activism and being vegan can be beneficial, these factors are not always the primary indicators of selection. Most organisations would prefer candidates that are not necessarily activists or vegan, but are competent and reliable colleagues.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the level of activism and veganism differ between organisations, so you can also choose which organisations would be a better fit for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So, don\u2019t just shy away from considering animal advocacy roles, if you didn\u2019t participate in a protest before or you still consume animal products.&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Not being born and raised in very high income countries is not a disadvantage, in most cases it\u2019s a plus</h3><p>Contrary to some fields like AI safety or international governance, being born and raised in countries outside of high-income regions can be advantageous in animal advocacy. Factory farming is a global problem and animals are raised and slaughtered in almost every region of the world. Most farmed animals in the world are not raised and consumed in North America and Western Europe. Due to economic and population growth, industrial animal agriculture also grew exponentially in other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Some countries and regions of the world host a notably high concentration of farmed animals, driven by their large populations and preference for smaller-bodied animals in the market, such as fish and shrimp. Developing countries hold significant potential for improving animal welfare, due to the immense amount of animal production that already exists and expected growth in this sector due to further population and economic growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Despite this need, most animal advocacy efforts are concentrated in the US and Western Europe, while the majority of animals are raised and slaughtered in other regions of the world.</strong> Farmed animal advocacy organisations are far fewer in number and size in the West than in other regions.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, there is a high need for more talented animal advocates and a great potential to impact animals in these regions if more competent and passionate people are involved (You can check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/2022-effective-animal-advocacy-forum-survey\"><u>Rethink Priorities survey</u></a> that analyse the views of many key decision makers in the movement).</p><p><strong>So, if you are living in a country that has an animal agriculture industry (you most probably are), and you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t relocate to another country, you most probably still have the opportunity to create a lot of impact in your own country.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Financial compensation is good, especially relative to Low and Middle Income Countries\u2019 median wages</h3><p>An animal advocacy career might not sound like the most financially rewarding type of career. And that is true, there are obviously other career paths that can provide better wages. But a lot of people are mistaken about the current rate of pay in EA-aligned animal advocacy organisations. Some might believe that most advocates are practically \u201cvolunteers\u201d (i.e. doing it without pay) or receive a very minimal salary. This perception is not groundless, since most charity sectors are extremely funding constrained and commit to high levels of austerity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Farmed animal advocacy organisations have historically faced similar challenges due to limited resources, which has contributed to slower progress. However, the landscape has evolved significantly. Thanks to increased philanthropic funding and effective giving of individual donors, the financial health of animal advocacy organisations has improved considerably and they can provide much better financial compensation for their employees. This, of course, varies between organisations, depending on their track record of success (thus funder interest), size, region and the type of work they are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In most cases, current rates of pay are \u201cat least\u201d in the range of national median wages. You can check some of the job postings in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/job-board\"><u>job board</u></a> for further details. In low and middle income countries, salaries might exceed local median wages, due to differences in currency rates and purchasing power. Philanthropic support for these regions is very strong due to their cost-effectiveness potential, and grants can typically cover budgets that can pay for very competitive wages by LMIC standards.&nbsp;</p><h3>You can start working part-time or begin a side project&nbsp;</h3><p>While career opportunities in animal advocacy may come with many positive aspects, changing your job and existing career path might feel daunting (and just wait to hear what your parents have to say!). But you don\u2019t need to start a full time position if that doesn\u2019t fit your preferences at the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>You can start your journey without quitting your current job or career path. Many organisations have part-time roles or may accept part-time applications. You can also try volunteering for a period of time too.&nbsp;</p><p>This can also allow you to test your fitness for various options, and to safely navigate certain risks without damaging your existing career progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>You can also found your own organisation</h3><p>You might be thinking now that there isn\u2019t any farmed animal advocacy organisation in your country, or the ones that exist are either not very EA-aligned or can\u2019t provide many employment opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, you can also create your own role by founding a new organisation. While this may sound surreal or well above your skills (which may also be true), most founders also felt similar uncertainties and anxieties too, and yet they succeeded at the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are many supporting and mentoring organisations like Charity Entrepreneurship, Open Wing Alliance, or The Good Food Institute, that can provide you information and direction for your project. Since initial funding needs are typically modest, due to minimal staff numbers at the start, funding is also not the greatest bottleneck, especially if you want to pursue a tractable intervention in a region where there are lots of farmed animals and farmed animal advocacy is neglected. Open Wing Alliance, Animal Charity Evaluators Movement Grants and EA Animal Welfare Funds provide grants to NGOs as well as informal groups or individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as mentioned above, you can also start your own organisation as a side project, without necessarily leaving your \u201cdaytime job\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Some options that seem especially tractable for potential founders</p><p>Through our conversations with certain stakeholders, we think founders that focus on corporate animal welfare reforms in Cyprus, Georgia, Hungary, Malta, Mauritius, Philippines, Slovenia may be especially promising due to the relative favourable socioeconomic conditions which increase the odds of success, or relative neglectedness of farmed animal advocacy compared to the scale of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(This is not to say that other interventions in other regions are less impactful - they are probably many that hold much more potential. We are just under the impression that these options may be low hanging fruits.)&nbsp;</p><h2><br>Ending note: getting a job in animal advocacy is also not easy and involves many uncertainties in terms of delivering impact for animals.&nbsp;</h2><p>This post should not be read as if getting a job in animal advocacy is easy, and one can immediately impact animals by just joining an organisation or starting a new one. Hiring rounds in many animal advocacy organisations are also very competitive. The process of getting a job might be very stressful, take a long time and require developing certain skills and credentials. Founding an organisation and receiving funding is definitely not easy as well.&nbsp;</p><p>And by no means, \u201cjust\u201d getting a job does not guarantee a positive outcome for animals. Animal advocacy is complex and challenging. Progress is never easy and straightforward. Advocates need to succeed as a team to make a change for animals and this process involves many inevitable uncertainties.</p><p>So, while we are suggesting not to overlook career opportunities in the animal advocacy space, we are also not suggesting that you should overlook the difficulties and uncertainties related to animal advocacy careers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Interested?

I do not claim that my experience will be the same as other charity founders as all the charities are different. For the purpose of brevity this post doesn't cover everything that I do in my job. Starting a charity is a big commitment and requires serious consideration so I recommend checking out other resources on how to start charities before you make a decision to become a founder, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\">Charity Entrepreneurship</a>.</p><p><br><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong></p><p>Thanks to Allison Agnello, Christina Schmidt Ibanez and Constance Li for your valuable feedback and suggestions! \ud83d\ude4f</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What\u2019s my current job and how I got here:</strong></p><p>Co-founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.impactfulanimaladvocacy.org/\"><u>Impactful Animal Advocacy</u></a> (IAA) -&nbsp;an ecosystem of&nbsp;community, knowledge, and tools that supports a more coordinated and strategic animal advocacy movement.</p><p>I started this as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ya8THw57ZPQTetv48/introducing-impactful-animal-advocacy-community-newsletter\"><u>volunteer project</u></a> in June 2022, first with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Lk347A\"><u>monthly newsletter</u></a> then expanding to include a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/45SV6ur\"><u>Slack community</u></a>. Last month, I decided to work on IAA full-time after seeing significant community growth and a path for counterfactual impact.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who is this post for</strong></p><p>People who are interested in starting a charity or people who are curious about what it\u2019s like.</p><p>As a relatively recent charity founder, I can make comparisons between what is a \u201cnormal job\u201d and this job (while it\u2019s relatively fresh in my head).</p><p>Because my charity does community building, I speak to many people about their work and plans, and some advocates are considering starting their own organization. I hope this will help you evaluate whether the job is for you, and should you decide to start a new organization, you\u2019ll be all the more prepared for it.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What\u2019s the job about</strong></p><p>You start, build, and run the charity. Because it\u2019s likely that it will just be you or your co-founder(s), you\u2019ll be doing a lot of different things (more about this below). This is a senior management position and it\u2019s a lot of responsibility. However, it\u2019s different from senior roles in more established organizations in a couple of ways. For example, the variety of tasks you have to do (both high-level and admin work) is higher, there is a lot more uncertainty and risk, and a lot more freedom in which interventions to run and how to run them. Starting a charity&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/founder-impactful-organisations/\"><u>could be one of the most impactful things</u></a> you can do with your career if you\u2019re the right fit for it.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Past job experiences that may help</strong></p><p>My most recent role was Head of Programmes at Animal Advocacy Careers. Before that, I was a Project Manager and a Partnership Manager at Veganuary where I took on various roles in management and marketing. I\u2019ve also worked in a couple of start-ups which added to my entrepreneurial experience. All these roles combined have helped me a lot. The skills that help me most from my past experiences are bootstrapping projects, project and people management.&nbsp;</p><p>On the whole, I don\u2019t think there is any set of experiences that are essential for this job. Each charity idea will have its own requirements and even the best co-founder pair won\u2019t have all of them. For example, if you start a charity in policy, experience in policy change is likely to make your job much easier, but there are still many other skills that you need to have to succeed. Looking at our community-building project, both my co-founder and I are very good at networking and relationship-building, which are key skills that our project needs. However, we are still learning many other skills that we need, like fundraising.&nbsp;</p><p>Some founders succeed without any experience, often coming right out of college (Charity Entrepreneurship has incubated several orgs like this!). If you think this kind of role is a great personal fit, but you don\u2019t have much working experience, it might be worthwhile to trial or test. I started the newsletter as a volunteer project and it gave me one year of feedback before deciding to take the project full-time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What helps to do this role well</strong></p><p>There are a couple of paths to starting a charity: you can do it yourself, you can start it with someone else, or you can go through an incubator to be matched with an idea and a co-founder.&nbsp;</p><p>I had an idea for IAA on my own, worked on it part-time on the side, then found a co-founder half a year later, and then found the money for the project (after a year of doing it as a volunteer). I didn\u2019t go through an incubator. I have also started other projects before, mostly myself, and I\u2019ve learned about what works and what doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Here are some factors that are likely to increase your chances of success:</p><ol><li><strong>A good co-founder.&nbsp;</strong><br>I\u2019ve started projects both on my own and with a co-founder and, in my opinion (which coincides with the entrepreneurship community in EA), it\u2019s so much better to do it together with another person. It\u2019s been shown that two co-founder teams do much better and for a good reason. You\u2019ll need so many skills to build an organization that it\u2019s impossible for just one person to have all of them.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Choose a co-founder wisely</strong>: I\u2019m not an expert at co-founder matching, but in my experience, it helps if you\u2019re both passionate about the cause and have complementary skills and you both enjoy working together.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Co-founders can be helpful!</strong> Having a co-founder may help you to make better decisions and produce work of higher quality because you have two pairs of eyes and two minds that have different perspectives. Running a charity together helps cope with the role emotionally as well because you will have harder days and your motivation will waiver sometimes, and having someone who is just as committed as you helps a lot.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>There are downsides to having a co-founder</strong>. You will \u201cco-own\u201d the organization together, so every decision is not 100% up to you. You will have to negotiate and compromise on some things. However, I\u2019ve found that if you have a good relationship and take ownership of different areas of the nonprofit, it\u2019s not as large of a problem.<br><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Going through an incubator.&nbsp;</strong><br>There are a couple of charity/project incubators around, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship</u></a> (CE) (by the way, they are looking for founders until 30th September) or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://provegincubator.com/kickstartingforgood/\"><u>Kickstart for Good</u></a>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Incubators can be helpful</strong>: with ideas, co-founder matching, training, mentorship, and even funding. They have significant experience and that can help you avoid common pitfalls that new charities may face.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Downsides of an incubator</strong>: They are often highly competitive and selective about the founders accepted to participate in their programs. Additionally, the program may restrict your charity\u2019s idea and execution, because the money and support team are sponsored by the incubator. All incubators differ when it comes to the freedom you\u2019ll have in decision-making, so it\u2019s worth asking about this&nbsp;<i>before</i> you apply/start the program. The takeaway is that if you go through an incubator, you\u2019re not going to have 100% freedom on your charity/project idea and how to execute it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A good network of smart people who can advise you</strong><br>It\u2019s impossible to know everything needed to lead a charity effectively. Thankfully, you can access these skills and knowledge through other people. A good network helps a lot. This could be an entrepreneurship hub, a mentor, other charity founders, or industry experts that support your organization\u2019s mission.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mental and physical wellness </strong>Starting a charity may be more intense than just starting a new job \u2013 I had to put in more hours than into a normal job (60+ a week) and go through a roller-coaster of new experiences and emotions. I also had to put a lot of personal things on hold to focus on my new project (other side projects, buying a house, hobbies like language learning). I would recommend being mentally and physically healthy in order to go through this process.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goalswon.com/giving-back\"><u>I have an accountability coach</u></a> who helps me keep my wellness habits up every day and this supports my work a lot. I also have a partner who helps me with chores and life admin tasks when I\u2019m short on time.</li></ol><p><br><strong>What I do day-to-day</strong></p><p>Every day is different - this is what I like most about this job. For example, on Monday I might work on budget and marketing, on Tuesday I could be applying for funding and meeting collaborators, and on Wednesday I might be reviewing my team\u2019s work and focusing on personnel management.</p><p>Every week I have about 10 hours worth of meetings, about 50% external and 50% internal. This is likely to go up as I progress in this role. Since most of my team is in the US and I\u2019m in the UK, I have most mornings free to focus on getting tasks done and then afternoons are frequently back-to-back meetings with some breaks. Many European people who work with US colleagues often say that they have to work later (up until 9pm) to accommodate different time zones, which is true for me too. I am lucky to have focus time, but I\u2019ve been told that this will diminish as the team and their needs grow. I try to block off at least two meeting-free days which have been very useful so far.</p><p>I was surprised by the quantity of admin tasks that are needed to co-found a charity. Registering for various things, updating passwords, booking travel, entering data \u2013 it\u2019s a lot! As a new charity founder, you\u2019ll have to do all the tasks whether you like them or not, and you are unlikely to be able to delegate them to others until you hire an operations manager or an assistant.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The best things about this role</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The variety.</strong> As mentioned above. No day is ever the same.</li><li><strong>The challenging nature of the role</strong>. Most days I wake up not knowing how I\u2019ll tackle certain issues and just figure it out as I go along. I love it! You never get bored.</li><li><strong>Learning and upskilling.</strong> You will learn so much about so many things. Budgeting, fundraising, management. The learning never stops. Just as you get comfortable with one skill, you need to learn another skill.</li><li><strong>Networking opportunities.</strong> You naturally need to talk to more people as a charity founder, whether for collaboration, learning, fundraising or recruiting. I\u2019ve noticed that in comparison to being an employee, my network grows much faster when I\u2019m leading a project.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Freedom.</strong> Since it\u2019s your organization, you can do whatever you want with it (within reason), and this refers to every single aspect of your organization. It\u2019s nice knowing that no one is looking over your shoulder so you can work whenever and wherever you want. This may change as your organization grows, as you may become accountable to funders and/or a board of directors.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ability to build things from the ground up</strong>. In my previous jobs, I wasn\u2019t the ultimate decision-maker and had to run changes past my manager. Without organizational bureaucracy, it is so easy to fix issues! I also get to create the organizational culture and values right from the beginning.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fun!</strong> All the above makes the job very enjoyable for the right person. Most days, I don\u2019t want to stop working because I enjoy the vast majority of my tasks and projects. I\u2019m very happy at work in general!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The skills I use most</strong></p><ul><li>Strategizing, planning, and organising</li><li>Management (currently managing 3 team members)</li><li>Idea assessments and decision-making</li><li>Networking, both online and attending conferences</li><li>Fundraising</li><li>Writing&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Main challenges</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzdz955dl8t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzdz955dl8t\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><ul><li><strong>Idea + execution + luck (good environment, people).&nbsp;</strong>Many factors are needed for a new charity to succeed, including a good idea that is likely to make an impact, a solid support network, good execution, and also, luck!&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Evaluation</strong>. To have greater confidence that your charity\u2019s work could have a high impact, it will require ongoing diligence. It\u2019s tempting to start a project based on intuition alone (which may be important to a degree), but I want to confirm our ideas with any information and/or evidence. It might be difficult to find the time to consider expected value, track the efficacy, and better understand the risks when there are so many other tasks to do. Carefully considering failure modes, alternatives, and potential negative externalities takes time. However, the time spent upfront and in maintenance can help save you from wasting time on the wrong project.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Funding.&nbsp;</strong>I ran this project as a volunteer for the first year, which is difficult to balance with a different full-time job. Even with seed funding, the uncertainty about future funding can be nerve-wracking.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Decision-making and prioritization</strong>. The founder is the one responsible for keeping the organization aligned with the strategic mission \u2013 which can be difficult when there are so many potential projects and problems to solve! IAA uses a decision-making tree tool to help keep us focused and triage projects. On a more granular level, I have a sea of tasks and all of them are competing for my time and attention. One of the best tips I received is knowing what NOT to do - you will never ever get to the bottom of your to-do list. Every day, I have to make decisions that affect the organization, and sometimes they are really important. I can consult advisors or discuss with my co-founder, but eventually, about half of the decisions are up to me. Some days I suffer from decision-making fatigue, especially by the end of the week. I can see why some people wear the same clothes to work \u2013&nbsp; it\u2019s one fewer decision you have to make!&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Dealing with uncertainty</strong>. Most new charities operate with a lot of uncertainty because the interventions are experimental or dependent on assumptions. It can be hard to emotionally deal with that uncertainty on a daily basis. You can try to take different worldviews to anticipate and prepare for various outcomes, but we cannot predict the future with full certainty. This makes decision-making difficult and there is a risk of analysis paralysis and constant indecisiveness.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Freedom is a double-edged sword</strong>. Sometimes I get very ambitious about what my organization can do, but eventually, I still have to deal with reality. It\u2019s disappointing knowing that I can do anything but need to limit myself to a couple of projects.</li><li><strong>Failing</strong>. You need to get very comfortable with being corrected, critiqued, and generally getting things wrong the first time (and even the second and third times). Interestingly, what really helped me was my experience of language learning. I see being corrected as positive feedback that helps me grow as a leader.</li><li><strong>Becoming an expert in your field</strong>. If you start a charity, you will specialize in a particular topic and you will have to learn a lot about it. If you\u2019re not a subject-matter expert from the start, you will have to learn a lot and quickly.</li><li><strong>Switching off and personal life sacrifice</strong>. At times, it can feel like you are \u201cmarried\u201d to your co-founder and to your charity, especially when your personal identity is tied to them. I\u2019ve found life-work&nbsp;<i>integration</i> is more realistic than work-life balance, because the lines are often blurred when your work is also your passion. I have started implementing some healthier practices, like finishing work at a certain hour and not working much during weekends (when possible).<br>Being a co-founder has resulted in compromising changes to my personal life. For example, I travel a lot, meaning more time away from my partner. Late evening calls with my American colleagues cut into the time I\u2019d normally spend with my family. Sometimes I feel I am working 24/7, especially when I attend conferences over the weekend and then have to go back to work on Monday.</li><li><strong>Emotional rollercoaster.</strong> Starting a charity is emotionally really, really hard. Harder than I expected. It challenges both my personal strength and my professional competencies. Some days, I\u2019m really happy and pleased with my work, and other days I struggle. Throughout the rollercoaster, I persevere and it has helped me feel extra motivated \u2013 especially when I can find a small win in the hard times! While all of this is going on, your confidence is challenged, impostor syndrome can be especially prominent, and you will have to overcome a lot of mental barriers. I definitely recommend considering regular professional mental health help and pacing yourself. This job was never meant to be easy, and, as the Charity Entrepreneurship team&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/book\"><u>say in their book</u></a>, even the best charities have bad days :)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Traits that really help in this role</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Proactivity and initiative</strong>. In my humble opinion, this is the most important skill! It\u2019s different from most \u201cnormal\u201d jobs because it\u2019s up to you to make things happen. To ask the right questions at the right time and prioritize the most pressing issues. It takes a lot of courage to have uncomfortable conversations and address things that may seem small now but could snowball later.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Delegation</strong>. I am very independent and like doing things myself, but in this position, I can no longer do everything myself. It\u2019s hard to get used to knowing when to delegate and ask for help, especially when you have to recognize that you\u2019re not as good at a task as someone else on the team.</li><li><strong>Enthusiasm</strong>. The job of a charity founder requires you to do a lot of things, and chances are that you\u2019ve never done most of them before. I\u2019ve found it helpful to approach these new tasks with interest and curiosity.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Tenacity</strong>. Sometimes despite doing your best, things don\u2019t go according to plan. Even though I feel disappointed about something on a weekly basis, I know that I have the internal strength to overcome these challenges. Our work is really important, and keeping that in mind helps me to see other perspectives.</li><li><strong>Diplomacy</strong>. A lot of my current role involves building relationships with other stakeholders, organizations, and community members. It\u2019s important to quickly understand the relationships and dynamics at play within the industry/movement. Some spaces are more political than others, so I imagine this varies by sector.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ambition</strong>. You have to create a compelling vision for the organization and plan things that may seem impossible at the time, often anticipating years in the future. Be prepared for people to think that you\u2019re too ambitious and have solid evidence/theory of change to back your reasoning. You have to be \u201cthe engine\u201d of the organization to propel it forward.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Knowing when to ask for help</strong>. In the past, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable saying \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Sometimes I feel that I\u2019m supposed to know everything and I\u2019m afraid of admitting that I don\u2019t get something. If people don\u2019t know you need help, they can\u2019t help you. You can figure things out yourself, but it may be more time effective to ask for help.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnzdz955dl8t\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefzdz955dl8t\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>These challenges and helpful traits are specific to my situation founding IAA, and I recognize they might not be applicable to every co-founder or charity.

However, I think there are a lot of high-impact careers in HVAC and I want to give some more context for that.</p><p>I work at a major HVAC equipment manufacturer. I do research and development, which means that I look at new technologies and prototype ways they could be incorporated into products.</p><p>I think there are two routes to having impact in HVAC equipment design, and I'm lucky enough to be able to work on both:</p><ol><li>Reduce the environmental impact of HVAC equipment (either in terms of how much carbon it takes to manufacture the equipment or in terms of the efficiency of the equipment). Climate change isn't often considered a very \"EA\" issue because it's not very neglected. However, I think there are a lot of low hanging fruit in HVAC. Based on the new products I've seen my team and other companies we compete with roll out, I'd guess that a very smart person in HVAC could reduce global annual carbon emissions by 0.01% to 0.2% over the course of a career.</li><li>Reduce the spread of diseases (through improved ventilation, filtration, etc.). This is actually much less tractable as an engineer in an established company I think. Because customers are relatively unwilling to pay for IAQ systems, manufacturers aren't doing a lot of work on it. However, there are a lot of startups which are much more focused on this issue.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Job</h1><p>My job involves the following work:</p><ul><li>Identifying new technologies (10% of my time): This involves reading academic papers, looking through science news websites, going to conferences, and listening to startup pitches. Sometimes it's clear how a technology would slot into HVAC products and other times it takes brainstorming to think of how it might be useful.</li><li>Doing shallow investigations of promising technologies (15% of my time): This involves running the numbers to see if a technology could be feasible. It also involves seeing if the numbers quoted to us by a startup or vendor are physically plausible.</li><li>Designing, building, and testing prototypes (25% of my time): Once we've decided to pursue an idea, we try to build and test a prototype. Sometimes this involves working with machinists to fabricate new components, other times it just involves modifying control software. It almost always involves putting temperature and pressure sensors all over a piece of HVAC equipment and measuring the results.</li><li>Modeling (40% of my time): We analyze test data and try to make predictions about how the technology will perform across a wide range of operating conditions.</li><li>Communication (10% of my time): We work with our marketing department to build a business case for a new technology.</li></ul><h1>My path to the job</h1><p>I've been in this role for three years. It was my first job after finishing my bachelors in mechanical engineering. I wasn't thinking about impact when I got into it. But the more I've worked on HVAC, the more convinced I am that it's where I have the greatest potential to make a difference.</p><p>I think you'd have an easy time getting a job in HVAC R&amp;D if you've completed a bachelors in mechanical engineering. Aerospace engineers and electrical engineers are also needed.

This is written in my capacity as a Researcher for Giving What We Can. I helped drive the hiring process along with several other team members. The main motivation of the post is to:</p><ul><li>Provide more information for applicants on what the hiring process looked like internally.</li><li>Share our lessons learned so that other organisations can improve their hiring processes by avoiding our mistakes and copying what we think we did well.</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><ul><li>We received ~145 applications from a diverse pool of candidates, and made one hire.</li><li>We had four stages:<ul><li>An initial series of short answer questions \u2014 24/145 moved to the next stage.</li><li>A ~2-hour work test \u2014 5/24 moved to the next stage.</li><li>A work trial (11-hours total) \u2014 2/5 moved to the next stage.&nbsp;</li><li>A final interview and reference checks \u2014 we made one offer.</li></ul></li><li>There are parts of the hiring process that we think went well:<ul><li>We had a large and highly diverse pool of candidates.</li><li>We provided at least some feedback for every stage of the application process, giving more detail for later stages.&nbsp;</li><li>We think there were advantages to our heavy reliance on work tests and trials, and the ways we graded them (e.g. anonymously, and by response rather than by candidate).&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>There are ways we could have done better:<ul><li>Our work trial was overly intense and stressful, and unrepresentative of working at GWWC.</li><li>We could have provided better guidance and/or tools for how long to take on the initial application tasks.</li><li>We could have had better communication at various stages, e.g. on the meaning of some of the scores shared as feedback on that application.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>What we did&nbsp;</h2><p>In this section, I\u2019ll outline the stages of our hiring process and share some reflections specific to each. The next section will provide some more general reflections.</p><h3>Advertising the role</h3><p>We made a reasonable effort into ensuring we had as large and diverse a pool of candidates for the role as we could. Some of the things we did include:</p><ul><li>Before the role opened, our Director of Research Sjir Hoeijmakers attended EAGxIndia and EAGxLatAm, in part motivated to meet potential candidates (we thought it was likely we would hire another person to our research team later in the year).&nbsp;</li><li>Once the role opened:<ul><li>Many of our team reached out to our own personal networks to advertise the role, especially to those from less represented backgrounds.&nbsp;</li><li>We advertised the role on our newsletter, 80,000 Hours\u2019 job board, and used High Impact Professionals\u2019 directory to reach out to candidates outside our networks.</li></ul></li></ul><p>We think this contributed to a diverse applicant pool, including many candidates with backgrounds, experience, and perspectives that we felt were underrepresented by the existing team:</p><ul><li>The majority of applicants at the work test and work trial stage were women (we mostly graded applicants blindly \u2014 more details below).</li><li>When we asked the 145 applications for their country of residence, roughly half were non-English speaking countries, and the majority of those were outside of Europe.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>The initial application</h3><p>We asked applicants to fill in an Airtable form which asked for:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>General information and permissions (e.g., whether they wanted to opt-in to receiving feedback or to us proactively referring them to other related roles in the future).</li><li>Their LinkedIn profile and/or resume.</li><li>Answers to short-answer questions, about:<ul><li>Their background with effective altruism or effective giving and interest in the role.</li><li>Specific questions that functioned more as a very quick test (providing an elevator pitch on effective giving, and giving feedback on our recommended charities page).</li></ul></li></ul><p>We then created a spreadsheet view for reviewers to grade individual and anonymised&nbsp;<i>responses</i> to each short-answer question (rather than grading candidates). Roughly, each reviewer graded each response out of seven and this allowed us to aggregate all the reviewers\u2019 scores.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zrM2ktic2HEswAwry/mpr55wmqeq3apuqn8jda\"></p><p>We then used this to give us a short-list of ~40 candidates, for whom we also rated their resumes on a 1-7 scale based on a highly subjective judgement of how much relevant experience we thought the candidate had for the role. Using a weighted average (weighting resumes/background information a bit less) we had an ordered list of the highest scoring candidates. Roughly speaking, we then:</p><ul><li>Decided what thresholds to use to, by default, move the candidate forward (or not).</li><li>We went through a selection of applications more granularly and holistically, to make a decision of whether or not to move the candidate forward to the work test. In some cases this included diversity considerations (providing more weight to candidates with backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives that we felt were underrepresented by our existing team).&nbsp;</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zrM2ktic2HEswAwry/vxr9mzvlsoalqh2k3f2y\"></p><p><i>(Note \u2014 the figure above is an example using randomly generated numbers and does not reflect actual applicant scores.)</i></p><p>For candidates who (a) we did not move forward; (b) opted into feedback sharing; (c) scored above a certain threshold, we shared a view (like the one above, but with actual scores). This allowed us to provide at least some feedback, but with minimal effort.</p><p><strong>Reflections on this stage:</strong></p><ul><li>What went well:<ul><li>We liked our grading system overall. Reviewers all agreed that reviewing specific responses to a particular question improved the quality of their grading.&nbsp;</li><li>We liked the balance we struck between preserving anonymity for most of the process, but also including some room for diversity considerations to play a role.</li><li>We think it was the right call to pay less attention to resumes. Though our subjective impression is that they did correlate with work test and trial scores, there were plenty of exceptions where a candidate with a lower scoring resume scored highly on the tests, and vice versa.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>What we could have done better:<ul><li>From the feedback form we shared with all candidates, we learned that while feedback was appreciated, it was hard to make sense of what the scores meant and why they were given. We gave further feedback to candidates who asked, and made improvements to the feedback shared at the work test stage:<ul><li>We added a more detailed rubric of how we graded responses.</li><li>We provided some exemplar responses, so candidates could see what a high scoring response looked like.</li></ul></li><li>One regret is that we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/careers/research-communicator\"><u>shared</u></a> that this stage would take 20\u201360 minutes, but on reflection, we expect many candidates spent longer (potentially, much longer) on this, and that this time may have in fact improved their application. In retrospect, we could have ensured this was done on a time-limited basis, or provided a more reasonable estimate.

This allowed us to time the test, as we could see when they started, but also allowed candidates to take the test at a time of their own convenience.&nbsp;</li><li>We graded responses and decided which candidates to move forward using the same process as we did for the initial application.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zrM2ktic2HEswAwry/hb1ufmlqns7shzfzq1zh\"></p><p><strong>Reflections on this stage:</strong></p><ul><li>What went well:<ul><li>This stage was probably the most successful of all our stages, in part because we found we received substantial information from how candidates performed on the test (arguably, it provided more information than the work-trial!).&nbsp;</li><li>GuidedTrack had several advantages:<ul><li>We could time tests (which turned out to be important, as several candidates did in fact go over-time).&nbsp;</li><li>Candidates could take the test at their own convenience.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Candidates followed instructions as we intended, in part because we erred on over-communicating these instructions (via an instruction document which linked to a short video explainer, our email to applicants, and on the test itself). Usually, at this stage, we would expect some confusion and back-and-forth.</li><li>We were able to give much more detailed feedback for candidates, based on the lessons learned from the previous stage. This included:<ul><li>Their raw scores (compared to other candidates) and comments from reviewers.&nbsp;</li><li>Exemplar responses.</li><li>An explanation on how we graded responses in general.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What could have been improved:<ul><li>I don\u2019t think we shared a timeline on when we would get back to candidates with more information, and I think it would have been good to do so.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>The work trial</h3><p>This stage worked very similarly to the work test, except we had two tests:</p><ul><li>One 3-hour test.</li><li>One 8-hour test (including a 1-hour break).</li></ul><p>These were written to, as closely as possible, resemble the type of work we imagine the candidate would go on to do, and each included a meeting with a member of our team.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reflections on this stage:</strong></p><p>In retrospect, the 8-hour test being done in a single block of time was a mistake. In addition to scheduling and time-zone issues (I had some of my calls scheduled on weekends, before 7am, and after 11pm) it was overly intense and stressful, and not reflective of what it would be like in the role. While we decided to do this to ensure consistency between candidates, in retrospect, these considerations outweighed the potential advantages of other approaches (like an honest-timed test that could be taken over several days, or possibly weeks).</p><p>Another issue was that we provided candidates with very little time (one week) to take the test. While we also shared that such short notice might not be possible, and that requesting an extension would not negatively impact the application, this level of pressure was arguably not reasonable.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, a consequence of our choices here is that one of our five candidates \u2014 very understandably \u2014 chose not to proceed with their application. We are especially grateful for the feedback they then shared about why they made this decision. One helpful suggestion they offered us was running a Q&amp;A session with each candidate just before the work trial. This could have been an opportunity to more casually meet with them, and discuss any concerns they might have about the work trial.&nbsp;</p><h3>The interview and reference checks</h3><p>Our interview stage followed a fairly standard process. We shared with candidates the kinds of questions we would ask, and then they met our Director of Research, Sjir, for the interview (which lasted one hour). We also conducted reference checks at this stage.</p><p>We ultimately went into this stage thinking we had two exceptional candidates, and left feeling much the same. Yet, we still think it was an important stage of the process because we could imagine other scenarios in which the interview ended up being decisive. Further, part of the value of the interview is giving candidates an opportunity to meet us and see if we are a good fit for them!&nbsp;</p><h2>General reflection</h2><p>We are overall happy with the hiring process, though we think there are several ways we could do better in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of our largest actionable take-aways for other organisations conducting hiring rounds are:</p><ul><li><strong>Provide feedback</strong> \u2014 while it\u2019s not always possible, as a small organisation we were able to find relatively low-cost ways of giving feedback to candidates.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Solicit feedback&nbsp;\u2014 we think that by having a feedback form at the end of our application, we\u2019ve learned a lot on how we could do better in future hiring processes.</strong></li><li><strong>Use GuidedTrack surveys for work tests</strong> \u2014 we found these really helpful on our end (they were relatively operationally efficient to set up) and yet also allowed candidates to take the tests at their convenience.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Review individual responses where possible</strong> \u2014 this is a bit of a niche suggestion, but all reviewers found they were able to give more calibrated scores when they reviewed individual responses to specific questions, rather than reviewing a candidates\u2019 set of responses all at once. We also noticed this in other hiring rounds.</li></ul><p>One take-away we\u2019d suggest candidates consider is lowering their bar for communicating with the hiring manager. This is likely to be most relevant for applying to organisations with similar hiring processes to GWWC,&nbsp;<strong>but we greatly appreciated when candidates gave us feedback</strong> (good and bad). Also, when candidates reached out to us to ask if we could make an alteration to the process so that they could provide a better and higher quality application, we were often able to do this (and even when we couldn\u2019t, there was no harm in having asked). We understand that this can be difficult, given the dynamic, but speaking personally \u2014 I expect that when I apply for jobs in future, I\u2019m going to be much more likely to email the hiring manager than I was before!</p><p><i>Thank you to Alana Horowitz Friedman, Sjir Hoeijmakers, Katy Moore and several other reviewers for their thoughtful comments.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This post is part of the&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/career-conversations-week-2023\"><i><u>September 2023 Career Conversations Week</u></i></a><i>.

Sometimes you don\u2019t have capacity to tailor feedback to each candidate, particularly at earlier stages of the process. If you have some brief criteria describing what stronger applicants or stronger trial tasks submissions should look like, and if that\u2019s borne out in your decisions about who to progress, I suggest writing out a quick description of what abilities, traits or competencies the successful candidates tended to demonstrate. This might be as quick as \u201ccandidates who progressed to the next stage tended to demonstrate a combination of strong attention to detail in the trial task, demonstrated a clear and direct writing style, and have professional experience in operations.\u201d This shouldn\u2019t take more than a few minutes to generate. My impression is it\u2019s a significant improvement for the candidates over a fully generic response.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Consider borrowing assessment materials<ul><li>Not sure how to test a trait for a given role? Other aligned organisations might have already created evaluation materials tailored to the competencies you want to evaluate. If so, that organization might let you use their trial task for your recruitment round.<ul><li>Ideally, you can do this in a way that\u2019s pretty win-win for both orgs (e.g. Org A borrows a trial task from Org B. Org A then asks their candidates to agree that, should they ever apply to Org B, Org A will send over the results of the assessment).&nbsp;</li><li>I have done this in the past and it worked out well.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Beta test your trial tasks!&nbsp;<ul><li>I\u2019m a huge proponent of beta testing new evaluation materials. Testing your materials before sending them to candidates can save you a world of frustration down the road by helping you tweak unclear instructions, inappropriate time limits, and a whole host of other pitfalls.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Mistakes</h1><p>Taken from our internal hiring resources, here are some mistakes we\u2019ve made in the past with our evaluation materials:</p><ul><li>Trial tasks or tests that are laborious to grade<ul><li>Some types of work tests take a long time to grade effectively. Possible issues can be: a large amount to read, multiple sources or links to check for information, a complicated or difficult-to-apply rubric. Every extra minute this takes you to grade is multiplied by the number of tasks. The ideal work sample test is quick and clear to grade.</li><li>&nbsp;Possible solutions:<ul><li>Think backwards from grading when you create the task.</li><li>Where appropriate, be willing to sacrifice some assessment accuracy for grading speed</li><li>Beta test!</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Tasks that require multiple interactions from the grader<ul><li>Some versions of trial tasks we used in the past had a candidate submit something to which the grader had to respond before the candidate could complete the next step. This turned out to be inefficient and frustrating.&nbsp;</li><li>Solution: avoid this, particularly at early stages.</li></ul></li><li>Too broad<ul><li>Some work tests look for generalist ability but waste the opportunity to test a job-specific skill. The more you can make the task specific to the role, the more information you get. If fast, clear email drafting is critical, test that instead of generically testing communication skill.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Too hard / too easy<ul><li>If you don\u2019t feel like anyone is giving you a reasonable performance on your task, you may have made it too hard.&nbsp;<ul><li>A common driver of this failure mode is assuming context the candidate won\u2019t have or underrating the advantage conferred by context possessed by your staff but not by (most?) of your candidates</li></ul></li><li>Ceiling effects are perhaps a larger problem. If everyone is doing well, you won\u2019t be able to sort applicants by performance.</li><li>Solution: beta test, ideally with people outside your org</li></ul></li><li>Not timed (with an enforcing tool)<ul><li>Letting people self-time may be tempting, but this makes results harder to interpret. If someone has done well, you don\u2019t want to have to spend time wondering if it\u2019s because they spent more time than other applicants / more than they said they spent. Some people will also forget to record time spent (or \u201cforget\u201d) about their time limit and go over. If people spend hugely different amounts of time, you can find yourself comparing apples and oranges.&nbsp;</li><li>Possible solutions:<ul><li>Especially for early stage tasks, I recommend using software like<a href=\"https://www.classmarker.com/\">&nbsp;ClassMarker</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Alternatively, you can use e.g. google docs and spot check results for time infractions.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Overburdened task<ul><li>Trying to make a task measure &nbsp;too many things at once can create noisy, hard to interpret / grade data. This trades off against making sure you're getting evidence for all key role criteria, but in my opinion it's often a worse mistake to create a task that tries to do too many things at once, and therefore doesn\u2019t (as) successfully accomplish any. If you have an assessment material that tests a single thing clearly and efficiently, you can give that assessment first and then test other key criteria later in the round.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Results are opaque to other staff<ul><li>In the past, some work sample tests spat out results only the hiring manager knew how to interpret. If only one person can understand the results, other stakeholders have to defer rather than being able to independently assess the candidate\u2019s performance. This can be particularly frustrating if people disagree about how strong a particular candidate is. Also, if the sole capable interpreter becomes capacity constrained, your round is now bottlenecked.&nbsp;<ul><li>Sometimes skills may be so specialized that somewhat opaque results are a correct tradeoff.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Confusing task<ul><li>Maybe everyone or a subgroup of applicants all misunderstand the task in the same way. Or, they answer in a different way to what you were looking for / different ways from other groups. This makes it hard to compare across answers.&nbsp;</li><li>It may be tempting to make \u201cfigure out what I want from you\u201d a key part of what you\u2019re testing for, but I recommend against this, unless that\u2019s a vital skill for success in the role, as weakness on that \"figuring out\" trait then causes ~complete failure, whatever other skills they may have to offer.</li><li>Solution: again, beta test.</li></ul></li><li>Evaluates candidates for the wrong role<ul><li>Having a poorly scoped role vision can lead to this failure mode. If you\u2019ve designed a role with too many constraints (hiring for an imaginary person!) or focused on a few aspects of the role to the exclusion of other important aspects, the work sample test may similarly target the wrong traits. I propose that the antidote to this failure mode is to spend significant time drawing up a role vision, and pressure test it. If people different than your imagined ideal could perform elegantly in this role, the work sample test (along with the rest of the process) should make it possible for less prototypical candidates to shine, too. More on that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hHRfkdma3KbvXHHZu/hiring-a-couple-of-lessons\">here</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Lack of clarity on what it measures / mistargeted tasks<ul><li>Some tasks might test well for some key role qualities, but miss other important aspects of being able to do the job well (that could have been added into the task). If a role needs traits A, B, and C, but the work sample test only evaluates trait A, then people who would not perform well on the job will pass the work sample test. I think this is fine and often unavoidable for early stage assessment but you should be aware in what ways your assessment is incomplete. More on that in the second section <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hHRfkdma3KbvXHHZu/hiring-a-couple-of-lessons\">here</a>.<ul><li>After drafting your evaluation materials, you may also want to revisit your list of key competencies to see if there\u2019s anything missing that you can easily add in.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>One specific failure mode here is making success on the task totally reliant on a single trait (assuming that trait is not un-controversially role-critical). For example, even if you\u2019d love to find a candidate who speaks excellent Italian, if it\u2019s potentially possible to succeed in that role without that competency, don\u2019t give the work sample test in Italian.</li></ul></li><li>Including pet features<ul><li>Beware of including any features that will bias you without adding information. If you include a reference to a movie you like and some candidates notice it and some miss the reference, can you be confident that that isn\u2019t going to bias you towards the noticers, who are clearly awesome because they enjoy the same things you do? This is a special case of making sure you\u2019re testing for (and evaluating on the basis of) the features you truly care about, and ideally those features alone.</li></ul></li><li>Privileging similarity to self<ul><li>In any type of evaluation, we as evaluators are likely to be biased towards people like ourselves. With work sample tests, there\u2019s a temptation to make tests that look for a bunch of the virtues you most care about, which may be virtues you yourself possess.</li><li>Proposed solution: Read your work sample test and ask yourself, \u201cDoes this sound like a test for being me-like?\u201d If so, be suspicious. &nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Cait_Lion"}}, {"_id": "b5FAcp82RYaJ5n5zW", "title": "Ever Too Many EAs?

Here are two aspects of recruitment where I worry some organisations may be making costly mistakes.</p><h1>Target your role vision (carefully)</h1><p>When a hiring manager identifies the need to hire an additional staff member, I think the process they ought to follow is to figure out that person\u2019s anticipated key responsibilities and then carefully draft a list of competencies which they endorse as predictive of success at those specific tasks. And to the extent possible, they should then evaluate only based on those traits that are (ideally pre-registered) predictors of success.</p><p>What I think sometimes happens instead is something like one of the two following situations:</p><ul><li>The hiring manager imagines a person they would like to fill that role and writes down a list of traits for this imagined individual.</li><li>The hiring manager picks a title for the role and writes down a list of traits and abilities that usually are associated with that role title.</li></ul><p>I think this causes problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Toy example:&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine you are hiring for a new executive assistant. You\u2019ve never had an executive assistant before. You imagine your ideal executive assistant. They are personable, detail oriented, they write extremely clear professional emails, and are highly familiar with the EA community. So you test them on writing, on how warm and personable they are, and on knowledge of EA cause areas. Maybe you hire a recent grad who is an extremely strong writer. Once you hire them, you notice that things aren\u2019t working out because while they write elegant emails, they do so slowly. More importantly, they are struggling to keep track of all the competing priorities you hoped they\u2019d help you handle, and have trouble working on novel tasks autonomously. It turned out, you should have focused instead on someone who can keep track of competing priorities, who is highly productive and can work autonomously, etc. Maybe it turns out that some of those criteria you originally listed were nice-to-haves, but in fact for this particular role at this particular moment, it\u2019s actually correct to prefer a seasoned deadline ninja who is a non-native speaker and writes slightly clunky emails. The person you hired might have also actually been an excellent executive assistant for some people in some contexts, they just weren\u2019t the puzzle piece you most needed. If you had taken the prediction exercise seriously, I claim you would have noticed at least some of the mismatch and adjusted.</p><p>In my opinion, it\u2019s worth investing significant time into targeting your role vision.</p><p>Other benefits:</p><ul><li>Facilitating stakeholder alignment. Often there are a variety of stakeholders in a given hiring round (e.g. other team members, leadership). If you create a thoughtful vision document in advance of launching the round, you can share it with those stakeholders. This can surface and hopefully allow you to resolve previously invisible disagreements that would otherwise have snuck up on you mid-way through the recruitment round.</li><li>(Ideally) fighting bias<ul><li>If you don\u2019t pre-register endorsed traits, you are more likely to be (even more) subconsciously swayed by the candidates\u2019 similarity to you or possession of not-role-relevant status-related traits (e.g. confidence in an interview setting)</li><li>Done effectively, pre-registering endorsed traits should be good for diversity</li></ul></li><li>Noticing/acknowledging confusion earlier in the process. Even if after attempting this exercise you don\u2019t have a strongly held list of traits, then at least you know you don\u2019t know&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>Evaluate the traits you care about (and not related traits)&nbsp;</h1><p>I suspect many EA orgs are using candidate evaluation tools in a way that causes a harmful level of false negatives.&nbsp;</p><p>I don\u2019t think this problem is remotely specific to EA; I would guess we\u2019re significantly better at candidate assessment than the average organisation. But it might be especially harmful in EA. If our recruitment rounds are even slightly prioritizing EA alignment or even EA context, then unlike the many hiring rounds, we are limited to a relatively tiny hiring pool, compared to e.g. someone hiring for a job at a bank. For many roles, organisations also seem to think that the best candidate might be far more impactful than a median candidate. If that\u2019s true and if the starting set of possible people is small, we should care more about false negatives relative to other tradeoffs; if we\u2019re predictably and preventably hiring in a way that risks ruling out the best candidates for a given role, we are likely filling many potentially-impactful positions with people who will be significantly less capable of generating that impact.</p><p>Watching friends go through recruitment rounds at EA orgs, I\u2019m often suspicious that the recruiters are filtering people out using traits correlated with a competency they (should) care about for the role, but not the competency itself. For a real world example, I know of someone applying for a job doing \u201cresearch engineering\u201d and being tested on software engineering generally, rather than on skills specific to the particular type of ML engineering work that seem like they would probably have been the bread and butter of the actual role.</p><p>Another common mistake is grading/rejecting candidates based on whether they can display excellence in a trait that\u2019s useful for the role, but where excellence isn\u2019t required \u2014 you just need a baseline of this trait. A hiring manager might, for example, be filtering candidates based on their performance on a written task reliant on strategic problem-solving because they think \u201coh, it would be nice if this candidate had that skill\u201d but perhaps the actual role is much more execution focused. If the hiring manager rejects people who are kinda meh on that writing task, in doing so they might lose the person who would have actually been by far the best at executing the actual role. This is true even if this written problem solving skill would have been of some benefit for the role. It\u2019s also true if a low level of that skill was indeed necessary, but the higher level at which they set the bar for progression in the hiring round was not.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there\u2019s also a sort of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect\"><u>search for keys under the lamppost</u></a> failure mode at play sometimes, where people put candidates through a particular evaluation because it\u2019s easy, rather than because it\u2019s laser-targeted at the competencies they should most care about.&nbsp;</p><p>In an ideal world, you can figure out an evaluation tool that measures the trait you are after extremely effectively. You can test it, become confident in it, use it and then test that it predicts success in the role for the people you actually hire. This is often a far away pipedream for the weird, often unique roles that exist at EA orgs. If you don\u2019t have a test you can be confident in,&nbsp;<strong>I think simply knowing your tool and its limitations is a huge improvement.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you suspect your test is e.g. too broad, too specific, or is (mostly?) testing a related trait to your actual target, you can be strategic about how you interpret the results. A couple of ways this might change how you treat task submissions:</p><ul><li>Confidence: If you aren\u2019t confident in your tool, you may want to be more generous in who you pass on to the next stage.</li><li>Rule in vs. rule out: sometimes you should be confident in your tool to rule out the lowest performers, but not confident enough to think it\u2019s reliably helping you distinguish between medium and high performers. If that\u2019s true, my suggestion is to make a pass / fail type task, so you try not to update on strong performance. I once wrote an event-related task for an operational role. I endorsed a prediction that very poor submissions should indeed be ruled out. But given I was not hiring for a role that matched the task closely, I wanted the graders to treat all the reasonable submissions ~equally, as otherwise skills that I did not endorse as key to strong execution of the role (e.g. extremely high writing skill, event production knowledge) might bias us towards the wrong candidates.&nbsp;</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Cait_Lion"}}, {"_id": "6tkJtLMcmvW7vEXW7", "title": "About my job: GiveWell Philanthropy Advisor", "postedAt": "2023-09-12T18:17:08.512Z", "htmlBody": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>I\u2019ve been a Philanthropy Advisor at GiveWell for two years. This role is a better job for me than I thought I could find, and GiveWell is a better workplace than I knew existed.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m often asked what a typical day in my role is like. Because my day to day is (delightfully) varied, I\u2019ll instead share what a typical month looks like as a Philanthropy Advisor. I\u2019ll also share some thoughts on my pathway to this role and its impact on GiveWell\u2019s work.</p><p>A GiveWell Philanthropy Advisor is best compared to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Career/major-gifts-officer-career_KO0,19.htm\"><u>Major Gifts Officer</u></a> at other institutions, though there are some key differences. Big-picture, my role is to fundraise for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\"><u>top charities</u></a> as well as for non-top charity grants (such as those funded from our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants\"><u>All Grants Fund</u></a>) that may align with a specific donor\u2019s priorities. I primarily do this by maintaining relationships with a portfolio of donors.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike my preconceived notion of what fundraising entailed, my job does not require cold outreach or making awkward asks of existing donors. Instead, I try to get to know my donors, learning about what motivates them in their giving, helping them stay up to date with our research, sharing organizational updates, and occasionally presenting them with giving opportunities that seem strongly aligned with their philanthropic goals and interests. When I accepted this role, I worried that it would require me to be interpersonally disingenuous or that I'd have to make funding opportunities seem like surer bets than they really are; I\u2019ve been delighted to find that our donors are genuinely easy to connect with and that GiveWell\u2019s values of transparency and truth-seeking translate to extreme honesty with donors about the risks and uncertainties of different grants.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>The job</h3><p>In a typical month, my responsibilities break down as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Communication with donors:&nbsp;</strong>In a typical month, I\u2019m likely to send an update to each of the donors I know. This is often part of a natural ongoing conversation, but if I\u2019m not specifically in touch with a donor already, I might reach out with an interesting article, share an impact report for their most recent gift, or get their feedback on some of our work. I also answer inbound donor questions from people seeking GiveWell\u2019s expertise and have a lot of calls with donors (over 100 per year). The volume of donor calls I have in a typical month varies greatly, clustering at the end of the year when many donors have questions about our work as they make annual giving decisions. These calls range from in-depth research conversations to logistical conversations about estate planning or giving mechanics to intense conversations about long-term philanthropic and financial goals and challenges. As relationships grow, we might also have more personal calls to catch up.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Following GiveWell\u2019s research:</strong> In order to keep donors informed about our work, I have to stay up to date with it myself! I spend a lot of time listening in on research meetings, reading research documents for various grants, and asking our researchers questions about the specifics of different programs. A donor call can go in any direction\u2014it\u2019s not uncommon for a donor to ask about a research decision we made years before my tenure at GiveWell began or about our position on a research area we have yet to publish public materials on\u2014so keeping abreast of our research is a core component of the job. Depending on my workload, I might also lead the process of drafting a grant proposal. This requires a deep dive into the supporting documents for a specific grant and then condensing a lot of technical materials into a donor-facing format that highlights the intervention, considers the benefits, risks, and uncertainties of the grant, and shares the case for funding with interested parties.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Special projects:&nbsp;</strong>At any given time, I\u2019m likely managing 1-3 special projects. Some of the special projects I've led include helping a company's employees organize internal donations before an IPO, overhauling GiveWell's legacy giving structure, and creating a new resource to help donors understand their options for giving.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><br>My experience at GiveWell has been wildly rewarding. This is not just because the research is deeply interesting to me and because we have the world\u2019s kindest donors (we do), but also because GiveWell is a great place to work. GiveWell is a remarkably humane workplace, one where I feel valued as a person in addition to as an employee\u2014and of course we have very fun banter on Slack, from our hot takes channel to our weekly Wikipedia game.</p><h3>My path to the job</h3><p>A few years before applying to GiveWell, I identified through a professional development fellowship that major gifts fundraising would be a good fit for my skills and interests. At the time, I was working in educational advocacy for a civil rights nonprofit. Networking calls with higher education major gifts officers confirmed my sense that this type of job would be good for me, but I didn\u2019t feel motivated by the idea of fundraising for an endowed educational institution.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my brothers is a GiveWell donor, and he learned during a call with my now-colleague that GiveWell's outreach team was hiring. I saw myself in the job description (one of those gasping-aloud-reading-excerpts-to-my-spouse moments) but I was doubtful that I could get a senior fundraising role without much fundraising experience. I also had some hesitations about GiveWell because of prior negative associations with EA as being cold and overly analytical.&nbsp;</p><p>The hiring process was heavy on performance trials, which made me more excited about GiveWell and also gave me confidence that I\u2019d be able to fill the needs of the role. By the time I had my final interviews, I was dying for the job and thrilled to receive an offer.&nbsp;</p><h3>Impact of the job</h3><p>GiveWell has been working with donors since its founding, and collaborating closely with major donors has been a strength for nearly the entirety of the organization\u2019s existence. I\u2019ve learned a ton from the way GiveWell does donor outreach; collaborating with a team of fundraising experts helped me quickly apply the core strengths I was hired for (such as communication skills, the ability to understand and translate research materials, diplomacy, and tact in sensitive conversations) to serve as a resource to donors wondering how to do the most good with their available funds.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be hard to quantify the impact of a philanthropic advisor, as we often can\u2019t know the counterfactual impact of our involvement in any given donation. However, we\u2019ve seen a very clear trend of success as we increase our investment in donor outreach. Since overhauling our strategic plan for major gift fundraising in 2019, we've increased the number of donors giving in the six-figure range by 1.8x and the number of donors giving over $1 million by 4.8x. We also have remarkable donor retention rates for major donors. I\u2019ve found this job tremendously rewarding both day to day and through some memorable wins, like cultivating a donor with no history of effective giving toward making a multi-million dollar gift, and having a donor mention the style of our direct communications as a motivating factor for an unexpected half-million dollar gift.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I hope this post is a helpful window into donor relations work in the world of EA. I also wrote about working on the outreach team in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ctgnisu3mBReoCKR4/highlighting-open-roles-at-givewell\"><u>June 2022 EA Forum</u></a> post and would be happy to answer questions in the comments section.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "maggie.lloydhauser"}}, {"_id": "P56q5epKjyN3eRJHq", "title": "John Green & Grassroots Activists Pressure Danaher To Drop Price of Tuberculosis Test", "postedAt": "2023-09-12T17:24:47.900Z", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/johngreen/status/1704109418797781456\">Update 19th September 2023 from @johngreen</a>:</p><blockquote><p>HUGE NEWS and what it means: This morning, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USAID\">@USAID</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StopTB\">@StopTB</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlobalFund\">@GlobalFund</a> jointly announced that Danaher will lower the price of their standard TB test cartridge by 20% to $7.97.

In fact, the WHO <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/350154/9789240040090-eng.pdf\"><u>recommends Xpert tests as the initial test for all people with signs and symptoms of TB</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The GeneXpert machine itself is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8544827/\"><u>cost-effective</u></a>, but its <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2022/08/16/cepheid-tuberculosis-who-unitaid-diagnostsics/\"><u>testing cartridges</u></a> are more costly. The company charges about $10 per regular TB testing cartridge and about $15 per multidrug-resistant TB testing cartridge (though <a href=\"https://msfaccess.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/2018%20COGS%20analysis%20of%20Xpert%20MTB_RIF%20Ultra%20cartridges.pdf\"><u>both tests cost the same to manufacture</u></a>).</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://msfaccess.org/time-for-5-brief\"><u>a 2019 brief from Doctors Without Borders</u></a>, Danaher and Cepheid could reduce the cost of these cartridges to just $5 each \u2014 or lower \u2014 based on continuous increases in volume.

But we know that they will still make a profit at a $5 price point. We also know people in poverty-stricken countries will die because of this pricing.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, Ezell said, Nerdfighteria knows that while corporations can make inhumane choices, they are still made of humans \u2014 who hopefully want to do right by others.</p><p>\u201cWe absolutely want Danaher to be successful and turn a profit so they can continue to manufacture these life-saving machines and components for them,\u201d Ezell said. \u201cWe just want as many people to have access to them as possible. That makes the world a healthier, happier place.\u201d&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>The Organizers</strong></i></h2><p>Nerdfighteria \u2014 and John Green himself \u2014 have made it clear that this campaign is the work of Treatment Action Group and Doctors Without Borders, and that the years of advocacy by organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.gctacommunity.org/\"><u>Global Coalition of TB Activists</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.stoptb.org/facilitate-access-to-tb-drugs-diagnostics/global-drug-facility-gdf\"><u>Stop TB Partnership, and Global Drug Facility</u></a> are at the heart of this newly invigorated movement.</p><p>But they also seem to know their own power, which includes bringing more passionate advocates into the fold.</p><p>Take Elianne, a 22-year-old Nerdfighter in the Netherlands, who has a degree in medicine and will soon wrap up her master\u2019s degree in global health. A longtime Nerdfighter, she has been heavily involved in the organizing of this campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cI think the power of Nerdfighteria is that all of us \u2014 including John and Hank \u2014 understand that nothing great like this is ever really a one-person achievement,\u201d Elianne told Good Good Good. \u201cIn my experience, being a Nerdfighter has always been about community and using the collective power and talent of that community to make the world a better place.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Along with Elianne, countless Nerdfighter organizers worked behind the scenes for weeks leading up to Green\u2019s video to launch a coordinated effort to persuade Danaher to end its over-priced practices.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cI have tried to use the little expertise I have in the field of global health and medicine to help out where I can. I think that is also why this campaign has worked so well within the community; there are so many people with such a wide range of interests and expertise that we were able to cover all our bases in an incredibly short amount of time,\u201d Elianne continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Leaders in the fanbase have turned from everyday Green devotees to health and business researchers \u2014 volunteering hours upon hours to assemble documents, compile research, create visuals, and articulate the perfect wording of their message.</p><p>\u201cThese are people with real knowledge and experience who are giving it freely and willingly because they want to see this succeed. They want to live in a world without TB,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cIf Danaher and Cepheid\u2019s leadership could put the same kind of effort toward making their TB tests affordable to those who need them most, we wouldn\u2019t have to be here right now.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>But Nerdfighteria <i>is </i>here \u2014 thousands of motivated online organizers, following in the footsteps of lifelong TB activists. Together, they unite under the mantra: \u201cWe lead by following, and we act with compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am immensely proud of Nerdfighteria\u2019s passion and activism. It\u2019s easy to portray Hank and I as leaders of the community, but the truth is, they\u2019ve led us. They\u2019ve encouraged us to think about how we can use our shared enthusiasm and resources to bring about a better world,\u201d Green told Good Good Good.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cOur community recognizes that when we listen carefully and work together, we can change the world.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s that togetherness that fuels their entirely volunteer-led hive.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cStudying global health can sometimes make you feel a little hopeless about the world and powerless to change it. However, this project has been incredibly uplifting: If enough people pay attention and work together, things can change,\u201d Elianne said.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cProgress is not inevitable, but neither is inequity.

The paper is now forthcoming in the journal Philosophy and Public Affairs. The summary was written by Riley Harris.</i></p><p>The value of the future may be vast. Human extinction, which would&nbsp;destroy that potential, would be extremely bad. Some argue that making such a catastrophe just a little less likely would be <i>by far</i> the best use of our limited resources--<i>much</i> more important than, for example, tackling poverty, inequality, global health or racial injustice.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftb65rxs3zj\"><sup><a href=\"#fntb65rxs3zj\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In \u201c<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/existential-risk-pessimism-and-the-time-of-perils-david-thorstad-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\">High risk, low reward: A challenge to the astronomical value of existential risk mitigation\u201d</a>, David Thorstad argues against this conclusion. Suppose the risks really are severe: existential risk reduction is important, but not<i> overwhelmingly </i>important. In fact, Thorstad finds that the case for reducing existential risk is stronger when the risk is lower.</p><h1><strong>The simple model</strong></h1><p>The paper begins by describing a model of the expected value of existential risk reduction, originally developed by Ord (2020;ms) and Adamczewski (ms). This model discounts the value of each century by the chance that an extinction event would have already occurred, and gives a value to actions that can reduce the risk of extinction in that century. According to this model, reducing the risk of extinction this century is not overwhelmingly important\u2013in fact, completely eliminating the risk we face this century could at most be as valuable as we expect this century to be.</p><p>This result\u2013that reducing existential risk is not overwhelmingly valuable\u2013\u2013can be explained in an intuitive way. If the risk is high, the future of humanity is likely to be short, so the increases in overall value from halving the risk this century are not enormous. If the risk is low, halving the risk would result in a relatively small absolute reduction of risk, which is also not overwhelmingly valuable. Either way, saving the world will not be our only priority.</p><h1><strong>Modifying the simple model</strong></h1><p>This model is overly simplified. Thorstad modifies the simple model in three different ways to see how robust this result is: by assuming we have <i>enduring effects</i> on the risk, by assuming the <i>risk of extinction is high</i>, and by assuming that each century is<i> more valuable than the previous</i>. None of these modifications are strong enough to uphold the idea that existential risk reduction is <i>by far</i> the best use of our resources. A much more powerful assumption is needed (one that combines all of these weaker assumptions). Thorstad argues that there is limited evidence for this stronger assumption.</p><h2><strong>Enduring effects</strong></h2><p>If we could permanently eliminate all threats to humanity, the model says this would be more valuable than anything else we could do\u2013\u2013no matter how small the risk or how dismal each century&nbsp;is (as long as each is still of positive value). However, it seems very unlikely that any action we could take today could reduce the risk to an extremely low level for millions of years\u2013\u2013let alone permanently eliminate all risk.</p><h2><strong>Higher risk</strong></h2><p>On the simple model, halving the risk from 20% to 10% is exactly as valuable as halving it from 2% to 1%. Existential risk mitigation is no more valuable when the risks are higher.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, the fact that higher existential risk implies a higher discounting of the future indicates a surprising result: the case for existential risk mitigation is strongest when the risk is low. Suppose that each century is more valuable than the last and therefore that most of the value of the world is in the future. Then high existential risk makes mitigation less promising, because future value is discounted more aggressively. On the other hand, if we can permanently reduce existential risk, then reducing risk to some particular level is approximately as valuable regardless of how high the risk was to begin with. This implies that if risks are currently high then much larger reduction efforts would be required to achieve the same value.</p><h2><strong>Value increases</strong></h2><p>If all goes well, there might be more of everything we find valuable in the future, making each century more valuable than the previous and increasing the value of reducing existential risk. On the other hand, however, high existential risk discounts the value of future centuries more aggressively. This leads to a race between the mounting accumulated risk and the growing improvements. The final expected value calculation depends on how quickly the world improves relative to the rate of extinction risk. Given current estimates of existential risk, the&nbsp;value of preventing existential risk receives only a modest increase.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrokjmzt2zr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrokjmzt2zr\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, if value grows quickly and we can eliminate most risks, then reducing existential risk would be overwhelmingly valuable\u2013we will explore this in the next section.</p><h2><strong>The time of perils</strong></h2><p>So far none of the extensions to the simple model imply reducing existential risk is overwhelmingly valuable. Instead, a stronger assumption is required. Combining elements of all of the extensions to the simple model so far, we could suppose that we are in a short period\u2013less than 50 centuries\u2013\u2013of elevated risk followed by extremely low ongoing risk\u2013less than 1% per century, and that each century is more valuable than the previous. This is known as the <i>time of perils </i>hypothesis<i>.</i> Thorstad explores three arguments for this hypothesis but ultimately finds them unconvincing.</p><h3><i><strong>Argument 1: humanity\u2019s growing wisdom</strong></i></h3><p>One argument is that humanity's power is growing faster than its wisdom, and when wisdom catches up, existential risk will be extremely low. Though this argument is suggested by Bostrom (2014, p. 248), Ord (2020, p. 45) and Sagan (1997, p. 185), it has never been made in a precise way. Thorstad considers two ways of making this argument precise, but doesn\u2019t find that they provide a compelling case for the time of perils.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpc7fk6sw6ac\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpc7fk6sw6ac\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><h3><i><strong>Argument 2: existential risk is a Kuznets curve</strong></i></h3><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XEx8cWvvSofsScaoC/yy2mjozfewi4w3xhgqwu\" alt=\"Figure 1 the existential risk Kuznets curve, reprinted from Aschenbrenner 2020\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XEx8cWvvSofsScaoC/yy2mjozfewi4w3xhgqwu 549w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/XEx8cWvvSofsScaoC/e4ztjnkjjibhibkt192f 300w\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Figure 1: the existential risk Kuznets curve, reprinted from Aschenbrenner (2020).</i></p><p>Aschenbrenner (2020) presents a model in which societies initially accept an increased risk of extinction in order to grow the economy more rapidly. However, when societies become richer, they are willing to spend more on reducing these risks. If so, existential risk would behave like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve\">Kuznets curve</a>\u2013\u2013first increasing and then decreasing (see Figure 1).</p><p>Thorstad thinks this is the best argument for the time of perils hypothesis. However, the model assumes that consumption drives existential risk, while in practice technology growth plausibly drives the most concerning risks.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk8kj9z6xnu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk8kj9z6xnu\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Without this link to consumption, the model gives no strong reason to think that these risks will be reduced in the future. The model also assumes that increasing the amount of labour spent on reducing existential risks will be enough to curtail these risks\u2013\u2013which is at best unclear.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2bdse2xnixe\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2bdse2xnixe\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Finally, perhaps even if the model is correct about optimal behaviour, real world behaviour may fail to be optimal.</p><h3><i><strong>Argument 3: planetary diversification</strong></i></h3><p>Perhaps this period of increased risk holds only while we live on a single planet, but later, we might settle the stars and humanity will be at much lower risk. While planetary diversification reduces some risks, it is unlikely to help us against the most concerning risks, such as bioterrorism and misaligned artificial intelligence.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqnnw6vaclog\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqnnw6vaclog\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Ultimately, planetary diversification does not present a strong case for the time of perils.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>Thorstad concludes that it seems unlikely that we live in the time of perils. This implies that reducing existential risk is probably not overwhelmingly valuable and that the case for reducing existential risk is strongest when the risk is low. He acknowledges that existential risk may be valuable to work on, but only as one of several competing global priorities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref81zlga909ia\"><sup><a href=\"#fn81zlga909ia\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><h1><strong>References</strong></h1><p>Thomas Adamczewski (ms). <a href=\"https://thomas-sittler.github.io/ltf-paper/longtermfuture.pdf\"><i>The expected value of the long-term future.</i></a> Unpublished manuscript.&nbsp;</p><p>Leopold Aschenbrenner (2020). <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/leopold-aschenbrenner-existential-risk-and-growth/\">Existential risk and growth.</a> <i>Global Priorities Institute Working Paper No. 6-2020</i></p><p>Nick Bostrom (2013). <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1758-5899.12002\">Existential risk prevention as a global priority</a>. <i>Global Policy</i> 4.</p><p>Nick Bostrom (2014)<i>. </i><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780199678112?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><i>Superintelligence</i></a><i>. </i>Oxford University Press.</p><p>Carl Sagan (1997). <a href=\"http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/159735/\"><i>Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space.</i></a> Balentine Books.</p><p>Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom (2008). <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf\">Global Catastrophic Risks Survey</a>. <i>Future of Humanity Institute Technical Report #2008-1</i></p><p>Toby Ord (2020). <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/precipice-9781526600219/\"><i>The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity.</i></a> Bloomsbury Publishing.</p><p>Toby Ord (ms). <i>Modelling the value of existential risk reduction</i>.

It highlights alternative methods for early career professionals to demonstrate competence beyond relying solely on academic credentials. As we evaluate applications to our programs, these are the things we consider.</p><p><br>It's not uncommon for early career professionals to rely heavily on academic credentials as their primary means of signaling competence. While formal education undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in shaping one's capabilities, it is not the sole determinant of professional competence. Early career development offers many avenues for signaling professionalism, proactiveness, and overall potential.</p><h2><strong>Writing Content</strong></h2><p>Many effective altruists (EAs) have built their reputations through writing, whether on personal blogs or by contributing to platforms like the EA Forum.&nbsp; High-quality writing demonstrates competence and intelligence and provides the reader insight into the topics that matter to you. Transforming individual pieces of writing into more comprehensive works, such as books, can be a powerful way to showcase your competence. However, it's important to acknowledge that it requires a substantial time investment compared to sporadic writing.</p><p>Writing a useful book or blog post contributes something to the world; for example, it can introduce new people to an important cause or develop new frameworks for a movement. Another advantage of writing is its ability to help you connect with the specific group or industry you aspire to work in. For instance, if you aim to work in EA, crafting a series of high-quality blog posts for the EA Forum can significantly enhance your applications. This principle can be applied to many other fields as well.</p><h2><strong>Bootcamps and Incubation Programs</strong></h2><p>Completing a bootcamp or an incubation program both teaches you great skills and signals competence on a resume.</p><p>Like writing, these programs enable you to tailor your learning and experiences toward specific industries or career goals. Some programs, such as Y Combinator (YC), also possess a broad appeal due to their reputation.</p><p>Securing admission to these programs is undeniably challenging, and thriving within them requires dedication and hard work. Still, the investment of time and effort in these intensive programs often yields faster results than pursuing advanced degrees, making them an attractive option for early career professionals seeking a swift path to professional growth.</p><h2><strong>Working or Interning</strong></h2><p>Gaining practical experience through employment or internships within the EA movement or related fields like global health, animal advocacy, and existential risk mitigation can be considerably more valuable than pursuing a degree when aspiring to secure a relevant position.</p><p>Competition for impactful roles in EA and allied sectors can be fierce, and focusing solely on obtaining a degree can lead to unfulfilled expectations. Employers frequently prioritize recent, hands-on experience as the primary indicator of your competence and commitment.</p><p>By investing your energy in working or interning within these movements, you build essential skills and establish a track record of tangible contributions. This experience enhances your understanding of the real-world challenges these fields face and demonstrates your dedication to making a meaningful difference.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Founding Projects</strong></h2><p>Running a local chapter, founding a small project (even if unsuccessful), or starting a full-scale organization can strongly amplify your resume.&nbsp;In the EA community, many individuals are recognized more for their impactful projects than their academic degrees.</p><p>Founding and successfully running projects showcases your dedication and highlights your capacity for self-motivation. These initiatives require leadership and a hands-on approach \u2013 transferable skills that can set you apart in a competitive job market. By taking the initiative to create and manage projects, you demonstrate your ability to identify challenges, devise solutions, and drive meaningful change.</p><p>Moreover, the recognition you gain within the EA community and related spheres often stems from your contributions to projects that align with the movement's core principles. This visibility can significantly shape your professional identity, making your projects a defining aspect of your resume and network. As a result, your name becomes synonymous with your work, highlighting your impact and dedication.</p><h2><strong>Self-Teaching via Online Courses</strong></h2><p>One thing we love to see on applications, and know other EA organizations look for, is evidence of self-teaching. Enrolling in courses on platforms like Coursera or edX is another powerful indicator of your competence and self-motivation. It showcases your willingness to take initiative, delve into unfamiliar topics, and acquire valuable competencies independently.</p><p>When EA organizations review applications, they often seek evidence of a candidate's ability to adapt and learn swiftly, especially given the ever-evolving nature of the movement and its associated challenges. Enrolling in online courses broadens your skill set and demonstrates your commitment to staying informed and continuously improving your capabilities.</p><p>Online courses offer a diverse array of subjects, allowing you to tailor your self-teaching experiences to areas that align with your passion and career goals within the EA movement. Whether it's data science, ethics, or any other relevant discipline, the ability to leverage online courses showcases your strategic approach to skill development.</p><p>Embracing this path of self-directed learning equips you with valuable knowledge and skills, positioning you as a proactive and well-rounded contributor to the movement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In your early career journey, remember that competence is not confined to the walls of academia. By exploring these alternative paths and embracing opportunities for self-improvement and impact, you can set yourself on a trajectory of meaningful contributions, professional fulfillment, and success in the fields you are passionate about. Your journey is not just about building a resume but about having a tangible impact on the causes you care about at the earliest opportunity.</p><p><i>This post is based on a blog post previously published on the CE's blog.</i><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "CE"}}, {"_id": "TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv", "title": "Theory: \u201cWAW might be of higher impact than x-risk prevention based on utilitarianism\u201d ", "postedAt": "2023-09-12T13:11:15.241Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Update: this post was completed about 1 month after I started reading and considering the ideas/arguments for longtermism.

However, I do think that this could mean that the areas are closer in impact than many longtermist might think, and therefore if you\u2019re a better fit for one of them you should go for that one.

To save time, I will not repeat this during every part of my analysis. I mainly wanted to present the idea of how we can compare x-risk prevention to WAW and other cause areas, in the hope that other people could use the idea (more than the actual estimations) for cause prioritization.

As a longtermist and total utilitarian (for the most part), finding the cause that increases utilities (no matter the time or type of sentient being) the most time/cost-effectively is my goal. I got an idea based on a number of things I read, that against the belief of most EAs, WAW might be a more pressing cause area than x-risk prevention. Since this question is quite important for my impact, I thought instead of speculating, I would make my own analysis (aka speculation with numbers), see if I change my mind, and let the analysis be criticized (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/theory-wild-animal-welfare-might-be-a-more-important-cause#Appendix_1__Things_that_I_want_answered_about_my_theory\">see appendix 1</a>: for which questions about my theory I want answered).</p><p>I suspect my theory is likely incorrect due to the following reasons:</p><ul><li>I don\u2019t have any credentials that make me qualified to make such an analysis.</li><li>This is my first post.</li><li>Due to personal reasons, I\u2019m biased towards working on WAW.</li><li>This theory is based on the principles of total utilitarianism, and may therefore not overlap with your views.</li><li>The theory is mainly based on the assumption that working on WAW now could potentially cause permanent changes to how we treat (wild) animals in the future (read why I think this might be the case in my section <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/theory-wild-animal-welfare-might-be-a-more-important-cause#Tractability_of_the_cause_itself__WAW_\">\u201cTractability of the cause itself (WAW)\u201d</a>).</li><li>This is all highly speculative.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Two framework ideas for the theory&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The following arguments which will be presented are based on the theory that human welfare is negligible compared to wild animal welfare. You can read \u201cabrahamrowe\u201d post if you want a further explanation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhogmapcxlvu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhogmapcxlvu\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, here I will just give (my own) short explanation: There are 10<sup>15</sup> wild animals alive currently (more according to some sources but not super relevant for my theory).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflvvuiegaat\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlvvuiegaat\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While humans could theoretically exceed this number if we achieve interstellar travel, this is only assuming there will be no wildlife in space.</p><p>My theory is also based on the idea that any scenario where an x-risk occurs, the utilities experienced (positive and negative, and by both humans and animals) before the x-risk are negligible. Let me explain. Nick Bostrom estimates that the accessible universe can support at least 10<sup>34</sup> biological human life-years.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrywfn3dl6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrywfn3dl6\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If humans were to avoid an x-risk until then, it undoubtedly would be because humans had reached a stage where x-risks practically were impossible to occur (existential security). E.g. because we had an AI in place that could prevent any unintentional (or intentional) x-risk from occurring, or because multiple civilizations in space would live so independently that catastrophes would be unable to affect the whole human species. If we were to reach this level of security, it would likely occur within a fraction of this timespan. Therefore anything that doesn't impact utilities \u201cpermanently'' (until all sentient creatures will die off by uncontrollable courses e.g. after the 10<sup>34</sup> years) or increase the likelihood that we will reach this level of security, is negligible in comparison (which I guess is also kind of similar to the general argument for longtermism).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Formula for comparing impact&nbsp;</h1><p>So if you believe that the two previously mentioned statements are true, then we basically have two options for making the world better: decreasing the likelihood of x-risk or changing the world in such a way that net utilities will be more positive \"permanently\". I will now present a formula that can be used to compare these two options. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Simple formula&nbsp;</h2><p>First of all, if you think it's 100 % guaranteed that the future will be net positive, then whether you should work on WAW or x-risks depends on two factors: how likely you think it is that an x-risk will occur at some point in the future and how tractable you think the two cause areas are. (Note: I will <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/theory-wild-animal-welfare-might-be-a-more-important-cause#What_is_the_probability_of_an_x_risk_happening_at_any_point_in_the_future\">later </a>in the post argue for what these numbers might be). Based on these two variables, we can use the following formula to calculate which cause is most effective:&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:495.5px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/uetq40ev1cbbe4zxujfs\" alt=\"\"></p><p><i>(Note: I\u2019m not a mathematician, so please let me know if there\u2019s something wrong with any of my formulas. Also I\u2019m sure there\u2019s better variables which could have been picked.)</i></p><p>So x&lt;1 means that WAW is more effective and x&gt;1 means that x-risk prevention is more effective.</p><p>For example, let's say the likelihood of an x-risk happening at any point in the future is 50 %. Then this would mean that according to total utilitarianism, completely eliminating the chance that x-risk will ever occur, would be equivalent in value to doubling net utilities \u201cpermanently\u201d.</p><p>So if you believe this to be the case, the determining factor for which area you should work on is tractability. Since this is quite unlikely for the EA movement to achieve, a more realistic way of saying it is: that decreasing the chance of x-risk by 1 percentage point will be equivalent to increasing net utilities by 1 %. However, if we think the likelihood of an x-risk ever happening is 75 %, then decreasing the chance of x-risk by 1 percentage point will be equivalent to increasing net utilities by 3 %.</p><p>While I have never personally seen it presented like this, I do see obvious reasons why most people would think that the former is easier than the latter (which would be aligned with current longtermist EA work). However, I will later present why I think this might not be the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Main formula&nbsp;</h2><p>If you instead think the future will have net negative utilities, then working on reducing the likelihood of x-risk would be negative. So if you think this is the case, then working on the problem that would help ensure a positive future most effectively would be your best bet. I personally don't think this will be the case, however, I do think there is a risk that it will be. And if you think like me, this is still an argument for working on WAW instead of x-risks.</p><p>To make our \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/theory-wild-animal-welfare-might-be-a-more-important-cause#Simple_formula_\">simple formula</a>\" more precise, we can include the possibility of a net negative future into our formula, creating our <strong>main formula</strong>: &nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:601.7px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/gw0pzvrbsabibr1iqy7u\" alt=\"\"></p><p>(If you do not understand u<sub>negative</sub>&nbsp;I will try to explain it with an example: if we quantify the net positive utilities of the world, in case the world will be net positive, with the number 1, and then choose that u<sub>negative</sub>&nbsp;is equal to 2. Then this will mean that in case we end up with a world that is net negative, it will on average be twice as bad as if it were to become good, or the net utilities will be equal to -2)</p><p>The exact numbers are of course unknown, so you can enter your own estimations into the formula. E.g. this is how they will look for me:</p><p><img style=\"width:259px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/k2wn7hs6onzdbmai9ptz\" alt=\"\"></p><p>So based on my estimations, working on x-risk instead of WAW is 0,382 times more effective. Or dividing the number \u201c1\u201d by 0,382, we get <strong>the number of times more effective WAW is to x-risk: 2,615</strong>.</p><p>I will, for the rest of this post, argue why I chose these numbers. I\u2019m not trying to argue that these numbers are correct, I just want to present some arguments that pull these numbers in different directions, and then I think it\u2019s up to you to decide how the numbers should look, based on the strength of each argument. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>What is the probability of an x-risk happening at any point in the future</h1><p>I don\u2019t think we have any current useful estimations for the likelihood of an x-risk happening in the long-term future (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/theory-wild-animal-welfare-might-be-a-more-important-cause#Appendix_2__Why_I_don_t_consider_any_estimation_for_x_risk_in_the_longterm_future_as_strong_evidens\">see Appendix 2</a>: for my reasoning). I think for many of you, your own estimations might be your best bet. I will now try to give my own estimation, using mainly made-up numbers: My personal favorite estimation (mainly just because that\u2019s the one I\u2019m most familiar with) is the one by Toby Ord (\"1 in 6\" during the next century). If we assume that it will take us one millennium to reach existential security, and the risk will decrease by 20 % each century, we can calculate the probability of an x-risk ever occurring like this:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/shehgcaqlud71sbipkoq\"></p><p>So based on my calculations, the probability of an x-risk ever occurring is \u2248 <strong>55 </strong>%. (Note: I will be happy to hear some of your guys' estimations. And if you want to play around with any of my estimations, here\u2019s a <a href=\" https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO_SCDEb8sMKiART4w8s6hG4pzWWk1NIgaq230HA0RE/edit?usp=sharing\">link</a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Net negative future&nbsp;</h1><p>Many EAs think that the future will be good. However, the idea that the future might be bad is far from new. For example, Brian Tomasik wrote in 2013 about how we might be too optimistic about the future.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3tdi1ir4bsd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3tdi1ir4bsd\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; He also believes there\u2019s a 70 % probability of space colonization causing an increase in total suffering (ignoring happiness).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefimcjcor9bc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnimcjcor9bc\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And as mentioned before, the risk for a net negative future might be a reason against working on reducing x-risk (or more specifically human extinction), because this will simply ensure that the negative future will occur. Many of the reasons are related to s-risk. Once again, we only care about scenarios where the suffering is \u201cpermanent\u201d, any others are negligible.</p><p>I will now give my estimation (again using made-up numbers) for how likely a number of different scenarios are and how bad they would be in comparison to a net positive future:</p><p><img style=\"width:489px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/bex7fmudu1lfsbbzhmt8\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;</p><p>(\u201cothers\u201d especially refer to once we are unable to imagine)</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/theory-wild-animal-welfare-might-be-a-more-important-cause#Appendix_3__Thoughts_on_how_to_do_the_calculation_on__net_negative_future_\">See Appendix 3</a>: for some thoughts on how to do the calculation)</p><p>These numbers reflect my own beliefs based on my limited knowledge, and will most likely differ greatly from yours (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/theory-wild-animal-welfare-might-be-a-more-important-cause#Appendix_4__Thoughts_on_why_I_chose_these_numbers_for__net_negative_future_\">see Appendix 4</a>: for why I chose these numbers).</p><p>Many longtermist may put a lot higher weight on \u201cartificial sentience\u201d, which could easily make the case for working directly on this cause area instead. Also, I think for a number of you, your calculations will be so that when you multiply \u201cp(negative)\u201d by \u201cu(negative)\u201d it will equal more than 1, meaning that you believe that the future will on average be net negative. Therefore the mean expected outcome of working on x-risk reduction would be negative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Tractability</h1><p>I think we can divide tractability into three parts: \u201ctractability of the cause itself\u201d, \u201ctractability based on personal fit\u201d and \u201ctractability as the means of neglectedness\u201d. All three, but especially the last one, are dependent on time. And personal fit obviously depends on the person. &nbsp;This is just to say that the tractability may vary greatly over time and from person to person. I will first give arguments to consider for each, and then give my own estimation.</p><p>Note that for calculating tractability I will specifically use AI-alignment as my example. However, since this is properly the most tractable x-risk-related cause compared to its scale, this will make a stronger case for working on x-risk than other x-risk-related causes e.g. preventing catastrophic pandemics. I will take into account that AI-related x-risk only makes up part of x-risk during my calculation of \u201ctractability of the cause itself\u201d.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tractability of the cause itself</h2><p>To clarify, we\u2019re in itself, not interested in the tractability of the cause area in general. While this is important for our evaluation, what we\u2019re truly interested in is the tractability of the cause area achieving one of the following: reducing the probability of an x-risk happening at any point in the future by 1 percentage point or increasing the net utilities of the future by 1 % \u201cpermanently\u201d. I will talk about each separately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Tractability of the cause itself (x-risk reduction)</h3><p>There are several ways you can work on reducing x-risk, in the area of AI alignment you can do e.g. technical research on how to create safe AI systems, strategy research into the particular risks AI might pose, and policy research into ways in which companies and governments could mitigate these risks. And in different areas, there are similarly many options. Here\u2019s a quote from 80.000 hours, on working on AI alignment: \u201cSo I think it\u2019s moderately tractable, though I\u2019m highly uncertain \u2014 again, assessments of the tractability of making AI safe vary enormously.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflpagfs85p67\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlpagfs85p67\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>As explained earlier, the higher the likelihood of an x-risk, the more important the cause area is, according to our equation. However, this might make the cause area less tractable. Because if the likelihood is high, it might not be enough for us to prevent an x-risk once. Preventing an x-risk once might only save us temporarily. Or in other words, decreasing the probability of an x-risk ever occurring by 1 percentage point, will require more resources. Although this might not have such a big impact on the tractability, since if the cause of the x-risk in these scenarios are similar, e.g. both are related to AI, then the work used to prevent the first one might help prevent the next one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Tractability of the cause itself (WAW)</h3><p>(Note that most of my ideas in this section are inspired by the post by saulius \u201cWild animal welfare in the far future\u201d.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff8bhds4kvob\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf8bhds4kvob\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, not stating our values/beliefs to be homogeneous.)</p><p>And now, finally, for the elephant in the room - is it possible to increase net utilities permanently? Truthfully\u2026 I have no idea, but I think, based on my own educated guess, that the likelihood and scale are enough to seriously consider the idea. I will now present a possible scenario where this could happen:</p><p>Based on WAW research on earth, we realize that there's no possible way (with the use of any interventions) to create environments where wild animals will have net positive lives. Therefore we will never bring animals to space (e.g. do to an international agreement). Or similarly, we learn that certain species or even entire classes of animals are practically unable to experience net positive lives. Therefore we insure to prevent these species from colonizing other planets.</p><p>I think the probability of spreading wildlife to space is pretty high. It\u2019s quite likely that at least some people will think spreading wildlife is the morally right thing to do. This could e.g. be done by directed panspermia (deliberate transport of microorganisms into space to be used as introduced species on other astronomical objects), terraforming or other ways. Especially because nature, by the majority of people, is seen as positive. There\u2019s also the chance of accidental spread. For example, spacecraft sent from Earth for scientific or colonization purposes might be contaminated with microorganisms. These microorganisms might evolve into sentient beings. There is an international law to prevent this, though it is not well enforced<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffor2mtr44zk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfor2mtr44zk\">[8]</a></sup></span>. &nbsp;<br><br>Working on WAW could help us to achieve one or both of the following:</p><ul><li>Decrease the amount of animals in space</li><li>Increase the welfare of the animals in space (e.g. by using interventions or intentionally making artificial ecosystems that ensure better welfare).</li></ul><p>While most people might be against the spread of wildlife to space, the choice might not be decided by the collected human species. It could be decided by an individual in power or if certain technologies could become widespread enough, it could become possible for many individuals to do by themself. &nbsp;</p><p>You might think that this would only be a temporary problem since these scenarios are reversible. However, technologies able to eradicate entire biospheres likely would be limited to large organizations or nonexistent for security reasons. Meaning there has to be widespread agreement to cause this reversal. But since it\u2019s way easier to convince someone to avoid creating unnatural life, which might be unenjoyable, than it is to convince someone to destroy life that\u2019s already existing, it seems that preventing the spread of wildlife could cause long-term changes. &nbsp;</p><p>Here is a list of ways we could work on this issue (directly copied from the post by saulius<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbcqj4lh12\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbcqj4lh12\">[9]</a></sup></span>):</p><p>\u201cTo reduce the probability of humans spreading of wildlife in a way that causes a lot of suffering, we could:</p><ol><li>Directly argue about caring about WAW if humans ever spread wildlife beyond Earth</li><li>Lobby to expand the application of an existing international law that tries to protect other planets from being contaminated with Earth life by spacecrafts to planets outside of our solar system.</li><li>Continue building EA and WAW communities to ensure that there will be people in the future who care about WAW.</li><li>Spread the general concern for WAW (e.g., through WAW documentaries, outreach to academia).\u201d</li></ol><p>You might argue that spreading WAW values is a quite indirect and potentially inefficient way of preventing a future possible problem. Which I do somewhat agree with. However, the same argument can be used against working on AI alignment, since current machine learning doesn't bring us closer to AGI, meaning that the importance of current research is questionable.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2by2pf4qshp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2by2pf4qshp\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Even though I still think a lot of it will be useful.</p><p>In terms of the tractability of the cause area itself in general, I think it is less tractable than many other EA causes, nevertheless I think it\u2019s more tractable than a lot of EAs seem to think. Several interventions seem doable (which in itself might have limited long-term effect, but could help the movement grow), for instance: wild animal vaccination, helping wild animals affected by weather events, helping wild animals in urban environments, animal contraception, and developing wild animal welfare assessment methods.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefetjzakdxuh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnetjzakdxuh\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There are tools, such as the reference system and adaptive management, which make the uncertainty of these interventions not intractable.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefefoz2pxt33m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnefoz2pxt33m\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Neglectedness (as a part of tractability)</h2><p>Most people reading this have properly heard numerous times that neglectedness can be used to assess how effective a cause area is. But you may not have realized that this is simply an indicator for how tractable the area is.</p><p>Both causes are obviously, at least in my opinion, extremely neglected compared to their scale. For AI alignment the numbers are according to 80.000 hours as follows: Around $50 million was spent in 2020 and around an estimated 400 people (90% CI = 200-1.000) working directly on the problem.</p><p>I have been unable to find estimations for the amount of money or FTE (\u201cfull-time equivalent\u201c) that is allocated to WAW. I will now try to make a very rough estimation for the latter. According to ACE, they know fewer than five charities that focus on improving wild animal welfare. And they currently only recommend one of them. This organisation is Wild Animal Initiative and they have 19 employees.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2b90ppxt89a\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2b90ppxt89a\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl6l1v7utux\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl6l1v7utux\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However some organizations work partly on WAW. I will try to take this into account. &nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:601.7px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/wydc9yd3abirqsibxi3s\" alt=\"\"></p><p>I do expect the numbers to increase proportionally more for AI-alignment because it\u2019s about a developing technology, so the area will properly create more news. I also think WAW is less likely to be solved by non-EAs because everyone cares about creating a safe future (even though most care less than they should), but very few care about natural suffering. And I personally think it\u2019s easier to convince someone of AI-alignment than WAW. However, I do also think that some people working on the issue of factory farming, could be convinced of switching to WAW, especially when we come closer to mass producing cultured meat. However, for simplification, I have not considered the future growth of the two movements in my calculation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Calculating \u201ct\u201d (tractability)</h2><p>I will calculate t by multiplying the three areas: \u201ctractability of the cause itself * \u201ctractability based on personal fit\u201d * \u201ctractability as the means of neglectedness\u201d. So first we need to decide the numbers.</p><p>See my estimation (and explanation for chosen variables) for \u201ctractability of the cause itself\u201d or \u201cx(cause)\u201d below: &nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:601.7px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TQdNRM9gofsN9thYv/g8w6snxxtjhiyzqebtlh\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Explanation for chosen variables:</p><ul><li>\u201cp(risk)\u201d: According to Tobi Ord's estimates, the existential risk associated with unaligned AGI accounts for <strong>60 %</strong>&nbsp;of the total risk next century. And since AGI \u201conly\u201d accounts for a part of x-risks, this reduces the scale of the cause area.</li><li>\u201ct(risk)\u201d: I do think both of them are less tractable than many other cause areas. Based on having more public and professional support and less resistance, I do think x-risk prevention is a more tractable area in terms of the \u201ccause itself\u201d. Therefore I put this value to <strong>2</strong>.</li><li>\u201cp(WAW)\u201d: Based on my own (conservative) guess. Because based on my framework, if animals never leave to space, working on WAW will only cause temporary change, meaning that it would be negligible according to my framework. Therefore the effect is only counted if this is the case.</li><li>\u201cb\u201d: &nbsp;Based on my own guess.</li></ul><p>For our example, I will simply give the number <strong>1</strong>&nbsp;for personal fit, meaning that the personal fit is equal between the course areas. Remember that based on the way I made the formula, \u201ct\u201d is the number of times more tractable x-risk is than WAW. So if you set this value to 2, then this means your personal fit is twice as good for x-risk. And if you set the value to 0,5, then this means your personal fit is twice as good for WAW. When you set this number for yourself, remember how important personal fit is. Generally, the top 10% of the most prolific elite can be credited with around 50% of all contributions.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3cz0jj76ba\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3cz0jj76ba\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So you might have to make this number differ further from 1 than you might think.</p><p>According to 80000hours, \u201cIf you care about an output K times more than society at large, then (all else equal) you should expect investing in gaining that output to be K times more effective than making other investments.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyg72blczm6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyg72blczm6\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Meaning that if all else equal, one area being twice as neglected, would make it twice as effective to work on. For our example, we can divide the number of WAW workers by the number of AI-alignment workers:</p><p>94/400= <strong>0,235</strong>.</p><p>So: t = 3,2*1*0,235 \u2248 <strong><u>0,75</u></strong>. Or in other words: WAW is about <strong>1,34</strong>&nbsp;times more tractable than x-risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Possible conclusions from the calculation (discussion)</h1><p>Based on my estimations, working on WAW is more than twice as effective. However, due to the uncertainty of these numbers, I feel unable to even say with 51% certainty that WAW is more effective than x-risk prevention. Which currently is what I conclude from this data. Based on my beliefs on the future and the tractability of the causes, I can\u2019t say with any level of certainty which cause is the most effective. Therefore if you agree with this statement, aiming for the area where you have the best personal fit is the most important.</p><p>Also due to the high uncertainty of the future, it might be so that the most effective cause area will be unaligned with our current estimations and or even by a \u201cflow-through effect\u201d (indirect effects of a charity's work). This is not to say we shouldn't try to make the estimations, but that in case of uncertainty, working on where you have the best personal fit, should properly be the deciding factor.</p><p>If you think there is a high risk for a net negative future or a non-negligible risk for an extremely negative future, then working on x-risk prevention might be net negative. Due to the uncertainty again, I don't think trying to increase the likelihood of human extinction would be a good idea, but trying to ensure a net positive future would be a better option than working on preventing x-risk. The uncertainty I have on whether or not the future will be net good or bad is definitely a motivation for me to prioritize WAW over x-risks. However, if you think artificial sentience is a likely s-risk, I think this could easily be the most effective cause area.</p><p>I think if other EAs do their own estimations, a lot of them will end up with x&gt;1 (x-risk being more effective than WAW). I think most likely this will be due to them thinking WAW is less tractable than me. After all, it\u2019s not often people talk about making \u201cpermanent\u201d changes to utilities. I believe the spread of animals (or microorganisms that later might develop and become sentient) to space is very likely. And if it happens, it\u2019s likely difficult to undo. I also think it\u2019s the most likely s-risk and therefore WAW is potentially the most effective cause area so far. However, if you disagree with any of these statements, your value \u201ct\u201d will properly be higher (x-risk is more tractable in comparison to WAW) than mine. And so, it\u2019s likely that another cause area is the most effective. I think, based on the cause areas I\u2019m currently aware of, that x-risk, s-risk (especially related to artificial sentience), meta and WAW are at the top of cause areas if you're a total utilitarian and a longtermist. But I certainly could be wrong about this. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>My recommendations on how to use this information</h1><p>If you agree with me that we can\u2019t say for certain which of the two cause areas are most effective:</p><ul><li>Work in the area where you have the best personal fit.</li><li>If you\u2019re doing earning to give - donate to whichever cause area is the most funding constraint currently. Historically WAW has been both funding and talent-constrained (my impression is more funding-constrained), whereas x-risks have been mainly talent-constrained, however, this seems to have changed recently.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you think x-risk or WAW is a more effective cause area than the other:</p><ul><li>If you haven't started your career path or it can be changed with minimal impact, then change based on your findings.</li><li>In general, I don\u2019t recommend using this data to make career changes unless you're highly certain that working on one of the cause areas is more effective than the other (e.g. &gt;80 % certainty).</li><li>Remember that these numbers change over time, so due to this uncertainty, personal fit may still be the most important.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you think the mean future is net negative:</p><ul><li>Work on WAW if you think the spread of wildlife is likely and AI sentience is unlikely. &nbsp;</li><li>Work on AI sentience if you think it\u2019s somewhat or highly likely.</li><li>Work on s-risk prevention in general if you think multiple s-risk are of approximately equal importance when taking into account probability and significance.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\u2014------------------------------------------------------------------</p><h1>Appendices</h1><h2>Appendix 1: Things that I want answered about my theory</h2><p>In general, I will be happy to hear any thoughts on my theory.

What we\u2019re interested in is the probability of the \u201clong longterm future\u201d.

So it\u2019s not about the probability that this future will happen in total, it\u2019s instead about the probability, that if there will be no x-risk, there will be x probability for any of these scenarios to happen.</li><li>Note that if you're using this calculation to compare working on an area that could be both an x-risk and a s-risk (e.g. AI misalignment), this should be reflected in your calculations. This could for example be done by instead of adding this specific number together with the others, you would instead minus it (because you\u2019re both working on decreasing the likelihood of this specific negative future and increasing the chance that there will be a future at all). (Note that I did not do this in my calculation for the sake of simplification and because it would have minimal impact on the result).&nbsp;</li><li>p(total risk) gets added together instead of multiplying the probability of it not happening (which was what we did in the calculation of x-risks) because these risks can coincide. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Appendix 4: Thoughts on why I chose these numbers for \u201cnet negative future\u201d</h2><ul><li>I may have put \u201cb\u201d to be lower than what you may expect, because of my high thoughts of how positive the future could be. I also think that if done right, there is a potential chance that we could have \u201cthe opposite of s-risks\u201d in the future, e.g. positive spread of wildlife to space or artificial sentience (however I don\u2019t think any EAs should attempt to create this (yet), due to the high risk of doing the opposite).</li><li>I put the \u201cp\u201d for \u201cAI misalignment\u201d as being pretty low, because most scenarios of AI misalignment, will according to my previous statements, be negligible (talking about s-risk, not x-risk). It would in this case only be relevant if AI keeps us and/or animals alive \u201cpermanently\u201d to have net negative lifes (which most likely would require traveling outside of the solar system). I also put \u201cb\u201d pretty low, because I think most likely (but not guaranteed) the impact will be minimal to animals.</li><li>The probability of \u201cSpread of wildlife to space\u201d was set pretty high, because I think it\u2019s quite likely that some people will think that using our power to spread wildlife is the morally right thing to do. Especially because nature, by the majority of people, is seen as positive. There\u2019s also the chance of accidental spread. For example, spacecraft sent from Earth for scientific or colonization purposes might be contaminated with microorganisms.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li

Maybe the most obvious one is just that, at any particular time, there\u2019s going to be something really salient that it seems like lots of people should do. And maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s at the top of the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/\">ranked list</a> we have. That is one disadvantage of having ranked lists. So a very clean version of this mistake could just be people going, \u201cThe thing that\u2019s at number one of the list of career profiles on the 80k website is <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/\">technical AI safety research</a>, so I guess I have to do technical AI safety research.\u201d</p><p>So why might this be a mistake? The obvious thing is just that <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/personal-fit/\">personal fit really matters</a>. It matters in a bunch of ways. My guess is, during a lot of this conversation, I\u2019m going to end up saying, \u201cDid you know that personal fit is a big deal?\u201d But specifically in the case of someone correctly realising that a thing is really important for more people to do, and then still making a mistake by thinking that they have to do it, what\u2019s going on is something like it\u2019s just a really bad fit for them. And I think there\u2019s one way which is easy for people to internalise this, which is like, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be very good at this, because I\u2019m dumb or stupid\u201d or something.</p><p>And I always say that people are really different. People are good at different things. And not being able to do the thing that\u2019s at the number one place, or the thing that your friend who\u2019s read more of the website than you says is the best thing\u2026 Maybe there\u2019s some sense where if you realise that the thing that\u2019s going on there is you aren\u2019t best placed to do that thing \u2014 maybe because you would hate it; maybe you\u2019d be good at it, but you would just hate it and you would not manage to force yourself to do it for more than a couple of years \u2014 just realising, \u201cThat\u2019s not the best thing for me to do. I should do something else.\u201d</p><p>I have some guess that it\u2019s easier to realise that maybe you should do something else if you realise that one of the things that you should be tracking is who is best placed to work on what. I can imagine some weird world where you\u2019ve got this ranking of the best things for people to do, and then you just rank people by ability \u2014 but the distribution of ability is exactly the same across all the people: you just get like the best people and you put them in the best thing. Once that thing\u2019s full up, you get the next best people, put them the next best thing. The world just doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s maybe the thing that seems top of mind, is this: \u201cI\u2019ve heard one job is really important and I have to do that.\u201d</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Trying harder to fail</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> I\u2019m pretty sure I mentioned in the only <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/after-hours-podcast/episodes/alex-lawsen-on-his-advice-for-students/\">other interview</a> I\u2019ve done on the 80k podcast was about how I approached exams when I was a teenager, and actually in university as well, which was really not preparing as much as my classmates would. And there were some other things going on that affected this, but certainly my internal narrative was like, \u201cIf I do well, having not tried that hard, then there\u2019s nothing ruling out the possibility that I could have done astonishingly well if I had tried really hard.\u201d</p><p>And that internal narrative is exactly the problem. The thing you want to do is rule out the possibility that this is the perfect match for you, so that you can consider whether something else is. And if you keep yourself in this limbo of, like, \u201cMaybe this would be amazing if I tried harder at it\u2026\u201d Yeah. There\u2019s something about, like, failing is really scary. And then it can also just free you up to try stuff that\u2019s just much better for you and for everyone else.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right, yeah. Like, \u201cGreat, I have one fewer option for things. There are like a billion things I could do with my career. I don\u2019t have to worry about that one.\u201d Which is probably just good if you\u2019re not feeling like you\u2019re crushing it and enjoying it. Are there other things that you\u2019ve seen as an advisor, or other ways this can look?</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> Yeah, I think there\u2019s a few. Often these will come up in early-career people who are trying to test out a bunch of different things. Let\u2019s say you think you might want to be able to do some kind of writing-based role. Maybe you want to be a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/journalism/\">journalist</a> or a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/public-intellectual/\">public intellectual</a>, or even just like a successful blogger. And so you write a bunch of drafts and you never really share them, or you post like one every six months. It\u2019s on the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/\">EA Forum</a>, but not under your own name.</p><p>And I think what\u2019s going wrong here is just probably you\u2019re not going to get a tonne of feedback either way, and you\u2019re probably not going to get that much better at writing. Writing careers are hard. Forget impact: just from a personal perspective, you\u2019re really going to have to have a bunch of stuff go well \u2014 not just in terms of talent for clarity or excision of ideas or new generative ideas, but even just how fast you can put stuff out. And yeah, if you\u2019re just writing a little bit sometimes and then not putting it out there, you can do this for two years and still have no idea how good your writing is.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. You get this ambiguous result. And then what do you do with an ambiguous result? You\u2019ve got the nice feeling of like, maybe I could be crushing it, and I don\u2019t have to stare in the face the fact that I\u2019m unambiguously not crushing it. But yeah, you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the thing you should be doing because it\u2019s going fine, but not exceptionally well.</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> And there\u2019s some sense in which this is sort of safe in the near term, that you\u2019re not going to hear, \u201cOh, wow. Try something else.\u201d But actually, if you should try something else \u2014 because, just as a random hypothesis, it turns out you might be really good at podcasting \u2014 never getting that signal, never getting the nudge to try a different thing, ends up harming you and ends up being difficult.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I feel like having success and failure criteria that are objective enough to measure yourself against seems really key here.</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> Yeah. Here\u2019s a recent example that could be kind of cool. There was a post on the EA Forum fairly recently about <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xnBF2vcQaZgmhidyb/list-of-short-term-less-than-15-hours-biosecurity-projects\">ways to test fit for biosecurity careers</a>. I think it was aimed at fairly early-career people, and it was essentially just a kind of smallish research project: Can I produce a report? And it doesn\u2019t have to be original research, but can I produce a summary of some part of this field in 10 hours \u2014 five hours a day across the weekend? And then I\u2019ll send that to some people and see whether they think it\u2019s nonsense. But even before I send it to anyone, you\u2019ve got some signal on: How was it to do that? How would I feel if my week was doing that? And I think often this can just come quite quickly.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Why you shouldn't optimise for impact *now*</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Another common mistake that you hear is people feeling like they need to optimise for having the most impact they can right now. Why do you think that is a mistake?</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> Yeah. Why is this a mistake? Let\u2019s say that with some part of your time or effort or whatever, you want to do the most good. The thing that I claim most people care about, when they are trying to do this, actually is the most good across your life, or across the time that you\u2019re working. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m a millionaire. I won the lottery. I won a million pounds, and I want to give that away. And I\u2019m going to give away \u00a31,000 a year for the next 1,000 years, because I just set myself up badly. I claim the thing I should be thinking about is how do I do the best with that million? \u2014 not how do I do the best with the first thousand \u2014 even at the cost of losing money. What this might look like in the money case is that maybe I should hire some researchers to help me work out what to do with the rest of the money.</p><p>And I think the key consideration that I end up highlighting to people who I think are trying to do the best thing right now is something like: It might be that setting yourself up well to do more good later looks like not directly having as much of an impact right now. Because probably learning is pretty good if you want to have an impact later. Probably getting some signalling experience for a lot of careers, maybe doing a prestigious internship, maybe getting paid a lot of money: these things just often pay off later, and often trade off against doing the very most good with, like, the summer internship you\u2019re doing this year, or in the first two years of your job just after you\u2019ve graduated.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> In my case, it feels like it was a combination of wanting to feel good about feeling and thinking that I am having a positive impact, hopefully, on the world; wanting to feel like I\u2019m living by my values of doing the most important thing, and not a thing that seems pretty good. And then also just totally something about wanting my peers to perceive me as doing good and living by my values. So wanting to work somewhere that\u2019s, like, legibly high impact, and not just somewhere that\u2019s giving me career capital, but doesn\u2019t seem as obviously good to them. And I think I\u2019ve had this particularly because being part of the effective altruism community, there are lots of people who all share some overlapping views on what\u2019s allowed, what\u2019s high status \u2014 and I just felt super hyperaware of that, and wanted the approval, I guess, from people around me, of doing the good thing now. It\u2019s just a lot of things pushing in that direction. How do we help people push in the other direction?</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> I certainly think that part of what\u2019s going on sometimes here is this peer approval thing. Maybe, actually, it\u2019s worth saying something like: If you\u2019re a member of this community, or adjacent to it, and you\u2019re talking to lots of other people in a similar position, kind of like making it clear that you won\u2019t judge your friends for taking things that seem pretty normal career capital building instead of the, you know, weird EA internship that seems really cool because it\u2019s got like a four-letter acronym running it.</p><p>But yeah, I think part of it can be pressure. The main thing I do to push back on this in calls is just hammering the thing: What are you trying to achieve? You\u2019re trying to achieve the most good \u2014 not the most good this year in exchange for less good later. I do think that part of the difficulty is that maybe people are really worried about suspiciously convenient outcomes. Where you like take the high-status job at the quant trading firm, where you\u2019re going to get to play with fun maths puzzles every day. And earn a bunch of money, and be seen as super duper smart by your normal peers who don\u2019t have any idea what this altruism stuff is. That\u2019s a real draw. And I think if that\u2019s a draw that you don\u2019t endorse, because you really care about helping as many people as you can, then it\u2019s easy to not realise that there are \u201chelping as many people as you can\u201d-style reasons for doing that thing anyway.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I think it still just feels really costly to me to have to sacrifice the feeling of I\u2019m living by my values, and I feel very proud of that, and it\u2019s a thing I care about a lot. I mean I just wish it weren\u2019t the case, but it is the fact that I care loads that my peers also think I\u2019m living by my values. Is there more from just, like, a sociological perspective that people can do?</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> Yeah. I think this is a really good thing to push on. Maybe the first thing that seems important is, if I was speaking to Luisa three years ago on an advising call, and she was saying stuff like, \u201cI really want to live up to my values,\u201d the main thing I\u2019d push on is like, \u201cWait. Your values are about doing the best thing, not the best thing right now. That\u2019s actually the thing you care about.\u201d So I might want to push in the direction of, if I can convince you that this does actually seem best in expectation across your long-run career, then that is the thing that\u2019s in accordance with your values.</p><p>And I don\u2019t know whether I would make this next move with everyone, but I find it plausible I might even say something like, \u201cYou care about acceptance from people in this immediate social circle of do-gooders, not from the world at large. It\u2019s actually pretty unclear to me that you\u2019re taking the easy route out by doing the normie prestigious internship, rather than the weird self-sacrificing thing that pays you much less. Plausibly, among the people whose opinions you care about, this is the hard option. This is the option where you have to explain your choice, and you feel like it\u2019s not something that has their EA-approved stamp on it.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYou want to live up to your values? You want to do the brave thing? That\u2019s the brave thing.\u201d Sure, the normal world won\u2019t judge you for it. But maybe the normal world isn\u2019t the world you\u2019re paying attention to.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How to stop constantly considering other career options</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Another one that I\u2019m super familiar with is basically being on a reasonably high-impact path or in a high-impact role, but still constantly considering other career options that might be even more impactful, in a way that\u2019s either kind of distracting or leads to too much switching, and never getting great at one set of skills. I feel like for years I was doing this. I think I\u2019d been working for six or seven years, and I\u2019d never had a job for more than 12 months.</p><p>And that was basically, I\u2019d be in a role that I thought was reasonably worth doing, seemed kind of valuable. And then some low self esteem-y thing creeped in, where I was like, \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing probably isn\u2019t that impactful, because it\u2019s me, and I surely couldn\u2019t be doing anything that impactful.\u201d If ever another opportunity was available and seemed like it might be high impact, and it made the difference between my role and that role seem artificially big to me. I was just like, \u201cOoh, a chance to actually have a big impact instead of do this bad thing I\u2019m currently doing, which is not impactful because I\u2019m bad.\u201d It wasn\u2019t quite that extreme, but I think that was a thing pushing in that direction.</p><p>I think there are probably other things going on too. There\u2019s a thing that can happen where it feels interesting and exciting and enticing to potentially get to do an even more impactful thing. And so whenever something\u2019s presented, you\u2019re just like, \u201cOoh, new thing! Potential for a new, bigger impact.\u201d And for years it just meant I ended up being in a role for a bit, and someone suggested I apply for another one. In some cases, I got those roles, and then I\u2019d switch because of a bunch of these biases, and then spent very little time getting actually very good at one thing because I\u2019ve done it for years or something.</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> Yeah, I think there\u2019s a difficult balance to strike here. It\u2019s not the case that people should just pick one thing and then go, \u201cGreat, this is my thing.\u201d And I think people make this mistake a lot too, especially if there\u2019s some \u201cprofession\u201d that you\u2019re in. So I think being a teacher, being a lawyer, being a doctor feels like one of these things where, like, \u201cThis is the path I\u2019m on. Now all of my options are things within this path.\u201d So yeah, it is hard to strike a balance, because I think people realise this and then they go, \u201cI want to do the best thing,\u201d and then they\u2019re always looking for something else.</p><p>Where does this go wrong? There are a couple of different ways. One way \u2014 and from the sound of it, this has happened to you before \u2014 is you keep switching and you don\u2019t get that much practice. Skills are transferable, but not all of the skills. Or even just you don\u2019t settle into your groove, you feel kind of like, \u201cHow much should I even be investing into this place? Probably I\u2019m going to have to switch in a year when I find something better.\u201d That\u2019s one way this can go wrong, and I think emotionally this can be pretty hard.</p><p>Another thing, and I see this actually quite a lot too, is people are doing something that seems to me objectively great, and they\u2019re just feeling terrible about it and not putting that much time or energy into it, because they\u2019re doing a bunch of job hunting on the side. Because what if it\u2019s not the thing that\u2019s objectively great? What if there\u2019s something better? And applying for jobs takes time, it takes energy, it takes emotional resilience. And feeling like you constantly have to be putting some of your attention on whether there\u2019s something better, even if you don\u2019t then switch to it, still results in you paying pretty significant costs.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah, that sounds totally right. So what is the better decision-making process, if this is the kind of trap you fall into?</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> I have a thing which has worked really well for me. I think it works well for lots of people, and probably won\u2019t work well for everyone. I think I\u2019ll just try to describe the thing, but then I\u2019ve got a metaphor I\u2019ve been playing with that maybe I want to try and describe as well. So the thing is, you stick to some policy, which is like: \u201cI\u2019m going to look at a bunch of things, I\u2019m going to actually seriously consider my options. And then with all of the information I have, I\u2019m going to make a decision. And I\u2019m going to make the decision to do the thing that seems best for some fixed period of time. At the end of that fixed period of time, then I will consider other options.\u201d</p><p>And I think for most people, you don\u2019t have to make this a fully binding commitment, that you just instantly say no as soon as anyone says, \u201cHave you considered\u2026?\u201d I think of it as a strong default. If someone says, \u201cHey, have you thought about doing this other thing?\u201d I can just say, \u201cThe next time I\u2019m looking at options is in a couple of years. If you want to pitch me on this really hard, I\u2019m not going to rule out ever doing anything before that time, ever, but you should know that you\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to convince me to even really think about this. Because my plan is to stay for this long.\u201d</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Going too far in a good direction</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Before we wrap up, I am curious if you had any reflections having done this, or any other mistakes that come to mind that we can cover before we call it?</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> Maybe one theme that seems worth pulling out is something like <i>going too far in a good direction</i>. I think lots of the stuff we\u2019ve talked about has been like, \u201cConventional wisdom says this. You\u2019ve noticed that conventional wisdom seems to not be tracking quite the thing you care about, or maybe even you just think conventional wisdom is wrong. And so you go, \u2018I want to move conventional wisdom in this direction'\u201d \u2014 and then you just move it way too hard in that direction. I don\u2019t want to even make the general claim that you should never move things that far. I in fact think you should push some things pretty hard, and keep other things at a satisficing level. But I think there\u2019s some amount of the correct update to make is not always like a really, really big one.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> To the other extreme. Yeah. That just makes sense, and it also makes sense that it\u2019s hard, and so lots of people make these \u201cmistakes.\u201d If the optimal amount to move in a direction is a bit, but not all the way to the other extreme, finding the exact spot that\u2019s ideal is just going to be really hard. And especially when you\u2019ve got decisions as hard as these. We\u2019ve already kind of qualified that people should not feel bad or guilty or ashamed if they\u2019ve done some of these things. It\u2019s just difficult because you\u2019re doing this balancing act.</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> I think it\u2019s actually a dynamic of how language is structured, or how people speak to each other, that makes this hard to talk about. And I don\u2019t mean hard emotionally; I mean we don\u2019t quite have the right vocabulary for it. The thing that I want to point out here is we don\u2019t have a neat single word for \u201cI agree with you in the direction, but not as hard as you.\u201d If people are estimating probabilities, then there\u2019s still not one word, but there\u2019s an idea. Let\u2019s say you think there\u2019s a 90% chance something\u2019s going to happen, and I think there\u2019s a 75% chance it\u2019s going to happen. In this case, I can say I think it\u2019s less likely, and it\u2019s still kind of hard to explain why. If I explain why it\u2019s less likely, but I don\u2019t say any numbers, my guess is an observer that didn\u2019t hear the start of the conversation isn\u2019t really going to be able to tell whether I\u2019m saying 75% or 10%.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. It\u2019s like, are you saying it\u2019s less likely than I think and therefore you think it\u2019s unlikely? Or are you saying it\u2019s less likely than I think, it\u2019s still probably going to happen, but you believe it less strongly than I do?</p><p><strong>Alex Lawsen:</strong> Yeah, I think that\u2019s exactly it. It\u2019s just kind of clumsy and awkward to talk about situations where you and the person you\u2019re talking to both basically think this thing on the left, rather than this thing on the right that everyone else thinks, but you\u2019re a bit closer to the right than they are. There\u2019s just kind of a difficult dynamic. And so I think part of what\u2019s going on here is if lots of your friends and people you talk to about your career decisions are in a kind of similar place to you compared to conventional wisdom, it\u2019s going to be hard for them to error correct. They don\u2019t have quite the right vocabulary to error correct without just saying conventional wisdom at you.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "ECiLcmozJHRk2ifAN", "title": "Portable MRI", "postedAt": "2023-09-11T20:13:18.106Z", "htmlBody": "<p>For centuries, people have sought to peer inside living organisms without causing harm, and it's only been a few decades since methods for such non-invasive scanning emerged.

Though we\u2019re still a relatively new org, we\u2019re learning a lot and striving to create high-quality content for a range of preferences and cause areas (be on the lookout for a whole lot of climate-focused career content in the next month!).</p><p>We think this sort of guidance can be extremely helpful in navigating your career search (it\u2019s why we do it!). But we also know that life is complex and unpredictable. Planning and strategizing for your career is super important, but so is chance, failure and learning along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>So to get a bit more personal and strike up some career conversations, our team is sharing the top piece of career advice we\u2019d give our younger selves. We all come from fairly different backgrounds and career stages, so hopefully this can give a more practical perspective on our own career journeys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Anna Beth, Writer</h3><p><strong>Show you can do the work instead of relying solely on on-paper qualifications. </strong>When looking for a job out of undergrad, I often wouldn\u2019t even apply to ambitious opportunities because I assumed I didn\u2019t have the impressive on-paper qualifications needed to stand-out. This probably has something to do with imposter syndrome, but I actually felt pretty confident in my abilities \u2014 I just thought I didn\u2019t have the background needed to be given a chance. Looking back, this was a pretty defeatist outlook. I wish I would have spent more time focused on practicing and sharing the sort of work I wanted to do. When I eventually started sharing (and emphasizing) a portfolio website with mostly personal writing projects, I ended up getting more interviews and my first full-time role.&nbsp;</p><p>If you feel limited by your background or like you\u2019re somehow behind for not&nbsp;<i>doing more</i> while in school, it can go a long way to show \u2013 not just tell \u2013 you can do the work. Sure, those prestigious internships and achievements could open doors and give you an extra boost, but ultimately, organizations want people who can actually do a good job and have something valuable to offer. Try a do-it-yourself approach by taking up projects that interest you, keeping up with a website, actively seeking work-tasks, or doing more volunteer work in your field.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Dylan, Researcher</h3><p><strong>You have more options than you likely realize</strong>. We tend to lean towards options we're already familiar with, and the careers we're exposed to at a young age are determined by fairly arbitrary variables like location, educational background, and our parent's careers. I think this means the career goals we form early on are often highly path dependent. In reality, there's far more areas of work we would have been excited about, if only we'd been exposed to them earlier on.&nbsp;</p><p>This probably sounds quite obvious, but it's something I wish I'd internalized before I latched onto the first subject that gripped me then spent a fair few years pursuing it at postgraduate level. I might still have chosen the same route, but my decision would have been better informed had I spent some more time trying a bunch of different things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Itamar, Head of Growth</h3><p><strong>Early on, prioritize broadly applicable skills\u2013like learning and communication\u2013that will be useful regardless of what path you end up taking.</strong> This is especially beneficial in cases where you\u2019re unsure what you\u2019ll do later, or think that there\u2019s a high likelihood you\u2019ll move between distinctly different roles/fields.</p><p>Remember that there\u2019s always an opportunity cost, so you don\u2019t want to waste your time mastering a highly specialized skill that you end up never using again. That said, you can\u2019t always know what skills you\u2019ll need in the future, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with learning some specialized skills when a task calls for it, particularly when you can hone your generalist skills along the way. For example, learning to program in R can help improve your general programming skills, and, more broadly, your general learning skills too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Omer, Co-Founder &amp; CEO</h3><p><strong>The roles you take and organizations you work at have a profound impact on your identity.</strong> People keep changing and growing throughout their whole life. Being surrounded by certain types of people, immersed in some specific workplace culture, working towards specific goals - this all has a huge effect on who you become. Is your environment pushing you to be a kinder person? One who collaborates or competes? Are you becoming someone who speaks their mind more or learns to go with the flow? There are countless small ways in which you will be different after a few years, including what sort of person you want to become.</p><p>At one of the points that I was considering a major career change, a manager I admired asked me: \u201cDo you want to become the person that this job will push you to be?\u201d</p><p>The answer can be both positive and negative (or neither), but, especially for early career professionals, I think it\u2019s an important (and sometimes neglected) consideration when deciding on a career path.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Sella, Co-Founder &amp; Head of Research</h3><p><strong>Be more proactive in reaching out and pursuing opportunities.</strong> My default approach is to learn, read, strategize \u2013 but not reach out. In hindsight I\u2019ve been shocked by how many of the people I admire are happy to engage and provide advice or opportunities when young people reach out, and how many of my heroes started their own path by reaching out to those they looked up to. I think a similar lesson applies to trying to pursue opportunities more broadly \u2013 like that job you probably won\u2019t get or that fellowship that\u2019s hard to get into.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, reaching out also needs to be done well. If you\u2019re contacting a person or organization you look up to, you should be respectful of their time. You should invest in reading their available work to identify where they can be most helpful (or better yet, how you could be helpful to them), and write extremely succinctly so they don\u2019t need to spend much time to decide whether they want to prioritize engaging or not. This approach also leads to way more failures and rejections than the passive approach, but the occasional successes are very much worth it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Thane, Operations Lead</h3><p><strong>Regardless of where you\u2019re at in your career, reevaluate your options before making big decisions.</strong> Ideally I would have had the kind of advice we provide at Probably Good while I was in high school, or when I decided to switch majors at university, and would have known about many more impactful careers early on. But I actually could have benefited most from exploring my options a few years into my career once I decided to pursue something more impactful.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, I felt like I had fewer options and even less time than I did at university, because I\u2019d already \u2018wasted\u2019 years of my career. So it was easy to jump straight to job applications rather than stopping first and figuring out what paths were really available to me. Thankfully what I pursued turned out to be a great fit, but in retrospect, that was lucky. I have a feeling that this happens a lot, whether by prematurely fixating on a job or career, or by continuing to follow a previously made career plan. Regardless of your situation, if you\u2019re about to make a big career decision, the time you put into reevaluating your options will always be worth it, because you\u2019ll either uncover new paths or be more certain of your current career trajectory.&nbsp;</p><h3><br>Vaishnav, 1:1 Advising Lead</h3><p><strong>Be strategic about your weaknesses.</strong> Over the past few years, I\u2019ve learnt to factor in my relative strengths and weaknesses while choosing roles and organizations. Conventional wisdom and our negativity bias can often lead to a relentless focus on weaknesses. However, it\u2019s worth being strategic about which weaknesses to work on while prioritizing skills that are a better fit for your temperament and personality.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, my challenges with organization and attention to detail stood out as areas of consistent feedback in my early career. I took steps to improve these skills, striving for a level of competence that wouldn't impede my professional growth. However, I got a lot more \u201cbang for my buck\u201d by pivoting towards roles where these attributes weren't the primary evaluation metrics ( eg. transitioning from a compliance and process heavy role at a big bank to a fundraising role at a startup). It's also useful to keep in mind that some skills seem way more salient for early career roles and are relatively less valued as you progress. Moreover, it\u2019s worth considering the explicit opportunity cost of focussing on weaknesses since even skills that draw on our natural strengths often need a great deal of cultivation and refinement.&nbsp;</p><p>___</p><p><br>If you have an interesting piece of career advice you\u2019d give your younger self, feel free to leave a comment!

I think these types of conversations can be incredibly helpful. I thought I would add my perspective as an academic that thinks of themselves as EA-adjacent.</p><p>Basic information: I am an Assistant Professor of Accounting at Mississippi State University. I think a good framework for thinking about accounting scholarship is as an area of applied economics - we use the same theories/methods as economists, we are just focused on the role of accounting information specifically (and accounting topics such as auditing and taxation). My research agenda is pretty niche within accounting research - I study nonprofit organizations, which is why I have learned about and started to become involved with EA. A lot of what I am working on focuses on the donor decision-making process and how to encourage more impactful giving.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong></p><ul><li>I have undergraduate degrees in accounting and economics, and my work experience was in federal consulting with a Big4 accounting firm, working on audit readiness for a DoD agency. Interesting work, but I felt at the time that the long-term career trajectory would not be personally satisfying.</li><li>I then did a PhD in Accounting at the University of Alabama. I could write a whole separate post about the PhD experience, but I had a <i>generally </i>very good time. I was paid enough to live on, had a supportive spouse, had a great relationship with my advisor, and performed well-enough that after my first year, didn't doubt much that I could complete it. I also discovered a passion for research, which made this a very exciting time.</li></ul><p><strong>Application Process:</strong></p><ul><li>The academic job market is a unique beast so I won't spend too much time on it. A research job at an R1 university is a difficult thing to achieve (and that difficulty depends a lot on the field you are in).</li><li>A high-quality PhD program will maximize your odds of placing at the best universities, so following the lead of your fellow PhD students and advice of your advisor should steer you in the right direction. Where you choose to do your PhD is of extreme importance, so spend a lot of time deciding where to do your PhD.</li><li>Accounting PhDs don't often place in industry, so I don't have any real advice on that unfortunately.</li></ul><p><strong>What the job is like:</strong></p><ul><li>I'll start by saying being an academic is a very strange job - it is remarkably different from my previous experience in public accounting. It is very much a lifestyle - most end up being an academic for their entire career.</li><li>I am responsible for 2 courses per semester (one undergrad course and one master's course). I have a TON of flexibility on the materials and how I teach the courses, which is both good and bad. The good is that I get to teach what I want. The bad is that as I am still creating/prepping my courses, I spend approximately 3 days a week during the semester on teaching and prep. Eventually, this should get down to 2 days a week.</li><li>The rest of my time is devoted to research. I have an active research pipeline (around 9 projects, which is frankly too many), with projects at various stages. Currently, I spend around 3+ days a week on research, with an eye toward getting that to 4+ once my classes are a bit more developed.</li><li>As a general point, one major advantage of academia is the level of autonomy. Outside of my 2 scheduled lectures, I have complete and total control of my schedule and that allows me to work when and how I want.&nbsp;</li><li>One of the reasons I love research is that I have ownership over the end product, rather than being a cog in the machine of a major corporation. This, along with the publish or perish reality of academic jobs, means that I tie up a lot of my personal self-worth in my research AND my personal job security is tied up in it was well. This can be motivating - I estimate I work around 60 hours a week on average (and I am always working on holidays/breaks). But it can also be very unhealthy to wrap up your self-worth in your work, especially when things go wrong, such as a test not coming out as you hoped or getting rejected from a top journal.&nbsp;</li><li>Research is incredibly difficult and taxing, and the pressure to publish is high, even at my university, which does not require any publications in our top journals for tenure. A lot of the work of research is collaborating effectively with others, learning new methods, reading a ton of papers, and writing long manuscripts over and over again until it is actually good. Having a passion for your research is <i>essential </i>to making it through your PhD and continuing to research enough to get tenure. Unfortunately, it is hard to know if you love research before you really start doing it.</li></ul><p><strong>Impact of the job:</strong></p><ul><li>I've spent a lot of time thinking about the impact of my job from an EA perspective.</li><li>Training future accountants: this is of some value, but someone else could easily fill this role. I do get personal satisfaction from teaching, but I don't see it as particularly high value.</li><li>Research: If I did not do nonprofit accounting research, there probably isn't really anyone who will replace me, as a very small group of people do this research currently. The challenge is the <i>value </i>of the research, which is very hard to define. Honestly, I grapple with this all the time, as much of what is published in academic journals doesn't have any measurable impact. I spend a lot of my time thinking about ways my research could inform policy, organizations, and donors, and try to steer my research in directions that maximize impact.&nbsp;</li><li>While most academics make fairly low salaries, US accounting academics are fortunate to be in a field with fairly low supply. Compensation ranges from $130k - $280k for new hires, with some researchers at top programs earning &gt;$300k. So the impact of the work itself + earn-to-give can make this a fairly high-impact job.&nbsp;</li><li>If anyone is interested in doing a PhD in accounting, I would love to offer you advice. I could offer a small amount of advice in regards to economics/finance as well, but you probably should find some in those fields.</li><li>I am hoping that one of the ways I can have an impact is by advising/sitting on boards of nonprofit organizations. I have accounting/finance skills, a strong knowledge of the 990, research skills, and am really passionate about effective organizations. This has been pretty difficult to break into, but if anyone out there is interested in having a chat about ways I could help your organization, please feel free to reach out!</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Kyle Smith"}}, {"_id": "TqAxoYPSYhpv7FP6c", "title": "Link: EU considers dropping stricter animal welfare measures (Financial Times)", "postedAt": "2023-09-12T18:33:41.800Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The Financial Times writes that the EU is considering dropping animal welfare regulations from the upcoming Green Deal.

Mosquitoes are the middleman between humans and malaria, so shouldn't we just... cut out the middleman? Wouldn't that be far more effective than spending so much money on netting and treatments? As far as I know, mosquitoes don't play a particularly important ecological role.</p><p>Let's be honest; We are spending a very large amount of resources on these programs, and we are seeing serious diminishing returns, with it costing a small fortune (some charities are estimated to require several thousand dollars) to save one life.

ACE often writes about how much money their top charities could use, highlighting how underfunded they are.</p><p>From my understanding, the main reason why this sort of technology (something like CRISPR) is generally rejected is because of ignorance of the utility of this technology by the governments in these countries, believing it to be dangerous and harmful.</p><p>However, a potential caveat of focusing so much on prevention as we are doing right now (as opposed to eradication) that has been brought to my attention is the concern that these efforts (mosquito nets, pesticides) make the governments of these countries content with how things are currently operating, that this decreases the chances even further of them even considering GM technology to fix their malaria problem, which would be much more cost-effective. Sure, they're denying their usage of them now, but will all the netting and such, they don't even have to consider it in the first place. Sort of how climate change deniers won't care about the increasing heat since they have air conditioners anyway.</p><p>Thanks, and I look forward to hearing your responses.

Also I'm shamelessly stealing Lizkas format, so thank her for me writing this.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that anything written here is my opinion and does not represent the department of defense, or any US Government agency.</p><h1>My background &amp; how I got here</h1><p>I studied Computer Science in college and graduate into the great recession of 2008. After not getting the exact job I wanted (Marine Officer), I went to the Army recruiter and they gave me the option to be an Army Reserve Quartermaster Officer. I wanted something more active, but since Officer Candidate School was very competitive I wasn't in the top.&nbsp;</p><p>I served part time as a Platoon Leader, Company Commander and Company Executive Officer. &nbsp;I interviewed with a different unit to change my branch to Civil Affairs, transferred to the &nbsp;unit and then served there as a Battalion Logistics Officer (S4) until I got called to go to first deploy, then school. &nbsp;My small school team of four Captains placed in the top six(Commandants List) of our approximately 60 person class and I was a Civil Affairs(CA) Officer after about 8 years. I credit my time working alongside CA officers as a large part of how well I did.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time I worked as a state department contractor full time. I also was going through Nursing school for most of it, though I didn't make it through.</p><p>During my deployment, I was always trying to quantify how much we were doing and I had problems doing so. I read books like Dead Aid and Toxic Charity, trying to get a sense of how to 'do international development' and 'foreign aid'. You might think that this is why I joined EA.&nbsp;</p><p>Nope.</p><p>My writing partner made me read Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality and then, yes you can guess the rest. I got picked up for a 3 year tour of AGR and decided to put my civilian career on hold and see if I liked it.</p><h1>What I actually work on</h1><p>There is a very specific scope of things that only I do, mostly long range planning, facilitation, writing policy and working on strategy/prioritization for my organization. This includes everything that is mandated for the unit I work for to do to what is directed at a local level for us to do. Most of my work is office work, over various lovely software, and some of it is field work.</p><p>Here is what I do normally:</p><p>-Field questions from people inside the unit</p><p>-Answer Requests for Information (RFIs) from higher echelons or sister units</p><p>-Write Operations Orders and iron out short term plans</p><p>-Be the telephone between two organizations that need to talk.</p><p>I also run several meetings that are ad hoc or weekly dependent. I've had to work with a lot of people and I have met so many good people. It's not EA, but they all want to make a difference.</p><h1>Reflecting on the Role</h1><p>I opted into a very specialized career field in an already specialized group. I love the people and the unit culture is great, but they ask a lot of the part timers.</p><h3>Some things I value:</h3><p>-I'm expected to work independently.&nbsp;</p><p>-If the work is done, then it's done. I'm not waiting around for someone's input normally.</p><p>-I get to work with top performers regularly.</p><p>-I get to mentor a lot of junior Officers and Enlisted, which is a big draw.</p><h3>Some things that can be hard:</h3><p>-I'm not in charge, I just work here. Even though I plan a lot in advance, sometimes the commanders will choose to take a different path, upending a lot of my work.</p><p>-There's a lot of things that need to be on a regulatory timeline that I can not change. This is fine, except when people try to get around it.</p><h3>Some Skills I develop in this job:</h3><p>-Language Skills. I learned enough Spanish on the job for my Spanish to be better than my French. I've had six years of French.</p><p>-Project Management. Everything is a project.</p><p>-Planning Skills. It's the job.</p><p>-Operations Skills.

If you don\u2019t want to read it all the way through, I recommend reading this summary, skimming the first part of the theoretical explanation and maybe the practical explanation, reading the cause areas that interest you the most, and then reading the analysis and maybe the next steps.</p><h1><strong>Positionality Statement:</strong></h1><p>I\u2019m not formally affiliated with Effective Altruism nor do I consider myself part of the Effective Altruism movement, although I do consider myself something of a fellow-traveler with respect to many of the movement\u2019s goals. Again, I have no expertise in anything related to phytomining (geology and soil science, botany, the economics of mining). I\u2019ve put a sizable amount of effort into verifying that all facts in this post are accurate, but unfortunately it\u2019s possible some inaccuracies may have slipped through. Please let me know if you find any inaccuracies.</p><p>All conclusions that I draw in this post should be considered to be very tentative. I\u2019ve spent very roughly about 15 hours on this post, but I could easily foresee spending additional time on the topic (especially if it involved talking with experts) leading to me changing my mind with respect to the benefits of phytomining. This post is intended to encourage further exploration of the relationship between phytomining and Effective Altruism. It\u2019s not intended to be the final word on phytomining, and I would strongly advise against anybody else taking actions because of this post without doing some research themselves first. I began to work on it as a standalone post, changed it up to submit it to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kaTRzN6QxrQvXLWx4/cearch-s-cause-exploration-contest-awards\">the CEARCH cause area contest</a>, and then made slight modifications to that version for the purpose of posting on the Forum.</p><p>I\u2019ve used in-line citations for all sources that aren\u2019t van der Ent et al. (2021), because that book was my primary source for this entire post and it would have grown too unwieldy to cite it every time I referenced it. Additionally, some people make a distinction between phytomining (usually as the specific production of metal from a plant) and agromining (the entire system of producing the plants, getting the metal from them, and everything else involved with that), but I\u2019ve chosen to refer to both of them as phytomining given that that seems to be a common convention in news reports, and because I personally find the distinction a bit confusing.</p><p>This post was entirely written and researched by me without the use of ChatGPT; I later tried to use ChatGPT to proofread it but it gave very few usable suggestions. Thanks to some friends who agreed to read this over; all errors contained herein are solely my fault and not theirs.</p><h1><strong>Explanation of Phytomining:</strong></h1><h2><strong>Theoretical:</strong></h2><p>The core of phytomining is that it is a process that takes plants (and soil and soil amendments) and turns them into metal (and some waste products). However, the process of phytomining starts long before the metal is extracted from the plants. Really, it started with the beginning of the universe, but let\u2019s cut to the chase and look at when human involvement begins to take place within the phytomining process. Botanists typically lead the way in identifying species of plants that are hyperaccumulators, which means that they are capable of taking in much more of their target metal from the soil than a normal plant is able to. The exact thresholds vary significantly depending on the author and the metal, but usually the concentration of the metal in plant tissues of a hyperaccumulator is a few orders of magnitude higher than it is in the plant tissues of a sampling of average plants.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are many complications in identifying hyperaccumulators, besides the ever-present risk of measurement error. To start, the concentration of a metal will differ drastically between burnt plant material and unburnt plant material, and both are sometimes reported. Although most research into hyperaccumulation has focused on leaves and stems, other parts of plants are sometimes known to have particularly high concentrations of target metals, and the concentration of a specific metal may vary depending on which part of the plant is measured. An additional complication is that the extent to which a plant will hyperaccumulate does depend on the inherent concentration of the metal in the soil. Some plants only engage in hyperaccumulation if the metal concentration in the soil is already high, while others will have significantly higher accumulation than other plants even on soil with low concentrations of the target metal. Furthermore, it also varies whether hyperaccumulator plants grow only on soil with a particularly high concentration of the target metal or are also found on other soils. Good hyperaccumulators are usually perennials that grow quickly and widely, are easy to propagate, and collect high concentrations of the target metal.</p><p>This is a good place to take a look at what kinds of soils contain the target metals necessary for a successful phytomining operation. Typically, ultramafic soils are known for having high concentrations of metals. I\u2019ll talk more about this in the practical explanation, but ultramafic soils make up about 1-3% of Earth\u2019s land surface, depending on which estimate you go with, and are distributed worldwide, albeit with particularly notable concentrations in the Mediterranean and the tropics (Kidd et al. 2018). Yet phytomining is not limited to these naturally occurring metal-rich soils. Soils that have been contaminated by metals are also a promising avenue for phytomining operations, as are the tailings of mining operations. Research is ongoing as to whether phytomining can be used as a form of metal recycling, with metallic waste as a component of the soil. Hydroponics are sometimes used to test metal intake in experiments, but it doesn\u2019t seem to me like hydroponic phytomining has known uses in the real world.</p><p>Still, simply knowing that hyperaccumulating plants are likely to be found on ultramafic soils is not enough to easily narrow down the question of which plants are hyperaccumulators and which ones are not. It often takes a significant amount of labor by botanists to identify plants that engage in hyperaccumulation. Traditional tests to identify hyperaccumulators are often difficult to perform in the field. However, the rise of portable X-ray fluorescence technology has recently permitted easier identification of hyperaccumulators. These devices, which can analyze the metallic composition of plants, have already been used successfully to identify many likely hyperaccumulators from collections of plant samples.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after a given hyperaccumulator has been identified, there\u2019s still a lot of testing necessary to identify how to use a specific hyperaccumulator most efficiently. A major component of this testing is work on how the plant grows best. Many hyperaccumulator plants benefit from some form of fertilization or other soil amendments. Some plants are also tested to examine how quickly they grow and how often the parts of the plant that contain the metal (usually this is leaves and sometimes branches, but for annuals it can be the entire plant) can be harvested.&nbsp;</p><p>Testing can also reveal how best to extract the metal within the plants. A lot of the details about this, and, frankly, testing as a whole are fairly technical and don\u2019t seem particularly relevant for the audience of this post, so I didn\u2019t spend as much time examining this stage as I did some of the other ones. However, it\u2019s clear that there are a wide range of options for extracting the metal, depending on both the kind of plant and the kind of metal, and that this can have significant impacts on the climate analysis later on. A common technique is to burn the plant matter first to concentrate the metal, which might be combined with leaching in order to separate the metal from the waste material. Other approaches involve trying to leach the metal directly from the plant, but this strategy is newer and is still being developed.&nbsp;</p><p>After the phytomining potential of a plant and soil region is established and some kind of tentative advice is known, there are hopefully larger-scale tests as to whether the phytomining procedure works well in the real world. These harvests can scale up into full-fledged commercialization, where farmers either sell their crop to some kind of smelting or metal extraction facility or possibly operate such a facility themselves. I\u2019m working off of very little data here because of how little phytomining has made it to this stage of operation, but it seems likely that scientists will become less important in the operation of the facility and more of the decisions about mining will transition to locals, specifically the people who are operating the facility. However, this probably does not mean that the phytomining process is no longer undergoing improvements, but rather that decisions are being driven by commercial rather than scientific considerations. This is the end goal of any phytomining development process.</p><h2><strong>Practical:</strong></h2><p>However, there\u2019s still a large question remaining: what the current state of the field of phytomining is. With regards to the first step, many hyperaccumulating plants have already been identified since the idea of phytomining first gained some currency towards the end of the 20th century. As of van der Ent et al. (2021), the Global Hyperaccumulator Database of the Center for Mined Land Rehabilitation at the University of Queensland listed 721 different species known to hyperaccumulate a wide variety of metals; doubtlessly X-ray fluorescence has allowed many more to be identified since then.</p><p>These plants additionally represent a wide variety of ecosystems. Nickel hyperaccumulators have been extensively studied in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia, located in the southwest Pacific Ocean not too far from Australia. The Malay archipelago (Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines) has also been the site of analyses of nickel hyperaccumulation. Furthermore, the Mediterranean region of Europe, such as the Balkans and Italy, is also known to contain a good number of species that can hyperaccumulate nickel. Other nickel hyperaccumulators have been identified in Cuba, South Africa, and a few different parts of Mexico, including one not on ultramafic soils. Copper hyperaccumulation has been identified within the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Selenium hyperaccumulators have been identified in the continental United States of America and China. And of course this list is far from comprehensive. This probably shouldn\u2019t be surprising, but I\u2019ve noticed something of a trend in these examples of hyperaccumulators being identified in regions already known to produce the target metal.</p><p>As you might have guessed from the above section, the metal with the most research on its hyperaccumulation is far and away nickel. Commercial nickel endeavours are already taking place in Europe as part of the LIFE-AGROMINE initiative and through the French company Econick (Alchemia Nova n.d.). I\u2019m not entirely confident on how either of them are doing, but they both do appear to still be in operation, and Econick apparently raised some additional later-stage venture capital in late 2022 (Pitchbook n.d.). Another European phytomining concern called Stratoz doesn\u2019t seem to have any current information about them on the Internet. There are also large-scale tests that are moving towards commercialization in Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo (Morse 2020).</p><p>Other metals have not seen quite the same enthusiasm as nickel, but that does not mean that research on their phytomining possibilities are entirely lacking. Thallium, a toxic metal that is important for many electronics, has been flagged as potentially quite promising for phytomining because it accumulates very easily in plants and thus could be easy to turn a profit. Cobalt has also been judged promising. Gold and other noble metals have been examined for their phytomining potential, but the reviews in van der Ent et al. (2021) are not particularly positive. Other research is ongoing concerning copper, manganese, selenium, and rare earth metals. There are more speculative reports of hyperaccumulation and thus the possibility of phytomining for a wide variety of metals, including mercury, technetium, uranium, and thorium.&nbsp;</p><p>For many other metals, research has been driven by the related topic of phytoremediation, where plants are used to clean up hazardous, typically contaminated, areas. Phytoremediation can, however, be combined with phytomining to both produce products of direct economic value and soils that are suitable for further production. Cadmium enjoys a high demand for its phytoremediation, but its prospects for phytomining seem worse because of a lack of efficient hyperaccumulators. Certain fern species have been used to phytoremediate arsenic, but it\u2019s not clear if the demand for arsenic is high enough to make the phytomining of arsenic a particularly likely outcome. Selenium is another metal where phytoremediation and bioextraction work may eventually lead to its phytomining in the United States and China.</p><p>It\u2019s very hard to find a solid estimate for how many people are working on phytomining currently. Probably the largest single organization working on phytomining as a major component of its mission is the Center for Mined Land Rehabilitation at the Sustainable Minerals Institute of the University of Queensland (University of Queensland n.d.). This is partially driven by the fact that a lot of phytomining work includes crossover with phytoremediation and other elements of research on the relationships between metals and plants. Furthermore, many phytomining researchers are academics and so also devote some of their time to teaching and other topics separate from their research. There are also chapters of van der Ent et. al (2021) that reference master\u2019s theses, but it\u2019s unclear that those individuals, or, for that matter, anybody whose current research I did not explicitly look up stayed within the field of phytomining research after that. There are ~60 contributors to van der Ent et. al (2021). Names in other papers that I looked at match very closely with the list of contributors to that work. If I assume that everybody who works on phytomining research contributed to the book and that they each spend half their work on phytomining, that results in an estimate of 30 FTEs (full-time equivalencies), the vast majority of which is devoted to scientific research and a smaller slice devoted to commercialization.&nbsp;</p><p>There clearly is some work ongoing towards phytomining policy and the non-scientific development of phytomining as a plausible alternative and complement to conventional mining. For instance, phytomining was mentioned as part of a law passed by the French government concerning the circular economy. Furthermore, the Department of Energy, through ARPA, has funded research concerning phytomining in the United States (Krol-Sinclair and Hale, 2023). However, it\u2019s not really clear to me if anybody is devoting a substantial proportion of their work time to focus on policy incentives to scale up phytomining production. There are also, of course, certainly some workers who tend to the plants on phytomining farms and don\u2019t directly do research, but I have no idea how many there are and it doesn\u2019t seem decision-relevant.</p><h1><strong>Global Health and Development Impacts:</strong></h1><p>One of the major cause areas in Effective Altruism is global health and development, although it can also be divided into two separate cause areas of global health and global development. Phytomining can be judged as an effective technology to improve both global health and global development. For global health, phytomining is useful because it serves as a substitute for conventional mining, which tends to produce poor health outcomes in both miners and the surrounding community. For global development, phytomining is useful because the jobs associated with a phytomining operation can often be preferable to jobs in traditional mining. However, support for phytomining because of its impacts on both global health and global development is indicative of a view among Effective Altruism that the near-term future should be the top priority, so these causes have been grouped together.</p><h2><strong>Global Health:</strong></h2><p>There aren\u2019t great statistics on how much of a health risk mining poses. According to the CDC, there were 37 known occupational mining fatalities in the United States in 2021, the last year for which data has been reported (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention n.d.). This is equivalent to 16.1 fatalities per 100,000 full-time employees. However, the United States is clearly capable of having much stronger regulations on mining than the developing countries where a large amount of metal production occurs. Furthermore, the health issues associated with mining are not just ones linked to current miners but also diseases such as black lung and the impacts of pollution and contamination from the mines on the surrounding community. The scale of issues with pollution from mining facilities, particularly upper respiratory infections, has been reported to be quite high in certain areas (Timmerman 2022). Yet it\u2019s also important to take into account that the health impacts of mining differ not just by the region but also based on what is mined; for example, uranium mining involves exposure to radon (Stephens and Ahern 2001). Phytomining can replace conventional mining for many common metals such as nickel, but it cannot replace coal mining.</p><p>One challenge in establishing the impacts of phytomining on global health is that phytomining does not remove all of the negative health outcomes linked to mining. Many phytomining procedures still involve some degree of smelting, although phytomining often results in higher-quality ore so less smelting can be necessary, and there are attempts to develop procedures that eliminate or cut out entirely the use of smelting. Thus the reduction in air pollution from implementing phytomining instead of conventional mining is variable but seems to generally be positive, although I\u2019ll flag this as an important point for further research and consideration in terms of global health impacts. However, it\u2019s safe to say that phytomining has much fewer of the health impacts of working underground, since if you\u2019re trying to grow plants underground you\u2019re almost certainly doing it wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, I wouldn\u2019t rate phytomining as a particularly promising avenue for further exploration by the Effective Altruism movement based on global health considerations alone. However, I do think that the global health impacts should be taken into account when looking at phytomining principally as a cause in other areas. Mining makes life pretty terrible for the communities surrounding it, but the scale of health impacts from mining, although hard to determine, seems to be less than that of major tractable issues such as malaria (which kills 1.1% of people worldwide) and other infectious diseases (Dattani et al., 2023).&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Global Development:</strong></h2><p>Mining is a major industry globally, but again it\u2019s very hard to say exactly how many people are employed by the mining industry worldwide, particularly because not everybody who works for a mining company is a miner. A 2019 report by the World Bank estimated that more than 40 million people work in small-scale or artisanal mining worldwide (Hobson 2019). A trade union group estimates 3.7 million people work in the mining sector worldwide, with 2.2 million of them in developing countries (IndustriALL n.d.).&nbsp;</p><p>On one hand, mines have historically been able to draw workers by offering relatively steady and high-paying jobs, especially compared to the forms of seasonal employment that are common across the developing world (Timmerman 2022). On the other hand, mines often impose high negative externalities on the local community and have been accused of both contravening the will of local communities that do not want to see a mine and using inaccurate predictions of their impacts on the local community. Some examples of these negative externalities include environmental disruption that removes the option of traditional forms of employment such as farming and fishing. Both air pollution and noise pollution can also drive residents to seek employment further from their communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Phytomining, by contrast, offers what I would consider to be a much rosier employment picture, although I\u2019d caution that you particularly shouldn\u2019t trust me, a lifelong inhabitant of a high-income country, on the preferences of people in lower-income countries. Because much of the core labor of the phytomining process is agricultural, it can fit well into the growing season of farmers, a particularly common occupation in the developing world. The metallic soils used for phytomining are typically considered not particularly good for growing other crops, so there\u2019s a very low opportunity cost to using the land for phytomining instead of other commercial practices. The cost in both money and effort of establishing a mine in a given location is much higher than the cost of establishing a phytomine (both need some form of a metal processing facility, but the mine also needs a lot of actual mining and the phytomine just needs some fields). This means that phytomines can be started more easily, and, because they have less fixed costs to cover, may also be stopped more easily. Phytomines also are less likely to require the displacement of people living on top of the mine, because, like other agricultural operations, they can work with non-contiguous fields.</p><p>But phytomining isn\u2019t just good for the people who work and live near the mine. This is getting a little speculative here, but the Indonesian government has used its control of mineral wealth to strongarm companies into building processing infrastructure for metals such as nickel in Indonesia, and using that to help get more advanced manufacturing located on Indonesian soil. This strategy, which is called downstreaming, is definitely controversial and comes with significant risks because it contravenes much of the dominant free-trade logic of political economists. Phytomining can help with this because it can both make more metal and tweak the distribution of where metal is made. Even without those measures, however, there\u2019s a common-sense argument that location-based benefits mean that it\u2019s often a good idea to produce metal near where the metal is used. Thus having a strong mining industry can help set a country on a path towards global development. However, it\u2019s still important to note that this section is very speculative and I don\u2019t see it as a particularly major benefit of phytomining.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t mean that phytomining is without its downsides from a development perspective. Mines are often located in out-of-the-way or remote areas, such as in the highest reaches of the Andes mountains. Phytomines, by contrast, need to be located in areas well-suited for the growing of crops, and are more likely to coexist with agricultural areas. Thus there are likely distributional consequences from establishing phytomines instead of traditional mines, although phytomining can often be done on former mines or areas next to present-day mines. My sense is that this mostly ends up favoring phytomines because humans have a very strong revealed preference to live near friends and family, but views could quite reasonably differ on this. Furthermore, traditional mining is much harder to ruin with bad weather than phytomining, meaning that the risk of phytomining is positively correlated with other risks from working in agriculture.&nbsp;</p><p>These concerns are definitely very real, but I don\u2019t think that they outweigh the many positives of phytomining from a development perspective. If you boil down the story of phytomining with regards to global development to its most important elements, it goes something like this: Mining employs a lot of people and can make a lot of money. But communities on the ground don\u2019t like to adopt it because of very real downsides. Phytomining lets them get the positives of mining (a new income stream, something to attract investment in other industries) without the downsides (pollution, mostly).</p><h1><strong>Climate Change and Biodiversity Impacts:</strong></h1><p>The conventional argument in favor of phytomining, presented in many of the news articles that I read for this, heavily focuses on phytomining\u2019s environmental impacts. For Effective Altruism\u2019s purposes, it\u2019s especially useful to divide these into two: effects on climate change and effects on biodiversity. Biodiversity isn\u2019t usually considered a major cause area, but there has been some discussion of biodiversity as a possible cause for the Effective Altruism movement (Malhotra 2022). The climate change case comes from how phytomining can both increase the supply of metals useful for green technology and how it can get metal for less greenhouse gasses than conventional mining. The biodiversity case is about how it can be better integrated with natural habitats than conventional mining, which often destroys the habitats, and also how phytomining can have benefits for overall ecosystem health. My understanding is that natural resource depletion is considered very speculative and unlikely by Effective Altruism, but I\u2019ll also mention its interactions with phytomining briefly.</p><h2><strong>Climate Change:</strong></h2><p>There\u2019s high demand for many metals because of green technology. Nickel, one of the elements with the highest promise for phytomining, is also particularly crucial for a wide array of clean-energy technologies, including electric car batteries (Roberts 2022; Timmerman 2022). Krol-Sinclair and Hale (2023) are particularly bullish on the prospects for phytomining of cobalt \u2014 I\u2019m not sure how much to read into this, since it\u2019s newer than van der Ent et al. (2021), but also written by people who are not scientific experts \u2014 and cobalt is also critical for many green technologies. Lithium, another essential component of certain battery designs, likely has hyperaccumulators but is much further behind in development than nickel and cobalt. Zinc and aluminum both have somewhat better outlooks than lithium. However, there are also other important metals that don\u2019t seem to accumulate or are too toxic to plants to be considered a good candidate for phytomining, of which chromium is an example.</p><p>The combined impact of an increased and cheapened supply of these metals could help catalyze the transition to a climate-friendly future, but the impacts of phytomining also go beyond that. Common sense (and van der Ent et. al (2021)) suggests that phytomining is more energy-efficient than traditional mining; there\u2019s no need to dig a hole in the ground. It\u2019s also likely that the metal can be processed more efficiently because of the form that it is in. The climate impacts of transporting the metal from a phytomining site versus a conventional mine is hard to say, but I suspect that it\u2019s a minor consideration as opposed to energy-efficiency and supply of critical materials. However, I will flag that people\u2019s beliefs about which technologies are most promising for future climate impact is an important consideration when judging the climate promise of phytomining. For me, I\u2019d judge phytomining to be promising by traditional standards, but I struggle to envision a scenario in which phytomining outcompetes climate interventions currently endorsed by Effective Altruism.</p><h2><strong>Biodiversity:</strong></h2><p>The case for phytomining for biodiversity reasons is based on three connected propositions: phytomining fits well with natural habitats, it can restore soils, and it can incentivize the protection of natural habitats. The third one is probably the least significant; phytomining incentivizes the protection of natural habitats because they can be used to find new hyperaccumulator species. I don\u2019t consider this line of reasoning particularly promising because preserving a wide range of plant species is already useful for pharmacological purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>I already discussed phytoremediation, the use of plants to clean up soils, in some earlier sections, but it\u2019s a critical element of the second point for biodiversity. One of the more promising types of locations for phytomining is contaminated soils. If these are phytomined, the level of contamination can thus be decreased, creating the possibility of the land again providing a habitat for the species that were on it. On the other hand, particularly large-scale phytomining could reduce the incidence of metal-rich soils and thus hurt the prospects for certain hyperaccumulators that rely on it. However, this doesn\u2019t seem to me to be a particularly concerning downside because it would rely on a tremendous amount of land being devoted to phytomining and additionally ignores that many hyperaccumulators can also grow on normal soils.</p><p>This leaves the impacts of phytomining on being better than conventional mining in preserving natural habitats. On one hand, this makes sense because phytomining mostly uses soils that aren\u2019t considered good by the normal standards of plants, while conventional mining tears up whole ecosystems in order to find the metals underneath. Still, it\u2019s possible that further research could determine negative impacts to phytomining, since it does require changing an ecosystem with the introduction of additional hyperaccumulators for harvesting. Focusing on native hyperaccumulators, which is suggested anyways because they are likely to be well-adapted to the environment, can help remediate this concern.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s hard for me to form a particularly coherent opinion as to the biodiversity impacts of phytomining, because so little research done in this area has explicitly compared it to the standards of the Effective Altruism movement. Still, I\u2019d very loosely guess that phytomining has positive biodiversity impacts, but that there are better marginal uses of time and money in terms of promoting global biodiversity.</p><h2><strong>Natural Resource Depletion:</strong></h2><p>The level of concern allocated to natural resource depletion seems to me to generally be quite low among Effective Altruism, but it is given more serious consideration by individuals outside the Effective Altruism movement (Wiblin, 2016). Still, I think it\u2019s worth addressing what phytomining could do to natural resource depletion. Phytomining can help restore soils because many plants do not thrive in soils that have high concentrations of the metals that are removed through phytomining, although there is also a risk of erosion. Phytomining can also increase the supply of metals that are extractable for a reasonable price. On the other hand, phytomining supplies on naturally ultramafic soils do not last forever (although presumably soil contamination and the more hypothetical industrial waste approach will continue to have opportunities), which could lull civilization into a false sense of complacency about the ease of metal supply. I\u2019m especially ill-informed about natural resource depletion, but I\u2019d say that phytomining could be highly effective in preventing natural resource depletion by increasing the supply of metals, but also that I\u2019m not particularly concerned about this topic.</p><h1><strong>Civilizational Impacts:</strong></h1><p>Civilizational resilience is yet another lens through which phytomining can be judged for promise as a cause according to the principles of Effective Altruism. The theory here is that, if we\u2019re in the unfortunate position of redoing civilization after some kind of major catastrophe or near-extinction event, it\u2019s important to have easily accessible metals. Furthermore, many of those easily accessible metal sources have already been used in the past, so this future version of us would have a harder task than the one that our civilization had before. Phytomining can ameliorate this because it doesn\u2019t seem to require anything that would be particularly hard to do after a collapse. There\u2019s no need to dig huge holes, it can work with a variety of options for refining the metal, and even the identification of hyperaccumulators has been done without fancy technology. However, one possible challenge is identifying hyperaccumulators post-catastrophe; knowing what they are before a catastrophe occurs would almost certainly be easier.</p><p>One major question here is what metals would be needed in such a scenario. I don\u2019t have access to the full book, but Dartnell (2014) speculates that the top priority would be making steel, which takes iron, and that aluminum would also be particularly useful. Neither of these metals have been the subject of much phytomining research or have been judged to be particularly promising. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a need for, say, nickel, thallium, and cobalt, to name some metals where phytomining seems more promising. One important avenue for further research would be figuring out what metals are both critical to civilization and comparatively easy to phytomine. All in all, I think that phytomining could potentially be quite impactful from a civilization resilience lens and is particularly deserving of further research.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Other Impacts:</strong></h1><p>Here I\u2019m going to lump together three cause areas that all are very important to the Effective Altruism movement that could potentially have minor negative interactions with phytomining: nuclear safety, artificial intelligence and technological challenges at large, and animal welfare, especially with regards to wild animals. These don\u2019t share that much in common, but it\u2019s convenient to address them at the same time. I\u2019ve tried to brainstorm any possible interactions with remaining cause areas (pandemics, aligning present-day technology) but can\u2019t think of anything.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Nuclear risk:</strong></h2><p>Let\u2019s start with nuclear risk, where I consider phytomining\u2019s prospective impact to likely be largest. Metals, especially uranium, are important to the production of nuclear bombs. Uranium can theoretically be produced using phytomining, although research into this is very scant compared to more popular metals like nickel. It\u2019s possible that some other naturally occurring radioactive elements, such as technetium, could also be phytomined. However, there are reasons to think that this isn\u2019t a major concern. One is that there are a lot of countries with nuclear power, and thus uranium, but no nuclear weapons, including countries such as Iran that would like to have nuclear weapons. This is evidence that the pure availability of raw uranium is probably not the limiting factor in the production of nuclear weapons. I looked for a more reliable source on this, but the World Nuclear Association, a pro-nuclear power trade group, also heavily implies that it\u2019s uranium enrichment, not the availability of uranium, that limits countries (World Nuclear Association 2023). It\u2019s also worth considering that a lot of phytomining research is specific to certain metals, and so is unlikely to significantly change the calculations with respect to uranium availability. I consider this something to keep an eye out on in future phytomining research, but it seems like a very minor and speculative downside to this technology.</p><h2><strong>Artificial intelligence:</strong></h2><p>The effects of phytomining on the development of artificial intelligence are more or less the effects of phytomining on technology development at large. Lots of metals are useful in building technology and in particular semiconductors, including rare earth metals, which have a potential for phytomining (IEEE n.d.). Electronics are also a major use case of thallium. For the most part, I think it\u2019s widely held that cheaper technology is good. But some of this technology can be used in AI capabilities research, and training runs for large language models are expensive, although I can\u2019t find any high-quality sources estimating what part of that is the cost of electricity versus the cost of the computers used to run it (Sajid 2023). It doesn\u2019t seem to me, however, that the cost of the specific metals with the greatest phytomining potential is a limiting factor in these runs, however. Any impact of cheaper electronics from phytomining would likely be slight, although I have extremely low confidence in this even compared to the rest of this post. I\u2019d be interested to know whether people whose work on AI safety focuses on limiting the capacity of people to train the AI think that this could be a concern, but I think that any impacts of cheaper electronics from phytomining would likely be so minor that this isn\u2019t a significant downside. This also means that other upsides (more accessibility of smartphones in the Global South) and downsides (maybe more accessibility of social media to teenagers) of cheaper electronics are also very likely insignificant.</p><h2><strong>Animal Welfare:</strong></h2><p>Some of the metals that can be phytomined are toxic to many species, including thallium. Arsenic can also be phytomined in theory, although economically it\u2019s not a particularly viable proposition. This includes humans, but humans can and do take precautions to avoid the toxicity associated with these substances. Plants with high concentrations of metals in them are often toxic to animals; I was told some time ago that this is what locoweed is, but that\u2019s not actually true. Phytomining increases the number of these plants around and puts them near humans, thus exposing them to animals. However, everything reported in van der Ent et al. (2021) suggests that animals usually have the sense to avoid these plants if they are toxic. There might also be a need for herbicide or insecticide in some cases, I\u2019m not sure about that. Phytomining also depletes these metals from the soil, which can in the long run be good for letting plants grow there without unhealthy concentrations of metals. Thus, I don\u2019t judge this to be a particularly significant concern, but it\u2019s probably worth keeping an eye out for any negative effects on animal species (or humans) that pop up as a result of phytomining.</p><p>The other possible objection to phytomining on animal welfare grounds is the meat-eater problem. Anything that makes human lives better off will let them eat more meat, which means that helping humans kills animals. My sense is that there are a lot of different justifications for how support for helping animals and present-day humans can co-exist, but if you are concerned about the meat-eater problem, phytomining is one of many interventions to no longer look promising.</p><h1><strong>Analysis:</strong></h1><p>I recommend phytomining enthusiastically but with some caveats for further research and study by organizations that share goals with the Effective Altruism community. Phytomining promotion shows the potential to be a promising civilization resilience intervention and is worthy of consideration for its impacts on global development and also climate change. Benefits to global health and biodiversity are worth noting but a brief glance does not make them seem strong enough to be good candidates for further investigation in those areas. Natural resource depletion isn\u2019t a traditional cause area of Effective Altruism, but phytomining could also be extremely valuable for people with interests in that area. However, there\u2019s also a very speculative potential for negative impacts due to phytomining in nuclear risk, AI safety and alignment, and animal welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>There were a few points that seem particularly important for further refining our understanding of the promise of phytomining. Firstly, to what extent does phytomining replace conventional mining and to what extent does it add to the metal supply of conventional mining. My expectation, which I believe to be implied in van der Ent et al. (2021), is that it does some of both. Certain elements with extremely high phytomining potential such as thallium could see both the replacement of conventional mining and some additional supply. However, since there\u2019s a much higher demand for nickel, it would be harder for phytomining to eliminate conventional nickel mining. These considerations are likely to vary by element. From the Effective Altruism perspective, this is an important question because the positive impacts in some cause areas rely on one mechanism or the other. The impacts on climate change, natural resource depletion, artificial intelligence, and nuclear risk mostly rely on it adding to the metal supply. The impacts on global health and development as well as biodiversity and some of the climate change impacts mostly rely on it displacing conventional mining.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, it\u2019s important to consider what specific metals can be phytomined and how well they match up to the metals important for different cause areas. This is particularly important for civilizational resilience, where specific metals are likely to have a much larger impact, but it also matters for many of the other cause areas. I\u2019ve already done some preliminary investigation on the subject, as reflected in the post, but there\u2019s a lot more room to examine and quantify the phytomining potential of different metals.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, it\u2019s still an open question as to how bad conventional mining is for global health, including global mental health, and development. I lean towards thinking it\u2019s pretty bad, since there seems to be a stated preference against mines in a lot of communities near the mines and I don\u2019t have particularly strong reasons to question it. However, I wasn\u2019t able to find much information on this subject in my fairly quick look through the area, and it particularly seems to lack the quantitative analyses that could help compare it to other global health cause areas. Polls done in the developing world could make significant progress towards answering this question.</p><p>Lastly, a number of the impacts, particularly in global health and climate change, are reliant on getting the metal out of the plants being more energy-efficient than traditional smelting. This view is well supported by van der Ent et al. (2021) and Morse (2020), but arguments against it would be bad for the case for phytomining. Alternatively, I haven\u2019t looked much at other ways to produce metal with greater energy-efficiency, but it\u2019s also possible that phytomining could look much worse if interventions with similar but larger effects are also available.</p><p>For my particular views about cause area prioritization, this makes phytomining seem quite promising. However, I\u2019d expect that other people could have radically different moral and practical views that could affect their cause area prioritization. I already mentioned the meat-eater problem, but differing views on how bad extinction is compared to catastrophe would also affect the expected value of civilization resilience interventions. Thus, it\u2019s important to note that phytomining being a cause that crosses cause areas is particularly good if you think a lot of cause areas are valuable, but if you think that one cause area is particularly valuable, its breadth does not help it.</p><p>I will also venture a quick qualitative Importance, Neglectedness, Tractability analysis given my personal views on phytomining as well as the relative value of different cause areas. I have a lot of uncertainty about importance in particular, but it seems like it could be either a little less or a little more important than other common problems in Effective Altruism. I think specific parts of phytomining, especially work on policy and scaling, are extremely neglected, but botany-heavy work is less neglected. I\u2019d also venture that the tractability is probably above-average but a little odd; it seems that there will eventually be strong economic incentives to do phytomining, but that it carries a lot of uncertainty now. This is influenced by how many open questions in phytomining are specific to certain metals, plants, or regions of the world. A small successful phytomining company could do well to inspire others, but the counterfactual impact of a specific small company is hard to imagine. Something that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into these three categories is that some forms of expertise useful for phytomining (plants, soils, Southeast Asia, mining) aren\u2019t in high demand, as far as I know, in other causes of Effective Altruism.</p><h1><strong>Next Steps:</strong></h1><h2><strong>Research:</strong></h2><p>The obvious next step, which I\u2019ve called for multiple times in this piece already, is some form of further research and exploration about the potential of phytomining as a cause area of Effective Altruism, likely focusing on its potential to help with one of climate change, global health and development, or civilizational resilience. However, there would be some benefits to keeping the broad-spectrum approach of seeing what phytomining promotion could do that I have adopted in this piece. A broad approach that looks at multiple different mechanisms by which phytomining might improve the world is better at identifying downsides to phytomining, and could consolidate research that would otherwise be multiple different reports. On the other hand, it would be really hard to produce a coherent quantitative estimation of the value of phytomining across cause areas. It also would probably be a challenge to make future recommendations for more concrete actions on phytomining if they don\u2019t strongly target one cause area, because so much funding in Effective Altruism is cause-area-specific.</p><p>Based on my experience, I\u2019d advise anybody undertaking a longer research project about phytomining to start with van der Ent et al. (2021); it\u2019s not quite the state of art of the field but is very close. Anything mentioned in Krol-Sinclair and Hale (2023) is probably a good place to start for a deeper dive into policy levers. Furthermore, I\u2019d very strongly advise contacting experts in the field; I didn\u2019t do so both because of time constraints on my part and because I didn\u2019t want to waste their time for something that was supposed to be shorter than it ended up being. These experts could include people working for phytomining startups like Econick and LIFE-AGROMINE, academics such as those at the Center for Mined Land Rehabilitation, and scientists from outside the phytomining community who can provide an outside perspective on phytomining\u2019s claims as a field.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019d also recommend this report being written by somebody with more experience in relative fields than I have; even if not a geologist, environmental scientist, or botanist, somebody with any familiarity with engineering and chemistry should be able to produce better estimates of the phytomining potential of specific metals than I have. I also think that, although I\u2019ve mostly eschewed quantitative claims here, quantitative reasoning would be very useful to be able to more explicitly compare phytomining to other causes and interventions.</p><h2><strong>After Research:</strong></h2><p>Even by the standards of this post, this section consists of speculative things I think such a further research report could recommend. One possible tool for phytomining promotion would be a charity to work on advocating for pro-phytomining policies, likely starting in Indonesia or maybe Southeast Asia as a whole. It wouldn\u2019t need to be particularly large and I doubt the marginal return would be particularly high from it being more than a few people.&nbsp;</p><p>If civilizational resilience is the main concern, one promising intervention would be to campaign for the Svalbard Global Seed Vault to open its doors to non-crop seeds (Svalbard Global Seed Vault n.d.). Currently the seed vault prioritizes crop plants and their close genetic relatives, but in many possible catastrophes, having both proven medicinal plants and hyperaccumulators would likely be a civilizational priority. I\u2019m honestly not sure why this isn\u2019t already the case; figuring out why it isn\u2019t would likely be important to getting this intervention to work well. Establishing a seed vault just for hyperaccumulators would be possible but costly. Another civilizational-resilience-tinged intervention would be to write a short but practical how-to-phytomine guide and put it with all the other sources of knowledge that people want to survive a major catastrophe.</p><p>And, of course, more research! Civilization resilience is hard to run experiments for, because civilization hasn\u2019t yet collapsed (knock on wood), but there are other elements of phytomining, such as health benefits, that seem amenable to high-quality research such as RCTs.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Other Steps:</strong></h2><p>I\u2019m not sure if this is correct, but I imagine that Effective Altruism organizations implicitly have a list of things that could affect the sorts of things they care about. I imagine this list to include both activities elsewhere in Effective Altruism-affiliated organizations \u2014 for example, what AI regulations might do to non-AI causes \u2014 and also other important civilization developments, like cheaper solar power or the Russo-Ukrainian War. I think phytomining belongs on that list. It spans a wide variety of topics that the Effective Altruism community cares about, as demonstrated by how many cause areas I discussed above. It\u2019s easy to imagine a future where phytomining becomes dominant for many metals, but also one where it fades into the dustbin of weird inventions.&nbsp;</p><p>So obviously, if there are explicit lists of these kinds of sources of disruption to consider, I\u2019d urge people to add phytomining to them. Explicitly considering phytomining in forecasts could also be good, if you\u2019re convinced of its potential. But I\u2019ll go further and say that more writing on phytomining would be positive in general. There isn\u2019t a lot of non-technical descriptions out there about phytomining that really go beyond the surface level, although Morse (2020) is pretty good. More information about phytomining that is readily available would help get the word out to potential stakeholders, such as mainstream climate activists and the parts of the global development field that are not part of Effective Altruism.</p><h1><strong>Sources:</strong></h1><p>All sources are cited in Chicago Author-Date format, more or less.

What scandals have happened and why?</h1><h2>1.&nbsp;</h2><p>There are several reasons that EA might be expected to do harm and have scandals:</p><p>a) <strong>Bad actors</strong>. Some EAs will take harmful actions with a callous disregard for others. (Some EAs have psychopathic tendencies, and it is worth noting that that utilitarian intuitions correlate with psychopathy.)</p><p>b) <strong>Naivete. </strong>Many EAs are not socially competent, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jFnyqaLAtgfWpATeJ/ea-s-weirdness-makes-it-unusually-susceptible-to-bad?commentId=gf9ZSC7xNCBxpwJtE\"><u>streetsmart</u></a>, enough to be able to detect the bad actors. Rates of autism are high in EA, but there are also more general hypotheses. Social movements may in-general by susceptible to misbehaviour, due to young members having an elevated sense of importance, or being generally impressionable. See David Chapman on \u201c<a href=\"https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths\"><u>geeks, mops and sociopaths</u></a>\u201d for other hypotheses.</p><p>c) <strong>Ideological aspects</strong>. Some ideas held by many EAs - whether right or wrong, and implied by EA philosophy or not - encourage risky behaviour. We could call these ideas&nbsp;<strong>risky beneficentrism (RB)</strong>, and they include:</p><p>i. <strong>High risk appetite.</strong></p><p>ii. <strong>Scope sensitivity</strong></p><p>iii. <strong>Unilateralism</strong></p><p>iv. <strong>Permission to violate societal norms</strong>. Violating or reshaping an inherited morality or other \u201creceived wisdom\u201d for the greater good.</p><p>iv. <strong>Other naive consequentialism.&nbsp;</strong>Disregard of other second-order effects</p><p>There are also hypotheses that mix or augment these categories: EAs might be more vulnerable to generally psychopathic behaviour due to that kind of decision-making appearing superficially similar to consequentialist decision-making</p><h2>2.&nbsp;</h2><p>All of (a-c) featured in the FTX saga. SBF was psychopathic, and his behaviour included all five of these dimensions of risky beneficentrism. The FTX founders weren\u2019t&nbsp;<i>correctly</i> following the values of the EA community, but much of what would be warning signs to others (gambling-adjacency, the Bahamas, lax governance), to us &nbsp;just looked like someone pursuing a risky, scope-sensitive, convention-breaking, altruistic endeavour. And we EAs outside FTX, perhaps due to ambition and naivete, supported these activities.</p><h2>3.&nbsp;</h2><p>Other EA scandals, similarly, often involve multiple of these elements:</p><ul><li>[Person #1]: past sexual harassment issues, later reputation management including Wiki warring and misleading histories. (norm-violation, naive conseq.)</li><li>[Person #2]: sexual harassment (norm-violation? naive conseq?)</li><li>[Person #3] [Person #4] [Person #5]: three more instances of crypto crimes (scope sensitivity? Norm-violation, naive conseq.? naivete?)</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fn7bo8sYEHS3RPKQG/concerns-with-intentional-insights\"><u>Intentional Insights</u></a>: aggressive PR campaigns (norm-violation, naive conseq., naivete?)</li><li>Leverage Research, including partial takeover of CEA (risk appetite, norm-violation, naive conseq, unilateralism, naivete)</li><li>(We\u2019ve seen major examples of sexual misbehaviour and crypto crimes in the rationalist community too.)</li></ul><p>EA documents have tried to discourage RB, but this now seems harder than we thought. Maybe promoting EA inevitably leads to significant amounts of harmful RB.&nbsp;</p><h2>4.</h2><p>People have a variety of reasons to be less excited about growing EA:</p><p>EA contributed to a vast financial fraud, through its:</p><ul><li><i>People.&nbsp;</i>SBF was the best-known EA, and one of the earliest 1%.

FTX had some EA staff and was funded by EA investors.</i></li><li><i>PR.&nbsp;</i>SBF\u2019s EA-oriented philosophy on giving, and purported frugality served as cover for his unethical nature.</li><li><i>Ideology</i>. SBF apparently had an RB ideology, as a risk-neutral act-utilitarian, who argued a decade ago why stealing was not in-principle wrong, on Felicifia. In my view, his ideology, at least as he professed it, could best be understood as an extremist variant of EA.</li></ul><p>Now, alongside the positive consequences of EA, such as billions of dollars donated, and minds changed about AI and other important topics, we must account for about $10B having been stolen.</p><p>People who work in policy now stand to have their reputation harmed by a connection to \u201cEA\u201d. This now means that EA movement growth can make policmakers more likely to be tied to EA, harming their career prospects.</p><p>From a more personal perspective, 200-800 EAs lost big on FTX: their jobs, savings, or sheer embarrassment (having recommended grants rescinded, etc.).</p><p>It may be more difficult, as there are new ways that promoting EA can go badly. For example, the conversation could go like this:</p><p>Booster: \u201chave you heard about EA?\u201d<br>Recruit: \u201cthat thing that donated $1B then FTX defrauded 10B? The fifth largest fraud of all time?\u201d<br>Booster: \u201c...\u201d</p><h1>II. More background considerations about EA\u2019s current trajectory.</h1><h2>5.</h2><p>Despite the above, EA is not about to disappear entirely. For any reasonable strategy that EA leaders pursue, some of the most&nbsp;<strong>valuable aspects of EA will persist</strong>:</p><ul><li><i>EA values</i>. Some people care about EA very deeply. Religions can withstand persecution by totalitarian governments, and some feel just about as strongly about EA. So people will continue to hold EA values.</li><li><i>EA orgs</i>. There are &gt;30 orgs doing different EA things, with different leaders, inside and outside academia, in many nations, and supported by multiple funders. Most will survive.</li><li><i>The EA network. Many have been friends and colleagues for a decade or more. This adversity won\u2019t tear the social graph apart.</i></li></ul><h2><i>6.</i></h2><p>There has been a wide range of responses to FTX-related events. One common response is that people are less excited about EA.</p><ul><li>Good people have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/t5vFLabB2mQz2tgDr/i-m-a-22-year-old-woman-involved-in-effective-altruism-i-m\"><u>become</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JcaecPXE8am7MYJXZ/i-am-tired\"><u>disillusioned</u></a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/99tnp7Jpts7Gssq7J/transitioning-to-an-advisory-role\"><u>burned out</u></a> and are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NunoSempere/status/1616398091388870660?fbclid=IwAR3E_W9rPplEc55JpUPKPm92fsAg1n65oxHonCwrxjx0PtLnRM-2-hFUrUY\"><u>leaving</u></a> EA. Note also the discontinuation of Lightcone for partly related reasons.</li><li>Personally, I still value EA goals, EA work, and have EA friends, but my enthusiasm for EA as a movement is gone.</li><li>Some argue that the people I hear from are not representative. But I think they differ if anything, by being older, and more independent-minded, and more academically successful. And if outreach is still thriving, but this is just because new recruits are young and naive about EA\u2019s failings, then this is not reassuring. Besides, the bigger selection effect is that we are not hearing from many, because they have left EA.</li></ul><h2><i>7.</i></h2><p>Another kind of response is for people to get defensive.<i>&nbsp;</i>Some of us would take a bunker-type mindset, trying to fortify EA against criticism. One minor example is that when I wrote in my bio, for an EA organiser retreat, that I am interested in&nbsp;<i>comparing&nbsp;</i>community-building vs non-CB roles, and in discussing&nbsp;<i>activities other than movement-building</i>, a worried organiser reminded me that the purpose of the retreat is to&nbsp;<i>promote</i> community-building. Another example is that many told me that their biggest concern about criticism of EA is that it demotivates people. Others reflected more deeply on EA, and I think that was the more appropriate response.</p><h2><i>8.</i></h2><p>Some people changed their views on EA less than I would like, especially some grantmakers and leaders. (I hesitate to point it out, but such folks do derive a lot of influence from their roles within EA, making it harder to update.)</p><ul><li>Some have suggested that there was little wrong with the style of politics pursued using FTX money, apart from the fraud.</li><li>Some asked: if students seem to still be interested, then why is there a problem? One asked \u201caren\u2019t you a utilitarian? Should you therefore place low weight on these things?\u201d. Whereas I think that our seat of the pants impression of the severity of events is more reliable than e.g. surveys from selected samples of event attendees, and that we should treat recent scandals seriously.</li></ul><h2><i>9.</i></h2><p>I think that CEA has struggled in some ways to adapt to the new situation.</p><ul><li><i>Vacuous annual update</i>. CEA\u2019s annual updates said that CEA had a great year, because metrics are up, while EA at-large had its worst year ever. In order to know the value of different kinds of growth, including even the sign, one must know the strategic landscape, which was not discussed. EVF and its board have generally said little about the FTX issue.</li><li><i>Governance</i>. EVF failed to announce its new CEO for months, and for almost a year, the FTXFF team still made up 40% of its UK board. It is thought&nbsp;<a href=\"https://manifold.markets/Jason/will-the-charity-commissions-statut-78d5dd70a396\"><u>10%-likely</u></a> at time of writing to be subject to discipline from the charity commission.</li></ul><h1>III. Thoughts on strategy</h1><p>So far, I have largely just described EA\u2019s strategic position. I will now outline what I think we should now do.</p><h2>10.</h2><p><strong>Promoting \u201cEA\u201d to promote interest in x-risk now makes less sense</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>But I don\u2019t think pivoting the longtermist EA scene toward being an \u201cx-risk\u201d community solves the problem; it might even make it worse.</strong></p><p>a) Typically, people I talk to are interested EA movement-building as a route to reducing x-risks. It is a priori surprising that we should need to detour through moral philosophy and global health, but they raise three points in favour:&nbsp;</p><p>i. EA is an especially persuasive way to get people working on x-risk</p><p>ii. (AI) x-risk is too weird to directly persuade people about.</p><p>iii. People who work on existential risk for \u201cthe right reasons\u201d (i.e. reasons related to EA), can be trusted more, to do a good job.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the reputational collapse of EA, (i) is less plausible. (ii) is much less true than it once was, thanks to Superintelligence, the Precipice, and growing AI capabilities. It might make some sense to want someone who can pursue your goals, as in (iii). But on the other hand, interest in EA is now a less reliable signal of someone\u2019s epistemics, and their trustworthiness in general, pushing in the other direction.&nbsp;</p><p>b) There is also somewhat less goodwill and&nbsp; trust between longtermist and non-longtermist EA, than there was a decade ago.</p><p>c) Even before the events of FTX, we knew that there was low-hanging fruit in field-building that we should pick - now we just need to give it more of our attention.&nbsp;</p><p>d) So, within a few years, I think most people doing EA work will be inclined to promote causes of interest - x-risk, global poverty, etc. in a direct fashion.&nbsp;</p><p>e) This is not without its challenges. We will need to work out new cause-specific talent pipelines. And many of the difficulties with EA outreach will remain in the cause-specific communities.&nbsp;</p><p>f) A central problem is that an AI safety community founded by EAs could - absent mitigating actions - be expected to have many of the same problems that afflicted EA. We could still expect that a subculture might form. If AI risk can literally cause human extinction, then it is not hard to justify the same kind of risky actions that RB can justify. Some illegal actions might even be&nbsp;<i>more</i> likely in an AI safety community, such as trying to harm AI researchers. So fundamentally, a switch to directly promoting AI/x-risk reduction&nbsp;<i>doesn\u2019t</i> solve the problems discussed in this document.</p><p>g) But starting a newly branded \u201cAI safety\u201d community might present an opportunity to reset our culture and practices.</p><h2>11.</h2><p>Apart from pivoting to \u201cx-risk\u201d, what else could we do? Would it help if\u2026</p><p>a) \u2026EA changed its name?&nbsp;</p><p>This would be deceptive, and wouldn\u2019t solve the risky behaviour, or even the reputational issues in the long-term.</p><p>b) \u2026we had a stronger community health team with a broad mandate for managing risks, rather than mostly social disputes and PR?&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe, but CH already had a broad mandate on paper. Given EVF\u2019s current situation, it might be a tall task. And if VCs and accountancies didn\u2019t see FTX\u2019s problems, then a beefed-up CH might not either.</p><p>Maybe a CH team could do this better independently of CEA.</p><p>Alternatively, risk management could be decentralised by instantiating a stronger norm against risky projects: If Alice thinks some project is good but Bob says it\u2019s harmful, we trust Bob more than we did before.</p><p>c) ... we shape the ideology to steer clearer of RB &amp; naive consequentialism?</p><p>Yes, this was already attempted, but we could do more. OTOH, it could be that beneficentrists are naturally (and intractably) include some psychopaths and other untrustworthy figures. If so, this could undermine the central strategy of recruiting beneficentrists to a community. But to the extent that people are committed to growing this beneficentrist community, such mitigation strategies are worth trying.</p><p>d) \u2026 we selected against people with dark triad traits, and in cases where we did recruit such people, we identified and distanced ourselves from them.</p><p>Absolutely</p><p>e) \u2026 EA was more professionalised, and less community-like?</p><p>Yes. People do risky things when they feel it\u2019s them vs the world. And we trusted Sam too much because he was \u201cone of us\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>f) \u2026 we had better governance</p><p>Yes, there was little oversight of FTX, which enabled various problems.</p><p>g) \u2026 EAs otherwise become less bound to one another's reputations</p><p>It doesn\u2019t obviate the harm from risky behaviour, but ideally yes, and this could also be achieved by being less community-like.</p><p>We could focus less on visible displays of do-gooding, to reduce the false impression that we are supposed to be a community of moral saints.</p><p>These are just my initial thoughts, obviously on all fronts, further investigation is needed.</p><h2>12.&nbsp;</h2><p>What&nbsp; should happen overall?</p><p>a) I think most EAs are not yet ready to let go of the existence of an EA movement. Nor is it clear that we could wind down effectively if we tried (without it getting co-opted). And things might look different in a year. So I don\u2019t think it makes sense to try to wind down EA completely.</p><p>b) Still, it\u2019s hard to see how tweaking EA can lead to a product that we should be excited about growing. Especially considering that we have the excellent option of just talking directly about the issues that matter to us, and doing field-building around those ideas - AI safety, Global Priorities Research, and so on. This would be a relatively clean slate, allowing us to do more (as outlined in 11), to discourage RB, and stop bad actors.</p><p>c) In this picture, EA would grow more slowly or shrink for a while, and maybe ultimately be overtaken by cause-specific communities.</p><p><i>Thanks to a dozen or so readers for their thoughtful comments and suggestions.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "WDsxB6n4dhxmwbQex", "title": "How should technical AI researchers best transition into AI governance and policy?", "postedAt": "2023-09-10T05:29:36.595Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>In the spirit of &nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/HqxvGsczdf4yLB9FG/p/FWmnwCcKiBLstFtYL\"><i>Career Conversations Week, </i></a><i>throwing out some quick questions that I hope are also relevant for others in a similar position!</i></p><p>I'm an early-career person aiming to have a positive impact on AI safety.

We believe that all beings with the capacity to suffer deserve to be treated with respect and compassion, and that our policies and practices should reflect this. Our goal is to promote research and scholarship that will help to shape a more just and humane world for all.</p><p>* * As it happens, this program description was co-authored by GPT-3, a large language model! Thank you to our co-sponsors for your generous support of this event:</p><ul><li>NYU Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness</li><li>NYU Center for Bioethics</li></ul><h1>Transcript</h1><p>JEFF</p><p>Hi everybody. My name is Jeff Sebo. Welcome to this event. Thank you for being here during what I know is a very busy week and day for everybody. This is the first day of class at NYU, and the fact that we have an event today with this many people interested, I think is a testament to how interesting the topic and the report that will be the basis for our conversation are.</p><p>So this is an event hosted by the NYU Mind Ethics and Policy Program, and we are also grateful to our co-sponsors, the NYU Center for Bioethics and the NYU Center for Mind, Brain and Consciousness. Thank you for co-sponsoring this event. The NYU Mind Ethics and Policy Program examines the nature and intrinsic value of non-human minds, including biological and nonbiological minds, with special focus on invertebrates and artificial intelligence systems. We are interested in examining what kinds of beings can be conscious and sentient and sapient, and what kinds of moral and legal and political status they should have.</p><p>And so we were very interested when this team released this report about a week ago, a report on what leading scientific theories of consciousness have to say about possible AI consciousness. And so we thought it would be useful, especially since the report, as soon as it was released, was generating a lot of discussion. It received coverage in Nature and Science and a lot of conversation on the Internet. We thought it would be valuable to bring some of the authors of the report together. There were 19 authors from different fields and different institutes, and we thought we could bring four of them together, including the two lead authors and representatives of other fields as well, to talk about the report, summarize some of the main points, and then offer their own individual perspectives about some of the implications.</p><p>So I will now briefly introduce the speakers, and then we can hear some remarks from them, and then we can open up the discussion and hear questions and comments from you and have a conversation. So here are the speakers.</p><p>Patrick Butlin is a philosopher of mind and cognitive science and a Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford. His current research is on consciousness, agency and other mental capacities and attributes in AI. Robert Long is a research affiliate at the center for AI Safety. He recently completed his PhD in philosophy at New York University, during which he also worked as a research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute. He works on issues related to possible AI consciousness and sentience. Yoshua Bengio is recognized worldwide as one of the leading experts in artificial intelligence, known for his conceptual and engineering breakthroughs in artificial neural networks and deep learning. He is a full professor in the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research at the University de Montreal, and the founder and Scientific Director of Mila Quebec AI Institute one of the world's largest academic institutes in deep learning. He is also the winner of many awards and has many other accomplishments that you can easily find online. And finally, Grace Lindsay is currently an assistant professor of Psychology and Data Science at New York University. After a BS in neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh and a year at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Freiburg, Germany, Grace got her PhD at the center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University in the lab of Ken Miller. Following that, she was a Sainsbury Wellcome Center Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit Research Fellow at University College London.</p><p>So thank you all so much for, first of all, writing this very interesting report, and second of all, being here to talk with us about it. I know a lot of people here are interested in hearing from you and discussing this with you. Just a note to everybody that the format and structure of this event will be that we will hear brief remarks from each of the four authors and speakers. Patrick and Rob will speak together about a summary of the report, followed by a philosophical perspective. And then we can hear cognitive science and computer science perspectives from Grayson and Yoshua, respectively. And all along the way, people in the audience can submit questions and comments, objections, whatever you like in the Q/A tab on zoom. And then when we reach the discussion portion of this event, I can read questions, comments, objections that have been entered and upvoted from the Q/A tab. So please go ahead and open that up and add your questions and comments whenever you like throughout the session. Okay, so with that in mind, without further ado, we can start the show. So, Patrick and Rob, whenever you are ready, feel free to share your screen and tell us about your report.</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>All right, so here we go, Jeff. And if you can, let me know that everything is in working order.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Everything is in working order. Yeah, go for it.</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>Excellent. So let's begin.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>First, I just want to say thank you so much to the audience for turning out. We're extremely excited to discuss these issues with you. A big part of why we wrote this report is to discuss these topics more widely and hear from different people. And thanks so much to you, Jeff, and to the NYU Mind Ethics and Policy Program for hosting this. So, my name is Robert Long, and along with Patrick Butlin, I'm one of the lead authors on this report. As Jeff mentioned, there are also 17 esteemed colleagues from various disciplines, and I'm going to briefly say what we did in the report and why we did it and why it matters. And, I mean, Patrick will be covering some of that.</p><p>So you've all probably read about the case of Blake Lemoyne, a Google engineer who was fired from Google after he became convinced that an AI system he was interacting with was conscious. You've probably seen the increased deployment of chatbots, including romantic chatbots, that interact with people in very human-like, compelling ways. And you may have seen a tweet from OpenAI's chief scientist Ilya Sutzkiver saying that it may be that today's large neural networks are slightly conscious. So AI consciousness is obviously a topic of increasing public concern and public interest, and it's also a perennially fascinating scientific question. Speaking for myself, as AI consciousness has become a bigger topic recently, I've often been frustrated by some of the characteristics that conversation about it has. I think when people talk about AI consciousness, there's often a lack of specific scientific evidence. There's very little detailed analysis of existing systems. The conversation is often kind of emotive and highly charged and often in dichotomies. Like how could AI systems possibly be conscious? We know that that's absurd. Or on the other hand, people being certain that they definitely are conscious. And what we wanted to provide in this report is kind of a better footing for these kinds of conversations. We want to bring a more nuanced and a more evidence based approach to the report. So in addition to the actual findings that we have, we really want to spur a conversation and spur further research along these lines.</p><p>So one aspect I'm going to talk about briefly is also conceptual clarity, something that philosophers love about what exactly we're talking about when we talk about AI consciousness. And before I do that again, just an advertisement for the paper. We put it up on Archive about two weeks ago, I think, and you can find it there.</p><p>And there is a list of this really wonderful team that helped us out. We have people from neuroscience, AI and philosophy. So there it is. So what are we talking about in this report? It's called consciousness and AI. Insights from the science of consciousness. It's very important both in this talk and we do this in the paper to pin down what we're talking about. So what I'll be talking about and what we discuss in the paper is what philosophers call phenomenal consciousness. And this means subjective experience. Thomas Nagel famously said that consciousness is what it is like to be an entity. So, for example, if you've tuned in, you're now currently listening to my voice, you're seeing my face and this wall on the screen, and there's a subjective aspect to your experience. There's something that it's like for you to be seeing a white wall or hearing my voice. And what we're asking about in this report is whether AI systems now or in the near future could have subjective experiences in this way, if they could be conscious in this sense.</p><p>And it's very important in conversations about this to be clear about what we're not talking about. We're not talking about whether AI systems are intelligent in a certain way. We're certainly not talking about AGI or artificial general intelligence. We're not talking about language, understanding or rationality. And also we're not talking about whether AI systems experience the world in exactly the way that humans do. So Thomas Nagel, when he introduced this phrase, famously asked what it's like to be a bat? It's very plausible that bats might be conscious, that they might have subjective experiences of the world. But if they are, the way that they experience the world is presumably very different than the way we experience the world. And that also comes along with the fact that the way they think about the world is presumably very different and they don't have the full suite of human cognitive capacities. So when we're talking about AI, we're wondering about consciousness in this sense and not necessarily any further assumptions about human like intelligence or experiences.</p><p>So how do we go about this in this report? Here's what I think are kind of the main foundations of what we do. First of all, we want the conversation to be empirical. So that means that we're looking at scientific theories of consciousness. So there's a broad field of consciousness science where scientists examine the human brain and animal brains and ask what sort of processes are associated with having conscious experiences. And this is somewhat distinct from philosophical questions about consciousness. We're going to look at these empirical theories and see what they can tell us about potential AI consciousness. Another key aspect is that we take this working assumption of this very broad thesis about the nature of consciousness, which we call computational functionalism. And very broadly, this is saying that what matters for consciousness is the computations that a system performs and not necessarily what it's made of. So this is compatible with consciousness coming from computations done by biological neurons or computations happening in silicon, transistors and chips. Patrick's going to talk a little bit more about exactly why we made this assumption and what it amounts to. And then we try to get precise. We try to derive indicator properties from the science of consciousness that we can use to examine different AI systems, and then we apply these to a broad class of AI systems from several different kinds of research programs, several different kinds of systems. And lastly, we're not aiming for absolute certainty. It's my opinion, and I think most of my co-authors, if you're asking for absolute certainty about AI consciousness, you are going to be disappointed because there still is a lot we don't know about consciousness. That's in spite of the fact that we do know some things, which is what we try to show in this report.</p><p>So it's a long report. So I would like to just talk about one specific example of this methodology and how it works in the paper. So one of the most prominent scientific theories of consciousness is called the global Workspace theory. And at a broad level, the global workspace theory says that consciousness is about global broadcast throughout a system. So it has this picture of the mind where there are these specialized independent modules that are responsible for different kinds of information processing. So for example, as you can see in that diagram, one such module might be Perceptual processing. So Vision is responsible for visual information processing. Or maybe there's a module dedicated to making decisions and choosing actions. The global workspace theory says that there's also a global workspace that will select the output from one of these usually independent modules and then broadcast that to all of the modules. This is a way of coordinating all of the processing that they are each doing individually. So consciousness is related to global broadcasts of information throughout a system, and a system having a certain architectural or information processing property that's related to the computational functionalist assumption that we have. And importantly, as we'll see, there needs to be a certain kind of feedback loop between modules and a global workspace. The global workspace taking input from the modules and then also broadcasting it back to them.</p><p>So from that we get some indicator properties to say what kind of features does an AI system need to have if it's going to satisfy, at least according to global workspace theory, the indicators that might be associated with consciousness. So one of the top questions you might have is, well, what do we say about large language models? So briefly, large language models, you're probably all familiar with them, these are some of the most prominent systems today. The GPT systems are an example. These are often built with what's called the transformer architecture. And now is certainly not a time for a full explanation of what that amounts to. But one key aspect for our analysis is that the transformer architecture is feed forward and that is to say when the system is taking in an input, say, a certain amount of text and it's going to produce an output, which is the text that it will continue to produce. For example, when you're chatting with it as it's processing that information, the information just goes from the input layer to the output layer kind of continuously. And when we look at this architecture and ask whether the way that information is flowing through, it kind of fits with the picture from global Workspace theory. Our provisional analysis in the paper is that as far as we can tell, there's nothing like a global workspace that is both receiving and broadcasting information to and from anything like individual modules. To put it another way, there don't seem to be the right kind of feedback loops in the transformer architecture for it to be satisfying these particular indicators of consciousness. So our answer in the paper is probably not according to global workspace theory, they do not satisfy these indicators.</p><p>So that's the kind of thing we do in the paper. Take a scientific theory, ask more precisely what kind of architectural and informational processing features it says are associated with consciousness. Look at how an AI system works and see how much it matches that. As I said, we do this with a lot of theories. We have, like, five very prominent scientific theories of consciousness that we look at. One thing that's worth remarking on is, why do we look at five different theories? Why not just, for example, go with global work theory? And that's kind of related to our points about nuance and uncertainty. We do think that the science of consciousness is making progress on discovering the processes associated with consciousness, but we think it's premature to commit to one particular theory. There's nothing like a consensus in consciousness science about which one of these stories is the right one for consciousness. So we kind of want to cast a broad net and say, here are a variety of things that might be associated with consciousness according to different theories, and let's look at all of them.</p><p>Jeff, I saw that my Internet said it was unstable. Did I skip at all? Are we good?</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Briefly. But I heard everything you were saying.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Cool.</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>And yeah, as mentioned, one thing that we think it's important to do is look beyond just large language models. They have understandably received a lot of the attention. They're very compelling. Their capabilities are extremely impressive and most saliently. They sometimes say that they're conscious, so it's understandable that they're one of the main systems that people wonder about. But at least speaking for myself, I think when you look at the way that they're built, they're not necessarily even the best current candidates for consciousness.</p><p>Among the AI systems that exist today. For example, many people point out that large language models don't seem like they're agents, or they don't seem embodied. They don't seem to interact continuously with an environment which you might think is important for consciousness. But many systems are plausibly much closer to doing that sort of thing, which is why we look at systems that are from robotics or that navigate virtual environments or that work in different ways than large language models do. And I will now turn things over to my colleague Patrick.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Thanks, Rob. Hi, everyone. So Rob's talked a bit about what we did in this project. I'm going to talk briefly about why we did things in the way that we did, and then I'm also going to comment very briefly on what's next for research in this area.</p><p>So next slide, please, Rob. Okay, so on the topic of why we did things the way we did, the first question I want to say something about is why did we make the assumption of computational functionalism? And this is an important question, because computational functionalism is quite a contentious hypothesis. So just to remind you about what this claim is, computational functionalism, as Rob said, is the claim that what matters for consciousness is computations. So according to this view, the reason why humans are conscious is that the right kinds of computations are going on in our brains. And what it would take for an AI system to be conscious is for it to perform the right kind of computations. Now, this is, as I just said, quite a controversial hypothesis. Many researchers in this area doubt it. For example, Anil Seth suggests that consciousness may require living cells, and there's many other researchers who take similar views to that position. So why do we make this assumption? Well, there's a few factors that play into this. One is that we'd think that computational functionalism is a plausible view. That doesn't mean to say that we're confident that it's true. I think there's probably a range of views about computational functionalism among the authors, but as a group, we're certainly not confident about this. It may even be too strong to say that we think it's more likely to be true than not true. But crucially, we think it's plausible enough that it's worth exploring its implications.</p><p>Another consideration is that many scientific theories of consciousness are expressed in computational terms. And also, if computational functionalism is true, then there's an important further question about which AI systems perform the kinds of computations which are associated with consciousness. So ultimately, the reason why we make this assumption is that we think it's a productive one in the sense that by working starting from this assumption, we can reduce our overall uncertainty about consciousness in AI to a significant degree.</p><p>So we're uncertain about whether computational functionalism is true. We're uncertain about which specific scientific theories of consciousness are true. We don't know which AI systems are conscious. But if we kind of explore this area of the space of possibilities, we think we can make progress, so we think we can reduce our overall uncertainty.</p><p>Next slide. Another question about why we did what we did is why did we focus on the internal processes that AI systems go through rather than on their behavior or on their capabilities? Why do we think that thinking about internal processes is a better way of determining whether they're likely to be conscious? Well, this is also an interesting question. And it's interesting because there's this kind of important challenge to the approach that we took, which is that the science of consciousness is relatively immature. There are still lots of competing theories in this science. And also, crucially, these theories are based mostly, although not entirely, on data from humans. So one might very reasonably have doubts about whether these descriptions of what's going on in humans when humans have conscious experiences can be extended to provide a guide to consciousness in non humans. And in particular, that kind of argument has been made in debates about non-human animal consciousness. Our colleague Jonathan Birch, for example, who's a leading researcher in that area, argues that in the case of non-human animals, when you're trying to work out which are conscious, it's more productive with science in its current state. To concentrate on examining the capabilities of non-human animals rather than on trying to work out whether the internal processes in their brains are similar or not to the internal processes in human brains.</p><p>But in fact, we think that different methods make sense in these two cases, that is, the case of non-human animals versus the case of artificial intelligence. So, next slide, please, Rob. And the key difference which makes it the case that different methods are appropriate in these two cases is that we know that on the whole, animal brains work in relatively similar ways to human brains. And we can know that because of our shared evolutionary heritage even prior to doing detailed animal neuroscience. On the other hand, there's a relatively wide space of possible designs for AI systems. There are lots of different possible architectures and methods that you can use in AI in principle. So this kind of space of possible internal processes in AI is much wider than the space of processes which we're likely to find in animal brains. Now, there are a couple of different consequences of this .1 is that in the case of AI, it's relatively informative to find similar internal processes going on in a system to the processes which seem to be associated with consciousness in humans. That's just because AIS could relatively easily be different from humans. In the case of animals, finding similar processes is not so informative. But then on the flip side, finding similar capabilities and similar behaviors to those exhibited by humans in AI is less informative than finding similar capabilities in the case of animals.</p><p>And that's because it seems that in AI it's possible for very different underlying processes to give rise to superficially similar behaviors and capabilities. So there's a specific version of this problem which clearly arises in AI that exists today, which is that AI systems are sometimes designed specifically to imitate human behavior. So we know that there are AI systems which have superficially, but also in a very compelling way, humanlike capabilities, human-like behaviors which also work in quite unhuman-like ways. For that reason, looking at capabilities looks like, on the whole, an unreliable method, unless it can be very substantially refined in the case of AI.</p><p>Next slide. Okay, now turning to the question of what's next for AI consciousness research. Well, I'm sure there are lots of exciting directions which could be pursued at this point. But one which I'm interested in, I think Rob's interested in as well, is understanding what's called valenced conscious experience. So of course, as we're all familiar with, some conscious experiences feel good, like feeling a cool breeze on a hot day. Another conscious experiences feel bad like feeling pain or fear. These are famous conscious experiences. What we say is that the ones that feel good have positive valence and the ones that feel bad have a negative valence. But it seems as though in principle, there can also be neutral conscious experiences which don't have a valence one way or the other. So the question is, could we find indicators for specifically valenced consciousness in AI? That seems to be a question which goes beyond the general one that we were asking in this report.</p><p>And we think that this question is important because it seems that pleasure and suffering have special moral significance. Next slide. Now, that brings us to the topic which is one of the major motives for our reports and which we're certainly going to be talking about further today, which is this point that a big part of the reason why thinking about AI consciousness matters. Why working out how to assess whether AI systems are likely to be conscious matters is because our society is soon going to have to decide whether to build systems which could plausibly be conscious. So there's a huge, very difficult philosophical question which is what moral principles should we use to make this momentous choice? I certainly don't know the answer to that question. It's possible we'll explore it a little bit in a few minutes. But we do think that there's a simple step which could be taken now, which is to continue the kinds of work that we've been doing to try to understand what might be good indicators of consciousness in AI. And then in particular, for groups engaged in building AI systems to recognize the possibility that they might build conscious systems, that they might do so even without trying to do just that. And for those groups to develop methods for assessing whether the systems that they're working on are likely to be conscious.</p><p>And we certainly strongly recommend that they proceed with great caution if they get a positive result when they're doing that kind of assessment. So thanks very much for listening, everyone. Thanks again to our collaborators and I'm looking forward to the discussion. Thanks.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Great. Thank you so much, Patrick and Rob. Now, Grace, do you have any thoughts from your perspective to share?</p><p>GRACE</p><p>Yeah, I just wanted to talk a little bit about kind of the state of consciousness research in neuroscience to give context to the theories that are discussed in the report and kind of, I guess to situate ourselves maybe in the history of science here. So I should say I'm not directly a consciousness researcher myself, but I do study attention which interweaves with consciousness studies in various ways, but so I don't have a dog in the fight of these different theories, which is possibly a good position to be in to discuss the overall state of things.</p><p>But yeah, it is the case that the neuroscientific study of consciousness in terms of being a proper scientific field of research is pretty new. I mean, you could argue neuroscience itself is pretty new in the whole scheme of history of science, but certainly people taking the scientific study of consciousness seriously is definitely new. Because there was a joke that you had to be tenured to study consciousness. And so the idea that now there are actually full labs devoted to this and people are really trying to make it rigorous and thorough and you have these theories and everything that's definitely progress, but it points to the fact that this research is still in its infancy. And so the theories that are laid out here are the major theories that are discussed amongst these researchers. But from my perspective, I don't think there's a sense that these are anywhere close to the final drafts of these theories. And that's important for when you then step through the conclusions. And just the fact that Rob said the report doesn't choose a specific theory to go with because there isn't consensus.</p><p>There's these multiple theories that in many ways have conflicts with each other. And so it really is still a young area. And also the way that the scientific study is framed in order to be precise and rigorous. It's usually framed more as studying the neural correlates of consciousness. So not even trying to make a strong claim necessarily about causal connection, but just what do you observe the patterns of neural activity to be when a subject reports a conscious experience? And that's another detail. It's really a lot of times the neural correlates of conscious report. What are people saying that they experienced as their conscious experience? There is a detail of kind of these no report paradigms, but they still ultimately rely on the fact that at some point a human was able to say that they experienced something. And so those are also caveats that bound the scientific study of it and are necessary to make it a scientifically rigorous thing to study. But obviously that's going to from a philosophical perspective, that's going to have implications as well.</p><p>And yeah, the other thing that I kind of wanted to talk about in kind of situating this sort of thing so the scientists are going into the brain and it's messy and there's a lot of stuff going on. And the hope is to find the simplified principles that correlate with this conscious report and correlate with people saying something is conscious versus not. And so there the work is to take the big, messy, complex thing and try to come up with the simplest description of what you need in order to get conscious report. When you then actually kind of look at that in isolation, sometimes those indicators as the report kind of turns them into seem really simple.</p><p>And I think we have to keep in mind that these theories were not developed for the purposes of trying to see if an AI system is conscious. They're developed in the context of assuming that a human is conscious and looking at their neural activity or even a lot of at least the kind of background knowledge for these theories comes from non human animal work and so they're understanding where they're coming from in that sense. The fact that they're not designed to be directly translated into these sort of easy to identify computational principles that could be in artificial systems, I think is important. I think it's important for this work of trying to take a theory and assess an artificial system. But I also think that there's a lesson for the people, the neuroscientists who study consciousness in this as well. Because as this happens a lot, when you do mathematical modeling, you can be working with a topic area and kind of think you have a mental model of how it works.</p><p>And then when you actually go to write it down, you realize some aspects are lacking, maybe or the pieces don't fit together the way that you thought they did. And it's the turning of the kind of mental model and the pile of experimental data and the word models that people use to describe how they think something functions. When you actually have to turn that into an equation or code or actually try to build it, you can kind of see where you might be missing things.</p><p>And I think that this is a nice opportunity for the neuroscientists who study consciousness to see their theories in a new light when they're kind of put into these cold, stark indicators and really reflect on if that is summarizing everything that they think is important or that there are things about the brain that are kind of going unspoken that they think are actually really important as well or things about the abilities of humans or animals that are important as well. So, yeah, I think that's important to keep in mind that these theories were not designed to lead to a description that is used for AI. But it's still a very helpful exercise in my mind to go through this and see what they look like in the end, when they're kind of pared down to the simplest form that can be translated into an AI system.</p><p>So overall, I think the report has benefits to be able to take this neuroscience literature and bring it to an AI audience and put it in those terms, but also should have benefits for the neuroscience side itself in terms of thinking about how these theories really pan out, how they relate to each other, what they could be missing. If the scientists who created and worked on these theories, if they would agree with the conclusions of the report or even agree that an artificial system that had these properties was conscious. In the end, I think that that's an important thing for those scientists to reflect on. Great.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Thank you so much, Grace. And finally, Yoshua, do you have thoughts to share?</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>Sure. Maybe I'll start with talking about the computational, functionalism, computational basis of consciousness and subjective experience. We've been using the word consciousness, but really I think it's important to clarify that the word consciousness can be associated to all sorts of things and we're trying to focus on subjective experience, which is the part that may seem very mysterious to many people, including researchers. My personal view, so maybe not the unanimous view of the others, is that physics is computation and many physicists share that view. It's just a bunch of equations that could be implemented in any way you want.</p><p>At the end of the day, you get the same changes in the state of the world and your brain is physics too. Now, I think some of the questions about how this could be turned into computations in a computer may have nothing to do with something non material that could possibly be happening in biology. Maybe there is something about the physics like it requires quantum computations that maybe we don't know yet how to do. But actually, if we look at the progress of AI in the last few decades, we're moving forward quite rapidly towards very strong capabilities and we never seem to be requiring any kind of quantum computation in order to get that power, which of course doesn't guarantee that it's continued to be the case.</p><p>But that suggests that the level of abstraction that, say, neural networks used in machine learning have is already doing a good job for providing a lot of the explanations and neural correlates of our abilities. So another interesting question that has to do with AI research is why are we conscious in the first place? And the perspective that would come naturally to machine learning researchers or AI researchers is evolution notice with these forms of computations because that gives us an advantage either individually or collectively. There's a social aspect to consciousness as well. And so if there is an advantage, then it's something worth investigating from an AI perspective. It may be something that AI researchers want to put into their AI systems, which is a question I'll come back to that Patrick talked about: do we want to have conscious machines or not?</p><p>So one of the things my group has been working on is precisely this. So some of these theories of consciousness, in particular the global workspace theory and attention schema theory and others, really can be interpreted as providing an advantage in terms of our ability to learn and manipulate abstraction. So this is connected to the property of thoughts and attention, selecting very few bits of information that go through working memory at any moment.</p><p>And then we sequentially go through a very small number of bits in this way that help us take decisions and organize our understanding of the world at a very abstract level, that compresses information, perceptual information in a way that helps us better understand the world, take better decisions, better model it and so on. Now let me go back to this question of whether AI are conscious or will be in the future. So our report suggests that none of the current AI systems have enough of the characteristics that those theories suggest. First of all, the different theories we chose are not the end of it. So this is a continuously moving field. There, you know, are newspapers coming regularly suggesting other variants often related to existing theories. So we shouldn't take these as the end story of how consciousness works in the brain. And also what the report suggests is actually those properties, those in these theories or maybe other ones that could be related that may come up in the near future. Those attributes are not impossible to put in AI. So it's very plausible that in coming years we would be able to build machines that compute in ways that are at least suggestive of consciousness in the human sense.</p><p>And I think this raises a lot of important questions. My take on this is we should not build conscious machines until we know better. There are many reasons for this. In particular, whether we succeed in building machines that are actually conscious or not. If humans perceive those AI systems as conscious, that has a lot of implications that could be extremely destabilizing for society. We associate moral status to other conscious beings, and that's connected with a very strong social contract which works for humans. We have all kinds of characteristics. We have a finite lifetime. We are bounded sort of intellectual capabilities.</p><p>And these properties may not apply to AI that can reproduce. There's no limit in how you could copy an AI system over and over. So they might be like, immortal, they might be much smarter than us. All sorts of things that I think would make the current interpretation of consciousness at a moral and social view questionable. I think until we know better, we shouldn't do that. There's another, more pragmatic reason why I think we shouldn't build conscious machines. Because with consciousness also comes a notion of self and even self preservation objectives like agency. This was one of the theories that was described. And if we go on that route, this could be very dangerous from an AI safety point of view. In other words, we might be building machines that have their own goals that are not well aligned with human norms and values in ways that could be extremely dangerous for humanity.</p><p>And of course, this is a subject that's intensely debated in the last few months, which makes this report particularly interesting. But this is one point I want to emphasize. Let's see the last point I want to make that's not really in the report, but connected to what we talk about in the report. But comes some recent work coming out of my group just in the last few months suggesting so it's another theory of consciousness that is completely computational. It's related to several existing theories. But what's interesting about this one is that subjective experience with all the attributes that we associate with it, like ineffability and subjectivity and richness and fleetingness, these properties emerge of this model as side effects of the need to perform a particular kind of computation that is important from a learning perspective. But you could obtain potentially the same computations with a different implementation that wouldn't have these side effects. So evolution has sort of converged in this particular way of achieving particular useful computations that may give rise to our sensation of being conscious and having free will and all these things to which we attribute a little bit of sort of magical properties. And we should be careful about that instinct we have about our own perception of being conscious in light of those results from neuroscience and AI. I'll stop here.</p><p>GRACE</p><p>Great.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Thank you so much, Yoshua and everybody, for those remarks. Very interesting. It gives us a lot to talk about. I want to flag both for the panelists and for everybody in the audience, that a very lively discussion is already happening in the Q/A tab. And so I encourage everybody to go check out the Q/A tab and read through some of the questions and comments that have already been entered and feel free to reply directly to each other and have those conversations. We can have one conversation here and another in the Q/A tab. I will jump right into questions that attempt to synthesize and present you with what people are asking about in the Q/A tab. I will not be able to get to everything, but please know, everybody, that we will send all the questions to the panelists after the talk, whether or not we can get to them during the presentation. So some of the questions are descriptive, others of the questions are moral or legal or political in nature. So I can start with a general descriptive question for you. As you noted in the initial presentation and some of your remarks, and as several people have noted in the comments, you focus on a particular perspective about consciousness, according to which consciousness is about computations.</p><p>And so you look at scientific theories of consciousness that identify different computations, and then you search for markers related to those theories, and then you look for those markers in particular kinds of AI systems. And as some people note, that does not exhaust the space of theories and perspectives about consciousness that are plausible and popular right now. So on a more permissive end of the spectrum, as one person notes, there are, for example, panpsychist theories of consciousness and other theories that are relatively undemanding that allow for the possibility that even quite simple systems could be conscious. Those theories might imply that lots of systems can be conscious, whether or not they have your markers. And then at the other more restrictive end of the spectrum, you have biological theories according to which, for various reasons, you really do need to be made out of, for example, carbon based cells and neurons in order to realize consciousness.</p><p>And according to those theories, a system can hit all of your markers but still be non conscious if that system is made out of silicon based transistors and chips. So I wonder, on a personal level, to the panelists, what kind of credence do you have in these more permissive or more restrictive theories? Do you find them plausible? Do you find them good candidates? And how would you incorporate them into your search for AI consciousness?</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>I can hop in first. Yeah. I think in people in the report, I'm probably on the higher end in my credence in computational functionalism of some kind, I'm maybe like 70%. But I am very compelled by arguments by people like Anil Seth and Peter Godfrey Smith, philosopher of biology, who has written extensively on consciousness. So I do sometimes wake up in the middle of the night wondering if computational functionalism is off on the wrong track.</p><p>And I'll also just take this opportunity to say, one thing we call for in the report is more detailed work investigating the assumption of computational functionalism. We think it's again, sufficiently implausible that it's really very important to explore its implications. But we could also get a lot more clarity on these issues if arguments for and against computational functionalism got hashed out in more detail. And I'll lastly just say I wanted to plug a really nice remark by Anil Seth that I think is really exactly the kind of response we wanted where he said, I disagree with some of the assumptions, and I'm guessing that's computational functionalism, but that's totally fine because I might well be wrong. So we're very excited to see people kind of exploring different parts of the space of possibilities that we could be facing with AI consciousness.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Great.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Thank you, Rob. Yoshua?</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>Yeah, so my credence on computational fictionalism is 99.99%, maybe because I'm a computer scientist, right? And the whole field of computer science is founded on the idea that computations can be done on any substrate. And there's not been any example of that that exists, as far as I know. It's not just AI. It dates back from Turing and the Turing machine around the Second World War. And it's also connected to, as I said in my little pitch, everything we know from physics. So I don't see how having carbon atoms prevents computations from explaining what's going on. It's just a different kind of computation. It may not be the computations going on at the level of these artificial neurons that you typically find in deep learning. That's very possible. But it's still computation. It's just now computation happening at the atomic level, but it's still computation. What's the level of abstraction that's needed to replicate human intelligence and consciousness? Well, nobody really knows, and that's open. But I think the question of whether you need something that's non computational, because for me, if it's not computational, it's not even physical, so it's not even materialistic. And I don't see how you could buy that unless you believe in some spiritual beings explaining our consciousness.</p><p>And I also have a comment on panpsychism. How could I say it feels like it's completely overgeneralizing. The things we know that are conscious are human beings. And because of many similarities, we have some maybe good reasons to think that other animals may be conscious. But everything we know about human consciousness has the kind of properties that we discuss in the report, for example, that are completely disjoint and not applicable to just arbitrary groups of atoms or even single electrons or whatever crazy things that you could come to with these theories. So I'm not saying these theories are false, but they seem so far removed from the biological reality, like what happens when a person is conscious or not conscious, that, for me, they don't rate very high as scientific theories that are supposed to explain what we know about consciousness. They may feel good again, because I think it may make us feel good with our intuitive religious understanding of the world, but in terms of matching what we observe, the correlates of consciousness seem pretty much bringing zero information.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>All right, great. Thank you. Grace or Patrick, did you have anything you wanted to.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>I mean so when you asked about credences in computational functionalism, I guess the thought is that to the extent that we're doubtful about computational functionalism, maybe we're doubtful about the value of this project to kind of reveal whether AI. Systems are likely to be conscious or not and therefore, whether they're likely to have a certain special kind of moral significance or not. And for me, I think how my credences fit together is something like this: if there's such a thing as consciousness, if the concept of consciousness makes sense and is a useful one to apply beyond the human case, then I think most likely it's a computational phenomenon. I think I'd give more credence to the computational view in that situation than to non computational views, because I think the computational views have got more promise in explaining the properties of consciousness. But what keeps me awake at night to go back to what Rob said, is the possibility that the concept of consciousness is somehow confused or that.</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>It.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Doesn'T make sense to apply it beyond the human case that it's unproductive for moral theorizing or conceptually confused in some way to ask the question whether AI systems are conscious or not.</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>But, Patrick, I don't think these two views are incompatible. So I actually think that consciousness is computational in nature, and that is confusing and kind of not clear that it's meaningful to extend that concept very far from human beings, especially regarding the moral aspects of things. That's what I mean. And the social and moral aspects, I don't think these are incompatible points of views.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Yeah, I think our views are pretty similar.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Grace, did you have anything you wanted to add?</p><p>GRACE</p><p>I mean, in terms of computational functionalism? My gut is that it's largely correct or certainly there will at least need to be a common set of computations and then maybe there also needs to be other stuff. But on the whole, I just feel like we're several paradigm shifts away from really understanding all of this. So it's hard for me to say anything with any confidence or vigor.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Yeah, that seems like the answer about which we can be most confident. Okay, great. Thank you everybody. I can now ask a question on the moral, legal, political side, and again, several people have asked questions along those lines as well. So I think, as you yourself said, part of why so many people are so interested in this topic is because we do associate consciousness and then related capacities like sentience, the ability to consciously experience positively and negatively valenced states like pleasure and pain and happiness and suffering. Many people associate that reasonably, in my view, with a certain kind of intrinsic moral and legal and political significance. The idea being that if you have consciousness and or sentience, if there is something it is like to be you, and if it can feel good or bad to be you especially, then you matter for your own sake. And I should consider your interests and needs and vulnerabilities when making decisions that affect you and that might extend to a decision about whether to create you in the first place, as well as a decision about how to treat you if and when I do create you.</p><p>And so I would like to ask all of you if you care to respond. First of all, do you associate consciousness or sentience with that kind of intrinsic moral or legal or political significance? Do you think that when a being is conscious or sentient or sufficiently likely to be conscious or sentient by our lights, that we should extend them a certain kind of intrinsic value and consider their potential interest, needs, vulnerabilities when making decisions that affect them? And since we are making these decisions under uncertainty, I also wanted to ask a little bit about how you think about the risks associated with false positives and false negatives, with potential over or under attribution of consciousness and moral status. What are the risks associated with accidentally seeing an object as a subject and what are the risks associated with accidentally seeing a subject as an object? And how do you weigh those when deciding how to calibrate this kind of test and practice? So yeah, do you associate this with moral status and how do you deal with this under?</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>Yoshua, I'm not a philosopher, so take that from the angle of a computer scientist. But my interpretation of this question is we are asking the wrong question. It's not whether we should attribute moral status to entities that have particular properties, like being conscious or something like that. Is that that's how we are? Humans are compelled to have empathy and compassion for other types of beings, in particular other human beings, because that's something that evolution put in us, because it helped us to help humanity to succeed and maybe become a dominant species. There are exceptions. You have sociopaths and so on. But for the most part, humans have those innate feelings. And by association, because our brain works by association, we often generalize that to other entities that look like us, mammals in particular, or we also have very strong empathy for babies of other species, right? My partner would not eat meat, but especially if it's coming from the baby of the species, it's not coming from a philosophical kind of argument. It's just an innate thing that we have. I can share that feeling, maybe not as strongly as she does, I think females in general.</p><p>So I think we're just asking the wrong question. And when we come to this for machines, I think it would be a huge mistake to build things that would play into our innate response mechanisms towards entities that look like us. So there was this black mirror episode where there are AI clones of a person in a virtual world that we feel for because they are so humanlike, even though it's just a simulation. Right? We can't prevent ourselves from attributing a moral status to those virtual agents because they look human. And I think that's the reality. What we do with that, I think, is then social norms to not break the way our society works with the introduction of entities that don't correspond to something we evolved for but is not going to be true anymore, with machines that could be potentially imitating us in many ways and maybe even have some of the attributes we put in the report. But is that really what society needs? I think that's a big question mark.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Very interesting, Rob.</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>Yeah, so I think my views on this are similar to Yasha's in many ways on the question of what the grounds of moral status are, as philosophers would say. For my own part, I'm quite confident that if an entity is sentient, that is, if it has valenced conscious experiences like pleasure and pain, that that alone is sufficient for us to care about it and show concern for it. Which is why I would be excited for the project that Patrick mentioned. I'm less clear on how to think about entities that are merely conscious, that maybe only have neutral experiences. You could imagine a future large language model maybe that fits more of our indicators that only had experiences of understanding or maybe even some very abstract conscious experience that we can't even comprehend. I would obviously be extremely careful in how I treated that thing, but I'm a little bit less sure how to think about that case.</p><p>And then lastly, I just wanted to flag one very characteristic element of how we like to think about this in the report is about uncertainty and managing all of the different cases that might come up. And so I also wanted to flag consciousness itself could be too narrow of a thing to focus on, and we don't want to put all of our focus on that. There are, I think, compelling arguments that even if something is not conscious, if it has desires or goals that it wants to pursue, then that itself is something that should be respected. So I would also love to see equivalent or analogous reports on whether AI systems could have the kind of preferences or desires that might merit consideration.</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>It's already the case. I mean, that lots of reinforcement learning agents have valence and have goals. It's like no rocket science here already exists.</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>So just very quickly on that, I'll just direct you to Patrick's work. Patrick is an expert on that sort of thing. And then just one very last point, which is just kind of reiterate what Yasha was saying. Yasha has recently been writing very eloquently and forcefully about risks from AI to humans in terms of their behavior being aligned with our interests and things like that. And yeah, adding consciousness or sentience into that mix is potentially extremely dangerous because it could morally constrain that project and also just lead us to act in certain ways that are dangerous to ourselves.</p><p>So there's a lot of interesting things to say about the relationship between risks from AI and risks to AI, let's say. And it's very good that people not conflate those two questions. One kind of convergent policy proposal for both of those is that we need to just be extremely careful, slow down, think very hard about what we're doing, have more transparency and reflection about what we're doing. I think that's something that's very important for both of those issues.</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>If I may, I'd like to articulate in two sentences why the concern from a safety point of view that Robert just talked about? So if we build machines and we start seeing attributes of consciousness, and then we just complete the picture to give them essentially all of our attributes of consciousness. In other words, they have their own goals. In particular, they have a self preservation goal. And if those machines are smarter than us in sufficient ways to be dangerous to us, then we are in a very risky situation from the point of view of humanity losing control of its future, because there would be something like a new species of entities that may have goals that don't match, that may lead harm to humans. We don't want to do that, obviously.</p><p>GRACE</p><p>Great.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Thank you, Grace.</p><p>GRACE</p><p>Yeah, I think there's a pragmatic answer that allows for the current high level of uncertainty, and that's if these systems seem conscious to us, then we need to follow that logic through, even if we don't know the truth of the matter. So, yeah, if it's a very human-like system, it's natural that people are going to feel that it's mean. I think you could have a system that is conscious and doesn't have some of the things that you were listing Yoshua, like the, you know, angle or anything like that. So I don't think necessarily if it's a conscious system, it has those things, or if it has those things conscious or anything like that, but certainly we would feel like it is. And the question is, what are the benefits or risks to society if you tell people they have to treat this thing like it's conscious or that they don't?</p><p>So if you have something that feels conscious, looks and behaves like a human, and we tell people you can do whatever you want to this thing, it has no moral status, is that going to lead to people? Some people make the argument that you can use that as kind of catharsis, where people could treat the non sentient robot terribly and then they won't do that to humans. Other people think you might start to devalue actual conscious life if you give people things that seem conscious and tell them that they can treat them poorly. So I think that's the pragmatic answer. Given the level of uncertainty. If there was a world where we could be certain that something is conscious, even if it doesn't feel like it is to us or looks like us in any way, I think then the next steps are more complicated because it doesn't just slot into okay, it has moral status the same as a human now. Because a lot of the things that we associate with something having moral status and how we treat the being with moral status, it's about being humane to them, it's about being treating them the way that humans would want to be treated.</p><p>And they might have completely different things that need to be done or not done to them to be considered moral to a completely different type of consciousness and intelligence potentially. So even if we can say with certainty that an artificial system is conscious, I don't know if we know very clearly what follows from that. Even if we agree that we're going to treat it as a moral agent, I don't know if we know clearly what follows from that.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Yeah, great point. This is a lesson that we have learned often the hard way over the past several decades on the animal minds and the animal ethics side of things. And I think we need to relearn or remember those questions on the AI minds and AI ethics side of things. And I appreciate everybody for articulating that here, that there might be broad similarities between the minds of biological and non biological beings, but a lot of the details might be different. Even if there is some kind of valenced subjective experience, the actual interests and needs are going to be very different. The levels of intelligence and power are potentially going to be very different. It might disrupt. Expectations we have about what it needs to have a moral relationship or a legal or political relationship with someone. So it might be that in some broad, thin sense the concepts extend, but in any kind of more detailed or thicker sense, we have to rethink everything.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Right.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Okay, we have about five minutes left. And again, tons of questions and comments. We will not be able to even scratch the surface. But I can ask one more detailed question about your discussion of global workspace theory that came up several times in the comments. Several people asked a question of the forum. You mentioned that large language models do not have the relevant kind of feedback loop at the kind of transistor level. But what about at other levels of explanation? What about, for example, the actual application of the models and how they draw from their own past responses when making predictions? Is there a kind of feedback loop happening there that might be relevant for global workspace theory? There were a few questions of that form, so it'd be great if somebody could address that.</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>Yeah, I'll say something very quick and then I'm going to pass the baton to Patrick just as a heads up. So a quick clarification. It's not actually about the transistor level, it's about the level of the virtual neurons. It's in that sense that it's feed forward. And then one thing that I haven't actually looked at those questions, but there was an interesting discussion on Twitter that happened where, yeah, you might think that the place you get the feedback loops is the fact that the model will output a word and then look back over the entire string and then output the next word. So you could argue that it's using the whole text output as a kind of global workspace. And if you're interested in the extended mind, you could maybe make an argument that that's a kind of global workspace. That said, I think that there's kind of challenges to that view, which I will punt to Patrick.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Yeah, it just seems to me that any system which interacts with an environment in the sense that its outputs influence the environment and therefore have a knock on effect on its subsequent inputs, is one in which there's a kind of recurrent causal loop connecting the system itself with its environment. And it seems as though if we allow that to be the kind of loop which is described in the global workspace theory, then we're just giving an uncharitable interpretation of the global workspace theory because that's not what they intend. Instead, the thought in the global workspace theory is that there's an internal recurrent loop within the system between the modules and the global workspace. But although Rob has suggested that I'm the best person to answer this question, really the most qualified person here to answer the question by far is Yoshua, because he understands both the global workspace theory and the AI systems much better than Rob or me.</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>I agree with your answers. So I have a machine learning interpretation of the bottleneck in the global workspace theory and it allows for forcing particular kinds of dependencies and abstractions to emerge very sparse dependencies that involve like very few variables. It forces that to emerge because of the bottleneck at the internal level. If you were to consider the output words of a transformer as the bottleneck, it doesn't really work for a number of reasons because this is what it's outputting. It's like if you were too forced to say everything that comes into your working memory and also that it could be expressed as words, which is not completely obvious. So it's really a different schema, as you say. The fact that it's an internal bottleneck makes a whole difference and the actions that are taken are not just a copy of that bottleneck, but they might be what is appropriate in the context. You might be lying, for example, or you might realize that your thought has something incoherent and you might want to say something different. You wouldn't have that if you interact with Chat GBT, although people are actually trying to design things like this that are closer to an internal thinking train of thoughts with Transformers and with Chat Chippity in particular to try to emulate some of the properties of the workspace for helping to reason. So there is movement in that direction, but it's not really the same.</p><p>PATRICK</p><p>Okay, great. So I was just going to say one response which we sometimes get when we say a system like a transformer based large language model or something doesn't meet the criteria, people are often quick to respond by saying well, you could change the system in such and such a way and then maybe it would meet the criteria. And we don't disagree with that at all. We think that there are relatively clear steps which could be taken using existing AI techniques to build systems which would meet more of the indicator properties than the ones which exist at the moment.</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>Yeah, I would add that there are other properties that are not really discussed in the global workspace theory which would be missing in my opinion, especially about subjective experience. So the global workspace theory doesn't explain subjective experience, at least not all the properties that are associated with it. I mentioned earlier things like ineffability like the fact that we are conscious of something richer than what we are able to express with words, at least in a limited number of words. And that's something you don't get with Transformers, especially if you put the bottleneck at the output. You might get something like this if you suddenly had a huge hidden layer in the middle somewhere that could play that role. That is possible.</p><p>ROBERT</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>YOSHUA</p><p>There are also other properties of conscious thought that are not expressed in Transformers as they are now. For example, attention in Transformers is what we call soft attention, actually something invented in my lab in 2014. And it's not at all like the kind of attention that makes a hard decision, usually somewhat stochastic, about what we're going to attend next, either in the perceptual or in something about our interpretation, our thoughts, our memories. And that is very different in nature from the kind of attention that are currently working well in AI, but doesn't mean that it won't be in future systems. Right, but just saying they're not present currently.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Thank you for that exchange. We are a little bit over time now. So Grace, I'm going to give you the last word and then we can wrap up if you still have a comment.</p><p>GRACE</p><p>Yeah, I just wanted to make a quick point about this idea of there kind of being this external recurrence because you can resample your environment that you impacted. I think if you're looking at the architecture of the model, that is a pretty big difference from there being internal recurrence. But if you take the perspective of, like, a naive neuroscientist who was trying to understand this system and they only had access to the activity of the neurons over time, which is what happens a lot in neuroscience you might think that there is internal recurrence because there would be correlations between activity of neurons over time and that kind of thing, or at least in the information represented in the system over time. And so on some fuzzier more abstract level, maybe it does look like there's recurrence, but we actually know the architecture that generates it. And if you're subscribing to theories of consciousness where the architecture that generates it matters, then it's a different outcome.</p><p>JEFF</p><p>Okay, great. Thank you very much, Grace. Okay, this is the time now to thank everybody again for taking the time to join us and tell us about your report, answer some of our questions. Thanks also again to everybody in the audience for showing up. We had really amazing attendance and a fantastic conversation happening and apologies for not being able to get at all of the even general topics of the questions, to say nothing of the specific questions. But it really was a great conversation and we will share all the questions and comments and exchanges with the panelists following the talk again. Yes, thank you to everybody. This is obviously the beginning of a much longer conversation about various tests for conscious and sentient AI systems and what follows for their moral, legal, political significance.</p><p>So really looking forward to having those conversations. Grateful to everybody for participating in them. Just a note to everybody that you can find a link to the report in the chat. So please do check out the report. You can also find a link to the Mind Ethics and Policy program. You can sign up to our email list for future events. We will be having in early October a talk by Peter Godfrey Smith, a philosopher who is more skeptical about AI consciousness and will explain his skepticism to us. So do sign up for that email list if you want to keep having this conversation with us. And with that, I hope everybody has had a great start to your fall. Great start to your semester. I have to go teach class now, so I will sign off. But thank you again to everybody and have a great rest of the night. And thanks again to our co-sponsors as well. Bioethics and Mind, brain and consciousness. Have a good night, everybody.</p><p>ROBERT<br>Thanks so much, Jeff. All right, I think I'm going to go. Yeah. Goodbye, everyone.</p><p>GRACE</p><p>Bye, Rob. It's just us.

I got and took the job, which I was expecting to be pretty low-responsibility since I was so junior.&nbsp;</p><p>I got more responsibility than I expected, which was both scary and very motivating. On my second week, I ended up being one of two(?) people from the Events Team at the Coordination Forum (I was there to help make it go smoothly and to take notes in some sessions), during which we also made the decision to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/2tEW9AH2X7L83hXeR/p/LwRSnvnaFL9eE4yKz#Preamble__What_sparked_this_thought\"><u>double the size of EA Global London 2021</u></a> (happening in around a month). It felt like a lot of the work that I was doing just wouldn\u2019t get done if I wasn\u2019t there (or maybe something else important wouldn\u2019t get done). After EA Global: London 2021, things calmed down a bit.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftib5arzhymh\"><sup><a href=\"#fntib5arzhymh\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I was still writing sometimes, and I sometimes contributed a bit to side-projects, some of which grew out a bit.</p><p>Then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/aaron-gertler\"><u>Aaron</u></a> reached out to say that he was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aNKuzuQkpfyBLwqqv/announcing-my-retirement\"><u>leaving</u></a>, and he was wondering if it would be ok to send me the job application.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref00lejoq8zxuu5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn00lejoq8zxuu5\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Skimming Aaron\u2019s messages from the time, it looks like Aaron reached out because of a combination of my Forum writing, my performance on the Events Team, and encouragement from Linch when Aaron checked with him.

(2021)</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.51291/2377-7478.1691\">Crump et al. (2022a)</a> reviewed the evidence of sentience in decapod crustaceans, with a focus on pain experience. Similar to findings previously reported by <a href=\"https://perma.cc/L6E9-F4WJ\">Waldhorn (2019</a>; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2RXZ-6TDR\">Waldhorn et al., 2020</a>), these studies concluded that there is substantial, although limited, evidence that decapods might be sentient. Notably, the low strength of current evidence likely corresponds to the little scientific attention various decapod taxa have received\u2013which is particularly the case for shrimp, especially for those belonging to the <i>Penaeidae</i> family (see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/7PTR-Q8QV\">Comstock, 2022</a>).</p><p>Decapods like crabs, lobsters, and shrimp serve as a major source of human food worldwide, having partly driven the global growth of the aquaculture sector in recent years (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/8SRM-VMXZ\">de Jong, 2018</a>). Decapod production also represents the fastest-growing major fishery activity worldwide (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2431\">Boenish et al., 2022</a>). If these animals are sentient, current commercial practices pose serious welfare risks both when decapods are farmed and/or handled during capture, transport and sale, and when they are slaughtered (see <a href=\"https://perma.cc/6FAT-3225\">Birch et al., 2021</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-022-00632-6\">Crump et al., 2022b</a>). These welfare issues might be particularly pressing given the high numbers of farmed decapods (see <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2EDY-UY63\">Mood &amp; Brooke, 2019a</a>), plus other uncounted individuals captured from the wild. Furthermore, increasing human population, changes in consumer preferences, technological advancements, and income growth suggest that decapod production stands to increase in the future (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2431\">Boenish et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4060/cc0461en\">FAO, 2022</a><u>f</u>), which may, in turn, augment the scale of the problem of decapod welfare.</p><p>Currently, only partial data exists about the scope of this issue. <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2EDY-UY63\">Mood &amp; Brooke (2019a)</a> calculated that between 255 billion and 605 billion decapods are farmed every year, the great majority of such individuals being shrimp and prawns\u2013specifically, 213-530 billion, which amounts to 83.5%-87.6% of the total amount of farmed decapods killed annually. However, such estimates do not account for premature deaths, which seem to be a common issue in decapod farming. Indeed, this problem has shaped decapod aquaculture production over the last decades (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.33997/j.afs.2018.31.S1.003\">Shinn et al., 2018</a>; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/KA9P-GV2M\">Benchmark Insights, 2019, p. 17</a>). If so, the numbers of farmed individuals are likely higher than the estimates currently available. Similarly, no data is known about the number of decapods captured from the wild. While an initial interpretation based on total tonnages suggests that decapod production is dominated by aquaculture, it is unclear to what extent the number of captured individuals is significantly lower than the number of farmed decapods. Taken together, all that information would allow us to properly assess the scale of this animal welfare issue, estimate the expected value of helping these animals, and inform further research into how serious an ethical problem decapod production might pose.</p><p>Here, we present estimates of the numbers of shrimp and prawns slaughtered for food, covering both farmed and wild-caught individuals, and based on the most recent data released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (i.e., FAO, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3RX-8ZH9\">2022c</a>, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/6ERV-W2F5\">2022d</a>). These estimates only focus on shrimp and prawns since current information, although incomplete, shows that these animals constitute the vast majority of farmed decapods. Likewise, statistics about decapod capture and the relatively small size of shrimp and prawns suggest that these animals are likely the majority of wild-caught decapods as well. We have quantified both farmed shrimp and prawns killed in a year and the number of these individuals alive at any time, accounting for mortality rates at different developmental stages. Numbers of individuals alive on farms at any given moment, rather than slaughter figures, are likely a more informative metric to assess the scope of potential welfare issues that standard shrimp farming conditions might pose. Regarding captures, we covered all the 92 decapod shrimp and prawn species caught in the wild across the globe.</p><p>All the shrimp and prawn figures we obtained were compared to equivalent available estimates for the most exploited vertebrates used in meat production (i.e., chickens and fishes), and also with available data on industrially farmed insects used to produce food and feed. Our findings suggest that, if these animals are sentient, shrimp production represents a massive animal welfare issue whose scale vastly surpasses all known figures of the animal species most exploited in the food system. Given the scale of shrimp production, the welfare of these animals deserves further attention.</p><p><u>A note on terminology</u></p><p>The terms \u2018shrimp\u2019 and \u2018prawn\u2019 are often used interchangeably. The two terms do not reliably track any phylogenetic differences between species. The preference for one term over another is geographically dependent (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/9781444314649.ch2\">Holthuis &amp; Ng, 2009</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/8KSC-SHWG\">New, 2002</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012374473-9.00453-7\">Penn et al., 2001</a>). Here, we use only the term \u201cshrimp,\u201d covering both shrimp and prawns. Note that members of the family <i>Artemiidae</i> are commonly referred to as \"brine shrimp,\" but are not decapods and so are beyond the present scope.</p><h2>Methods</h2><p>FAO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/topic/166235?lang=en\">FishStatJ</a> produces annual statistics of captured and farmed aquatic animals worldwide, measured in tonnes. To calculate the numbers of farmed shrimp annually slaughtered and those alive on farms at any time, we used FishStatJ<i>\u2019s Global Aquaculture Production </i>dataset (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3RX-8ZH9\">FAO, 2022c</a>). In the case of wild-caught individuals, the <i>Global Capture Production</i> dataset (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6ERV-W2F5\">FAO, 2022d</a>) was consulted. In both cases, data is for 2020, the latest year available at the time the data for this work was recovered (September 2022).</p><p>Please note that this work only covers decapod shrimp (and prawn) species, mostly belonging to the <i>Caridea </i>and<i> Dendrobranchiata</i> groups. Non-decapod shrimp, like <i>Artemia</i> (family <i>Artemiidae</i>), are not decapods but belong to the <i>Anostraca</i> order and were thus excluded from this work.</p><p>Data for the species used to compare our shrimp estimates\u2013i.e., farmed insects, fishes, and chickens\u2013was obtained from the most recent sources available for each of them at the time of writing. These data were collected in November 2022.</p><h3>Farmed shrimp estimates</h3><p>To estimate the number of slaughtered farmed individuals and how many shrimp are alive on farms at any moment, all the countries and fishing areas of the corresponding FAO\u2019s dataset (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3RX-8ZH9\">FAO, 2022c</a>) were selected. Regarding the species included, all the species under the category \u201cShrimps, prawns\u201d of the database were covered. Shrimp freshwater species under the category \u201cFreshwater crustaceans\u201d were also included.</p><p><strong>Number of farmed shrimp slaughtered per year</strong></p><p>The number of killed individuals was estimated by dividing tonnages by the average live weight of each species. These weights were taken from <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2EDY-UY63\">Mood and Brooke (2019a)</a>. An average live weight of 6-40 g for species for which <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2EDY-UY63\">Mood and Brooke (2019a)</a> do not provide an estimate. This is a wide range that is a guess based on other species. Pre-slaughter mortality rates at larval, post-larval and juvenile-adult phases were also included. All these calculations were incorporated into a probabilistic model and performed in Guesstimate. The model is available <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21679\">here</a>. This approach was chosen given that it uses Monte Carlo simulations, producing narrower and more meaningful value ranges than a deterministic model.</p><p>To check the validity of the model, it was used to calculate figures for 2018, an earlier year for which other data is available and, therefore, it might offer a more valid point of comparison than 2020 estimates. Our results converged with the numbers obtained using an alternative model designed with information from other sources for 2018 (see \u201cAlternative estimation of the number of slaughtered shrimps\u201d <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21692\">here</a>), which suggests that the model used for 2020 estimates is roughly correct. Further details are provided in the <i>Appendix</i>.</p><p><strong>Number of farmed shrimp alive at any time</strong></p><p>To estimate the number of farmed shrimp alive at any time, the number of slaughtered individuals in 2020 was multiplied by the average total lifespan of individuals of that species. Then, the result was divided by 366 (the number of days in 2020).</p><p>The numbers of slaughtered shrimp correspond to the figures resulting from the previous probabilistic model for farmed shrimp (see <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21679\">here</a>). Regarding farmed shrimp\u2019s average lifespan, this input was based on FAO sources for the two most commonly farmed species\u2013namely, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO (2009)</a> for <i>Penaeus vannamei</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9vvzt3ykjxc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9vvzt3ykjxc\">[4]</a></sup></span><i>&nbsp;</i>(family <i>Penaeidae</i>, suborder <i>Dendrobranchiata</i>), and <a href=\"https://perma.cc/5ST4-8DED\">FAO (2022e)</a> for <i>Penaeus monodon </i>(belonging to the same family and suborder). For other species, we used figures from table 4.6 in <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/doi.org/10.1002/9780470995082\">Wickins and Lee (2002, p.</a> <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/doi.org/10.1002/9780470995082\">85)</a>.</p><p>These calculations were performed in a probabilistic model, using the same tool as before\u2013Guesstimate. Adjustments to account for premature deaths were also incorporated. For further details, see the model <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21679\">here</a>.</p><h3>Wild-caught shrimp estimates</h3><p>The method used is very similar to the one already adopted for calculating the number of farmed shrimp. In this case, all the countries and fishing areas of the <i>Global Capture Production</i> dataset (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6ERV-W2F5\">FAO, 2022d</a>) for 2020 were selected. Regarding the species included, all the species under the category \u201cShrimps, prawns\u201d of the database were covered. Shrimp freshwater species under the category \u201cFreshwater crustaceans\u201d were also included\u2013i.e., Changallo shrimp, freshwater prawns, and shrimps nei<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffn5n6lbx1wc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfn5n6lbx1wc\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(family <i>Palaemonidae</i>, suborder <i>Pleocyemata</i>), giant river prawn, oriental river prawn, river prawns nei, and Siberian prawn. Shrimp species of other orders were excluded.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqzam7n9qg3o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqzam7n9qg3o\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;That way, 92 different species or taxon<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefta6reimn5pg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnta6reimn5pg\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;were finally considered (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJl3mMW12zdwQN2eMQ_B86S7AJhuHBPCehpjadIant4/edit#gid=42137106\">here</a>, column \u201cB\u201d).</p><p>To estimate the number of individuals, capture tonnages were divided by each species' average live weight of captured shrimp. These weights\u2013expressed in a range of possible values\u2013were estimated based on relevant scientific literature or information provided by the industry. The search terms initially used were the species' scientific name(s),<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5ovwrhkynab\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5ovwrhkynab\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and the words \"mean weight.\" If such an approach did not provide relevant results, \"mean weight\" was substituted by \"weight.\"</p><p>In general, the mean weight ranges were based on mean weights found in the literature, minus and plus standard deviation. Typically, the lower bound of the range resulted from the lower average weight reported by the sources; the upper bound is the highest mean weight found in the literature plus the standard deviation. However, in several cases, the ranges relied primarily on specific sources and not equally on all the sources found. This is because some sources seemed more credible than others, mostly due to sample sizes and the capture methods employed. This approach was adopted for estimating mean weights for <i>Acetes japonicus </i>shrimp (family <i>Sergestidae, </i>suborder <i>Dendrobranchiata</i>), adjusting for sample sizes of the different sources (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K7EMdCR2PCmCPiPcl_3ZXLu0r3y7aGcGfpt0_klqT58/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>).</p><p>In several cases, no information was found on the typical weight of a species at the time of capture. Therefore, in those cases, we took as a reference the average live weights provided by scientific papers for farmed shrimp of that same species. Still, it should be noted that mean weights of farmed individuals are possibly different from those of individuals of the same species caught in the wild. Assuming this, the mean weight range was slightly adjusted accounting for available information for other wild-caught species phylogenetically close to the species at stake.</p><p>A similar approach was adopted for species for which no data at all was found. In these circumstances, possible mean values were estimated based on the average reported weights of shrimp species of the same genus. Whenever possible, more than one of the weights of species taken as references was reviewed. Then, mean lengths for the target species and the species used as references were also checked. Eventual differences were incorporated into the estimated mean weight for the species in question. Likewise, when no data at all was found for a whole genus, mean weights were estimated based on evidence for species with similar mean lengths, even if they belonged to a different genus.</p><p>In a few other cases, only data on mean shrimp weights when already dried was found (i.e., information provided by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(94)00342-T\">Chu et al., 1995</a>). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-9655-9\">Kurun et al. (2007, p. 358)</a> point out that the dry weight of the \u201cedible\u201d parts of shrimp is significantly lower than the weight of fresh parts. Therefore, dry mean weights were adjusted by 1.6. Further details about how this adjustment factor was calculated can be found in the <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food-production#appendix\"><i>Appendix</i></a>.</p><p>The different approaches adopted are properly indicated on a case-to-case basis in the \"Sources\" column of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJl3mMW12zdwQN2eMQ_B86S7AJhuHBPCehpjadIant4/edit#gid=42137106\">spreadsheet</a> that compiles the mean weights for all the wild-caught shrimp species.</p><p>Initially, the number of captured shrimp per species was estimated by creating a simple deterministic model in a spreadsheet (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJl3mMW12zdwQN2eMQ_B86S7AJhuHBPCehpjadIant4/edit#gid=42137106\">here</a>). This first approach was primarily chosen due to the practicalities that a spreadsheet offers against other methods to input and review weight estimates and their sources for more than 90 species. This method allowed us to identify the most commonly wild-caught species\u2013namely, <i>A. japonicus</i>, which accounts for at least ~70% of captured individuals. Next, the specific estimate for this species and for other non-<i>A. japonicus</i> shrimp species were combined into a probabilistic model to calculate the total number of wild-caught individuals using Guesstimate. This model is available <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21689\">here</a>.</p><p>The total number of catches was therefore estimated with a probabilistic model, narrowing the ranges obtained with the initial deterministic approach.</p><h3>Total shrimp estimates</h3><p>All the shrimp estimates of slaughtered individuals, farmed and wild-caught, were combined in a single probabilistic model, using Guesstimate. This model is available <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21709\">here</a>.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Farmed shrimp</h3><p>We estimated that, on average, between 300 billion and 620 billion farmed shrimp are killed annually (mean: 440 billion). Considering mortality rates for different species, at different life stages, between 150 billion and 370 billion shrimp are alive at farms at any time (mean: 230 billion).

While it was previously shown that more farmed insects annually die to produce food and feed than farmed shrimp for human consumption, this is not the case when considering the numbers of farmed individuals alive at any moment. The productive cycle of shrimp is typically longer than that of insects, so more farmed shrimp than insects are alive on farms at any time.

Of these, the majority are individuals of a single species: <i>A. japonicus</i>. While in terms of total tonnage, this species accounts for 7.4% of shrimp captured in 2020, in terms of individuals, <i>A. japonicus </i>represents between 69.7% and 88.7% of wild-caught shrimp worldwide\u2013that is, between 3.6 trillion and 50.2 trillion individuals.</p><p>Notably, in 2020, there was a sharp decrease in <i>A. japonicus</i> catches worldwide compared to 2019\u2013namely, from 402,061 tonnes in 2019, similar to previous years\u2019 catches, to 251,093 tonnes in 2020 (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6ERV-W2F5\">FAO, 2022d</a>). It is unclear whether this drop obeys anomalous or longer-term factors, as discussed in the <i>Appendix</i>.

They are found in the Indo-West Pacific, from the west coast of India to Korea, Japan, China, and Indonesia (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7K27-WVMB\">Holthuis, 1980</a>).

Hence, as our previous estimates of wild-caught shrimp have already suggested, shrimp, in general, account for the majority of animals directly slaughtered for human consumption.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbnzqo2wzjha\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbnzqo2wzjha\">[16]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>We presented our estimates of the number of shrimp mostly intended for consumption, including farmed and wild-caught individuals. As shown, the number of farmed shrimp killed in a year (440 billion) exceeds several times the figure of the most numerous vertebrate species used in the food system\u2013namely, fishes, and chickens. Certainly, more farmed insects than farmed shrimp are typically killed in a year. Nevertheless, significantly more shrimp than insects are alive on farms at any time. Furthermore, the number of farmed shrimp alive at any moment surpasses any farmed animal estimate known to date\u2013even when compared to any other estimate of global captive vertebrate numbers as provided by <a href=\"https://perma.cc/9FZP-7A7S\">\u0160im\u010dikas (2020)</a>. Thus, the problem of shrimp farming is greater in scope\u2013i.e., number of individuals affected\u2013than the problem of insect farming or the farming of any vertebrate for human consumption.</p><p>Moreover, if shrimp are sentient, shrimp farming may not only be bigger in scope, but also likely to cause more severe harms than other animal farming industries. Unlike land vertebrates, shrimp and other decapods are often granted no protection by animal welfare legislation. Similarly, shrimp are typically not included in aquaculture certification schemes provisions, and \u201cbest-practice guidelines, where they exist at all, tend to prioritize product quality rather than animal welfare\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-022-00632-6\">Crump et al., 2022b</a>). As a result, shrimp and decapods, in general, can be farmed under conditions that otherwise would not be legally authorized for other industrially farmed animals. The exclusion of shrimp from certification programs also entails that producers lack incentives to adopt more humane practices. Moreover, the lack of standardized, welfare-oriented farming and slaughter guidelines means that even producers who might care about welfare may not have the resources to assess and improve their own practices. If negative experiences under typical farming conditions are severe, farming shrimp might pose one of the most serious animal welfare issues known to date, and one which is likely to worsen in the near future.</p><p>The problem of shrimp captured from the wild seems even bigger in scale. While the total tonnage of shrimp production from aquaculture typically exceeds the wild-capture output,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcy566b93em\"><sup><a href=\"#fncy566b93em\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;this most likely isn\u2019t the case in terms of the number of individuals affected. Indeed, this work has shown that, taking means as a reference, the total number of wild-caught shrimp (25 trillion) is equivalent to ~<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vOcmenj318b744uqE7WGqjpN-z-PISbBF7bT-01rwOM/edit#gid=1581428268\">56.8 times</a> the number of shrimp slaughtered annually in aquaculture (440 billion). Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the number of wild-caught shrimp is greater than that of any animal species killed for meat. Indeed, overall, wild-caught shrimp may account for the vast majority of all animals directly slaughtered by humans for food. This suggests that, even though shrimp captures may stagnate in the near future, the welfare risks caused by common capture methods will still cause, on aggregate, a very significant amount of avoidable suffering.</p><p>Nevertheless, our ability to produce estimates has been limited both by the quality of the available data and the nature of methods adopted to elaborate the models presented here. Regarding the first category of limitations, it should be noted that data about mortality rates of shrimp under different commercial farming conditions are scarce and not highly accurate (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12394\">Boyd et al., 2017</a>). Similarly, no specific information about mean weights was found for several shrimp species, or it was not possible to find more than one reliable source to guarantee the validity of a possible weight range.</p><p>Additionally, FAO data and other official figures may substantially underreport, or fail to report at all, data of non-commercial, small-scale, and illegal farms. Furthermore, FAO tonnages of farmed shrimp\u2013and, by implication, our models\u2013do not include data on shrimp used as breeders, or of young (postlarval<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft764yn2n6wl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt764yn2n6wl\">[18]</a></sup></span>) shrimp that die while being transported to growing farms.</p><p>Something similar happens with data regarding some shrimp capture operations. In this regard, countries typically report \"landed weight,\" but not total catches. For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3923/jfas.2011.279.284\">Amani et al. (2011)</a> warn that \u201cthe fishery statistics available is inadequate due to the fact that most <i>Acetes </i>shrimp caught are locally consumed and they are not been landed at fish landing jetties in the country [Malaysia].\u201d Moreover, in some cases, some shrimp capture operations do not always appear in official records, so neither catches nor landed amounts are reported.</p><p>As to the second category of limitations, related to the methods adopted, our estimates admittedly could use further refining. In several cases, the ranges that feature in our models do not represent our subjective confidence intervals (lower than 90%), but simply ranges of possible values found in the literature\u2013either for mean species weights or mortality rates in shrimp aquaculture. Ideally, it would have been desirable to aggregate data using the more common approach in meta-analyses, consisting in weighing the evidence by the inverse of the square of the standard errors of parameters that serve as inputs to the models, so as to arrive at weighted means and standard errors. Then, we would have been able to construct more accurate 90% confidence intervals for the mean weight of each species.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr4y6f9tq4tk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr4y6f9tq4tk\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, the quality of the data available\u2013particularly, for wild species\u2019 mean weights\u2013did not make such a method feasible.</p><p>Notably, the models are highly sensitive to slight variations in estimated mean weights for shrimp species. On the one hand, we are relatively confident in the weight ranges used for farmed species. On the other hand, there is greater uncertainty regarding the wild-caught species since reported mean weights vary significantly depending on capture practices, season, or the sex ratio of the individuals caught, among other factors. For these reasons, wide mean weight ranges were used. While we believe that the mean capture weight of <i>A. japonicus</i> very likely falls within the range here employed, minor weight changes\u2013especially for small and commonly caught species\u2013would result in wide variations in our estimates.</p><p>Additionally, although we confirmed that our farmed shrimp figures are roughly correct, we were not able to check the validity of our wild-caught shrimp calculations. Particularly, it would have been desirable to estimate the number of shrimp used to produce shrimp paste in order to see if it is similar to the number of <i>A. japonicus</i> here obtained. This would have also been helpful to possibly explain the sharp decrease in <i>A. japonicus</i> catches observed in 2020.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefal1yyus00yp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnal1yyus00yp\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Unfortunately, no reliable and updated sources for the estimation of the amount of shrimp paste produced or consumed per year were found. These and other previously discussed limitations are further addressed<i> </i>in the <i>Methodological uncertainties and limitations</i> section of the <i>Appendix</i>.</p><p>All things considered, while the lower and upper bounds of our estimates might be unlikely, we can provisionally say with high credence (&gt; 90%)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6fb5k462v7p\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6fb5k462v7p\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that the actual number of reported farmed and captured shrimp is somewhere in between the estimated ranges, and, conservatively, with mid credence ( \u2248 51-60%) that it is close to the averages (\u00b1 10%) here presented. In other words, we believe it is highly likely that currently, at least, 300 billion farmed shrimp are slaughtered per year (credence: \u2248 95%); that there are, at minimum, 150 billion shrimp alive on farms at any moment (credence: \u2248 95%); and that at least 4.1 trillion shrimp are captured from the wild annually (credence: &gt; 90%<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqjsusqkucle\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqjsusqkucle\">[22]</a></sup></span>).</p><p>Despite these sheer numbers, if the moral significance of shrimp sentience is negligible, then the total moral value of shrimp may not amount to much. In this regard, it should be noted that the evidence for sentience in penaeids (e.g., <i>P. vannamei</i>) and in other shrimp belonging to the <i>Dendrobranchiata</i> suborder (e.g., <i>A. japonicus</i>) is particularly scarce. Moreover, contrary to <a href=\"https://perma.cc/6FAT-3225\">Birch et al.\u2019s (2021)</a> conclusions, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/7PTR-Q8QV\">Comstock (2022)</a> has recently argued that Dendrobranchiates are probably <i>not </i>sentient. However, several open questions still remain, and lack of evidence of sentience should not be confused with evidence of lack of sentience. Thus, further research is needed to better understand the likelihood of sentience in these animals, focusing on the species most commonly farmed and killed for food production.</p><p>Assuming that there is a non-negligible chance that farmed and wild-caught shrimp can have valenced experiences\u2013i.e., shrimp are at least 1% likely to be sentient\u2013additional work about shrimp welfare needs under common farming conditions (particularly, for the <i>P. vannamei</i> and the <i>P. monodon</i> species) and the welfare risks posed by standard capture and slaughter methods is necessary. Given the exceptionally high numbers that wild-caught shrimp represent, it might be of special interest to investigate whether individuals of the most captured species\u2013namely, <i>A. japonicus</i>\u2013endure net negative or positive lives in the wild, to look into common natural deaths for individuals of these species, and to address whether the 2020 drop in this species\u2019 catches is anomalous or part of a longer-term trend. Additionally, further resources are necessary to develop and promote science-based humane aquaculture and capture practices, taking into account possible species-specific needs.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This work presented the first known-to-date total estimates of shrimp slaughtered in our food system. It demonstrated that the number of farmed shrimp killed annually and alive in farms at any time vastly surpasses the amount of chickens, fishes, and insects farmed for their meat, or indeed, of any other farmed animal. Furthermore, the number of wild-caught shrimp are even higher, making the problem of shrimp used for food production greater in scale than the problem of insect farming or the farming of any vertebrate for human consumption.</p><p>Although shrimp sentience is not as strongly supported by existing evidence as that of vertebrates and other decapods, there are far more shrimp than farmed crabs, lobsters, chickens, or fishes slaughtered for food production. Thus, even if the case for shrimp sentience is weaker than the case for sentience in other decapods, chickens, or fishes, the expected value of researching and helping shrimp might be higher than the expected value of devoting resources to those other animals. Such expected value might become increasingly higher since shrimp production is likely to continue to grow in the future. Upcoming work by Rethink Priorities will provide a better understanding of this problem and possible ways to address it.</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:713.525px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/irrorsmbfqbzwzafrcja\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/elhgszrbxsh4rrxns8qw 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/nolkzv6qa83pgyl8vyra 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/hxkzekws7ihrtpl20wn3 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/hb6wqfrati6tzmapuw1c 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/ytgh8ydyyuctxztijjks 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/qv3yiq8ehw2lbi4lrgxg 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/yubyoabb0p8czpo6dzf3 2500w\"></p><p>This research is a project of <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/\">Rethink Priorities</a>.

This year was chosen given that (i) it\u2019s a closer point of comparison for existing 2017 estimates by <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2EDY-UY63\">Mood and Brooke (2019a)</a>, and (ii) other information for that same year would allow us to produce an alternative model and thus, compare its results with those obtained with the model initially built.</p><p>We calculated that between 270 and 550 billion farmed shrimp were slaughtered in 2018 (mean: 390 billion, see <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21692\">here</a>). These results are very similar to those provided by <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2EDY-UY63\">Mood and Brooke (2019a)</a>\u2013namely, between 213 and 530 billion. Then, we performed an alternative estimate based on data offered by the Global Aquaculture Alliance\u2019s GOAL (Global Outlook for Aquaculture Leadership) 2019 survey (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/PF5Q-2W6Z\">Anderson et al., 2019</a>) for the year 2018. That source describes what percentage of farmed shrimp produced in 2018 belong to different weight categories (see <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=15baojZYUDZEt48J2wpG4QytQhayOh7yc\">this figure</a>). Using this information, it was calculated that the average farmed shrimp weight in 2018 was about 10.3 grams. According to an email exchange with one of the authors, the survey asked for weights of shrimp with their shells on but with their heads off. According to an article by <a href=\"https://perma.cc/NS3R-UNHJ\">Louisiana Direct Seafood (n.d.)</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6xiztw0ynkh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6xiztw0ynkh\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u201cremoving the heads [of shrimp] will decrease total weight by 35%.\u201d Hence, the mean live weight of farmed shrimp in 2018 was about 10.3 grams / (1 - 0.35) = 15.8 grams.</p><p>If the total 2018 shrimp aquaculture production from FAO\u2019s FishStatJ (~6.6 million tonnes; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/F3RX-8ZH9\">FAO, 2022c</a>) is divided by 15.8 grams, it is obtained that about 417 billion farmed shrimp and prawns were produced in 2018. We performed the same estimation using ranges for the mean number of shrimp per pound in each size category (see <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21692\">here</a>). As observed in the model, it is estimated that between 360 billion and 470 billion farmed shrimp were slaughtered in 2018. This finding is similar to the figures initially calculated for that very same year. This convergence of results suggests that the model built for 2020 estimates is roughly correct.</p><p><strong>Methodological uncertainties and limitations</strong></p><p>There are limitations of our work that result both from the quality of the data available and from the method used. These are briefly discussed in what follows.</p><p><strong>Limitations associated with the data available</strong></p><p>Unlike the FAO data of the tonnage of animals captured, aquaculture outputs refer exclusively to amounts of aquatic animals harvested for human consumption. That is, the data provided do not include shrimp reared for other purposes. Nevertheless, other limitations should be taken into account:</p><p><strong>In some cases, aquaculture production data are not fully recorded: </strong>Similar to what happens with some shrimp capture operations (see below), FAO and official figures may substantially underreport, or not report at all, data of non-commercial small-scale and illegal farms. In India\u2019s Odisha state, some testimonials of local residents claim that this might be a rising phenomenon (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3RKE-WHAH\">Singh, 2021</a>). In the Indian city of Surat, it is estimated that around 1,000 illegal shrimp ponds have been constructed on government land (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/4S4Y-QYA4\">\u201cSurat: Razing of illegal shrimp farms begins,\u201d 2021</a>). Informants interviewed for this report confirmed the existence of illegal farms in the country, which is also one of the major shrimp producers worldwide. Similarly, a report states that the shrimp business in Ecuador\u2013another main producing country\u2013operates largely illegally (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/AW6U-NRCB\">Bravo, 2020, p. 8</a>; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/F6MW-5L8F\">\u201cContin\u00faa la discusi\u00f3n por,\u201d 2020</a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcd1shy5avtj\"><sup><a href=\"#fncd1shy5avtj\">[24]</a></sup></span>). No additional, reliable and updated sources were found to assess the scope of this issue.</p><p>Furthermore, good data for some countries may not be available. In those cases, FAO estimates the amount of farmed shrimp production. However, if those countries have not reported official figures repeatedly over the years, FAO statistics may underestimate the actual amounts. For example, according to FAO\u2019s <i>Global Aquaculture Production </i>dataset reviewed in June 2021, some important producing countries\u2013e.g., India, Ecuador, and Honduras\u2013had not reported shrimp aquaculture production numbers for 2018 yet. At the time we are drafting this report (December 2022), 2020 data for China is partially incomplete and Indonesia\u2013one of the world's largest shrimp exporters\u2013has not fully reported its shrimp captures either, so some of their figures are estimates (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8mvLw-j9YaZbruCs9a3Rq9J0q7NEeMv/edit#gid=482602442\">here</a>, extracted from <a href=\"https://perma.cc/6ERV-W2F5\">FAO, 2022d</a>).</p><p><strong>The total tonnage of farmed shrimp do not account for the total amount of shrimp that die in aquaculture</strong>: In particular, FAO figures\u2013and hence, our models\u2013do not include:</p><ul><li>Numbers of shrimp used as broodstock or as \u201cstock\u201d</li><li>Postlarvae that die while being transported to growing farms</li><li>Other shrimp that die or are slaughtered prematurely\u2013e.g., due to disease outbreaks.</li></ul><p>However, we attempted to account for premature mortality in our second model\u2013i.e., numbers of farmed shrimp alive at any time.</p><p><strong>Limited updated information about mortality rates and other variables in commercial conditions</strong>: One crucial concern about these estimates is the limited up-to-date information on lifespan, mean weights, and mortality figures found in the literature. Importantly, accurate mortality rates for different species under different production systems are particularly scarce. According to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12394\">Boyd et al. (2017)</a>, farmers typically fail to properly estimate the proportion of shrimp that survive the whole production cycle, and \u201cfailed crops\u201d are not always included in reported mean mortality rates. Additionally, it may be that such mortality rates do not account for current diseases that are threatening shrimp production.</p><p><strong>Limitations associated with the methodology adopted</strong></p><p>Some methodological constraints are likely to lead to an underestimate of the actual numbers of farmed shrimp. In this sense, for our first model on the number of shrimp slaughtered in aquaculture, at least three limitations should be acknowledged:</p><p><strong>In several cases, our subjective confidence level is lower than 90%</strong>: Guesstimate is made to be used with <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/subjective-confidence-interval/\">subjective 90% confidence intervals</a>. Similarly to our calculations for wild-caught shrimp, in many cases, we entered ranges in the model that are not our subjective confidence intervals, but simply ranges of possible values that we found in the literature. Future work might refine our estimates by better accounting for confidence intervals.</p><p><strong>Estimated mean weights per several species may not be accurate, and this would change the total number of killed animals</strong>: According to <a href=\"https://perma.cc/PF5Q-2W6Z\">Anderson et al. (2019; see fig. 4)</a>, there has been a shift towards farming smaller shrimp since 2011. If so, some average weights used in our model may be outdated\u2013that is, they are likely to be higher than the actual mean weights of farmed shrimp. As a result, the total number of farmed shrimp slaughtered per year would be greater than what we calculated. However, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/7YJB-LJVN\">Suresh (2015)</a> claims that bigger individuals can be produced nowadays: \u201cProduction of 15 g vannamei in 120-135 days at a stocking density of 20 animals/sq.m was the norm twenty years ago. Today 28 g shrimp can be produced in the same duration\u2026.\u201d It might also be the case that there are trends to farm smaller or bigger shrimp in each country due to demand changes.</p><p><strong>Lifespan and mortality figures may not be accurate, and this would change the number of farmed shrimp alive at any time</strong>: It could be that the sources we used are outdated, or that these numbers are not sufficiently valid across all producing countries or farming systems. If the aquaculture industry is nowadays shifting to produce smaller shrimp\u2013as <a href=\"https://perma.cc/PF5Q-2W6Z\">Anderson et al. (2019)</a> suggests\u2013then, life cycles in captivity are likely to be shorter than what was estimated for these models. Similar concerns apply to the mortality rates used.</p><p><strong>The model\u2019s convergent validity may not be as strong as it may seem</strong>: The results of our model are similar to those obtained by other authors and with an alternative model. Those other calculations are, to the best of our knowledge, the only available sources of comparison to check the sanity of our estimates. However, those other models may not be the best sources for ensuring the validity of our calculations:</p><ul><li>First, the mean weights used in our model are based on data provided by <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2EDY-UY63\">Mood and Brooke (2019a)</a>\u2013the other model we compared our results with. It is reasonable to obtain similar figures if several inputs of both models are exactly the same. Still, it should be noted that <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2EDY-UY63\">Mood and Brooke (2019a)</a> developed a deterministic model while we used a probabilistic one.</li><li>Second, the alternative estimate provided here is mostly based on one survey, but it is unclear how representative it is and whether its results are accurate.</li></ul><p>With respect to the models designed to estimate the numbers of farmed shrimp alive at any time, the following limitations should be considered:</p><p><strong>The limitations of the first model on the number of farmed shrimp killed were incorporated in the calculations of the number of shrimp alive on farms at any time</strong>: Since the later estimate required as an input the number of farmed shrimp slaughtered in a year, any inaccuracy in the first calculations was also accumulated in our estimates of the number of shrimp alive at any moment on farms.</p><h3>Wild-caught shrimp estimates</h3><p>Adjustment factor to convert dry weights into wet weights</p><p>When only dried weight data was found, an adjustment factor was used. It was calculated as follows:</p><ol><li>According to figures provided by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-9655-9\">Kurun et al. (2007)</a> (see table 4 on page 358), when shrimp meat is dried, it loses approximately 75% of its initial weight.</li><li>It is hypothesized that it is unlikely that similar weight losses affect non \u201cedible\u201d shrimp parts\u2013i.e., shrimp exoskeleton and their heads. Therefore, we assume that when shrimp are blotted dry, there is no such significant weight loss of such non-edible parts.</li><li>According to <a href=\"https://perma.cc/NS3R-UNHJ\">Louisiana Direct Seafood (n.d.)</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwyp6wtzq2h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwyp6wtzq2h\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;a shrimp\u2019s head and exoskeleton together represent 50% of the animal\u2019s total weight.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6omcnf4zxw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6omcnf4zxw\">[26]</a></sup></span></li><li>Thus, if a shrimp is dried, the animal will lose 75% of the 50% weight of her total weight. Therefore, the total weight lost upon drying is 37.5% of the animal\u2019s initial weight (0.75x0.5). In other words, a dried shrimp preserves 62.5% of her initial weight (0.5 + 0.5x0.25 = 0.5 + 0.125 = 0.625).</li><li>This 62.5% retained weight must be multiplied by 1.6 to obtain the live animal weight (100/62.5 = 1.6).</li></ol><p>Nevertheless, assumption (2), although possible, may be disputed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvx0yjgz6dc8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvx0yjgz6dc8\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Whether shrimp\u2019s non \u201cedible\u201d parts would lose weight in any significant way depends on how and to what extent the animals are dried out. Unfortunately, not enough details are provided in this regard.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe4s6obzi8ln\"><sup><a href=\"#fne4s6obzi8ln\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In order to account for the possibility that this hypothesis might be wrong, all the values resulting from the above calculations were also compared with the already available mean weights of shrimp species of similar size, and when possible, of the same genus. When necessary, some small adjustments were made. Those cases are indicated in the \u201cType of weight\u201d column of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJl3mMW12zdwQN2eMQ_B86S7AJhuHBPCehpjadIant4/edit#gid=42137106\">the spreadsheet</a> as \u201cWW, adjusted &amp; estimated.\u201d</p><p><strong>Methodological uncertainties and limitations</strong></p><p><strong>Limitations associated with the data available</strong></p><p>In what follows, the limitations of this work that result from the quality of the data currently available are discussed. Such constraints are likely to lead to an underestimate of the actual number of wild-caught shrimp.</p><p><strong>Data provided by FAO refer to shrimp captured for various purposes</strong>: FAO statistics cover shrimp captured for all commercial, industrial, recreational, and subsistence purposes\u2013that is, not exclusively for direct human consumption. Unfortunately, the database does not allow a breakdown of the quantities of animals landed (see below) for different purposes. Nevertheless, the majority of global catches are likely industrial fisheries that commercialize shrimp for human consumption (FAO-Fisheries Division, personal communication, May 27, 2021; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, p. 15</a>; see also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10244\">Pauly &amp; Zeller, 2016</a>).</p><p><strong>Countries typically report \u201clanded weight,\u201d not total catches: </strong>The FAO global capture database refers to the total retained catches, which includes \u201clanded\u201d and \u201cnon-landed\u201d catches (FAO-Fisheries Division, personal communication, May 27, 2021). That is, it includes the mass of animals that are captured, whether they arrive at the port (\u201clanded\u201d) or not.</p><p>However, in most cases, countries are only able to report the quantities of landed catches (FAO-Fisheries Division, personal communication, May 27, 2021). That is, it is likely that <a href=\"https://perma.cc/6ERV-W2F5\">FAO\u2019s Fishery Statistical Collections on Global Capture Production</a> does not contain data about shrimp (and other animals) that were captured, killed, and used prior to landing, either because they were consumed on board, or used as bait. Similarly, captured shrimp that got spoiled onboard are typically dumped before landing, and therefore, are not reported either. Lastly, landed weight data do not account for shrimp that are unintentionally lost when handling at sea or when landing.</p><p><strong>In some cases, neither catches nor landed amounts are recorded</strong>: Some shrimp capture operations do not always appear in official records. In general, FAO figures may substantially underreport data of commercial and non-commercial small-scale fisheries and illegal or non-regulated catches (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10244\">Pauly &amp; Zeller, 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.39\">Watson, 2017</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-014-1219-1\">Zeller et al., 2015</a>). This underestimation is known and acknowledged by FAO\u2013e.g., the organism states, \u201cnon-reporting of landings is a major concern in some fisheries\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/ML2D-2XWP\">FAO, 2022a</a>).</p><p>Still, the magnitude of these underestimations for the shrimp fishing industry is unclear. However, there are reasons to think that official data significantly underestimates the total catch. First, illegal and non-regulated shrimp trawling is a common issue in major producing countries, like Indonesia (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, pp. 191-213</a>) and China (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/MJ8C-RTWE\">Urbina, 2020</a>). That is why, in 2001, the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) stated that \u201cworld landings of <i>Acetes</i> [shrimp]<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefecg1q1mu3qh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnecg1q1mu3qh\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;are likely to be grossly underestimated\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/B9PS-AX9W\">Otto &amp; Jamieson, 2001, p. 34</a>). If that continues to be the case, given the small size of these animals\u2013who resemble krill\u2013these estimates would fall short by several orders of magnitude.</p><p>Second, good data for some countries is not always available (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, p. 33</a>). This might be the case of currently available <i>A. japonicus </i>figures, as discussed below. Some countries catch important amounts of shrimp and have not reported official data to FAO for years (FAO-Fisheries Division, personal communication, May 27, 2021).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft1a4pi29xj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt1a4pi29xj\">[30]</a></sup></span></p><p>Additionally, due to practical and logistical constraints, lack of reliable data is a common issue for subsistence and small-scale shrimp catches, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (FAO-Fisheries Division, personal communication, May 27, 2021; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, p. 33</a>). One may believe that such catches do not represent significant amounts, but <a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett (2008, p. 9)</a> states that \u201csmall-scale fishing is responsible for a surprisingly large proportion of the world\u2019s shrimp catch.\u201d More recent sources confirm the above (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103613\">Carvalho et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00052\">Jones et al., 2018</a>). Additionally, it should be noted that small-scale operators typically employ gear suitable for estuarine waters and lagoons. Therefore, the shrimp captured will preferably be small individuals\u2013i.e., larvae, juveniles, and migrating subadults (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, p. 22</a>; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/3C29-X485\">Garcia, 1988, p. 220</a>). That is, even if the non-reported amounts by small-scale operators are relatively reduced, this deficit is likely more important in terms of the number of individuals involved.</p><p>Also note that recreational catches are likely to be under-estimated in many countries (FAO-Fisheries Division, personal communication, May 27, 2021), but that those sorts of captures are beyond the scope of this work.</p><p><strong>A large drop in </strong><i><strong>A. japonicus</strong></i><strong> catches due to unclear factors</strong>: In 2020, there was a sharp decrease in <i>A. japonicus</i> catches worldwide compared to 2019. While in 2020 251,093 tonnes of <i>A. japonicus </i>were captured from the wild (data viewed: September 2022), captures in 2019 for the same species reached 402,061 tonnes\u2013similar to previous years. The 2020 dip came from China, whose<i> A. japonicus</i> captures decreased by 157,546 tonnes (-40%) from 2019 to 2020 (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6ERV-W2F5\">FAO, 2022d</a>). No generalized drop was observed for China\u2019s total capture numbers for other marine species over that same year, and according to the United States Department of Agriculture (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/V6JZ-YY4W\">USDA, 2021</a>), China\u2019s wild catches only declined by 5.4% in 2020 compared to 2019.</p><p>Given <i>A. japonicus</i>\u2019 small size, even little variations in tonnages lead to significant variations in numbers of individuals. Initially, it was assessed whether the 2019-20 difference in <i>A. japonicus </i>catches was due to late data reporting\u2013that is, available information for 2020 might still be incomplete\u2013rather than an actual dip in catches. In this regard, FAO-Fisheries Division experts stated that \u201ccatches for the latest year (currently 2020) should generally be treated as preliminary and subject to revision at the next release of the data, scheduled for March 2023. In 2021, catches for 2019 were revised by China, so it is reasonable to expect that catches for 2020 may also be revised as new or more complete data becomes available\u201d (Statistics team at FAO-Fisheries and Aquaculture Division, personal communication, September 9, 2022). If 2020 catches are actually similar to 2019 figures, we may be underestimating the numbers of wild-caught shrimp by 2.2 trillion to 30.2 trillion individuals.</p><p>However, while catches are generally revised upwards by countries, in the case of China, the revisions to 2019 data resulted in a marginal (just over 1%) increase in total catches. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that 2020 revised data for<i> A. japonicus</i> will unlikely change the already-2020 reported figures by any large magnitude. It is even more unlikely that complete 2020 data will reach 2019 levels. If so, late data reporting does not likely explain the decrease in <i>A. japonicus </i>captures, and other factors thus probably offer more plausible reasons.</p><p>After further research and also consulting with FAO-Fisheries Division experts, this sharp decrease may be multifactorial, possibly including the following:</p><ul><li>Circumstantial effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic: The pandemic, including lockdowns and closure of markets, caused major disruption to fishing activities and quantities of landed catches, and slowed down trade (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4060/cc0461en\">FAO, 2022f, pp. 195-200</a>). In China, <i>A. japonicus</i> is mostly caught in the Zhejiang province <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12562-021-01514-9\">(Ding et al., 2021)</a>, which was one of the most affected areas in terms of COVID-19 circulation in 2020 <a href=\"https://perma.cc/8BB3-TB9Y\">(Feng &amp; Cheng, 2020</a>). The province was on lockdown from mid-February 2020. It therefore seems like a plausible hypothesis, which was also mentioned by the FAO\u2019s statistics team in their response (Statistics team at FAO-Fisheries and Aquaculture Division, personal communication, September 9, 2022). This hypothesis was deemed \u201cmeaningful\u201d and \u201cable to develop as a very good research\u201d by Yen-Chiang Chang, Professor of International Law at Shandong University and co-author of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?KdxL7V\">The impact of the COVID-19 on China\u2019s fisheries sector and its countermeasures</a>\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105975\">2022</a>) (personal communication, October 5, 2022). However:<ul><li>It is unclear why <i>A. japonicus</i> captures would be <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJl3mMW12zdwQN2eMQ_B86S7AJhuHBPCehpjadIant4/edit#gid=1987041525\">much more affected by the pandemic than catches of other species</a>\u2013which, in some cases, even increased, while China\u2019s total shrimp captures are generally consistent with previous years. It could be argued that <i>A. japonicus</i> production, commercialization and/or demand were particularly vulnerable to pandemic restrictions, unlike other shrimp products. In this regard, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett (2008, p. 28)</a> claims that \u201cakiami paste shrimp is distinct from most other [shrimp] species (magnitude of production, fishing technique, product form, end market).\u201d If so, assuming that the pandemic impacted aquatic food production differently (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4060/cc0461en\">FAO, 2022f, p. 196</a>), it is yet to be investigated whether <i>A. japonicus</i> production, trade, or consumption were actually particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</li><li>So far, no direct and more specific proof linking the pandemic restrictions with this dip in <i>A. japonicus</i> catches was found.</li></ul></li><li>A decrease in catches caused by structural factors: While China remains the world\u2019s top producer of marine captures, according to the FAO experts consulted (Statistics team at FAO-Fisheries and Aquaculture Division, personal communication, September 9, 2022) and <a href=\"https://perma.cc/V6JZ-YY4W\">USDA (2021)</a>, China is voluntarily reducing wild catches. Over the last years (2016-2020), this has been happening \u201cdue to fewer resources, reduced fishing fleets, and [new] regulations\u201d put in place by the Chinese government (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/V6JZ-YY4W\">USDA, 2021, p. 3-4</a>). However, assuming that China did indeed voluntarily reduce its <i>A. japonicus </i>captures, it should be noted that the country\u2019s catches of other shrimp species in 2020 grew, while China\u2019s total shrimp captures are generally consistent with previous years. It is unknown whether and why <i>A. japonicus </i>catches would have been particularly affected by recent fishing policies of the Chinese administration.</li><li>In general, without 2021 data, it is difficult to speculate whether the decrease in <i>A. japonicus</i> captures was anomalous or is part of a longer-term trend and possible change in targeting by Chinese vessels. Forthcoming data for 2021 and onwards will likely shed light on this matter.</li></ul><p><strong>Total retained captures do not account for the total amount of animals killed by shrimp fishing: </strong>In general, FAO data of total retained catches of aquatic animals do not account for the total amount of shrimp and other animals that are actually killed, like:</p><ul><li>Shrimp (and other animals) that died as a result of capture operations but were not caught.</li><li>Shrimp and other animals of non-target species that were captured and killed but were considered undersized,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefselkc7k9kpi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnselkc7k9kpi\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;unsaleable, or undesirable for other reasons, and were discarded. This includes what is commonly called \u201cbycatches.\u201d It is widely known that global discarded bycatches are mainly caused by shrimp trawling (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, pp. 45-67</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00052\">Jones et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10244\">Pauly &amp; Zeller, 2016</a>).</li></ul><p>Estimating the number of these animals indirectly killed by shrimp fishing is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p><strong>These estimates do not account for all the shrimp and other non-human individuals </strong><i><strong>harmed</strong></i><strong> by shrimp capture operations:</strong> Capture operations can harm shrimp and other animals living in the wild, without being caught. Similarly, captured shrimp and other animals may escape alive\u2013but physically hurt\u2013from the fishing gear. Other animals are captured, but may be considered commercially undesirable, and are discarded while still alive (\u201cbycatches\u201d). It is likely that those individuals, if sentient, also suffered from the intensive handling that capture operations pose. There is no specific data on these harms caused by capturing shrimp.</p><p>Note that these limitations are not exclusive to this work. They derive from the quality of the available data and affect any estimate of the number of captured aquatic animals based on figures provided by FAO.</p><p><strong>Limited data of the mean weight of all the captured shrimp species exist</strong>: Shrimp of more than 92 different species are captured from the wild. For just a few species, the mean commercial weight at which those individuals are typically caught is readily available. However, for several species, we were unable to find such specific information. In many cases, it was not possible to find more than one reliable source, or we had to rely on factsheets where no additional information was provided to directly assess the accuracy of the data provided.</p><p><strong>Limitations associated with the methodology adopted</strong></p><p>There are other constraints related to the method used to calculate the number of shrimp captured from the wild. These are described below.</p><p><strong>In several cases, our </strong><a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/subjective-confidence-interval/\"><strong>subjective confidence level is lower than 90%</strong></a>: In many cases, mean species weights that are not our subjective confidence intervals were used, but simply ranges of possible values that were found in the literature, or values that were inferred based on the literature for other species of the same genus.</p><p><strong>The model is highly sensitive to slight variations in estimated mean weights of shrimp species</strong>: Some of the species most commonly captured are particularly small\u2013e.g., <i>A. japonicus</i>, <i>Acetes</i> spp, or <i>Sergestidae</i> shrimp weighing less than 1 g. Therefore, any tiny change in shrimp estimated mean weights\u2013particularly, of the mentioned species\u2013results in wide variations in the total number of wild-caught individuals. While we are confident that the mean weight of <i>A. japonicus</i> very likely falls within the range provided, mean weights for some other species may be further refined given that:</p><ul><li><strong>Mean weights are based on relatively small samples</strong>: While farmed species' mean weights might be more homogeneous, that is unlikely to be true for the 92 species of wild-caught individuals. Here we are, at best, relying on sample sizes of up to a few thousand shrimp to extrapolate the mean weights of trillions of individuals.<ul><li><strong>No data on the mean weight of some species were found</strong>: When no average weight information for a given species seemed to exist, it was inferred from scientific descriptions of the species or the mean weight of other comparable species. Those cases are flagged in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJl3mMW12zdwQN2eMQ_B86S7AJhuHBPCehpjadIant4/edit#gid=42137106\">the spreadsheet</a> as \"WW [wet weight], estimated.\" When the live weight of a species had to be calculated based on data about its dry weight, it is indicated as \u201cWW, adjusted.\u201d Still, it should be noted that, in many cases, it was not possible to find more than one reliable source to guarantee the validity of the estimated average weight.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The average weight of adult individuals of a given species can vary greatly</strong>: For most shrimp species, there are significant weight differences between adult males and females of the same species (see e.g., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(94)00342-T\">Chu et al., 1995</a>), and it is unknown whether most catches are females or males for any given species. For example, based on <a href=\"https://perma.cc/T6N4-FT4V\">Amin et al., (2009)</a>, it is reasonable to think that a higher proportion of females in catches is likely for <i>A. japonicus</i> (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/T6N4-FT4V\">Amin et al., 2009</a>), which represents between 69.7% and 88.7% of individual shrimp caught globally. However, evidence by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3923/jfas.2011.279.284\">Amani et al. (2011)</a> does not support such an assumption, and none of these studies provides strong enough evidence to generalize across <i>A. japonicus</i> capture practices worldwide. Due to these uncertainties, on some occasions, the range of estimated mean weights is particularly wide.</li><li><strong>Commercially desirable weights also vary greatly</strong>: Different markets require different species and sizes. In some countries, the industry has developed standards to classify commercially valuable shrimp and discard smaller individuals (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NS3R-UNHJ\">Louisiana Direct Seafood, n.d.</a>; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, p. 37-38</a>). In general, large individuals are sold at higher prices than small shrimp (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, pp. 37-38</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/NS3R-UNHJ\">Louisiana Direct Seafood, n.d.</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/CH2K-PL63\">Torry Research Station, 2001</a>), and are likely to be preferred for export (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3TZH-FBG7\">Turnbull &amp; Atfield, 2007</a>). However, while specimens of a given species can be considered too small for some markets (i.e., juveniles), they can indeed meet commercial expectations in other locations. Indeed, small individuals that are discarded in some countries, are commercially valuable in other locations, especially in lower-income countries\u2013e.g., tiny shrimp are ground and used as a condiment (e.g., in Indonesia or Nigeria), directly consumed, or used for other purposes (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, p. 33</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/3C29-X485\">Garcia, 1988, p. 222</a>; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/CH2K-PL63\">Torry Research Station, 2001</a>). According to observations in markets in China, smaller shrimp are preferred over large ones (Tse Yip Fai, personal communication, June 16, 2021) while that is not typically the case in Western countries (see e.g., <a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y6TC-Y772\">Gillett, 2008, p. 37</a>). These preferences inform capture practices that affect mean weights of shrimp catches, as discussed in the next point.</li><li><strong>Mean weights of a given species can also vary due to capture practices: </strong>Wild-caught shrimp sizes might vary greatly depending on the season of the year they are captured (see e.g., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3923/jfas.2011.279.284\">Amani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/PHX3-UD4N\">Demestre &amp; Abell\u00f3, 1993</a>), and mesh size selection (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DA79-E553\">Gra\u00e7a, 2008</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1651/C-2405\">Oh et al., 2003</a>). Due to behavioral patterns, sizes also change depending on the depth at which shrimp are collected (see e.g., <a href=\"https://perma.cc/PHX3-UD4N\">Demestre &amp; Abell\u00f3, 1993</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0025315411001202\">Paramo, 2012</a>), and, for some species, even the time of day capture efforts take place (see e.g., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1163/156854006778859678\">Despalatovi\u0107 et al., 2006</a>). Similarly, it might be the case that a species' common sizes are slightly different in different geographies. Unfortunately, it was not always possible to obtain data on the average weight of a species in the area where it is most frequently captured\u2013for example, for<i> A. japonicus </i>caught by China. All these considerations might affect the reliability of the sources used to calculate wild-caught shrimp mean weights\u2013that is, some weight-reporting sources rely on catching methods and/or locations that may not be representative of global shrimp capture practices for that same species. This is an additional reason why we used relatively wide mean weight ranges.</li></ul><h1>Notes</h1><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fngpni82j2sa8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefgpni82j2sa8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Decapods (a term derived from the Greek, meaning \"ten footed\") are an order of crustaceans within the class <i>Malacostraca</i>.

(CCW2023)", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T16:04:31.782Z", "htmlBody": "<p>TLDR: This post is part of a sequence we\u2019ve prepared for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FWmnwCcKiBLstFtYL/career-conversations-week-on-the-forum-8-15-september\"><u>Career Conversations Week</u></a> on the EA Forum. This article provides a concise overview of the traits that Charity Entrepreneurship deems most valuable for a career in nonprofit entrepreneurship. We intend to provide you with a deeper understanding of our criteria when evaluating applications for our Incubation Program. Additionally, we hope this post assists you in self-assessing whether this career path aligns with your aspirations and abilities.</p><p><br>It\u2019s been five years since we started our <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/incubation-program\">Incubation Program</a>. We\u2019ve since incubated <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/our-charities\">27 charities</a>, some of which are now GiveWell incubated or ACE recommended, with many others on a path to becoming leaders in their fields. This would be impossible without dedicated, smart, resilient, and ambitiously altruistic individuals like you. Of course, not everyone is suited to be a successful nonprofit entrepreneur, and so we\u2019ve spent the last few years refining our vetting process to identify people for whom this career would be an especially good fit.</p><p>There is no single blueprint for successful founders. Many of our alumni hadn't even considered this career path until someone encouraged them to explore it! What surprises many people is the incredible diversity among our successful charity founders in terms of age, educational background, and experience.</p><p>So far, people from 28 different countries joined our program. We've had many participants come directly from bachelor's or master's programs, as well as welcomed individuals with PhDs from recognized institutions like Cambridge, Oxford, and Harvard. They\u2019ve specialized in fields as diverse as philosophy, geology, machine learning, and engineering. Some have chosen entrepreneurship over formal education, like our youngest participant, who, at the age of 19, left university to join our program!</p><p>Our program has also attracted individuals who boldly chose to transition from lucrative, secure, or high-status careers such as consulting, real estate, engineering at NASA or medicine. We've seen passionate street activists and seasoned nonprofit professionals alike join the program, each bringing their unique perspectives and skills to the table.</p><p>More than specific experience or expertise, they have each brought in an open mind and focused desire to launch a high-impact nonprofit.&nbsp;<br><br>If it\u2019s not credentials, age, or specialized experience that make you a great fit for nonprofit entrepreneurship, what is it? Here is what we\u2019ve learned in the last five years and who we are looking for to join our Incubation Programs.</p><h2><strong>Competence:&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Previous Project Experience:&nbsp;</strong>People who have initiated their own projects or taken the lead in previous initiatives. Examples might be organizing impactful events or conferences, managing and expanding student groups, cultivating a newsletter or blog following, developing a mobile app with peers, serving as an editor for a university newspaper, or mobilizing an activist group. These instances serve as evidence of an entrepreneurial mindset and a proactive approach.</li><li><strong>Academic or Personal Achievement</strong>: People who have excelled academically or demonstrated exceptional accomplishments in their career, hobbies, or interests. A wide range of things fit into this category, from academic distinction to playing an instrument really well, taking part in debate competitions, or winning local RPG contests. High achievement indicates a strong work ethic and a drive for excellence.</li><li><strong>Scientific/Analytical/Empirical Mindset:&nbsp;</strong>Individuals with experience in empirical methods who value scientific evidence and are eager to test assumptions and change their minds. The skeptical, evidence-based mindset and humbleness around one's views are critical for sound decision-making.</li></ul><h2><strong>Personality Traits:&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Ambitiously Altruistic</strong>: People who are exceptionally \u201chungry\u201d for counterfactual impact. Deeply care about the world's problems and are willing to be highly analytical in figuring out (and acting on!) the best ways to do as much good as possible. They value reason, evidence, and effort.<ul><li>Impartiality: They are impartial about who they help. This often means they prioritize people outside of their own country or community (because it\u2019s unlikely their own people are those who can be most helped).</li><li>Scale Sensitive: They aim to help the greatest number of the most in need, to the greatest extent. They are not content with merely doing some good; instead, they aim to utilize their careers to do the maximum amount of good (as they define it).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Conscientious:</strong> Individuals with a strong sense of duty who proactively plan, take action, and keep track of tasks without constant follow-up. They are capable of working fast and hard without oversight. Self-motivated, natural planners.</li><li><strong>Results-Oriented:</strong> People who prioritize tangible outcomes and ask critical questions about the impact of their actions. They put authentic results over other values or metrics like mastery, vanity, and notoriety. Will turn down funding if it comes with restrictions that will reduce overall impact.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Resilient, Energetic, and Self-Driven:</strong> Candidates who display unwavering determination and enthusiasm, even in the face of setbacks. They demonstrate resilience to pressure and are comfortable taking calculated risks, all while driven by internal goals and aspirations.</li><li><strong>Productive Learners with a Growth Mindset:</strong> Individuals who continuously seek ways to improve themselves and their work. They demonstrate effective personal productivity systems, are decently well-organized, and actively seek feedback and learning opportunities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>Upskilling as You Go:</strong></h2><p>It's crucial to keep in mind that not all of the traits mentioned above need to be fully developed from the outset. There are two key reasons for this:<br><br>1) First, you'll often launch your nonprofit alongside a co-founder with complementary traits or skills. For instance, one of you may excel in quantitative skills while the other excels in communication. One may be a proficient operations manager, while the other is a passionate researcher. One person might exhibit more extroverted and enthusiastic qualities, whereas the other leans towards conscientiousness and attention to detail. This is one reason we firmly believe that having a co-founder is paramount. A strong co-founder foundation facilitates better decision-making, accelerates project progress, and boosts overall motivation and morale. The first half of our Incubation Program is dedicated to this aim, enabling you to collaborate with various ambitious individuals and discover the best fit for launching your charity.</p><p>2) Second, you will upskill as you progress in your entrepreneurship journey. At CE, we leverage our Incubation Program to provide valuable knowledge and a practical training ground through applied projects and feedback, all designed to help you launch a successful nonprofit. Our mentorship and support extend beyond the initial program. We help you secure funding, establish your operational foundations, and provide continuous, tailored guidance as your organization grows. We foster a supportive community that readily shares knowledge, templates, solutions, and productivity tools. Our community illustrates why an unwavering willingness to learn, collaborate, and explore is invaluable for a startup founder. Skills and tools can be acquired, but you must bring a flexible attitude and commitment to impact.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Potential Obstacles in this Career Path</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Arrogance/overconfidence:</strong> We firmly believe that a scientific mindset requires humility. Maintaining a healthy level of skepticism and being open to the possibility of being wrong are essential traits for sound decision-making.</li><li><strong>Resistance to learning new concepts:</strong> Candidates joining our Incubation Program must embrace new concepts, e.g., counterfactual thinking, power lawed distributions, and cost-effectiveness analyses. If someone confines themselves to a single domain, they may be better suited for a focused role within a nonprofit organization rather than to be a founder. As a founder, you'll be responsible for making critical decisions across various domains, so a generalist, growth mindset approach is necessary.</li><li><strong>Limited communication skills</strong>: Founders must work closely with their co-founder, eventual team, and various high-importance external stakeholders (from funders to field partners). The ability to manage these relationships well is crucial. This skill is less about extroversion and more about the importance of empathy and a willingness to improve relational skills.</li><li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> Adapting from an academic environment, where solving a single problem might span months or even years, can pose a challenge in this career. Highly impactful nonprofit organizations need to operate swiftly and efficiently. This often entails the 80/20 principle, making decisions amidst uncertainty and not having ample time to explore every available option.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lack of motivation:&nbsp;</strong>Nonprofit entrepreneurship demands hard work. A proactive attitude is necessary, and there is little time for procrastination. A founder must be receptive to refining their productivity to get more done and occasionally put in extra hours when necessary. While certain sacrifices may be required, the rewards can be immensely gratifying, especially when witnessing the direct impact of your efforts.</li><li><strong>Not putting impact first:&nbsp;</strong>Nonprofit founders can encounter numerous pitfalls if their primary focus isn't on impact. Examples include scaling too rapidly with an unsuitable model, accepting funding that diverts activities away from more impactful paths, and prioritizing reputation building over helping beneficiaries. Errors may stem from overarching strategic decisions or intricate choices in intervention implementation. Being prepared and willing to make uncomfortable decisions, undergoing rigorous evaluation processes, making personnel changes, and significantly altering interventions are essential aspects of this journey. Understanding when to discontinue a project is equally important. Counterfactual thinking is pivotal to making these determinations and can lead to profoundly positive outcomes.</li></ul><h2><br><strong>We Encourage You to Apply to Our Incubation Program!</strong></h2><p>Applications are still open for our <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/our-charities\">2024 Incubation Programs</a>.

Campaigns that performed best were \u2018choosing inspiration\u2019 and one that appealed to students\u2019 ambitiousness.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Select the right channel</strong><ol><li>After defining the target group and learning more about audience behaviour and where they spend their time, the next step would be to select channels based on audience reach, relevance, communication objectives, budget and resources.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Channels we selected and their results</strong><ol><li><u>Email outreach</u> - reaching out to university course coordinators, relevant foundations, and student clubs to share what Effective Thesis does. This was time-consuming and results were not as trackable since we weren\u2019t directly sharing the word about Effective Thesis but did result in high conversion rates from student clubs and research foundations sharing the word about Effective Thesis (16.4% and 11.76% respectively).</li><li><u>Social media advertising</u> - we focused on running campaigns on Twitter and Facebook as they seemed promising in terms of audience reach and were inexpensive. We found that campaigns which ran for longer (&gt;1 month) performed better than shorter campaigns. Overall, the results from these were poor compared to other channels (GoogleAds, email, virtual sessions), both in terms of number of conversions and conversion rates. This might have been different if we promoted services like our newsletter instead of coaching.</li><li><u>Google Ads</u> - has extensive reach, is intent-based, and uses keyword targeting, which can be especially useful if the keyword research stage produces promising results. Additionally, for nonprofits, this can be especially cost-effective since Google awards a $10,000 USD/month grant to run these ads. We received a total of 921 conversions in a year of running Google Ads, and utilised 88% of our grant spend overall. A significant portion of our total conversions from all outreach efforts came from Google Ads. We also received a lot of low-quality applications, which resulted in us excluding certain keywords and locations from our campaigns.</li><li><u>Running sessions with EA groups</u> - we ran ~1-hour virtual sessions on \"Changing the world with your research\" to introduce EA student group members to Effective Thesis and possible ways of thinking about using their thesis as a path to impact. We ran 8 virtual sessions, with a total of ~112 attendees and received ~33 sign-ups for at least one service, making the conversion rate ~30%, the highest of any other outreach activity.</li><li><u>Influencer marketing</u> - we targeted small-medium sized influencers (3-100k followers) on Twitter, along with a podcast, and ran a total of 5 paid campaigns. Our total spend was ~$900, which resulted in a cost per acquisition of $17.3 (average) and a conversion rate between 2-6%. The process of reaching out and getting a response turned out to be extremely time-consuming. In retrospect, I might have worked with an influencer marketing agency instead.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Channels we did not select that seemed promising</strong><ul><li>SEO: I would recommend new orgs to work on their SEO, though we were unable to do this due to high competition and a very low DA ranking. We still were able to rank on the first page on Google for the term \u2018thesis topic\u2019 by making minimal changes to our webpage.&nbsp;</li><li>YouTube ads: these seemed really promising and still do, but we didn\u2019t have the capacity to do these well enough and prioritised other channels.</li><li>Reddit: I did not select this due to a lack of presence on Reddit and did not have the capacity to provide quality answers on relevant threads.</li><li>PR: we primarily did not invest in public relations as we did not have a lot of our own research or publications to promote, though I think this is a really helpful channel to build legitimacy.&nbsp;</li><li>LinkedIn ads: seemed most promising because of context relevance compared to other social media platforms, but it\u2019s much more expensive to promote and I was uncertain which service might work best on this platform.</li></ul></li></ol><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5tw2nLeXXf6K8b7Bb/my-learnings-from-a-year-of-handling-outreach-at-effective#Additional_learnings_from_outreach_and_marketing\"><strong>Additional learnings from outreach</strong></a></p><ul><li>Google Analytics: Analytics plays a critical role in understanding user behaviour and website performance. Google Analytics provides valuable insights into popular pages, traffic sources, and conversions. It is recommended to start with simple metrics and set up tracking for all channels.<ul><li>Results from Google Analytics: Outreach efforts resulted in a significant increase in website traffic (475%) and conversions (235%) compared to the previous year. Referrals and emails were more effective than paid search in generating sign-ups, likely due to higher engagement levels and contextual relevance.</li></ul></li><li>Logo Design: The process of creating a logo helped refine the messaging and target audience. Multiple iterations were needed to clarify messaging. Eventually, working with a freelance designer proved successful in achieving the desired logo.</li><li>Switching to the Newsletter: promoting our coaching faced resistance, leading to a strategic shift towards launching the Future Researchers Newsletter. This approach allows students to engage with Effective Thesis gradually and provides thesis topic inspiration, advice, and tools. The newsletter has gained over 350 sign-ups and shows promise in generating interest and eventual sign-ups for coaching.<ul><li>Preliminary Newsletter Results: The open rates and click rates of the newsletter varied across different editions with the average open rate and click rate 38.9% and 7.05%, respectively.</li></ul></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5tw2nLeXXf6K8b7Bb/my-learnings-from-a-year-of-handling-outreach-at-effective#Remaining_uncertainties_to_consider_\"><strong>Remaining uncertainties to consider</strong></a></p><ul><li>A crowded space: Many EA organisations/projects target the same audience. We need better coordination to know where to not duplicate efforts, and how to cross-promote where possible.</li><li>Defining audiences through metrics: metrics like targeting students from \u2018Top 100 Universities\u2019 may overlook those that need the most support.</li><li>Quality vs. quantity: We might want to spend more time optimising for a narrow pipeline (better quality leads) but use automation to reach a broader audience.</li><li>Hitting the ground running: I\u2019m concerned there is an expectation to \u2018execute\u2019 marketing strategies before taking enough time to scope and research.</li><li>Organic social media: Allocate minimal resources here unless content creation is central to your organisation\u2019s strategy.</li></ul><h1>Recommendations for outreach</h1><p>These are my recommendations for outreach that most orgs should work on. Many of these might not work for all types of projects, but I think it\u2019s quite important to consider each of these steps to know what might work for you. This is not an exhaustive list and is based on the experiments we conducted at Effective Thesis, along with the lessons learned from those experiments.</p><h2>Aligning outreach with your theory of change</h2><p>Before starting to work on your marketing strategy, a (somewhat obvious) task is to identify your organisational goals and align them with your marketing goals. This means that your organisational goal informs your marketing goals, but findings from market research also influence your theory of change.&nbsp;</p><p>At Effective Thesis, this looked like taking learnings from our market research, i.e. by surveying students who we thought were the right fit for our services, and finding whether there was a gap we could fill.</p><p>The importance of branding for nonprofits<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefisi6nruglo8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnisi6nruglo8\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;is often overlooked and is sometimes done mid-operations or after monitoring and evaluation rather than as a tool to flesh out the larger theory of change. Since EA orgs are growing and there\u2019s a chance of multiple organisations reaching similar kinds of people, it\u2019s important to know whether there\u2019s a need/gap or message you\u2019re filling or you\u2019re doing similar things to reach the same people.</p><p><strong>Branding may include</strong></p><p>a) Visual identity -</p><ul><li>Logo, colour palette and typography&nbsp;</li><li>Messaging and positioning&nbsp;<ul><li>Mission statement, tagline and tone of voice</li><li>Crafting a compelling mission statement helps articulate the organisation's theory of change and communicate its goals and intended impact. The elaboration likelihood model suggests that persuasive messages, including mission statements, can influence attitudes and behaviours when they are clear, relevant, and emotionally appealing.</li></ul></li></ul><p>b) Stakeholder Engagement -&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Identifying &nbsp;and segmenting the range of target audiences</li><li>Establishing communication channels like social media, newsletters or events</li></ul><p>c) Impact -&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Transparent reporting: Communicating impact and outcomes through annual reports, impact assessments, and success stories</li><li>Brand reputation: Building a positive brand reputation through consistent delivery of high-quality programs and services.</li><li>Clear and transparent communication of an organisation's impact and mistakes might aid with accountability internally and help its reputation<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why I think branding is important</strong></p><ul><li>It helps the organisation articulate its theory of change, goals, and intended impact in a compelling and coherent manner. Theoretically, without a well-defined brand, the organisation may struggle to effectively communicate its program outcomes and evaluation findings to stakeholders.</li><li>Branding can sometimes help clarify key messages and big-picture goals of the org. At Effective Thesis, the process of creating our logo helped us in clarifying our audience and key messages.&nbsp;</li><li>Brand strength is proven<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi37fizzlddh\"><sup><a href=\"#fni37fizzlddh\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to have both conative outcomes (e.g., the intention to donate) and affective outcomes (e.g., trust)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Defining your target audience sharply</h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5tw2nLeXXf6K8b7Bb/eocjndnt091a2ba4eepk\"></p><p>Having a clear and detailed understanding of the target group helps you relay what strategy and channels to undertake. There may be several methods to do this: user interviews, focus groups, researching the sector (not just the audience you\u2019re trying to reach but finding out more about the ecosystem), keyword research and desk research to find reports around the cause area you operate in.</p><h3>Initial audience research (surveying)</h3><p>Other than knowing we wanted to reach out to students who were thinking about their thesis topic, we also wanted to learn how to reach talented students across the world, what their challenges and motivations were and their initial impressions of Effective Thesis. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haqR2xyuHSiYsOypmI9uPFPjxlpIUDbFCRCIIm9PA-g/edit?usp=sharing\">We decided to have paid interviews with students</a> (top rejected applicants) who applied to CERI, SERI and CHERI Fellowships to understand:</p><ul><li>Social media usage - to understand where we would be likely to have ad campaigns&nbsp;</li><li>Motivations to apply for these programs - to understand behaviours&nbsp;</li><li>Impressions about ET - whether our messaging was being understood&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Why we selected applicants from these programs</strong></p><ul><li>Aligned motivation: we could safely assume most students applying to these fellowships were interested in doing research work.</li><li>Cause alignment: similarly, we could also assume that students applying were aware of and were interested in similar cause areas to our recommended research directions.</li><li>Talent: we reached out to the \u2018top\u2019 rejected applicants in 2 out of 3 of these fellowships, which would allow us to speak to students we ideally want to reach.</li></ul><p><strong>What we learned</strong></p><ul><li>Twitter was the primary engagement platform for most Masters and PhD students. Facebook for several, but only to keep in touch with friends. Undergraduates preferred Instagram (or even Discord, but sparsely). YouTube was common among most for informational/educational purposes.</li><li>A common theme for motivation to apply for these programs was topic relevance (an interest in X-risks).<ul><li>Many students (~40%) found out about the fellowship through their University newsletter and thought it would be interesting to apply.</li><li>Some mentioned testing their fit for research and it would be a good way to develop their skills with others who have similar interests.&nbsp;</li><li>Some also mentioned that collaborating in person was very attractive.</li></ul></li><li>Students who were already highly engaged with EA found our website easier to understand and go through. Most students wanted to apply after speaking to us, but were unsure they would from the website alone - this signalled that we needed more clarity in our communications.</li><li>We also learned what sort of content, resources and workshops students might be interested in that they don\u2019t have access to otherwise. &nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Keyword research</h3><p>For more granular information, researching beyond behaviours led to using tools like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_in/home/tools/keyword-planner/\"><u>keyword planner</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/\"><u>google trends</u></a> to view which keywords were widely adopted and which results we could use for intent-based searching. We found this to be most helpful in using specific keywords for our website and somewhat helpful for our campaigns. For more live data, we used social listening to gather what terminology (especially those in graduate school) were using.</p><p>Eg. We found that \u2018thesis topics\u2019 was a much more relevant term than \u2018research projects\u2019 for the students we wanted to reach. We also found that \u2018early career researchers\u2019 and \u2018aspiring researchers\u2019 were terms people in our target group were likely to use and recognise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Feedback</h3><p>This is something best done continuously. We had feedback loops every 6 months from mid-2022 onwards on our content,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/our-services/\"><u>all services</u></a> and any external outreach we did, mainly through feedback forms. This was extremely helpful in learning how to communicate expectations around our services, and knowing how to better improve them.&nbsp;</p><p>Eg. Collecting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/eAgjjTqsSBq9XoJw8\"><u>feedback around virtual sessions</u></a> with newer EA groups helped us learn that they were effective in students signing up for coaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Defining messaging well</h2><p>Once you have a clear understanding of your target audience and their needs, the next step is to define your messaging effectively. Well-defined messaging helps communicate your organisation's goals, values, and intended impact in a compelling and coherent manner. It ensures that your outreach efforts resonate with your target audience and motivate them to take action.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some key considerations for defining your messaging well:</p><h3>Core Message: Craft a Clear Value Proposition</h3><p>Your core message should succinctly convey the unique value your org offers to your target group. Consider prompts like - \u201cWhy do we exist?\u201d or \u201cWhat problem are we solving?\u201d and \u201cWho should care, and why?\u201d</p><p>For Effective Thesis, our value proposition (different from our org mission and vision) was to provide personalised support and inspiration to students writing their thesis.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternate, perhaps more effective value proposition could be - to provide support to students interested in pursuing an impactful research career - which clarifies motivations and somewhat narrows&nbsp;<i>who</i> we\u2019re trying to help instead of&nbsp;<i>when</i> we\u2019re trying to help, but we found that influencing thesis topic choice may have additional value, theoretically in:</p><ol><li>Inspiring students to learn about EA causes in an applied manner&nbsp;</li><li>Testing their fit for research</li><li>Writing a thesis that may be more beneficial than selecting a less impactful topic</li></ol><h3>Tone of Voice: Establishing the Right Tone</h3><p>Consider the tone that aligns with your organisation's values and resonates with your target group. It could be authoritative, compassionate, inspirational, or conversational, depending on your org\u2019s personality and the nature of the message.&nbsp;</p><p>In the process of refining our tone of voice, we analysed the tone of voice of other organisations doing similar work or targeting similar audiences to ours to better understand how our voice might be similar or unique. I don\u2019t think we have been able to figure out our tone of voice perfectly yet, but our aim was to present a tone that was&nbsp;<strong>informative</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>transparent</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>professional</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>inspirational</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Key Messages: Tailor Messages to Different Segments</h3><p>Your target audience may consist of different segments with varying needs and interests. Tailoring your messages to specific segments allows for more personalised and impactful communication. Identify the key messages that resonate with each segment and address their specific pain points or aspirations.</p><p>For instance, we tried a reverse approach to figure out our messaging strategy with the intent of receiving applications from our ideal target audience, i.e. - \u2018What don\u2019t we want people to perceive about us?\u2019 We then decided we didn\u2019t want to highlight that we are a \u2018free service\u2019 as a key message. We also did not think it would be wise to have messaging that competes with university resources.</p><h3>Emotional Appeal: Connect on an Emotional Level (carefully)</h3><p>Appealing to emotions can significantly influence attitudes and behaviours. Consider how your messaging can evoke emotions that align with your organisation's mission and resonate with your target audience. Use storytelling techniques to create narratives that evoke emotions and illustrate the positive impact of your organisation's work. Using this approach sometimes seems risky or somewhat manipulative to me, so it is wise to present this in a way that isn't inauthentic or 'hides' important information and actually addresses concerns your audience may have.</p><p>For Effective Thesis, we wanted to invoke a sense of inspiration for our messaging to be more memorable and persuasive. We used inspiration from our own content pieces that we thought would promote that messaging, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/how-can-research-change-the-world/\"><u>this one</u></a>.</p><h3>Test and Refine: Iterate Based on Feedback</h3><p>Regularly gather feedback on your messaging to understand its effectiveness and make improvements. Conduct surveys, collect user feedback, and analyse the response to your messaging efforts. This feedback loop allows you to iterate and refine your messaging based on real-world data and insights. Continuously monitor and adjust your messaging to ensure it remains relevant and resonates with your target audience.</p><p><strong>How we defined our target audience better</strong></p><p>At Effective Thesis, an important consideration for us was to segment and prioritise our audience since our services were applicable to undergraduate, master's and PhD students worldwide. Some initial ideas about our ideal audience:</p><ul><li>We wanted to reach students who would become good researchers/were considering a research career<ul><li>Since we\u2019re also reaching out to undergraduate students, looking for research foundations students apply to was a starting point, along with knowing where considering research is a popular career path.</li></ul></li><li>We wanted to reach talented students&nbsp;<ul><li>These may not always be at prestigious universities, but it\u2019s more likely we find students who are talented at top 100 universities, so our focus was to reach top research-based universities across the world.</li></ul></li><li>We wanted to reach the students we could help <i>most</i> (those who would have otherwise not considered a thesis or research in one of our recommended topics)<ul><li>Being members of the EA community is anti-correlated with this because people in EA are much more likely to hear about these problems from other sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>Due to some of these ideas, we decided it would be good to answer:</p><ul><li>What are the traits of good researchers&nbsp;<ul><li>To do this, we reached out to promising students we coached previously, along with senior researchers to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GlBXZtQGypDBYPZZq70ng_4bI6WdFuHYbl77WZFAWGs/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>study and interview them</u></a> to find out more about these traits. We were only able to speak to people who mildly/considerably engaged with EA, so the results of these are quite skewed.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Where do we find talented students globally and how do we reach them (specifically non-EA students)<ul><li>We reached out to knowledgeable individuals and researchers from ~23 different countries to find out about top universities, what programs existed for talented students there and any communities we could reach out to and created the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_hVMeZJUg1e6O9C3IMwzLN6sLL2_bC-bmE3Mdn-6jIQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>country diversity database</u></a>. This is a non-exhaustive list and we\u2019re unable to share any contact information for outreach, but it could be extremely useful for others with similar target audiences to take a look at.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Messaging strategies we used&nbsp;</strong></h3><ol><li>Choosing&nbsp;<strong>inspiration:&nbsp;</strong>We ran a set of campaigns focused on messaging that encouraged students to find a thesis topic that \u2018inspired\u2019 them. The idea behind this was because most undergrad/masters students think of their thesis as just another project (anecdotal evidence from talking to many students and university group leaders) and not as something very valuable for their career. Since we want students to get and give more value out of their thesis, we think an avenue that would excite them is to be inspired by the results of their own work.&nbsp;</li><li>Solving&nbsp;<strong>real-world problems:&nbsp;</strong>Similar to inspiration, some students get value out of not just stimulating their curiosity and building skills but also by working on issues that solve real-world problems. Since our ideal target group consists of students that are altruistic-leaning, we hoped this message would speak to them specifically.</li><li><strong>Academic success:</strong> We also ran a single campaign in parallel to 'choosing inspiration' and 'solving real-world problems'. This focused on students who care about academic success. We imagined that academically successful students were likely to make good researchers, and a percentage of them would also care about well-done research on their thesis that might help them later in their careers.</li><li>Direct, smaller subset of PhD students - calling out to<strong> ambitious PhD students</strong>:<br>We also experimented with a set of ads for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/phd-coaching/\"><u>PhD coaching</u></a> made for students who self-identify as ambitious. This messaging had the risk of PhD candidates who may not think they\u2019re ambitious enough, or work on problems that seemed too difficult for them to pursue. This did not seem like a large risk due to the fact that PhD candidates are generally very committed to their work and already work on hard problems.</li><li>General coaching for all students -&nbsp;<strong>finding your fit/best topic for you</strong>:<br>A more general approach to talking about selecting a thesis and coaching, this messaging strategy leaned heavily on the fact that students want what is \u2018best suited\u2019 or \u2018well tailored\u2019 to their interests. By personalising our coaching, we\u2019re able to find impactful topics that are best for them.</li></ol><h3>Results</h3><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5tw2nLeXXf6K8b7Bb/tzgmdnatmvteislehlar\"></p><p>Looking at the click-through and conversion rates of these campaigns across Twitter and Facebook, we find that&nbsp;<u>the most effective messages are likely to be those that encourage students to find \u2018inspiration\u2019 in their topics and help them self-select themselves as \u2018ambitious\u2019</u>. We found the least promising avenue to be \u2018finding your fit\u2019, as it is too general, though this may just have a low click rate because the design was not as clean or good quality as some of the others.</p><p><i>Note: From these campaigns, other than the ones tailored to PhD students, we didn\u2019t send users to landing pages and sent them to our website instead, which isn\u2019t optimised for conversions. This is a large reason why the click and conversion rates are not as high as they could have been.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xwJEpopGEOuc1quUGsmHitSbCrxcVerIdANE5PPIUQM/edit?usp=sharing\"><i>Full keyword and messaging report here.</i></a></p><h2>Selecting the right channels</h2><p>After defining the target group and learning more about audience behaviour and where they spend their time, the next step would be to select channels based on audience reach, relevance, communication objectives, budget and resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Through the audience research phase and learnings from previous outreach attempts by Effective Thesis, I selected a mix of channels for marketing to reach students that seemed most promising.&nbsp;</p><h3>Email outreach</h3><p>From our audience research, we created an outreach database with contact information and categories that could potentially help us promote Effective Thesis to students. These included: research coordinators at Universities, scholarship and research foundations, student clubs, EA groups and influencers.</p><p><strong>Why this seemed promising</strong></p><p>Instead of only reaching out to individuals, we thought to maximise our outreach by reaching out to \u2018nodes\u2019 within (and outside of) the university environments. Our main goal was to reach out to individuals with high credibility and/or trust within these systems in a way that would be a low effort for them to do and would encourage groups of students to seriously consider applying for Effective Thesis services.&nbsp;</p><p>Eg. Theoretically, students would be much more likely to regard an email forwarded from their program or research coordinator than they would if they were sent an email by a nonprofit they have never heard of before, assuming they open it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Process</strong></p><p>A large part of this was reaching out by cold-emailing to ask contacts to share our digital flyer, highlighting coaching as our primary service. I would send out ~3 personalised emails per contact (including follow-ups). We maintained a comprehensive AirTable with information about each contact and dates they were reached out to.&nbsp;</p><p>For research coordinators, I tried different strategies promoting Effective Thesis as a resource to support talented students that included highlighting either 1-1 coaching, our research topics, workshops (we were running a reasoning transparency workshop at the time) or specifically, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/effective-thesis-award/\"><u>Exceptional Research Award</u></a>.<br><br>For student clubs other than EA groups, I focused on general societies across top research universities (AISEC, students interested in social work etc.) along with cause-specific clubs (like AI societies, biological sciences, and philosophy clubs) that I was able to find.&nbsp;</p><p>For all other types of outreach emails, we would send out a summary of what Effective Thesis does and ask to share an email or ask for a shoutout in exchange for cross-promotion. This process was iterated several times based on results from experimenting with messaging, subject lines, the product/service and the content of the email.</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>I sent out 323 emails, focusing on research coordinators at Universities, student groups (both EA and non-EA societies) and influencers. Out of these, the highest results for emails shared came from student groups (EA) and student societies.&nbsp;</p><p>Student clubs were happiest to share what Effective Thesis did and generally responded quicker than all other categories of contacts we tried to reach out to.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that the scholarship and research foundations we reached out to were mostly those we had contacted previously, some of whom had agreed to share our emails in the past. We sent similar messaging that worked previously, however, this time we didn't receive any responses.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p><strong>Channel Type</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p><strong>Number of contacts approached</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p><strong>Conversion rate (%age that agreed to share our advert)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>Foundations/Scholarships</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>14</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>Research Opportunity</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>17</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>11.76%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>Student Group/Society</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>189</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>16.4%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>Specific Course/University</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>52</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>11.53%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>Influencer</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>47</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>4.25%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>Other</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>3</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #9e9e9e;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><i>Channels used for Effective Thesis outreach and their conversion rates</i></p><p><strong>Learnings</strong><i>&nbsp;</i></p><ul><li>If you\u2019re asking for a favour virtually from someone who isn\u2019t aware of your org, it\u2019s probably best to make it extremely easy for them to say yes. Sharing email and social media templates that people could use (instead of asking them to reach out to people where they would need to add their own message) resulted in more people sharing our advert.&nbsp;</li><li>Emails can be automatically forwarded to the \u2018promotions\u2019 tab. At some point in the process, someone pointed out that my Effective Thesis emails were shown in their&nbsp;<u>promotions</u> instead of the&nbsp;<u>primary</u> tab (in Gmail). After some research, I found out that may be due to sending emails with a large number of links and using words like \u2018apply\u2019 or \u2018sign up\u2019.</li><li>Networking in academia helped. In reaching out to a specific university coordinator, only those through a personal connection agreed to share our advert.</li><li>Reaching out to professors we didn\u2019t know seemed risky \u2013 on one hand, if they were sympathetic to EA causes, they would share the word about Effective Thesis with their researchers. On the other, we could cause some harm if we reached out to academics who weren't sympathetic to EA and wouldn't appreciate us influencing their students on their thesis topics. Owing to this, I only reached out to University academics directly less than a handful of times and they were happy to share our message (in one case we received a <i>very</i> negative response).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Using tracking links: One large error was not using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/settings/how-do-i-create-a-tracking-url\"><u>tracking links</u></a> on many of the initial emails or digital flyers. That made measuring the effectiveness of these emails nearly impossible.</li><li>Email outreach had higher conversion rates compared to most other channels, however, we eventually decided not to pursue it as:&nbsp;<ul><li>We didn\u2019t have a CRM and it was extremely time-consuming to research who the right person to reach out to was, personalise emails and follow up.</li><li>Tracking is hard. In many cases, people&nbsp;<i>agreed&nbsp;</i>to share the email and confirmed they would, but we didn\u2019t find out whether that happened. We also don\u2019t know how&nbsp;<i>many&nbsp;</i>students ended up seeing our emails.</li><li>We received a few emails (&lt;10%) from research coordinators that they would not share what Effective Thesis does with students, as it conflicts with their faculties\u2019 responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p><p>I am fairly confident about recommending email outreach (whether it\u2019s cold outreach or newsletter marketing) for most orgs who want their audience to take some sort of action. For us, cold emails took a fair amount of time, however, were more effective in terms of conversion rates so I would recommend automating as much of this as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As for reaching out to influencers, <strong>I\u2019d highly recommend using an agency </strong>instead if you have the funds.</p><h3>Social media - Twitter and Facebook (ads)</h3><p><strong>Why these seemed promising</strong></p><ul><li>Academic Twitter is large, active and not a very crowded space for advertisements. Twitter also has features that allow you to target people based on who they follow. Through our audience research, we learned more about the influencers some of our audience is interested in.</li><li>Facebook also has an extremely large reach and was a common answer to the \u2018most used social media platform\u2019 question in our&nbsp;<i>initial</i> audience research.</li><li>Facebook and Twitter are cheaper than other large platforms. For context, here's the <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/how-much-do-social-media-ads-cost-on-facebook-instagram-twitter-and-linkedin/\"><u>average cost per click for each of the four major social media advertising platforms</u></a>:<ul><li>Twitter: $0.38</li><li>Facebook: $0.97</li><li>Instagram: $3.56</li><li>LinkedIn: $5.26</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Process</strong></p><p>We created campaigns based on location, targeting, and A/B tested with design and messaging. We focused primarily on promoting our primary service coaching, along with the more recently launched Future Researchers Newsletter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>We ran short campaigns (between 2 weeks - 2 months), and had a small budget to run these. We spent a total of $2370 on social media ads that resulted in 132 conversions, making the cost per acquisition ~$18. The results below are from long-running ads (not including promotion of a post or tweet). These weren't strong results overall, looking at conversion rates alone compared to other campaigns, especially for coaching. I think this might have gone differently if we used a different approach or service to promote.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Campaign</strong></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Average CPC</strong></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Average cost per acquisition</strong></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Average conversion rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Facebook - newsletter</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>$0.11</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>$8</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>4.36%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Facebook - coaching</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>$0.48</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>$17</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>0.29%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Twitter - coaching</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>$0.32</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>$31.70</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>1.30%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Twitter - PhD coaching</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>$0.17</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>$31.25</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>0.53%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;<strong>Learnings</strong></p><ul><li>On both Twitter and Facebook, when not defining a specific location, the campaigns would automatically reach more people in APAC than Europe and USA.</li><li>We found the campaigns we ran for longer periods (1 month+) performed significantly better than shorter campaigns.</li><li>The results from these campaigns did not seem promising enough to promote coaching - we observed that through ads, people were hesitant to sign up for coaching but more inclined to sign up for our newsletter or something low-effort, since coaching requires them to research and fill out a form. This pattern emerged across different channels, and we decided instead to take a longer approach to familiarise students with Effective Thesis and launched the Future Researchers (now Topic Discovery) Newsletter.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p><p>I am not confident that Facebook/Twitter ads are the best channels for reaching a \u2018quality\u2019 audience for a high-fidelity service (like coaching) since the space is extremely crowded and attention spans are short. These channels seem better for quick sign-up services (like a newsletter) or awareness if you have a large budget that exists to share valuable information and encourage nudges to engage with other parts of your org.</p><p>Additionally, if you\u2019re running ads on these channels, you should probably invest a little time in organically growing your account.&nbsp;</p><h3>GoogleAds Grant</h3><p><strong>Why this seemed promising</strong></p><p>GoogleAds has extensive reach, is intent-based and uses keyword targeting, which can be especially useful if the keyword research stage produces promising results. Additionally, for nonprofits this is especially cost-effective since Google awards a $10,000 USD/month grant to run these ads.</p><p><i>Read:</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cPCra34aCGrYzKcDF/opinion-digital-marketing-is-under-utilized-in-ea\"><u>Digital marketing is under-utilized in EA</u></a></p><p><strong>Process</strong></p><ol><li>Since setting up a GoogleAds grant, we promoted our home page, research directions, advice, funding database and potential supervisors database.&nbsp;</li><li>Since (other than our research directions) these were not our primary services, I decided to promote only coaching and our opportunities newsletter - which seemed most promising as it has the lowest bar to sign up and has the potential for impact through open opportunities.</li><li>I generally preferred to use keywords with low to medium competition and high volume for short-tail keywords.</li><li>I used short-tail keywords with lots of search volume like \u2018thesis topics\u2019 and long-tail keywords like \u2018thesis to improve the world\u2019, which had less volume but a narrower intent.</li><li>I checked in on my campaigns each week to add or remove keywords that were performing well.</li><li>I bid keywords based on results from the keyword planner and initially bid on keywords slightly higher than the average bid. After a week or two of learning, I automatically switched my campaign to \u2018Maximise Conversions\u2019.&nbsp;</li><li>Based on the results, I started to exclude popular keywords related to keywords like \u2018thesis writing service\u2019, which were automatically added by Google but were not intent-relevant.

A significant portion of our total conversions came from GoogleAds from all outreach efforts. The lowest conversions from these ads, as previously expected, was applying for coaching. We received the highest conversion rate and highest number of people who signed up for our newsletter, however, the impact and quality of those sign-ups is uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Campaign</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>CTR</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Conversion rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Coaching &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>10.68% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>0.30%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Newsletter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>8.57% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>5.90%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Content</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>6.43% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>3.71%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Learnings</strong></p><ul><li>Running worldwide campaigns (not targeted to a specific location) may pose the risk of \u2018low quality\u2019 customers, the more specific the targeting, mixed in with high volume and high intent keywords, the better.

There are several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gettingattention.org/google-ad-grants-limitations/\"><u>restrictions</u></a> on bidding, ad type and daily spends.&nbsp;</li><li><i>Recommendation</i>: GoogleAds Grants is a good experiment to invest in for 3-6 months, and should give you a clear picture of whether the results look promising. However, it might not work for all types of campaigns or products/services that require action that has a higher bar than signing up. Test for quick signing up and content (where you have built a good pipeline for further engagement). &nbsp;</li></ul><h3><br>Online sessions with EA groups - introduction to impactful research</h3><p>We ran ~1 hour sessions on \u2018<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j5LhhAmLV1jYgGMGz1x4uFP0FWUeE8GmO_6RbKKp_44/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Changing the world with your research</u></a>\u2019 which consisted of introducing EA student group members to Effective Thesis and possible ways of thinking about using your thesis as a path to impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why this seemed promising</strong></p><p>Students attending these virtual sessions would likely be interested in or familiar with our recommended research directions. We also presumed that reaching out to EA group leaders and setting up these sessions would contribute to a part of their outreach efforts, as a way to encourage students to do applied work in EA cause areas.</p><p><strong>Process</strong></p><p>This part was simple. I reached out to EA group leaders, met to find out about when students typically start thinking about their thesis and coordinated a date and time. Initially, the process was rough but we created a structured communications pipeline that allowed us to track applications better and encourage attendees to take action.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>We ran 8 virtual sessions, with a total of ~112 attendees. There is a non-insignificant margin of error on the number of attendees (likely -/+10-15%) as we ran a portion of these sessions with students attending group meetings together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Out of the 112 attendees, we received ~33 sign ups</strong> for at least one service, making the conversion rate ~30%, the highest of any other outreach activity. We also did not track initial events diligently, so this rate is likely higher.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learnings</strong></p><ul><li><i>&nbsp;</i>Have a robust communications plan around events. We learned it is important to have everyone register before the event, create a sharable digital poster, content templates for group leaders, reminder emails, calendar invites and clear next steps sent soon after the event (within 24 hours).</li><li>We did not receive many sign-ups from the 2 events which were scheduled around student exams; we also did not share emails for next steps directly with students for these 2 events which made it difficult to track whether attendees signed up.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Influencer Marketing</h3><p><strong>Why this seemed promising</strong></p><ul><li>High trust: Similar to email outreach for university coordinators, influencers with relevant, high-quality content and an engaged audience can reach their followers through one campaign for which trust is already built.&nbsp;</li><li>Content for most formats (videos, blogs and podcasts) usually helps SEO through backlinking.</li><li>We received a shoutout from a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OajDpnH4Iuw\"><u>video by a YouTube content creator</u></a> with high relevance to our content and received a steady, though small stream of applications from this video over 7-8 months.&nbsp;</li><li>Authenticity and relatability: By integrating brands into their content organically, influencer marketing allows for a more authentic and relatable promotion. This approach helps overcome ad fatigue to some extent.</li><li>Market insights and feedback: collaborating with influencers can provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, trends, and feedback on your product or service. This feedback loop can help refine your campaigns and overall strategy.</li></ul><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>We targeted small-medium sized influencers (3-100k followers) on Twitter, along with a podcast and ran a total of 5 paid campaigns. Our total spend was ~$900, which resulted in a cost per acquisition of $17.3 and a conversion rate between 2-6%.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a significant error of margin on these results as 2 out of 5 campaigns ran on Twitter which had a glitch that showed inaccurate numbers for these campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learnings</strong></p><ul><li><i>&nbsp;</i>Influencer agencies: Without using an agency that could connect us to influencers directly, this was an extremely long and arduous process. I would recommend looking into this if influencers are likely to be a part of your marketing strategy.</li><li>Progressive overload: Running longer/bigger subsequent campaigns with the same influencers resulted in more traffic, clicks and conversions.</li><li>Micro-influencers might be happy to promote your organisation for cross-promotion. Look for relevant influencers (for us, these were students who would share study and research tips). In our case, it usually took ~3 months to get a response to our original email, so accounting for time while planning this is important.&nbsp;</li><li>Sponsorship and collaboration are two different things - we attempted to co-create content with medium-sized influencers which led to very long feedback loops and resulted in the collaboration never happening.</li></ul><h3><strong>Channels we did not select that seemed promising&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><strong>SEO</strong></p><p>&nbsp;SEO (search engine optimization) is the process of optimising a website and its content to improve its visibility and rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal of SEO is to increase organic traffic to a website by making it more relevant and authoritative for search engines. This is usually done by creating relevant content, good UI/UX (including page speed) and link popularity which tells search engines how many other relevant websites with higher domain authority have linked to this one.</p><p><i>Why it\u2019s promising</i></p><ul><li>Increase in organic traffic: an increase in organic traffic has a higher probability of converting, as users tend to find you vs you reaching them.</li><li>Long-term visibility: unlike paid ads which stop being visible once the budget runs out, SEO is a more sustainable solution that produces results after initially working on optimization.&nbsp;</li><li>Cost Effective: SEO actually adds value to your stakeholders and brand, even if initial setup and content strategy costs more, it\u2019s likely much more cost-effective in the long-term.</li><li>At Effective Thesis, we observed that users who were visiting our website were mostly one of the top sources for those who spent longest on the website. This indicated that users who visited our website from other web pages found our content relevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>Why we (mostly) decided against it&nbsp;</i></p><p>Note: we did invest a little time in improving the UI/UX of our website, creating better meta-descriptions for pages that did rank. Like our thesis topics page, which now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=thesis+topics\"><u>ranks #3 on Google search (as of July 2023).</u></a></p><ul><li>Highly competitive keywords: our relevant keywords were mostly rated against universities and content-heavy educational websites. We didn\u2019t think there was a high chance of ranking above more resource-intensive sites.&nbsp;</li><li>Our domain authority (DA) was already too low: our DA score was already pretty low, and ranking for highly competitive keywords needed significantly more resources and a larger focus on content.</li><li>Didn\u2019t align with short-term goals.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>YouTube/video ads</strong></p><p>I have low confidence that it was a good strategy to not have YouTube ad campaigns even if we didn\u2019t have our own YouTube channel or original video content.</p><p><i>Why it\u2019s promising</i></p><ul><li>Very refined targeting</li><li>Higher chance of brand recall through video&nbsp;</li><li>Students who may not be active on social media channels we target will still likely use YouTube</li><li>There is lot of educational content on YouTube&nbsp;</li><li>Video ads can be more engaging than text/image-only ads</li></ul><p><i>Why we decided against it&nbsp;</i></p><ul><li>Limited time and resources</li><li>Lack of presence or video content resources on YouTube</li></ul><p><br><strong>Reddit</strong></p><p><i>Why it\u2019s promising</i></p><ul><li>Target group: Advertising on Reddit could be valuable due to subreddits related to Academia that are closely related to the kind of services we offer.</li><li>Active engagement: Users on these subreddits are generally quite active and engage with the platform for longer periods of time. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/website/reddit.com/#ranking\"><u>average engagement time for the US is over 8 minutes</u></a>, and being a primarily text-based platform (though gifs and images are common), it is better placed than Instagram or Facebook for reading.</li><li>Cost-effective: Reddit ads are some of the cheapest compared to other large platforms.</li></ul><p><i>Why we decided against it&nbsp;</i></p><ul><li>Reddit users are known to dislike ads - I\u2019m not 100% confident about this, but I have seen across many subreddits that self-promotion (or any kind of promotion) is banned.</li><li>Limited resources - in order to advertise on Reddit, it seemed important to also grow an organic following by answering questions acting as a thesis or academic expert. This takes up significantly more time than simply advertising and would require coaches input who were otherwise engaged in 1:1 coaching, which seemed more important.</li><li>Brand dilution - I was unsure how the brand\u2019s reputation might come across by advertising on reddit, since it is a more casual platform with much less regulation than other platforms.</li></ul><p><br><strong>PR</strong> <strong>(Public Relations)</strong></p><p><i>Why it\u2019s promising</i></p><ul><li>Builds credibility and awareness: PR efforts could help establish us as a trusted authority in academia by securing media coverage, guest speaking opportunities, or byline articles in relevant publications.</li><li>Targeted outreach: By targeting specific educational publications, or online platforms that cater to students or research coordinators, we may reach a broader audience to be aware of Effective Thesis.&nbsp;</li><li>Human storytelling: this gives an opportunity to share the stories and experiences of students who may have benefited from coaching or other services that are more difficult to capture while advertising on a limited budget.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>Why we decided against it&nbsp;</i></p><p>Note: Consequently, I am of the opinion that we should have spent more time building out a PR strategy as high credibility is important when reaching out to coordinators within academia and building awareness.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Initial focus on students in the EA community: we were initially focused on reaching EA channels that seemed more accessible.</li><li>We didn\u2019t have events or our own research to share, so producing a continuous stream of content for PR might have had to be paid.</li><li>We did a cheap test that didn\u2019t go well: We ran an article in an online educational news channel and though we received a lot of traffic, the conversion rate was low and the CPA was the highest out of all the channels we tried.&nbsp;</li><li>Uncertain results: PR outcomes can be more difficult to measure and quantify compared to advertising or marketing campaigns. While media coverage and exposure are valuable, it can be challenging to directly attribute specific outcomes, such as an increase in coaching, solely to PR efforts.</li><li>Resource intensive: PR requires time, effort, and sometimes financial resources to develop compelling stories, build relationships with media outlets, and pitch ideas.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br><strong>LinkedIn (advertising)</strong></p><p><i>Why it\u2019s promising</i></p><ul><li>Context relevance. Though we can find our target group on other platforms, LinkedIn shares more relevance with regard to career, education and impact than others. When browsing LinkedIn, users seek something more valuable or purpose-driven to them than they would on, say, Instagram.&nbsp;</li><li>Targeting specific Universities was possible. We could target Masters, Undergrad and PhD students specifically according to their programs.</li><li>Higher conversion rates: From having previously run ads on LinkedIn, I found that conversion rates were better than on Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>Why we decided against it&nbsp;</i></p><p>Note: if given more time or we were running more virtual events, I would have likely run ads on LinkedIn as they have performed much better for similar campaigns I have run in the past.</p><ul><li>LinkedIn ads are more expensive than Facebook or Twitter, though having run ads previously for larger organisations, they can be more effective.</li><li>Our page on LinkedIn wasn\u2019t yet as active or built out as Facebook or Twitter - we felt we needed more visibility and content on our LinkedIn before advertising.</li></ul><h2>Additional learnings from outreach and marketing</h2><p><strong>Google Analytics&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Analytics plays a critical part in understanding user behaviour. Google Analytics delivers insights not only into these behaviours but also into website performance and audience characteristics. It can be somewhat overwhelming to use at first, but simple enough to learn. I highly recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.analyticsmania.com/\"><u>Analytics Mania</u></a> to learn more about GA4 if you\u2019re new to it.</p><p>Our reports usually contained what our most popular pages were, where a lot of the users were coming from (paid ads, social media, emails, referrals etc.), how long they were engaging with the website, and which one of them was likely to sign up for a service.</p><p>Some ways to use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) well:</p><ul><li><strong>Set up tracking for all channels</strong>: tracking involves the use of tracking codes, pixels or other technologies to gather information about user actions, such as page views, clicks, conversions, or interactions with specific elements on a website.&nbsp;<br><a href=\"https://ga-dev-tools.google/ga4/campaign-url-builder/ \"><i>I usually use this simple tool for UTM tracking.</i></a></li><li><strong>Start with simple metrics</strong>: views, users, sources of traffic, engagement time and popular pages is a good place to start. Depending on your goals and website, you can build on these and create user flows.</li><li><strong>Make sure your conversions are set up:&nbsp;</strong>If you\u2019re using a tool for people to submit their information, like signing up for a newsletter, ensure it\u2019s being accounted for by doing a live test in Google Tag Manager. We initially faced difficulties setting up conversions, as we used Jotform and GA4 wouldn\u2019t count it as a conversion directly. Using Google Tag Manager, we set up conversions to be counted when people submitted a form that would redirect them to a \u2018Thank you\u2019 page.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Using exploration:&nbsp;</strong>Using free forms in Google Analytics, we were able to find out how many people spent over 5 and 15 minutes on our website as we consider them to be highly engaged. We were also able to track the flow of user behaviour using path exploration, i.e. which pages were visited in which order once people visited a specific page on the site.

Earlier on, our logo was closely EA-related (lightbulb + graduation hat). We didn\u2019t think it was needed any longer, especially now that we were reaching out to students unfamiliar with EA. It was extremely helpful to find logo design long and challenging, as questions about&nbsp;<i>what we wanted to be perceived as</i>, also helped us ask questions about&nbsp;<i>who we are</i>.</p><p>The process of creating a logo for Effective Thesis was, again,&nbsp;<i>long</i> and we tried different things:</p><ol><li>Having a contest for our logo: This didn\u2019t work. I received feedback that designers didn\u2019t appreciate taking time to submit their work for relatively small prizes (unlike writing submissions)&nbsp;</li><li>Worked with a design agency: with multiple rounds of feedback and short timelines (we wanted to launch our logo at an EA conference), we realised we didn\u2019t really like the work and more revisions were very expensive.</li><li>Finally, we worked with a freelance designer whose work we liked, and we would also get revisions and feedback incorporated fairly quickly.</li></ol><p><i>Why did it take us so many tries to figure out the \u2018right\u2019 logo? &nbsp;</i><br>We hadn\u2019t defined our value proposition or target group sharply yet. Though I still don\u2019t think our logo is perfect, since we\u2019ve somewhat iterated our strategy a few times in the past year; but the process of having a logo designed helped us dive deeper into our value proposition, with some prompts like:</p><ul><li>What do we want our logo to convey?</li><li>How important is our logo vs our name (which is self-explanatory)?</li><li>What are we trying to achieve with our logo? (memorability, legitimacy etc.)</li><li>What are some key emotions, thoughts or associations we want it to invoke?</li><li>What are some key emotions we already invoke? How can we tie that in with the aspirational brand we want to be?&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>If you have been through the process of logo design and found it frustrating, it\u2019s likely you need to work through initial branding questions more.</i>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Switching from promoting coaching to launching the Future Researchers Newsletter (now called the Topic Discovery digest)</strong></p><p>We saw from running ads that there was higher resistance to people signing up for our primary service i.e. coaching than there was to newsletters, workshops and virtual information sessions. In theory, that made a lot of sense - applying for coaching is a more cognitively demanding and time-consuming process.

Additionally, we were likely reaching students even when they weren\u2019t thinking about their thesis; we needed an introduction or \u2018warm up\u2019 to Effective Thesis while staying salient.</p><p>We decided to bridge that gap by directing people to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/da3877008b7d/future-researchers-newsletter-april-edition\"><u>Future Researchers Newsletter</u></a> for students to sign up and receive thesis topic inspiration, advice and tools they might find useful for academic (or other) work.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Preliminary Results from the Future Researchers newsletter</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p><strong>Level of engagement of subscribers</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p><strong>Open Rate</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p><strong>Click Rate</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>No to mild engagement with EA</p></td><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>41%</p></td><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>5.10%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>Considerably engaged with EA</p></td><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>75%</p></td><td style=\"border:0.416667pt solid #000000;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>16%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>We launched this in April, with subscribers receiving 4 weekly emails to \u2018onboard\u2019 them and ~2 newsletters a month.

That may be oversimplifying for the differences between causes, timing or objectives but it\u2019s likely that there is a large overlap in marketing efforts.&nbsp;<br><br>Some uncertainties I have are around the counterfactual impact of one org reaching these students than the other and that it doesn\u2019t seem very efficient to be competing. It also doesn\u2019t seem like an answer as simple as \u2013 the org with the most resources and historically positive impact is the best choice to promote their service.</p><p>Some ways to solve for this overlap can be to:</p><ul><li>Coordinate marketing strategies&nbsp;</li><li>Clarify specialisation and differentiation</li><li>Encourage cross-promotion&nbsp;</li><li>Evaluate the impact of outreach/marketing publicly (eg. the forum)</li></ul><p>It\u2019s likely that there will be more EA orgs reaching out to the same people, and it\u2019s probably not bad if people are more aware of them, but for smaller budgets and more efficiency, coordination and cross-promotion seem like good things to do.</p><h3><strong>Defining audiences through targeted metrics</strong></h3><p><i>Confidence level: low&nbsp;</i></p><p>While it\u2019s a good bet that talented students from Top 100 Universities around the world are more likely to become impactful researchers, I\u2019m concerned that only using these (and related) metrics to reach out to students from prestigious programs is not&nbsp;the <i>most impactful</i>. We may miss reaching out to those students who need the most support in writing their thesis on a pressing problem.&nbsp;On the other hand, I agree that if we're optimising for the most talented students, the probability of finding them at these universities is quite high.&nbsp;<br><br>As a way to diversify outreach, we ran virtual sessions across newer and LMIC groups for visibility, though this was done on a small scale and thinking about this more intentionally could be valuable.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Quality vs. quantity: is a broad funnel the best thing?</strong></h3><p><i>Confidence level: medium</i></p><p>Initially, it made sense to broaden our outreach across locations, degree levels and channels but by applying the power law, we have enough information from previous outreach that allows us to reach a smaller, better-suited audience. I\u2019m uncertain whether we will saturate this space if we optimise for a narrow pipeline vs a broad funnel over the long term.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if we were to look at our previous high-quality applications, most of them came from within EA and through word of mouth, which has diminishing returns since they are more likely to work on EA causes anyway and our counterfactual impact decreases.</p><p>My best guess is to set up channels (like GoogleAds for us, Influencer outreach) that somewhat automate the broad funnel and focus the rest of the outreach capacity on more targeted, narrow audiences.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hitting the ground running&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><i>Confidence level: medium</i></p><p>For a small org with YoY funding rounds, you\u2019re encouraged to hit the ground running by starting marketing activities right away. This can be both good and bad. In retrospect, I might have spent more time carefully scoping our previous data, reaching out to coordinators at Universities and selecting only 2 to 3 most impactful channels.</p><p>I\u2019m still uncertain as I see some benefits to hitting the ground running for others and myself:</p><ul><li>Short-term impact: By quickly immersing yourself in marketing activities, you have the potential to make an immediate positive impact on the organisation.&nbsp;</li><li>Faster learning curve: Engaging from the start allows you to learn the intricacies of the job and the organisation more rapidly. It enables you to gain hands-on experience and understand the nuances of your target audience and industry.</li><li>\u2018Visible\u2019 impact: with limited funding and needing to see quick results, the right experiments lead to more visible impact as you have data you can showcase. Scoping work is not as \u2018visibly\u2019 impactful in the short-term.</li><li>Building relationships: Being proactive and diving into marketing early on can help you establish relationships with colleagues, stakeholders, and clients. This can lead to better collaboration, increased trust, and a stronger support network as you progress in your role.</li><li>Time-sensitive opportunities: Taking immediate action allows you to capitalise on time-sensitive opportunities, such as upcoming events or seasonal campaigns.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Even with these benefits, there are some considerations for caution:</p><ul><li><i>Understanding context</i>: While it's essential to be proactive, it's equally crucial to grasp the organisation's theory of change and mission before making significant marketing decisions. Taking time to assess the existing strategies, gather insights, and aligning with the orgs goals ensures a more informed and effective approach.</li><li><i>Building thoughtful relationships</i>: While building relationships is important and is probably easier to do within the EA community, it's essential to approach it with care. Rushing into collaborations without understanding the dynamics can be ineffective.&nbsp;</li><li><i>Balancing longterm strategy and short-term wins</i>: While hitting the ground running can yield quick wins, it's crucial to maintain a balance between short-term tactics and long-term strategic planning. Focusing solely on immediate results may sacrifice the development of a robust marketing strategy that aligns with long-term objectives.</li></ul><p>I think people starting out new outreach should invest more time scoping the landscape, and if it\u2019s also important to start executing quickly, start small with the most promising (and previously proven) strategies if possible.</p><h3>Organic social media effectiveness</h3><p><i>Confidence level: high</i></p><p>I\u2019ll keep this brief - I\u2019m unconvinced by organic social media (not ads or collaborations) being an effective tool for outreach, and recommend spending 5-10% of an outreach manager\u2019s time or budget to invest in building social media&nbsp;<i>unless</i> a large output of the org rests on building and sharing content. It still makes sense to have a presence on social media to build legitimacy and for SEO, but it\u2019s very unlikely much of your impact comes from posting on social media alone.<br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnisi6nruglo8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefisi6nruglo8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257342552_Effectiveness_of_Mission_Statements_in_Organizations_-_A_Review\">A study by Fogel and Nut</a> (2017) found that clarity of mission positively influences an organization's reputation and funding outcomes</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fni37fizzlddh\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefi37fizzlddh\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Wymer, Walter &amp; Gross, Hellen &amp; Helmig, Bernd.

Instead of maximizing, they randomly choose from a few of the most effective possible actions:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31529c1b-5fac-4361-9357-a939ab77dbc3_1452x1010.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31529c1b-5fac-4361-9357-a939ab77dbc3_1452x1010.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31529c1b-5fac-4361-9357-a939ab77dbc3_1452x1010.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31529c1b-5fac-4361-9357-a939ab77dbc3_1452x1010.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31529c1b-5fac-4361-9357-a939ab77dbc3_1452x1010.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31529c1b-5fac-4361-9357-a939ab77dbc3_1452x1010.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>They work like this:</p><ol><li>Start with a goal, and a set of possible actions</li><li>Predict how useful each action will be for achieving the goal</li><li>Rank the actions from the most to the least useful</li><li>Pick randomly from the highest fraction only (i.e, the top 10%)</li></ol><p>This avoids cases where the AI chooses extreme actions to maximize the goal. The AI chooses somewhat helpful actions instead.</p><p>It does leave one question \u2014 how do we make a list of possible actions in the first place? One suggestion is to ask a lot of humans to solve the task and train an AI to generate possible things it thinks humans would do. This list can then be used as an input to our quantilizer.</p><p>This does make them less effective, of course\u2014 firstly by picking less effective actions overall, and secondly by picking actions it thinks humans would take. But this might be worth the reduced risks\u2014 indeed, based on your risk tolerance, you can change the % of top actions the quantilizer will consider to make it more effective and riskier or vice versa.</p><p>So quantilizers trade some capability in exchange for greater safety, and avoid unintended consequences. They pick from lots of mild actions and very few extreme actions, so the chance of them doing something extreme or unexpected is miniscule.</p><p>Quantilizers are a proposed safer approach to AI goals. By randomly choosing from a selection of the top options, they avoid extreme behaviors that could cause harm. More research is needed, but quantilizers show promise as a model for the creation of AI systems that are beneficial but limited in scope. They provide an alternative to goal maximization, which can be dangerous, though they\u2019re just theoretical right now.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsmixvrb0gvj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsmixvrb0gvj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Humans care about an awful lot of different things, even just one human!</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "brook"}}, {"_id": "33o5jbe3WjPriGyAR", "title": "Announcing the Meta Coordination Forum 2023 ", "postedAt": "2023-09-10T17:00:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Continuing our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WLZabqQGCd2joZpxR/summit-on-existential-security-2023\"><u>efforts to be more transparent</u></a> about the events we organize, we want to share that we\u2019re running the Meta Coordination Forum 2023 (an invite-only event scheduled for late September in the Bay) and provide community members with the<strong> opportunity to give </strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4bKvDVwb7OxSuUfwOyx5_7pIXmuCTlDyWaVhZLgniH9g59g/viewform?usp=sf_link\"><strong>input via a pre-event survey</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Highlights</h3><ul><li><strong>Event Goal:&nbsp;</strong>Help key people working in meta-EA make better plans over the next two years to help set EA and related communities on a better trajectory.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiv2hq9rowkq\"><sup><a href=\"#fniv2hq9rowkq\">[1]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>Agenda:</strong><ul><li>Updates from subject-matter experts from key cause areas.</li><li>Discussions on significant strategic questions.</li><li>Clarification of project ownership and forming of actionable plans.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Attendees:</strong> A group of key people focused on meta / community-building work.&nbsp;<i>Not</i> focused on other key figures beyond the meta space.</li><li><strong>Organizing Team:</strong> The Partner Events team at CEA (Sophie Thomson, Michel Justen, and Elinor Camlin) is organizing this event, with Max Dalton and other senior figures in the meta space advising on strategy.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> We\u2019d like to hear your perspectives via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4bKvDVwb7OxSuUfwOyx5_7pIXmuCTlDyWaVhZLgniH9g59g/viewform\"><strong><u>a survey</u></strong></a> by&nbsp;<strong>11:59 PM PDT on Sunday, 17 September.&nbsp;</strong>The survey asks about the future of EA, the interrelation between EA and AI safety, and potential reforms in meta-EA projects.</li><li><strong>Post-Event:</strong> A summary of survey responses from the event will be made public to encourage wider discussion and reflection in the community.</li></ul><p>The event is a successor to past \u201cLeaders Forums\u201d and \u201cCoordination Forums\u201d but is also different in some important ways. For further details, please see the post below.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why we\u2019re running this event</h2><h3>Now seems like a pivotal time for EA and related communities</h3><p>The FTX crisis has eroded trust within and outside the EA community and highlighted some important issues. Also, AI discourse has taken off, changing the feasibility of various policy and talent projects. This means that now is an especially important time for various programs to reconsider their strategy.</p><h3>We think that more coordination and cooperation could help people doing meta work make better plans</h3><p>We think it could be useful for attendees to share updates and priorities, discuss group resource allocation, and identify ways to boost or flag any concerns they have with each other\u2019s efforts. (But we don\u2019t expect to reach total agreement or a single unified strategy.)</p><h2>What the event is and isn\u2019t</h2><p>We think it\u2019s important to try to give an accurate sense of how important this event is. We think it\u2019s easy for community members to overestimate its importance, but we\u2019re also aware that it might be in our interests to downplay its importance (thus inviting less scrutiny).</p><h3>The event will potentially shape the future trajectory and strategies of EA and related communities</h3><p>First, some ways in which the event is fairly important:</p><ul><li>It will bring together many important decision-makers in the meta-EA space (more on attendees below).</li><li>These people will be discussing topics that are important for EA\u2019s future, and discussions at the event might shape their actions.</li><li>The event aims to improve plans, and hopes that this leads to a better trajectory for EA and related communities.</li><li>The event may facilitate further trust and collaboration between this set of people, possibly further entrenching their roles (though we\u2019re also trying to be more careful about how much we limit this; see below).</li></ul><h3>The event will not foster unanimous decisions or a single grand strategy</h3><p>Some ways in which the event is less important:</p><ul><li>It is not a collective decision-making body: all attendees will make their own decisions about what they do. We expect that attendees will come in with lots of disagreements and will leave with lots of disagreements (but hopefully with better-informed and coordinated plans). This is how previous versions of this event have gone.</li><li>Relatedly, we are not hoping or expecting that we\u2019ll agree on a single grand strategy.</li><li>We think that many attendees have spent a long time thinking about these questions. We hope that they\u2019ll learn some new things and find opportunities to collaborate, but these will likely be second-order tweaks to their models and plans, with the main shape of their plans determined by work outside of the event.&nbsp;</li><li>It is only focused on the \u201cmeta\u201d/community-building space rather than object-level decisions in any cause area.</li></ul><h3>We don\u2019t want this event to slow down other efforts to build a better world&nbsp;</h3><p>While this event is aimed at improving the trajectories of EA and related communities, we think it will be very far from solving all of the problems that exist, and we support others trying to do other work that could help (e.g., running projects to address a problem they see, trying to coordinate important decision-makers). Please don\u2019t rely on this event for too much, and don\u2019t let it slow down any efforts you\u2019re considering to build a better world. Just because there are private discussions, don\u2019t assume that those private discussions will solve everything!</p><h2>What we\u2019re aiming to do with the event</h2><h3>Our Goal: Help key people working in meta\u2013EA make better plans over the next two years</h3><p>The event aims to help key people working in meta-EA make better plans over the next two years, to help set EA and related communities on a better trajectory.</p><h3>Our Strategy: Build shared context, discuss disputed strategy questions, clarify project ownership, and maintain professional relationships</h3><p>We\u2019re aiming to help key people working in meta-EA make better plans over the next two years by:</p><ol><li>Building shared context by syncing up about EA and its associated cause areas:<ol><li>Hosting expert presentations and Q&amp;As to discuss recent developments and field needs.</li><li>Generating reports on meta-EA topics such as the growth rates of key programs and data on program cost-effectiveness.</li></ol></li><li>Discussing disputed meta-EA strategy questions<ol><li>We\u2019re focusing discussions on significant yet tractable disagreements with direct implications for important decisions.&nbsp;</li><li>We\u2019re using a pre-event survey and memos to identify and draw out these disagreements.&nbsp;</li><li>We\u2019re not trying to reach agreement on big strategy questions. For many big strategy questions, we think that this is likely intractable, and it\u2019s often fine/good for people to pursue a variety of complementary strategies.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Clarifying who\u2019s owning which projects<ol><li>We\u2019re gathering a list of important projects through the pre-event survey, memos, and throughout the event.</li><li>Towards the end of the event, we\u2019ll host a session to rank, discuss, and assign ownership for highly-ranked proposals.&nbsp;</li><li>We\u2019ll share a list of unowned projects publicly so that people outside of the event know which projects might be good to pursue.</li></ol></li><li>Building professional relationships with calibrated trust<ol><li>While past events have emphasized trust-building, we want to take a balanced approach here. We want to help people to understand each other\u2019s goals, thinking, strengths, and weaknesses better so that they have a better sense of when and how to trust and coordinate with each other.</li><li>We think that this will be built throughout the event, especially in 1:1s and informal discussions.</li></ol></li></ol><h2>Who\u2019s attending the event</h2><p>We designed the attendee list in consultation with Claire Zabel and James Snowden, as well as suggestions from our initial invitees. Our objective was to assemble a group of attendees that is roughly representative of the meta work that is going on (e.g., in terms of the split between effective giving, EA principles, existential risk community building, etc.)</p><p>43 people working in EA meta are currently planning to attend the event. These include:</p><ul><li>Alexander Berger</li><li>Amy Labenz</li><li>Anne Schulze</li><li>Arden Koehler</li><li>Bastian Stern</li><li>Ben West</li><li>Buddy Shah</li><li>Caleb Parikh&nbsp;</li><li>Chana Messinger</li><li>Claire Zabel</li><li>Dewi Erwan</li><li>James Snowden</li><li>Jan Kulveit</li><li>Joey Savoie</li><li>Jonas Vollmer</li><li>Julia Wise</li><li>Kuhan Jeyapragasan</li><li>Lewis Bollard</li><li>Lincoln Quirk</li><li>Max Dalton</li><li>Max Daniel</li><li>Michelle Hutchinson</li><li>Nick Beckstead</li><li>Nicole Ross</li><li>Niel Bowerman</li><li>Oliver Habryka</li><li>Rob Gledhill</li><li>Sim Dhaliwal</li><li>Sjir Hoeijmakers</li><li>William MacAskill</li><li>Zach Robinson&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Note this isn\u2019t the full list; some people preferred not to be publicly listed.</p><h3>What the attendee list is not</h3><p><strong>This is not a canonical list of \u201ckey people working in meta EA\u201d or \u201cEA leaders.\u201d</strong> There are plenty of people who are not attending this event who are doing high-value work in the meta-EA space. We\u2019ve invited people for a variety of reasons: some because they are leaders of meta EA orgs or run teams within those orgs and so have significant decision-making power or strategic influence, and others because they have expertise or work for an organization that we think it could be valuable to learn from or cooperate with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Invitation to this event is not proof of trustworthiness.</strong> Post FTX, we want to make it especially clear that being an important player in EA doesn't guarantee a high degree of trustworthiness or endorsement from others. We value collaboration and learning among people, taking place in an environment of well-calibrated trust.</p><h2>How You Can Help</h2><p>We value the insights and perspectives of the community and understand that the event could influence decisions that impact some community members. So, we wanted to ask you to share your input through a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4bKvDVwb7OxSuUfwOyx5_7pIXmuCTlDyWaVhZLgniH9g59g/viewform\"><strong><u>brief survey</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>to inform and shape the discussions at the event&nbsp;<strong>(deadline: 11:59 PM PDT on Sunday, 17 September).</strong></p><p>Because we\u2019re in the final sprint of event planning, we will prioritize responding to comments that could influence the event, and our responses to other questions will be delayed.</p><h2>Updates Post-Event</h2><p>After the event, we plan to publish a summary of the survey responses and a list of unowned projects publicly (edit: see footnote<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefql9jpzb7o7o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnql9jpzb7o7o\">[2]</a></sup></span>). We will also encourage attendees to share their memos on the EA event and think about what other updates we can share that will aid transparency and coordination.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fniv2hq9rowkq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefiv2hq9rowkq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Two years is obviously a bit arbitrary, but feels like the right sort of time frame. We think that decisions made at the event will have an impact over months, but that relationship-building will have an impact over years (but especially the next couple of years, before turnover in leadership and weakening ties causes the effect to decrease).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnql9jpzb7o7o\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefql9jpzb7o7o\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>We\u2019ve decided to call off sharing the list of owned and unowned projects.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019ve shared an extensive <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/d32npjG3dv2oPXxbH\">summary of Meta Coordination Forum's pre-event survey</a>, and the cost-benefit for sharing this additional project list didn\u2019t look great. This is because: 1) The existing MCF recaps posted received relatively little attention, suggesting limited benefit; 2) sharing this post still requires significant work from the organisers to check in with project owners about what they\u2019re happy to share; 3) the organisers are currently very busy with another upcoming event. We wish we didn\u2019t have to drop this, but it seems like the best call.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Sophie Thomson"}}, {"_id": "ZwswpxAWMZ8F7CvtB", "title": "AMA: 80,000 Hours Career Advising Team", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T10:42:03.046Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>We\u2019re the 80,000 Hours Career Advising team, and you should ask us anything!&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>We are advisors at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/?int_campaign=2021-08__primary-navigation\"><u>80,000 Hours</u></a>!

We thought it might be helpful to give you some context.</p><h2><strong>Who can we help?</strong></h2><ul><li>We&nbsp;<strong>love</strong> when people form inside views on issues, and question ideas that don't make sense to them. So we encourage you to apply for advising even if you don't agree with everything on the 80k website.</li><li>However, we\u2019re most able to help people who are open to working on some of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\"><u>the top&nbsp;</u>problems we</a> list on our site, or something in a related area. We think most of our impact comes from helping people who end up working in these areas, and since they\u2019re the topics we focus on, our advice is best for applicants who could potentially take relevant career paths.</li><li>We\u2019re best able to help people who are mid or early career, with some idea of what they want to do, but open to changing directions and building new skills.

In other words, you can gain a lot of clarity on your career just by setting aside an hour to write down your answers to these questions, even without speaking to an advisor!</p><p>You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsMzMw7_YFYs0H7Ivreo2I7zMxqBgARAsb_-6UnBgzc/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>make a copy of our call prep doc</u></a> and fill it out now if you\u2019d like. (We won\u2019t be able to see your answers, this would be for your personal reflection.)</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>During the call</strong></h2><p>For people early in their career, we usually cover these topics:</p><ul><li>What is your current situation and default career path?</li><li>Let's take your skills/experience out of the picture completely and think about what the world needs.<ul><li>How do you think about choosing which pressing world problem to work on?</li><li>What qualities make these things problems?</li><li>What are your values, and how can your career align with them?</li></ul></li><li>Which of these problems would you be able to make progress on based on your personal aptitudes, existing skill sets, and interests?</li><li>Options?<ul><li>Long-run paths<ul><li>Which skills/experiences/career capital will help you do impactful work on problems you care about?</li><li>What kinds of work can you see yourself doing over the long term, how can you aim to do that, and how can you test your fit for certain kinds of roles?</li></ul></li><li>Immediate decisions<ul><li>Are you deciding between two options in the near future?

Right now, these five advisors are taking calls:</p><ul><li>I (Abigail Hoskin) have a PhD in psychology and neuroscience and can talk about paths into and out of academia.

She particularly enjoys discussing careers in biosecurity, biotech, or global health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, all of our advisors are equipped to talk with anybody about any career; you should book in with whoever is available when you are. We do not think our primary path to impact is giving extremely specific advice about getting into specific programs (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rJ9LBoSt9MvXJrbEf/how-to-apply-for-a-phd\"><u>how to apply for a PhD</u></a>). Instead, we believe our value comes from higher level advice, like building frameworks for how to make big decisions and helping identify misconceptions that may be holding you back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Things that usually don't happen on calls</strong></h2><ul><li>Career advisors do not usually help you with your resume, review cover letters, or do interview prep.<ul><li>We don\u2019t think this is our comparative advantage or how we add value. Many other advising firms provide these services.</li></ul></li><li>We are not hiring managers, and we cannot directly hire you for any jobs.</li><li>The trend here is that we\u2019re trying to help our advisees help the world, not help themselves win zero-sum competitions for roles. Our goal is to identify what you think is most important, think through what that means, and help sketch out careers that promote what you value based on your personal fit.</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>If in doubt, apply!</strong></h2><ul><li>If you get rejected from advising, you can always reapply. We won\u2019t consider it the least bit spammy if six months have gone by.&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>You should not update too much on getting rejected from advising. People get rejected for lots of reasons. For example, there are some people who are really cool who we just don\u2019t think are at the right place in their career for coaching, such as freshmen who would benefit more from reading the (free!)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/\"><u>80,000 Hours career guide</u></a> than speaking to a coach for half an hour.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Don't \"save\" your advising call until you feel \"ready\". It\u2019s better to let the advising team decide if we can add value on the margin. Your advisor can help you make your plan, and if the path you're on could be improved, it's best to get course correction sooner rather than later. You can also contact your advisor after your call if big decisions pop up later.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>Our advisees have a diverse set of backgrounds and perspectives.

Initially outlined by the late Harvard philosopher John Rawls in his 1971 treaty on liberalism as a political philosophy <i>A Theory Justice</i>, Rawlsianism starts out with a thought experiment.</p><p>Suppose one were to look behind a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d, one would not know their sex, nationality, race, economic status, etc., yet from a selfish point of view, one must restructure society, how would one do so? Rawls formulates two principles behind the veil of ignorance, which he defines here:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both:</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.</p><p>Rawls essentially takes a lexical minimum position beneath the veil, stating a Pareto efficient outcome holding that the welfare of the worst-off is appropriately maximized. Inequalities must not just improve the welfare of the worst-off, no, that could lead to classical liberalism or even libertarianism, instead, they shall only be justified if they maximize their well-being or some other criteria.</p><p>Rawlsianism is historically important because it is the first famous conception of liberalism as distributive justice using Kantian contractarian thinking and borrowing the veil of ignorance from utilitarian academics such as John Harsanyi. Indeed, whether or not Rawlsianism is the great contractarian moral theory or its significance in philosophy does not have much bearing on this first essay, instead, I shall focus on considerations to prescribe Rawlsian outcomes and policies to support that outcome.</p><h2>2. Considerations on the \u201cleast advantaged\u201d</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We can first ignore the first principle dictated by Rawls and focus on the second one, i.e. the difference principle, fundamentally one based on a desired normative outcome for greater economic equality. Let\u2019s start by defining some basic terms, consumption, saving, and their sum \u2014 income. Denoting them by the respective variables C, S, and I, we can define S as equal to C minutes I, getting the identity I = C + S.</p><p>When trying to define an outcome where we \u201cmaximize\u201d the \u201cbenefit\u201d of the \u201cleast advantaged\u201d, the simple thing to do would be to maximize the minimum utility, that is, apply a maximin rule behind the veil of ignorance. However, even assuming one has a cardinal utility function (which requires one\u2019s preferences to adhere to the von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern axioms of rational choice), this function is not interpersonally comparable nor is it one-to-one with one\u2019s preferences, making utilitarian numerical calculation essentially worthless.</p><p>To look for an outcome compatible with the difference principle, and the policies to maintain such an outcome, we further need to define who counts as the \u201cleast advantaged\u201d. For the sake of avoiding excruciating calculation, and given that the principle is fundamentally an economic one, we shall define them as those in some nth percentile of socioeconomic status, with n defined to be between 5 and 20 as a good heuristic for Rawlsian goals. Additionally, we need to define what one should use to define socioeconomic status (SES) whether it be consumption, income, or wealth. Since we already defined the first two, we shall now define wealth, which I simply state as net worth, i.e. assets minus liabilities.</p><p>There are quite a fair bit of problems with using this as our SES target. Imagine a scenario with two reasonably intelligent people, Lydia and Gwen, neither of whom has a utility function (notice keyword \u201cpeople\u201d). Lydia and Gwen are both employed, make the same annual income, and work equal hours, however, due to different preferences and other factors, Lydia saves a lot more than Gwen and ends up wealthier than her. Both have equivalent reported rates of life satisfaction and well-being, however, Rawlsian principles (assuming wealth in place of utility), which fundamentally ought to be Kantian in nature, dictate some redistribution from Lydia to Gwen, which could arguably violate Kant\u2019s famous formulation of humanity, and is opposed to reasonable moral intuition required behind the veil of ignorance, not even considering the lost economic efficiency redistribution would impose.</p><p>In addition, would any reasonable person say that a broke college graduate with a lot of debt is worse off than a malnourished African kid who has Malaria but also owns a watch and has no debt?</p><p>Let\u2019s provide another hypothetical against using wealth as a heuristic: Robert Nozick, another famous Harvard philosopher known for his 1974 defense of minarchism <i>Anarchy, State, and Utopia,</i> gives out his \u201cWilt Chamberlain argument\u201d as a critique of egalitarian thinking.</p><p>The argument goes as follows:</p><p>Imagine a society where wealth is initially distributed according to a pattern of justice, such as equal distribution.</p><p>Now suppose that Wilt Chamberlain, a famous basketball player, enters this society and demands that people pay him a small fee to watch him play basketball.</p><p>Because Chamberlain is so popular, millions of people willingly pay him the fee, and he accumulates a vast amount of wealth.</p><p>As a result, the initial pattern of wealth distribution is disrupted, and Chamberlain ends up with much more wealth than others, violating the original pattern of justice.</p><p>Everyone in this scenario is better off, and any tax on Chamberlain\u2019s wealth can cause increased <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss\"><u>deadweight loss</u></a> and an arguable violation of Chamberlain\u2019s liberty.</p><p>Empirically, wealth is far harder to redistribute and even assess compared to income and consumption, which leads us to them by elimination. Given that\u2019s equal to consumption plus saving, income runs into the same problems wealth does, leaving us with the most intuitive choice as a heuristic for identifying the \u201cworst-off\u201d: consumption. Even better would be to look at other factors: IQ, disabilities, disorders, parental SES, opportunities, etc., which can be classified as exogenous, however, this runs into problems of lacking sufficient data and how one can redistribute any genetic predisposition.</p><p>Given that we\u2019ve found our target, let\u2019s give further clarifications. The present value of <strong>lifetime </strong>consumption is better than annual consumption as an indication of well-being. Furthermore, if two people, Bob and Jay, have equal ability and equality of opportunity, but Bob has a lower PV of lifetime consumption due to his <strong>choice </strong>of working less for lower total wages, we cannot strictly that Jay is better off than Bob in terms of economic outcomes.</p><p>In addition, we are trying to seek not just what a maximin rule desires, but what a leximin rule desires as well. In other, words given what the difference principle sets, we still need to find a state that is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_optimal\"><u>Pareto optimal</u></a> (or at least <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_second_best\"><u>second best</u></a>).</p><h2>3. Considerations on Economic Efficiency</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorems_of_welfare_economics\"><u>first two theorems in welfare economics</u></a>, we know that the first states that in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_equilibrium\"><u>economic equilibrium</u></a>, a set of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_market\"><u>complete markets</u></a>, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information\"><u>complete information</u></a>, and in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition\"><u>perfect competition</u></a>, will be Pareto optimal</p><p>The second maintains that a Pareto efficient outcome can be achieved with any initial set of endowments. However, any change in the initial condition can cause a deviation from the Pareto optimal outcome.</p><p>If the previous two paragraphs are not clear enough, let\u2019s take a trip back to 1945, when Friedrich Hayek, a Nobel-Prize-winning economist, published the academic article <i>The Use of Knowledge in Society</i>.</p><p>In the article, Hayek emphasized the role of prices in conveying information and coordinating economic activity, arguing that prices in a competitive market serve as signals that convey information about supply and demand conditions, helping individuals make informed decisions about resource allocation. He further argued that attempts to manipulate prices through central planning would distort these signals and result in inefficient resource allocation.</p><p>However, there are times when markets fail: times when rational self-interests collide toward an outcome that is not socially optimal. Consider a state where allocative efficiency is maximized, where the sum of consumer and producer surplus is at its peak. We can start looking at things from the producer\u2019s point of view. Let\u2019s start with a basic model of one input and output, we can assume that returns are strictly increasing and are also diminishing. Using basic high school calculus, in order for a producer to maximize returns given these conditions, we must set the first derivative of surplus equal to zero. Since this means marginal surplus is set to zero, we derive the equation <strong>marginal revenue = marginal cost</strong>. Replace \u201crevenue\u201d with \u201cutility\u201d and we have arrived at the utility maximization conditions for consumers.</p><p>We may now look at where markets fail to deliver on such conditions. Consider the case of externalities: social costs and benefits that are not accounted for through free-market pricing. Without considering the Coase theorem, a standard solution would be to impose Pigouvian taxes/subsidies to move towards an optimal outcome. But externalities, aren\u2019t the only market failures. Monopolies, free-rider problems, the tragedy of the commons, etc. are all examples of market failures, i.e., when markets fail to maximize allocative efficiency. Further, research in behavioral economics showcases examples of humans deviating from standard models of rational choice. Indeed, an ideal Rawlsian prescription given our non-ideal world says that we should not just move people to act not just in the best interest of society (or at least help the worst-off) but also to move in their own interest in the long run.</p><h2>4. Some Empirical Considerations</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rawls may have been a socialist, but it is not evidently clear that socialism would help achieve an outcome close to the principles he himself initially outlined. Indeed, Hayek, who is often known for advocating for classical liberalism through consequentialist reasoning, does not find any incompatibility between the two principles and his preferred set of policies. Socialist countries tend to have lower rates of life satisfaction, consumption per capita, and democratic policies. Indeed, the top 10 countries in the <a href=\"https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/world-happiness-trust-and-social-connections-in-times-of-crisis/\"><u>world happiness report</u></a> have relatively high rates of <a href=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom\"><u>economic freedom</u></a>.</p><p>From a global perspective declines in <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality\"><u>child mortality</u></a> and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/poverty\"><u>absolute poverty</u></a> seems to coincide with <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization\"><u>increased globalization</u></a> and more <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/democracy\"><u>democratic</u></a> and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/egalitarian-political-institutions?country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN\"><u>egalitarian</u></a> political institutions. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to draw a causal mechanism from here; simple 2x2 matrices illustrating comparative advantage can suffice for our intuition. Further, this lines up perfectly with the predictions of new institutional economics by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. outline in their book <i>Why Nations Fail</i>. The book seeks to create a monocausal outline of history through the lens of institutions. Nations fail through extractive institutions, i.e. ones that only serve the interest of special-interest groups, versus inclusive ones, where everyone is granted a basic set of economic and civil rights. Acemoglu and Robinson go through the excruciating process of showing why geography, culture, etc. do not explain the great differences in prosperity among nations. It\u2019s the institutions, stupid.</p><p>Consider the case of North and South Korea, two countries, that share the same language, have similar geography and resources, and share similar facets, of culture, yet one is rich and the other is not. It is because one is a communist dictatorship and the other is a vibrant liberal democracy. The book goes through its major themes in the first five chapters, reiterates its main talking points through the next five via historical context, and gives prescriptions on what to do in the last five. Even without looking through an institutional lens of history and politics, countries that have inclusive civil and economic rights tend to prosper more than countries that don\u2019t.</p><p>Thus, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that an outcome of <strong>political liberalism</strong> is a society that is <strong>politically</strong> liberal.</p><h2>5. Prescriptions for a Rawlsian State</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Democracy</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If one were to truly create a society where all have a say, no matter its problems, democracy would be the great equalizer. Indeed, there exists no empirical evidence of another policy that allows for greater political rights to the disadvantaged, and further their right to choose economic freedom.</p><h3>Free Markets</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without the ability to obtain and trade private property, incentives to create wealth do not exist. Markets allow consumers and producers to allocate towards a maximally efficient outcome and create freedom and incentives for greater civil rights. Without such a system, the ability of the disadvantaged to escape poverty gets worse, and more extractive institutions get implemented.</p><h3>Free Trade</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Equity is often looked at from a domestic perspective. We often think of helping those who are not just disadvantaged, but also close in proximity. The veil of ignorance doesn\u2019t take this perspective; it allows for a more cosmopolitan view. In line with the beliefs of most economists, free trade increases economic efficiency to the benefit of the global poor. Sure, it creates winners and losers, but Kaldor-Hicks improvements can be converted into Pareto improvements. And from a contractarian viewpoint, would you want your trade limited?</p><h3>Land Value Taxation</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In order to fund the government, one needs to consider what means of taxation should be employed. Since we are aiming for a lexical minimum rule, efficiency and equality should be of foremost consideration. Since the supply of land is inelastic, land value taxes (LVT) produce no deadweight loss, causing no disruption to economic efficiency. And considering that the median landowner is wealthier than the median non-landowner, LVT should cause a more equal economic outcome.</p><h3>Pigouvian Taxation</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using the leximin rule, we find that driving outcomes toward increased allocative efficiency given no sacrifice of the well-being of the worst-off is desirable. Pigouvian taxes, through imposing taxes on goods that impose externalities, can move the market towards greater allocative efficiency. The revenue generated by such taxes could fund redistributive programs. Indeed, such a policy is already <a href=\"http://econstatement.org/\"><u>widely supported by over 3,500 economists</u></a>. So it shouldn\u2019t be hard to recommend this no matter your ethical views.</p><h3>Social Insurance</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Concluding with just a single policy is a disservice, but instead, we should end with an outline for greater equality and prosperity. Inclusive economic institutions, while creating great wealth, create great inequity. The idea of a welfare state, a setup where those who are not gifted can still enjoy the fruits of a liberal society, seems attractive from a risk-averse view behind the veil of ignorance. Indeed Rawlsianism is far more than just a dollars-and-cents ideology, it seeks to provide the disadvantaged with more than what they deserve, but what the better-off are more obligated to give. Whether through basic income, EITC, wage subsidies, unemployment insurance, or universal catastrophic care, the welfare state is a favorite tool of modern-day Rawlsians. It is through this tool, we can create a society that is not just economically liberal, but politically liberal as well.</p><h2>5. Conclusion (for now)</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notice the use of the repeated use of the word \u201csome\u201d I\u2019ve had in this article. It would be absurd to end such an essay with such minimal recommended actions. Depending on the feedback I receive, this should be part I of multi-part series. This essay was mainly focused on the second Rawlsian principle taken at a global scale; indeed prescriptive actions were not even distinguished between developed and developing countries. It also did not address the first principle nor did it argue for or against either, in fact, this essay is mostly positive in content. The broad plan towards a Rawlsian outcome is still intact but the details have not been specified. After all, it should take more than one essay to state what is needed for equity, or for liberalism, or for utopia.</p>", "user": {"username": "ParetoOptimal"}}, {"_id": "nyRwGEepTfb2EJMeF", "title": "Writing about your job is (still) great \u2014 consider doing it", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T08:04:12.676Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Many of us know very little about what people in different roles&nbsp;actually do or how they got there.

As the argument goes, even if we should only refrain from the <i>unneeded relatively direct creation of sentient beings</i>, and if children prima facie count as one of them, sentiocentric antinatalists have a moral duty not to take actions that would result in the creation of fruit flies. I base my argument on the plausible axioms that creating fruit flies is unneeded, the formation of fruit flies is the result of a relatively direct act or abstaining from such an act, analogous to the creation of children, and above all the fact fruit flies satisfy numerous criteria for sentience (see <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065280622000170\"><u>Gibbons et al., 2022</u></a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/short-research-summary-can-insects-feel-pain-a-review-of\"><u>EA summary</u></a>), so it is reasonable to assume they are sentient, or it is reasonable to invoke the ethics of uncertain sentience/precautionary principle in their case. Abstaining from actions that would lead to the creation of fruit flies may save hundreds to thousands of subjective years of fruit fly lives, and in expectation reduces disvalue. Therefore it is a serious moral issue despite maybe looking funny or unworthy of consideration. I also briefly mention some other ways in which our everyday actions may impact invertebrate multiplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Introduction: Antinatalism and non-human animals</strong></p><p>Sentiocentric antinatalism (hereinafter: SAN) claims that coming into existence constitutes harm to every sentient being. For the purposes of this introduction, this strong version of SAN will be adequate, but I believe even the weak version of SAN - coming into existence is a harm only if the life created is sufficiently bad - might suffice. It may be enough to state that (strong) sentiocentric antinatalism is a view defended by David Benatar, many well-known antinatalists and a large part of the antinatalist community, and it does not struggle with the problem of setting an arbitrary moral boundary between humans and non-human animals, thus not exposing itself to the charge of speciesism.</p><p>Despite the fact that many antinatalists consider themselves sentiocentric, often considerations of non-human animals do not occupy a proportionate position in antinatalists\u2019 worldviews, to the point of being commonly ignored. This may be partly due to a sense of lack of influence, and partly due to the lack of adequate representation of the problem. The following text is not intended to address this problem, but to draw attention to one aspect of it, related to our impact on the existence of fruit flies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The case for fruit fly antinatalism</strong></p><p>From the perspective of both consequentialist and non-consequentialist SAN, conscious action to produce a new sentient being is immoral, in some cases assuming we're not expecting the new life to have sufficient instrumental value. In practice, it usually leads to abstaining from conceiving children. From the utilitarian AN perspective, since utilitarianism is often a very demanding ethical theory, the set of obligations is much broader. For the purposes of this text, a weaker set of obligations is sufficient though.</p><p>My focus on fruit flies stems from several reasons. First, they are, sadly, once again a perfect model organism, allowing us to easily show the moral aspect of the SAN in relation to non-human consciousnesses. Then, they shed light on the suffering of invertebrates which, despite making up 99.9998% [see <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/07/13/1711842115.DC1/1711842115.sapp.pdf\"><u>Bar-on et al., 2018</u></a>] of the animals on the planet, receive not even a fraction of the moral attention they deserve. Thirdly, not only are fruit flies common, being known to all of us, but also preventing their creation and multiplication in their case is relatively simple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>The criteria</strong></i></p><p>Let's look at the criteria that must be met for even a very morally undemanding sentiocentric antinatalism, limited only to <i>abstaining from unneeded relatively direct creation of sentient beings</i>, I will call this view Minimally Demanding Sentiocentric Antinatalism (MDSAN), to require abstaining from causing the existence of fruit flies.</p><ol><li>Creating fruit flies is unneeded.</li><li>The formation of fruit flies is the result of a relatively direct act or abstaining from such an act, analogous to the creation of children, prima facie considered immoral under antinatalism (so also MDSAN).</li><li>Fruit flies are sentient beings, or it is reasonable to assume they are, or it is reasonable to invoke the ethics of uncertain sentience/precautionary principle in their case.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(1)</p><p>Let's start with the first criterion. An initial point that may be important to clarify is the difference between unneeded and unnecessary. Some AN (e.g. consequentialist AN) may justify the creation of sentient beings because the instrumental value of their existence outweighs the disvalue of their creation. We may consider some acts of creation or allowing sentience to be <i>necessary</i>, and thus the act of creating them may be morally justifiable or obligatory. Another group of creations would be those that are somehow <i>needed</i>&nbsp;but not necessary. Necessary acts could be \"strongly needed\", but there would also be acts \"weakly needed\" - that is, useful to some extent. I leave open the question of how morally justified such acts of creation are, in principle they seem unjustified to me. However, we can assume that within&nbsp;minimally&nbsp;demanding SAN, the creation of some merely useful creatures is allowed. While the creation of some sentient beings has an instrumental value, although the vast majority of such creations I believe (as most of these instrumentally created lives are probably farm animals) is unwarranted, it allows MDSAN to create some whatever needed/useful beings. But there are also beings whose creation is instrumentally unneeded, and even instrumentally troubling.</p><p>Fruit flies are unneeded because their existence does not meet the criteria of having important instrumental value. They do not improve the well-being of other sentient beings, nor do they cause any other clearly positive states, although in the paragraph below I present suggestions for such possibilities. Most often, flies are either completely neutral or have a negative impact on human well-being, causing annoyance by large numbers of flies, discomfort by having to eat or throw away infected fruit, and if they are thrown away - the loss of money paid for the fruit and the lack of comfort of eating it, as well as failure to provide the body with an additional portion of vitamins. The discarded fruit can also become food and a breeding ground for other sentient beings that would not have arisen in such quantity without it. The existence of fruit flies in house conditions has no instrumental positive value, so creating them, if the following criteria are met, is unjustified from the perspective of the MDSAN, and therefore also any other SAN.</p><p>Certain situations in which the existence of fruit flies has an instrumental value in domestic conditions can be imagined. For example, fruit flies provide food for house spiders, thereby reducing the discomfort of their hunger. However, given that a) house spiders also feed on other insects, and the flies are not necessary for them, but merely useful for survival, b) the spider's death by starvation seems less bad than its life paid for by many flies being dissolved by spider\u2019s venom and c) that such feeding of spiders consequently leads to their reproduction, and thus to more suffering for spiders and their prey, the existence of flies as food for spiders is not an argument for creating them, because the disvalue of their suffering outweighs their instrumental usefulness. Another aspect of the usefulness of the flies is that their appearance reminds us to eat the fruits quickly, thus preventing food from spoiling and being thrown away, perhaps at the expense of only a small number of flies. This is related to another argument, which I will call <i>the need to avoid discomfort</i>. It may be argued that preventing the proliferation of fruit flies is an additional chore, being an inconvenience that reduces the comfort of human life. In this sense, not preventing the emergence of flies by creating conditions for their multiplication is needed so as not to burden us with additional tasks and not to complicate everyday functioning. It may be argued that MDSAN should not require us to sacrifice our own comfort for such a \"trivial\" activity as not causing fruit flies to multiply. However, I believe this argument is wrong. The potential discomfort of investing energy in not contributing to the formation of flies seems negligible compared to the amount of suffering and instances of coming into existence that could be prevented. Weighted against the cumulated discomfort of all stress, pain and agony that may be experienced by at least thousands of fruit flies, our discomfort looks like a minor inconvenience it in fact is. Especially given that avoiding leaving uneaten fruits for too long is associated with benefits - we avoid the discomfort of dealing with flies, we acquire healthy habits of self-control, we throw away less food. Eating fruits before the flies appear on them quickly becomes a habit, being only a very temporary discomfort. It also helps us to reduce our direct impact on the suffering of invertebrates in daily life, an impact of non-negligible absolute importance, even if the relative impact of such an approach may be negligible. What matters, however, is the suffering of particular individuals, which does not change whether there are 10 or 10 billion individuals. From the SAN perspective, any emergence of a conscious being is a tragedy, and being able to stop that tragedy at low, virtually negligible cost, or even to your own benefit, requiring you to do so is, in fact, minimally demanding. \u201cMinimally\u201d is also a key word in this context, because MDSAN does not mean the absence of any requirements. In the absence of requirements, it can be argued that if someone is mildly uncomfortable not having children or not creating conscious programs, abstaining from doing so should not be required of them. Treating the suffering of flies differently does not seem justified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(2)</p><p>The second criterion is responsibility for the formation of fruit flies. The similarity between the creation of a child, i.e. causing a child to come into existence, and causing a fruit fly to come into existence is, I argue, a tenable analogy. A true analogy must be characterized by both significant similarity and no significant differences, both of these criteria are met in this case. Even limiting the practical moral requirement for antinatalists only to not creating children, the creation of a sentient mind is not the direct result of an act. It is either a risked, foreseen, or, depending on the situation, practically unavoidable consequence of another intentional act (the sexual act or artificial insemination, which leads to the development of an organism in which sentience itself does not arise until later) or an act from which we refrained (contraception, abortion). This presentation of the matter provides a morally relevant analogy on which I wish to base my argument. I argue that a sentiocentric antinatalist who recognizes even a minimal moral obligation not to create sentient beings relatively directly (as we've seen, even the creation of a child is not technically a fully direct act, but a consequence of another act or abstaining from certain acts) is obliged not only to refrain from making children. They also have the responsibility not to create other sufficiently unneeded (or, ideally, unnecessary) sentient lives. This means, for example, not causing pets to bear offspring, &nbsp;which is a fairly common claim, but also not contributing to the creation and multiplication of fruit flies. Between the <i>creation itself</i>&nbsp;of human life and fly life there seem to be no morally significant differences, although the differences may concern the negative value of this future life (which could be greater in \"more\" sentient humans) and the instrumental value (zero or negative in the case of flies, questionable in the case of humans [people cause suffering, e.g. to farm animals and other people, but they can also reduce their suffering, and their existence results in the degradation of ecosystems and prevents the future creation of a large number of wild animals (see <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/strategic-considerations-moral-antinatalists/\"><u>Tomasik, 2016</u></a>; <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2021/02/20/antinatalism-and-reducing-suffering/\"><u>Vinding, 2021</u></a>)], and there are morally significant similarities between them - both result in a creation of a sentient being for whom it will be a harm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(3)</p><p>Fruit fly sentience: The third criterion that must be met is that fruit flies have to be considered (at least plausibly) sentient beings. There is now convincing behavioral and neuroanatomical evidence for the consciousness of insects, particularly fruit flies. As demonstrated by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065280622000170\"><u>Gibbons et al. (2022</u></a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/short-research-summary-can-insects-feel-pain-a-review-of\"><u>EA summary</u></a>) in a paper examining the evidence for insect consciousness, flies in adult stages satisfy at least 6/8 criteria for sentience. This is more than lobsters and other decapods, generally considered sentient. In addition, research on insect consciousness is still in its infancy, which leads us to believe that more criteria for sentience may be met by insects in the future. In addition, fruit flies <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpain.2023.1076017/full%23:~:text%3DNociception%252C%2520the%2520process%2520of%2520encoding,from%2520potentially%2520life%252Dthreatening%2520stimuli\"><u>have nociceptors</u></a>,&nbsp;at least in larval states, that have so far only been detected in a small number of insects (perhaps because of little research), which allows us to further increase our credence that they can feel pain. The evidence therefore tells us to assign a significant probability to insects possessing sentience, although we cannot yet be absolutely sure. However, absolute certainty is not necessary. Based on probability and the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_uncertain_sentience\"><u>ethics of uncertain sentience</u></a>, a form of the precautionary principle (see: <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle%23Animal_sentience_precautionary_principle\"><u>precautionary principle in animal sentience</u></a>), we should avoid creating beings that we suspect may be sentient. The strength of this requirement may depend on the probability assigned and the strategy adopted, but as long as this probability is non-negligible and our effort is negligible, MDSAN also implies refraining from relatively directly allowing for the emergence of fruit flies.</p><p>An argument against moral consideration of &nbsp;fruit flies would be to assume that the sentience intensity of fruit flies may be low, and thus people's preference for convenience easily outweighs it. In fact, however, we have no other than intuitive reason to believe that the mental states experienced by simpler organisms are less intense [see <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2019/08/27/on-insects-and-lexicality/\"><u>Vinding 2022</u></a>], and our intuitions repeatedly turn out to show a model of reality that is inconsistent with the facts. Even if the mental states of fruit flies were less intense, this does not entitle us to disregard them. Guided by the ethics of uncertain sentience and precautionary principle, we should also recognize that it is better not to be responsible for the emergence of the flies, since their mental states can, with a non-negligible probability, be morally significant enough. The last, very important aspect of the whole problem is the number of fruit flies for which we can be responsible, or whose existence we can prevent. Over the course of the rest of our lives, this may be tens of thousands of individual sentient beings prevented from coming into existence. An adult female fruit fly can lay up to 500 (usually 400) eggs on the surface of moist and rotting fruits, which hatch within 12 hours. Tiny maggots - which we should also consider possibly sentient, according to Gibbons et al. (2022)&nbsp;Diptera (the order where flies belong) larvae satisfy at least 4-5/8 criteria for sentience - hatch and start to eat the decayed food. Within 4 days, they're all grown up and shortly after ready to mate, too. The average natural lifespan of fruit fly adults in optimal temperatures is 40 to 50 days (different sites provide different lifespans, but for the back-of-an-envelope calculations I perform it\u2019s not so importnat). This gives many thousand days of fly life, the quality of which we can assess differently. Most likely it is not filled with joy, but at most with neutral satisfaction of needs, and with moments of hunger, fear, thermal stress, aggression, and frustration related to the impossibility of reproduction, ending with death in a spider's web, of hunger, drowned in juice, or otherwise killed by a human trying to get rid of them, their deaths not being instant in most cases. Even the assumption of low probability and low intensity of their sentience seems insufficient to ignore the problem of allowing for fruit fly emergence and multiplication. Assuming the average lifespan of fruit flies to be much shorter, only 10 days, if we imagine 10,000 fruit flies (a number which does not seem to be an exaggeration) a year would have been created given we don't prevent it, we may be responsible for creating 274 subjective years of fruit fly life. If our actions (e.g. for the rest of our lives) would cause 100,000 flies to come into existence, and if their average lifespan is longer (e.g. 30 days), we get over 8 thousand years of sentient experience, plausibly slight to intense disvalue, created. This simplified calculation sheds light on the scale of the problem, and the impact our actions really have. All of that doesn't even touch on the suffering of future generations of wild fruit flies that may follow from the ancestral lines we relatively directly created. We may further modify those examples, claiming fruit fly sentience counts as only slightly negative, but plausibly there is enough of a disvalue taking place for us to take action against allowing fruit flies to reproduce. It seems implausible at best and wishful thinking at most that the disvalue of the suffering of fruit flies is incidentally at precisely such a low level to be easily outweighed by our need for not experiencing a really slight inconvenience.</p><p>Thus, the creation of fruit flies in a situation where a) their existence is unnecessary and unneeded, b) their existence is caused by intentional or unintentional relatively direct act or omission, c) when we have good reasons to believe that the flies are sentient, and to act on the basis of ethics of uncertain sentience, is morally reprehensible from the perspective of even minimally demanding, and therefore every sentiocentric antinatalism. Sentiocentric antinatalists should at least not allow fruit flies to emerge and refrain from actions that will lead to their multiplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to prevent fruit flies?</strong></p><p>Preventing the formation of fruit flies is minimally demanding, at the cost of just a few activities we can prevent their emergence or significantly reduce their number. Chat GPT and various sites on the internet give the following, intuitive advice:</p><ul><li>Store fruits and vegetables properly:</li><li>Keep ripe fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator.</li><li>Store unripe fruits at room temperature until they ripen, then move them to the fridge.</li><li>Use fruit bowls with lids:</li><li>Cover fruit bowls with a mesh or netted lid to prevent flies from accessing the fruits.</li><li>Keep countertops clean:</li><li>Wipe down kitchen countertops regularly to remove any fruit residue or spills that may attract fruit flies.</li><li>Dispose of overripe or rotting produce:</li><li>Regularly check for and discard any overripe or rotting fruits or vegetables in your kitchen.</li><li>Empty trash bins regularly:</li><li>Fruit flies can breed in your trash, so empty it regularly and use a trash can with a tight-fitting lid.</li><li>Rinse recycling containers:</li><li>Clean recyclables before placing them in recycling bins to remove any food residues.</li><li>Clean drains:</li><li>Fruit flies can breed in damp and organic material in sink drains.

This seems to be the most popular method, but I would strongly suggest causing flies to die instantly, rather than a slow and probably very distressing death. The best way when the flies already hatched might be to mechanically kill every fly, crushing it instantly to disintegrate its nervous system. Then, the infected fruit should be eaten immediately or otherwise (e.g. thermally?) deprived of the larvae, otherwise more flies will hatch. Throwing away such fruit will not prevent the formation of flies.]</li><li>Regularly clean and sanitize:</li><li>Maintain a clean kitchen by wiping down surfaces, cleaning spills immediately, and regularly sanitizing areas where fruits and vegetables are prepared and stored.</li><li>Remove compost regularly:</li><li>If you have a compost pile or bin, empty it regularly to prevent fruit fly breeding.</li><li>Fix any leaks:</li><li>Repair any plumbing leaks as fruit flies are attracted to damp areas.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Fruit flies are an obvious example of organisms that we have a relatively direct influence on. Our act or inaction in a small number of steps leads to the emergence of sentient life. The case of fruit flies is in a way special, as their existence is actually unneeded, and preventing or limiting their formation is relatively simple (we treat simplicity of implementation as an aspect of the need for convenience). Minimally Demanding Sentiocentric AN therefore requires not creating fruit flies. However, it seems that MDSAN is not a plausible moral stance under sentiocentric antinatalism. It does not seem that the creation of sentient beings as a result of taking care of one's own comfort should be morally justified. In that case, antinatalism would lose its practical sense, allowing for the creation of any minimally needed beings, including children and non-human animals bred for food, and we would, prima facie, like antinatalists not to create e.g. children for self-centered reasons. Assigning a low value to the mental states of insects may balance this inequality, allowing them to be created as a result of our convenience, but in the face of modern knowledge, this seems to contradict the precautionary principle and ethics of uncertain sentience, as well as the utilitarian calculation of expected value. I think that constitutes a strong case as to why even minimally demanding sentiocentric antinatalists are responsible for the creation of fruit flies, and therefore all sentiocentric antinatalists are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related issues</strong></p><p>There are many other examples of beings whose reproduction depends on our decisions. There is a greater cost linked to preventing their existence, but depending on how morally demanding the view we subscribe to is and what action a person is willing to take, that cost may be supererogatory or obligatory in theory or practice. Selected examples, with varying degrees of demandingness and expected value, may include preventing/not causing the existence of:</p><ul><li>Fungus gnats associated with houseplants, as well as other pests found on houseplants (aphids, mealybugs, spider mites, whiteflies, scale insects, thrips). It would be optimal to have no house plants at all, but caring for them and eliminating pests before they multiply may be suboptimal but more acceptable for many, perhaps especially when the plants increase psychological comfort (although the question remains whether the suffering of invertebrates is worth this convenience).</li><li>Booklices and moths feeding on the storage of organic materials.</li><li>Cockroaches, flies and other invertebrates thriving on discarded unprotected food scraps.</li><li>Spiders breeding in untidy areas, and other invertebrates in there (in basements, attics, utility rooms)</li><li>Mites multiplying on less frequently washed bedding.</li><li>Parasites on captive animals (like pets).</li><li>Small crustaceans, insect larvae, nematodes and other invertebrates developing in small bodies of water in gardens, such as ponds, birdbaths, or even rain-filled containers.</li><li>Earthworms (e.g. Eisenia fetida and Lumbricus terrestris), red wigglers (a type of earthworm), potworms (Enchytraeidae), springtails (Collembola), various mites, beetles (such as rove beetles and ground beetles), various species of ants, flies (including fruit flies and soldier flies), sails and slugs, millipedes (Polydesmida), woodlice (Isopoda), centipedes (Chilopoda), and various other insect larvae, as well as other invertebrates multiplying in composters.</li><li>And also all insects, springtails, arachnids, crustaceans, myriapods, annelids, nematodes, snails and slugs, other invertebrates, as well as small vertebrates that breed in gardens. It would be optimal to make the garden uninhabitable, for example by covering it with concrete, gravel, or otherwise depriving it of habitats for new creatures (see Tomaik below). It may be more acceptable for many to give up dense vegetation, avoid bodies of water in the garden, or cover part of the garden with something that prevents some creatures from breeding (such as gravel, tiles or concrete).</li></ul><p>The examples presented above are characterized by varying degrees of demandingness, but I encourage all sentiocentric antinatalists to seriously think through those issues, and limit their influence on causing the creation of conscious beings, seriously weighing their own discomfort against the suffering of these invertebrates for whose existence we are relatively directly responsible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Further reading</strong></p><p>Brian Tomasik on not causing insect suffering:</p><p><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/kill-bugs-humanely/\"><u>How to Kill Bugs Humanely</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/speculations-on-population-dynamics-of-bug-suffering/\"><u>Speculations on Invertebrate Population Dynamics Relevant to Reducing Suffering</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/convert-grass-lawns-to-gravel-to-reduce-insect-suffering/\"><u>Convert Grass Lawns to Gravel to Reduce Insect Suffering</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/many-springtails-created-gram-grass/\"><u>How Many Springtails Are Created by a Gram of Grass?</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wikihow.fitness/Avoid-Hurting-Insects\"><u>How to Avoid Hurting Insects</u></a></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Daniel Daymoon"}}, {"_id": "5pksH3SbQzaniX96b", "title": "A quick update from Nonlinear", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T21:26:13.338Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>One example of the evidence we\u2019re gathering</strong></p><p>We are working hard on a point-by-point response to<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear\">&nbsp;<u>Ben\u2019s article</u></a>, but wanted to provide a quick example of the sort of evidence we are preparing to share:</p><p><strong>Her claim:</strong>&nbsp; \u201cAlice claims she was sick with covid in a foreign country, with only the three Nonlinear cofounders around, but nobody in the house was willing to go out and get her vegan food, so she barely ate for 2 days.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>The truth (see screenshots below)</strong>:</p><ol><li>There<i> was</i> vegan food in the house (oatmeal, quinoa, mixed nuts, prunes, peanuts, tomatoes, cereal, oranges) which we offered to cook for her.</li><li>We&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>pick up vegan food for her.</li></ol><p>Months later, after our relationship deteriorated, she went around telling many people that we&nbsp;<i>starved</i> her.

We invite people through our social media - Facebook, Instagram, and newsletter. Some meetings attracted a lot of (even 15) people, some did not. We had two objectives in mind:</p><ul><li>Community building - using reading group as low-commitment entry-point to EA. It probably failed. Although a few new people joined our Slack after the meetings, they are no longer active.</li><li>Creating and strengthening bonds between EAs. Limited success. Success, because of 1) just hanging out together, 2) exploring tough topics together, made us friends. Limited, because there are only a few regular participants, so our bonding is limited to this small subgroup of the EA community.</li></ul><p>Our current plan is to continue organizing those meetings.</p><h1>Our previous experience</h1><p>In this post I describe details of how our reading group has worked since November 2022, when we decided to keep our meetings open to everyone. Before that, from March to September 2022, we had our internal book club meetings (only for EAs, not announced on our social media). We read Doing Good Better and The Precipice. From those meetings we had a few main insights:</p><ul><li>Weekly meetings are too time consuming for us.</li><li>Reading whole books does not work for us because<ul><li>People who missed a few meetings are less likely to join in the middle of the book.</li><li>Over time, we get tired of discussing the same topic.</li></ul></li><li>Moral claims are much more likely to start a discussion than factual ones. We learnt that while reading The Precipice - chapters 1 and 2 of The Precipice led to fiery discussions on longtermism, but later chapters, which contained mostly factual information about particular X-risks and we found that there was really nothing to talk about.</li></ul><h1>How it works</h1><h2>Organisation</h2><ul><li>We meet every 2 weeks, online.&nbsp;</li><li>The meeting lasts 1h15min. We started with 1h and then agreed that we\u2019d prefer longer meetings.</li><li>Each meeting is announced on Facebook, Instagram and in our newsletter.</li><li>I prepared a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X3FCI0sZ6hUZotU7XFapT53rqmRv2JQhFPePnQe-HyU/edit?usp=sharing \">Doc </a>with the key actions when organizing the meetings. Might be helpful for other organizers.</li></ul><h2>Readings selection</h2><ul><li>We decide on the next reading together. I collect 4-5 diverse titles and write a very short description of each of them. Then, I post them on our community Slack channel and we start voting.</li><li>We choose readings that are easily accessible - either free online access or available in most public libraries.</li><li>Topics are related to EA, ethics, philosophy. We just read what seems interesting to us at a given moment.</li><li>We try to select readings that take 1-1.5 hours to read. We noticed that with longer readings we sometimes fail to complete them.</li><li>In the final paragraph of this post I gathered all our readings and general impressions from the meetings.</li></ul><h1>How it worked out</h1><p>We had three main goals:</p><ol><li>Having fun ourselves and learning new stuff together.</li><li>Community building - using reading group as low-commitment entry-point to EA.</li><li>Strengthening bonds between Effective Altruists.</li></ol><p>We think that we indeed 1. had fun and 3. got to know each other better. We also think that those meetings can be used as an entry-point for non-EA people, however we do not find support for this in our statistics. Indeed a few people joined our community Slack because of the reading group however they are no longer active users. In January 2023 we started organizing Intro Fellowship, so it is possible that it attracted newcomers who would have otherwise joined our reading group.</p><h1>Lessons learnt</h1><ul><li>Long books can be too long because participants drop out, and no new people join in the middle of the book and participants might get bored.</li><li>Readings on morality are more discussion-friendly than readings on pure facts.</li><li>It might be tempting to plan a lot of reading for a single meeting, but in the long run we were just failing to complete it.</li><li>Meeting once a week was too frequent for us to sustain in the long run.</li></ul><h1>What\u2019s next?</h1><p>We plan to continue organizing meetings only changing the frequency. Instead of one meeting every two weeks, we would like to try doing them once a month. We expect that this could increase the attendance because it\u2019d be easier for busy participants to find some time to prepare and attend.</p><h1>Statistics</h1><p>Here are some statistics and comments from our previous meetings. This can perhaps be useful for other book club organizers, just to see how a particular reading worked out for us.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top;width:92px\"><strong>Date</strong></th><th style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Reading</strong></th><th style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top;width:250px\"><strong>Impressions/reception</strong></th><th style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>#participants</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">02.11.2022</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">Peter Singer - Famine, Affluence, and Morality</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">This topic worked really well with fluent discussion flow.</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>14</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">16.11.2022</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">Peter Singer - Famine, Affluence, and Morality</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">&gt;=7 (forgot to write down)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">30.11.2022</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">Peter Singer - Animal Liberation (chap. 1)</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">This topic worked really well with fluent discussion flow.</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>11</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">14.12.2022</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">Peter Singer - Animal Liberation (chap. 1)</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">There were only 4 people who basically agreed on the topic, so some non-mainstream cases were discussed, e.g. feeding dogs, moral offsetting, or moral status of farming \"happy\" animals.</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">11.01.2023</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Holden Karnofsky - The Most Important Century:</p><p>1.

In only a few cases has the accuracy of forecasts resulting from decomposition been tested against those of control groups making forecasts holistically.</strong> One exception is <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/for.3980090403\">Edmundson (1990)</a> who found that for a time series extrapolation task, obtaining separate estimates of the trend, seasonal and random components and then combining these to obtain forecasts led to greater accuracy than could be obtained from holistic forecasts.  Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207004001049\">Webby, O\u2019Connor and Edmundson (2005)</a> showed that, when a time series was disturbed in some periods by several simultaneous special events, accuracy was greater when forecasters were required to make separate estimates for the effect of each event, rather than estimating the combined effects holistically. <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76362507.pdf\">Armstrong and Collopy (1993)</a> also constructed more accurate forecasts by structuring the selection and weighting of statistical forecasts around the judge\u2019s knowledge of separate factors that influence the trends in time series (causal forces).\nMany other proposals for decomposition methods have been based on an act of faith that breaking down judgmental tasks is bound to improve accuracy or upon the fact that decomposition yields an audit trail and hence a defensible rationale for the forecasts (<a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/49278189/0169-2070_2891_2990004-f20161001-25533-1nihj7p-libre.pdf?1475369537=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DUsing_belief_networks_to_forecast_oil_pr.pdf&amp;Expires=1693237828&amp;Signature=JtQssSZv0KaUbWLf3fPA70ho1ECj9zYkBC~EnNVIrFfIgcQ5dDVeK5stSWj1tR7OQrcur7PG~y8wHNuAorqrPAjqHwEq3T88klt23BzmzXwMWUNR~ZPKimTrcDTGgrj0WcC~~gM51fzvvCJrK2hO7oPsmc-mQsgvBL5VIywRLw6-GpQjBbpILXJk90c3-JTXwWeUwhwt1zv3h6U-WAyQn-Y88tZg~R7AUFJBRAdbwV8A67o7mHcCZNbKLdluGYDgG9uC516BWr4lckSd7VcoqzfywkjpxZWTjBEFLvmJoWuSRwNvqak3SzHBO5Hv86zZ4oJtWXbxwTdsVw61JGmt6Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\">Abramson &amp; Finizza, 1991</a>;\n<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George-Wright-11/publication/227446292_Interaction_of_Judgemental_and_Statistical_Forecasting_Methods_Issues_Analysis/links/0c9605375ff870d3c9000000/Interaction-of-Judgemental-and-Statistical-Forecasting-Methods-Issues-Analysis.pdf\">Bunn &amp; Wright, 1991</a>;\n<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0169207092900277\">Flores, Olson, &amp; Wolfe,\n1992</a>;\n<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/9789401579544\">Saaty &amp; Vargas, 1991</a>; <a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/56667412/0040-1625_2894_2900050-720180527-12155-ptp70l-libre.pdf?1527455229=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DDecomposition_in_the_assessment_of_judgm.pdf&amp;Expires=1693237988&amp;Signature=Np4MDK~nFPb3xPknH2QaBnyOnnYT8FPgpsx7PTKkZEhmPVRQ5RTKSKzOQ7j9KDstvWfF~X7pIQdd~OJxn4OntioCsEPCPxRzLtOUscn3~UuGBnWYNsZ4JO8iBaREvH2N~DL0um~6moufhk69-lNkSjV~x2MLC5KMDBGJUwbxSwZmTp0sx3vANfZGpq~~f5ojnSkSfVJ1NYvWr82KK5UUxtU08HtGsSqOKlBB8NA7~IxsTcJnUKONHm5lczVeWq8KBEMGaNLI0GBr1y4e2bPA~Y8aKcCqnDbsOriQ0f7rNclqsY-cEEarUmd8UXRFJZc6vtPjgdF5Xv0CgrPEGIh0xA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\">Salo &amp; Bunn, 1995</a>;\n<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/for.3980090407\">Wolfe &amp; Flores,\n1990</a>).\nYet, as <a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/46103856/0169-2070_2893_2990001-420160531-2191-1mlbayr-libre.pdf?1464718211=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DImproving_judgmental_time_series_forecas.pdf&amp;Expires=1693238053&amp;Signature=PDCGfnyMHtluH1q9RsZffGSGZU02oBJZvEFChvofGx0nzBDrpCnlErCwx5OFUv0rXIRsULnJL~LA57rWsRXBEXcAbUtaObpC6rJTmAqe1RJLkDE59eD7787zBpqxYCkBHx5-uOou2gPpBCrxpMzc9JS3zDt4HXSs3eiXMzhzw0jPHkPyYGPwIFK5Xae1JVOkmZccnBe-9QwZhwyIcLEqoEWIoAr34d2EW19zendk~9NA182Kaf4MgKXaUCzMxSwcyMIWfoJ5K~VdfWr5Cf1LOToCb638Nn354gpcOtTX~gwCfaK0lwWcqc9Ew-3AJ7w7EBtStETgW3rSbOvuSV9WrA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\">Goodwin and Wright (1993)</a> point out, decomposition is not guaranteed to improve accuracy and may actually reduce it when the decomposed judgements are psychologically more complex or less familiar than holistic judgements, or where the increased number of judgements required by the decomposition induces fatigue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis mine).</p>\n<p>The types of decomposition described here seem quite different from\nthe ones used in the sources above: Decomposed time series are quite\ndissimilar to multiplied probabilities for binary predictions, and in combination with the conceptual counter-arguments the evidence appears quite weak.</p>\n<p>It appears as if a team of a few (let's say 4) dedicated forecasters could\nrun a small experiment to determine whether multiplicative decomposition for binary forecasts a good method, by randomly spending 20 minutes either making explicitely decomposed forecasts or control forecasts (although the exact method for control needs to be elaborated on).

This seems like a worthwhile exercise for at least non-zero people to do in the comments before reading on.

Typically this would involve reading some of their public writings, and reaching out to a couple of their references that I trusted and asking for information about them. A lot of the people I reached out to were surprisingly great at giving honest references about their experiences with someone and sharing what they thought about someone.</p><p>One time, Kat Woods and Drew Spartz from Nonlinear applied to visit. I didn't know them or their work well, except from a few brief interactions that Kat Woods seems high-energy, and to have a more optimistic outlook on life and work than most people I encounter.</p><p>I reached out to some references Kat listed, which were positive to strongly positive. However I also got a strongly negative reference \u2014 someone else who I informed about the decision told me they knew former employees who felt taken advantage of around things like salary. However the former employees reportedly didn't want to come forward due to fear of retaliation and generally wanting to get away from the whole thing, and the reports felt very vague and hard for me to concretely visualize, but nonetheless the person strongly recommended against inviting Kat and Drew.</p><p>I didn't feel like this was a strong enough reason to bar someone from a space \u2014 or rather, I did, but vague anonymous descriptions of very bad behavior being sufficient to ban someone is a system that can be straightforwardly abused, so I don't want to use such a system. Furthermore, I was interested in getting my own read on Kat Woods from a short visit \u2014 she had only asked to visit for a week. So I accepted, though I informed her that this weighed on my mind.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rldJBi3eVVeqZjqbpCljgz9rmfNbuQW7HMEpugsPWt4/edit\"><u>This is a link to the decision email I sent to her.</u></a>)</p><p>(After making that decision I was also linked to this ominous yet still vague&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L4S2NCysoJxgCBuB6/announcing-nonlinear-emergency-funding?commentId=5P75dFuKLo894MQFf\"><u>EA Forum thread</u></a>, that includes a former coworker of Kat Woods saying they did not like working with her, more comments like the one I received above, and links to a lot of strongly negative Glassdoor reviews for Nonlinear Cofounder Emerson Spartz's former company \u201cDose\u201d. Note that more than half of the negative reviews are for the company after Emerson sold it, but this is a concerning one from 2015 (while Emerson Spartz was CEO/Cofounder):&nbsp;\"<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW8511849.htm\"><u>All of these super positive reviews are being commissioned by upper management. That is the first thing you should know about Spartz, and I think that gives a pretty good idea of the company's priorities\u2026 care more about the people who are working for you and less about your public image</u></a>\". A 2017 review says&nbsp;\"<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW14177614.htm\"><u>The culture is toxic with a lot of cliques, internal conflict, and finger pointing.</u></a>\" There are also&nbsp;far worse reviews about a hellish work place which are very worrying, but they\u2019re from the period after Emerson\u2019s LinkedIn says he left, so I\u2019m not sure to what extent he is responsible he is for them.)</p><p>On the first day of her visit, another person in the office privately reached out to me saying they were extremely concerned about having Kat and Drew in the office, and that they knew two employees who had had terrible experiences working with them. They wrote (and we later discussed it more):</p><blockquote><p>Their company Nonlinear has a history of illegal and unethical behavior, where they will attract young and naive people to come work for them, and subject them to inhumane working conditions when they arrive, fail to pay them what was promised, and ask them to do illegal things as a part of their internship. I personally know two people who went through this, and they are scared to speak out due to the threat of reprisal, specifically by Kat Woods and Emerson Spartz.</p></blockquote><p>This sparked (for me) a 100-200 hour investigation where I interviewed 10-15 people who interacted or worked with Nonlinear, read many written documents and tried to piece together some of what had happened.</p><p>My takeaway is that indeed their two in-person employees had quite horrendous experiences working with Nonlinear, and that Emerson Spartz and Kat Woods are significantly responsible both for the harmful dynamics and for the employees\u2019 silence afterwards. Over the course of investigating Nonlinear I came to believe that the former employees there had no legal employment, tiny pay, a lot of isolation due to travel, had implicit and explicit threats of retaliation made if they quit or spoke out negatively about Nonlinear, simultaneously received a lot of (in my opinion often hollow) words of affection and claims of familial and romantic love, experienced many further unpleasant or dangerous experiences that they wouldn\u2019t have if they hadn\u2019t worked for Nonlinear, and needed several months to recover with friends and family afterwards before they felt able to return to work.</p><p>(Note that I don\u2019t think the pay situation as-described in the above quoted text was entirely accurate, I think it was very small \u2014 $1k/month \u2014 and employees implicitly expected they would get more than they did, but there was mostly not salary \u2018promised\u2019 that didn\u2019t get given out.)</p><p>After first hearing from them about their experiences, I still felt unsure about what was true \u2014 I didn\u2019t know much about the Nonlinear cofounders, and I didn\u2019t know which claims about the social dynamics I could be confident of. To get more context, I spent about 30+ hours on calls with 10-15 different people who had some professional dealings with at least one of Kat, Emerson and Drew, trying to build up a picture of the people and the org, and this helped me a lot in building my own sense of them by seeing what was common to many people\u2019s experiences. I talked to many people who interacted with Emerson and Kat who had many active ethical concerns about them and strongly negative opinions, and I also had a 3-hour conversation with the Nonlinear cofounders about these concerns, and I now feel a lot more confident about a number of dynamics that the employees reported.</p><p>For most of these conversations I offered strict confidentiality, but (with the ex-employees\u2019 consent) I\u2019ve here written down some of the things I learned.</p><p>In this post I do not plan to name most of the people I talked to, but two former employees I will call \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cChloe\u201d. I think the people involved mostly want to put this time in their life behind them and I would encourage folks to respect their privacy, not name them online, and not talk to them about it unless you\u2019re already good friends with them.</p><p><strong>Conversation with Kat on March 7th, 2023</strong></p><p>Returning to my initial experience: on the Tuesday of their visit, I still wasn\u2019t informed about who the people were or any details of what happened, but I found an opportunity to chat with Kat over lunch.</p><p>After catching up for ~15 mins, I indicated that I'd be interested in talking about the concerns I raised in my email, and we talked in a private room for 30-40 mins. As soon as we sat down, Kat launched straight into stories about two former employees of hers, telling me repeatedly not to trust one of the employees (\u201cAlice\u201d), that she has a terrible relationship with truth, that she's dangerous, and that she\u2019s a reputational risk to the community. She said the other employee (\"Chloe\") was \u201cfine\u201d.</p><p>Kat Woods also told me that she expected to have a policy with her employees of \u201cI don\u2019t say bad things about you, you don\u2019t say bad things about me\u201d. I am strongly against this kind of policy on principle (as I told her then). This and other details raised further red flags to me (i.e. the salary policy) and I wanted to understand what happened.</p><p>Here\u2019s an overview of what she told me:</p><ul><li>When they worked at Nonlinear, Alice and Chloe had expenses covered (room, board, food) and Chloe also got a monthly bonus of $1k/month.</li><li>Alice and Chloe lived in the same house as Kat, Emerson and Drew. Kat said that she has decided to not live with her employees going forward.&nbsp;</li><li>She said that Alice, who incubated their own project (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220321075904/https://www.nonlinear.org/hiringagency.html\"><u>here is a description of the incubation program on Nonlinear\u2019s site</u></a>), was able to set their own salary, and that Alice almost never talked to her (Kat) or her other boss (Emerson) about her salary.</li><li>Kat doesn\u2019t trust Alice to tell the truth, and that Alice has a history of \u201ccatastrophic misunderstandings\u201d.</li><li>Kat told me that Alice was unclear about the terms of the incubation, and said that Alice should have checked in with Kat in order to avoid this miscommunication.</li><li>Kat suggested that Alice may have quit in substantial part due to Kat missing a check-in call over Zoom toward the end.</li><li>Kat said that she hoped Alice would go by the principle of \u201cI don\u2019t say bad things about you, you don\u2019t say bad things about me\u201d but that the employee wasn\u2019t holding up her end and was spreading negative things about Kat/Nonlinear.</li><li>Kat said she gives negative references for Alice, advises people \u201cdon't hire her\u201d and not to fund her, and \u201cshe\u2019s really dangerous for the community\u201d.</li><li>She said she didn\u2019t have these issues with her other employee Chloe, she said she was \u201cfine, just miscast\u201d for her role of \u201cassistant / operations manager\u201d, which is what led to her quitting. Kat said Chloe was pretty skilled but did a lot of menial labor tasks for Kat that she didn\u2019t enjoy.</li><li>The one negative thing she said about Chloe was that she was being paid the equivalent of $75k<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8a69v0tq2qo\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8a69v0tq2qo\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;per year (only $1k/month, the rest via room and board), but that at one point she asked for $75k&nbsp;<i>on top</i> of all expenses being paid and that was out of the question.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo53culramn\"><sup><a href=\"#fno53culramn\">[2]</a></sup></span></li></ul><h2>A High-Level Overview of The Employees\u2019 Experience with Nonlinear</h2><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The core Nonlinear staff are Emerson Spartz, Kat Woods, and Drew Spartz.&nbsp;</p><p>Kat Woods has been in the EA ecosystem for at least 10 years, cofounding Charity Science in 2013 and working there until 2019. After a year at Charity Entrepreneurship, in 2021 she&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fX8JsabQyRSd7zWiD/introducing-the-nonlinear-fund-ai-safety-research-incubation\"><u>cofounded</u></a> Nonlinear with Emerson Spartz, where she has worked for 2.5 years.</p><p>Nonlinear has received $599,000&nbsp;<a href=\"https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2022-h1-recommendations\"><u>from</u></a> the Survival and Flourishing Fund in the first half of 2022, and $15,000&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/nonlinear-fund-personal-assistant-hiring-agency/\"><u>from</u></a> Open Philanthropy in January 2022.</p><p>Emerson primarily funds the project through his personal wealth from his previous company Dose and from selling Mugglenet.com (which he founded). Emerson and Kat are romantic partners, and Emerson and Drew are brothers. They all live in the same house and travel across the world together, jumping from AirBnb to AirBnb once or twice per month. The staff they hire are either remote, or live in the house with them.</p><p>My current understanding is that they\u2019ve had around ~4 remote interns, 1 remote employee, and 2 in-person employees (Alice and Chloe). Alice was the only person to go through their incubator program.</p><p>Nonlinear tried to have a fairly high-commitment culture where the long-term staff are involved very closely with the core family unit, both personally and professionally. However they were given exceedingly little financial independence, and a number of the social dynamics involved seem really risky to me.</p><p><strong>Alice and Chloe</strong></p><p>Alice travelled with Nonlinear from November 2021 to June 2022 and started working for the org from around February, and Chloe worked there from January 2022 to July 2022. After talking with them both, I learned the following:</p><ul><li>Neither were legally employed by the non-profit at any point.</li><li>Chloe\u2019s and Alice\u2019s finances (along with Kat's and Drew's) all came directly from Emerson's personal funds (not from the non-profit). This left them having to get permission for their personal purchases, and they were not able to live apart from the family unit while they worked with them, and they report feeling very socially and financially dependent on the family during the time they worked there.</li><li>Chloe\u2019s salary was verbally agreed to come out to around $75k/year. However, she was only paid $1k/month, and otherwise had many basic things compensated i.e. rent, groceries, travel. This was supposed to make traveling together easier, and supposed to come out to the same salary level. While Emerson did compensate Alice and Chloe with food and board and travel, Chloe does not believe that she was compensated to an amount equivalent to the salary discussed, and I believe no accounting was done for either Alice or Chloe to ensure that any salary matched up. (I\u2019ve done some spot-checks of the costs of their AirBnbs and travel, and Alice/Chloe\u2019s epistemic state seems pretty reasonable to me.)</li><li>Alice joined as the sole person in their incubation program. She moved in with them after meeting Nonlinear at EAG and having a ~4 hour conversation there with Emerson, plus a second Zoom call with Kat. Initially while traveling with them she continued her previous job remotely, but was encouraged to quit and work on an incubated org, and after 2 months she quit her job and started working on projects with Nonlinear. Over the 8 months she was there Alice claims she received no salary for the first 5 months, then (roughly) $1k/month salary for 2 months, and then after she quit she received a ~$6k one-off salary payment (from the funds allocated for her incubated organization). She also had a substantial number of emergency health issues covered.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefylc0clu1ffa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnylc0clu1ffa\">[3]</a></sup></span></li><li>Salary negotiations were consistently a major stressor for Alice\u2019s entire time at Nonlinear. Over her time there she spent through all of her financial runway, and spent a significant portion of her last few months there financially in the red (having more bills and medical expenses than the money in her bank account) in part due to waiting on salary payments from Nonlinear. She eventually quit due to a combination of running exceedingly low on personal funds and wanting financial independence from Nonlinear, and as she quit she gave Nonlinear (on their request) full ownership of the organization that she had otherwise finished incubating.</li><li>From talking with both Alice and Nonlinear, it turned out that by the end of Alice\u2019s time working there, since the end of February Kat Woods had thought of Alice as an employee that she managed, but that Emerson had not thought of Alice as an employee, primarily just someone who was traveling with them and collaborating because she wanted to, and that the $1k/month plus other compensation was a generous gift.</li><li>Alice and Chloe reported that Kat, Emerson, and Drew created an environment in which being a valuable member of Nonlinear included being entrepreneurial and creative in problem-solving \u2014 in practice this often meant getting around standard social rules to get what you wanted was strongly encouraged, including getting someone\u2019s favorite table at a restaurant by pressuring the staff, and finding loopholes in laws pertaining to their work. This also applied internally to the organization. Alice and Chloe report being pressured into or convinced to take multiple actions that they seriously regretted whilst working for Nonlinear, such as becoming very financially dependent on Emerson, quitting being vegan, and driving without a license in a foreign country for many months. (To be clear I\u2019m not saying that these laws are good and that breaking them is bad, I\u2019m saying that it sounds to me from their reports like they were convinced to take actions that could have had severe personal downsides such as jail time in a foreign country, and that these are actions that they confidently believe they would not have taken had it not been due to the strong pressures they felt from the Nonlinear cofounders and the adversarial social environment internal to the company.) I\u2019ll describe these events in more detail below.</li><li>They both report taking multiple months to recover after ending ties with Nonlinear, before they felt able to work again, and both describe working there as one of the worst experiences of their lives.</li><li>They both report being actively concerned about professional and personal retaliation from Nonlinear for speaking to me, and told me stories and showed me some texts that led me to believe that was a very credible concern.</li></ul><h2>An assortment of reported experiences</h2><p>There are a lot of parts of their experiences at Nonlinear that these two staff found deeply unpleasant and hurtful. I will summarize a number of them below.</p><p>I think many of the things that happened are warning flags, I also think that there are some red lines, I\u2019ll discuss my thoughts on which are the red lines in my takeaways at the bottom of this post.</p><p><strong>My Level of Trust in These Reports</strong></p><p>Most of the dynamics were described to me as accurate by multiple different people (low pay, no legal structure, isolation, some elements of social manipulation, intimidation), leading me to have high confidence in them, and Nonlinear themselves confirmed various parts of these accounts.</p><p>People whose word I would meaningfully update on about this sort of thing have vouched for Chloe\u2019s word as reliable.</p><p>The Nonlinear staff and a small number of other people who visited during Alice and Chloe\u2019s employment have strongly questioned Alice\u2019s trustworthiness and suggested she has told outright lies. Nonlinear showed me texts where people who had spoken with Alice came away with the impression that she was paid $0 or $500, which is inaccurate (she was paid ~$8k on net, as she told me).&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I personally found Alice very willing and ready to share primary sources with me upon request (texts, bank info, etc), so I don\u2019t believe her to be acting in bad faith.</p><p>In my first conversation with her, Kat claimed that Alice had many catastrophic miscommunications, but that Chloe was (quote) \u201cfine\u201d. In general nobody questioned Chloe\u2019s word and broadly the people who told me they questioned Alice\u2019s word said they trusted Chloe\u2019s.</p><p>Personally I found all of their fears of retaliation to be genuine and earnest, and in my opinion justified.</p><p><strong>Why I\u2019m sharing these</strong></p><p>I do have a strong heuristic that says consenting adults can agree to all sorts of things that eventually hurt them (i.e. in accepting these jobs), even if I paternalistically might think I could have prevented them from hurting themselves. That said, I see clear reasons to think that Kat and Emerson intimidated these people into accepting some of the actions or dynamics that hurt them, so some parts do not seem obviously consensual to me.</p><p>Separate from that, I think it\u2019s good for other people to know what they\u2019re getting into, so I think sharing this info is good because it is relevant for many people who have any likelihood of working with Nonlinear. And most importantly to me, I especially want to do it because it seems to me that Nonlinear has tried to prevent this negative information from being shared, so I am erring strongly on the side of sharing things.</p><p>(One of the employees also wanted to say something about why she contributed to this post, and I've put it in a footnote here.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2ad0whew08p\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2ad0whew08p\">[4]</a></sup></span>)</p><p><strong>Highly dependent finances and social environment</strong></p><p>Everyone lived in the same house. Emerson and Kat would share a room, and the others would make do with what else was available, often sharing bedrooms.</p><p>Nonlinear primarily moved around countries where they typically knew no locals and the employees regularly had nobody to interact with other than the cofounders, and employees report that they were denied requests to live in a separate AirBnb from the cofounders.</p><p>Alice and Chloe report that they were advised not to spend time with \u2018low value people\u2019, including their families, romantic partners, and anyone local to where they were staying, with the exception of guests/visitors that Nonlinear invited. Alice and Chloe report this made them very socially dependent on Kat/Emerson/Drew and otherwise very isolated.</p><p>The employees were very unclear on the boundaries of what would and wouldn\u2019t be paid for by Nonlinear. For instance, Alice and Chloe report that they once spent several days driving around Puerto Rico looking for cheaper medical care for one of them before presenting it to senior staff, as they didn\u2019t know whether medical care would be covered, so they wanted to make sure that it was as cheap as possible to increase the chance of senior staff saying yes.</p><p>The financial situation is complicated and messy. This is in large-part due to them doing very little accounting. In summary Alice spent a lot of her last 2 months with less than \u20ac1000 in her bank account, sometimes having to phone Emerson for immediate transfers to be able to cover medical costs when she was visiting doctors. At the time of her quitting she had \u20ac700 in her account, which was not enough to cover her bills at the end of the month, and left her quite scared. Though to be clear she was paid back ~\u20ac2900 of her outstanding salary by Nonlinear within a week, in part due to her strongly requesting it. (The relevant thing here is the extremely high level of financial dependence and wealth disparity, but Alice does not claim that Nonlinear failed to pay them.)</p><p>One of the central reasons Alice says that she stayed on this long was because she was expecting financial independence with the launch of her incubated project that had $100k allocated to it (fundraised from FTX). In her final month there Kat informed her that while she would work quite independently, they would keep the money in the Nonlinear bank account and she would ask for it, meaning she wouldn\u2019t have the financial independence from them that she had been expecting, and learning this was what caused Alice to quit.</p><p>One of the employees interviewed Kat about her productivity advice, and shared notes from this interview with me. The employee writes:</p><blockquote><p>During the interview, Kat openly admitted to not being productive but shared that she still appeared to be productive because she gets others to do work for her. She relies on volunteers who are willing to do free work for her, which is her top productivity advice.</p></blockquote><p>The employees report that some interns later gave strongly negative feedback on working unpaid, and so Kat decided that she would no longer have interns at all.</p><p><strong>Severe downsides threatened if the working relationship didn\u2019t work out</strong></p><p>In a conversation between Emerson Spartz and one of the employees, the employee asked for advice for a friend that wanted to find another job while being employed, without letting their current employer know about their decision to leave yet. Emerson reportedly immediately stated that he now has to update towards considering that the said employee herself is considering leaving Nonlinear. He went on to tell her that he gets mad at his employees who leave his company for other jobs that are equally good or less good; he said he understands if employees leave for clearly better opportunities. The employee reports that this led them to be very afraid of leaving the job, both because of the way Emerson made the update on thinking the employee is now trying to leave, as well as the notion of Emerson being retaliative towards employees that leave for \u201cbad reasons\u201d.</p><p>For background context on Emerson\u2019s business philosophy: Alice quotes Emerson advising the following indicator of work progress: \"How much value are you able to extract from others in a short amount of time?\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft84or63yyei\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt84or63yyei\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Another person who visited described Emerson to me as \u201calways trying to use all of his bargaining power\u201d. Chloe told me that, when she was negotiating salaries with external partners on behalf of Nonlinear, Emerson advised her when negotiating salaries, to offer \"the lowest number you can get away with\".</p><p>Many different people reported that Emerson Spartz would boast about his business negotiations tactics to employees and visitors. He would encourage his employees to read many books on strategy and influence. When they read the book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197\"><u>The 48 Laws of Power</u></a> he would give examples of him following the \u201claws\u201d in his past business practices.</p><p>One story that he told to both employees and visitors was about his intimidation tactics when involved in a conflict with a former teenage mentee of his, Adorian Deck.&nbsp;</p><p>(For context on the conflict, here\u2019s links to articles written about it at the time:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/teen-who-created-omgfacts-twitter-182620/\"><u>Hollywood Reporter</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jacksonville.com/story/business/2011/05/16/california-teens-lawsuit-over-twitter-feed-underscores-power-tweet/15903568007/\"><u>Jacksonville</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2011/05/thoughts_on_the.htm\"><u>Technology &amp; Marketing Law Blog</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110513103830/https://emersonspartz.tumblr.com/post/5150292566\"><u>Emerson Spartz\u2019s Tumblr</u></a>. Plus here is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110824205315/http://www.omgfactslawsuit.com.s3.amazonaws.com/CONTRACT.pdf\"><u>Legal Contract</u></a> they signed that Deck later sued to undo.)</p><p>In brief, Adorian Deck was a 16 year-old who (in 2009) made a Twitter account called \u201cOMGFacts\u201d that quickly grew to having 300,000+ followers. Emerson reached out to build companies under the brand, and agreed to a deal with Adorian. Less than a year later Adorian wanted out of the deal, claiming that Emerson had made over $100k of profits and he\u2019d only seen $100, and sued to end the deal.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Emerson, it turned out that there\u2019s a clause unique to California (due to the acting profession in Los Angeles) where even if a minor and their parent signs a contract, it isn\u2019t valid unless the signing is overseen by a judge, and so they were able to simply pull out of the deal.</p><p>But to this day Emerson\u2019s company still owns the OMGfacts brand and companies and Youtube channels.</p><p>(Sidenote: I am not trying to make claims about who was \u201cin the right\u201d in these conflicts, I am reporting these as examples of Emerosn\u2019s negotiation tactics that he reportedly engages in and actively endorses during conflicts.)</p><p>Emerson told versions of this story to different people who I spoke to (people reported him as \u2018bragging\u2019).</p><p>In one version, he claimed that he strong-armed Adorian and his mother with endless legal threats and they backed down and left him with full control of the brand. This person I spoke to couldn\u2019t recall the details but said that Emerson tried to frighten Deck and his mother, and that they (the person Emerson was bragging to) found it \u201cfrightening\u201d and thought the behavior was \u201cbehavior that\u2019s like 7 standard deviations away from usual norms in this area.\u201d</p><p>Another person was told the story in the context of the 2nd Law from \u201c48 Laws of Power\u201d, which is \u201cNever put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies\u201d. The summary includes&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBe wary of friends\u2014they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical\u2026 you have more to fear from friends than from enemies.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>For this person who was told the Adorian story, the thing that resonated most when he told it was the claim that he was in a close, mentoring relationship with Adorian, and leveraged knowing him so well that he would know \u201cexactly where to go to hurt him the most\u201d so that he would back off. In that version of the story, he says that Deck\u2019s life-goal was to be a YouTuber (which is indeed Deck's profession until this day \u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AdorianDeck\"><u>he produces about 4 videos a month</u></a>), and that Emerson strategically contacted the YouTubers that Deck most admired, and told them stories of Deck being lazy and trying to take credit for all of Emerson's work. He reportedly threatened to do more of this until Deck relented, and this is why Deck gave up the lawsuit. The person said to me \u201cHe loved him, knew him really well, and destroyed him with that knowledge.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzcp7frumok\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzcp7frumok\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>I later spoke with Emerson about this. He does say that he was working with the top YouTubers to create videos exposing Deck, and this is what brought Deck back to the negotiating table. He says that he ended up renegotiating a contract where Deck receives $10k/month for 7 years. If true, I think this final deal reflects positively on Emerson, though I still believe the people he spoke to were actively scared by their conversations with Emerson on this subject. (I have neither confirmed the existence of the contract nor heard Deck\u2019s side of the story.)</p><p>He reportedly told another negotiation story about his response to getting scammed in a business deal. I won\u2019t go into the details, but reportedly he paid a high-price for the rights to a logo/trademark, only to find that he had not read the fine print and had been sold something far less valuable. He gave it as an example of the \"Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability\" strategy from The 48 Laws of Power:</p><blockquote><p>Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.</p></blockquote><p>In that business negotiation, he (reportedly) acted unhinged. According to the person I spoke with, he said he\u2019d call the counterparty and say \u201cbatshit crazy things\u201d and yell at them, with the purpose of making them think he\u2019s capable of anything, including dangerous and unethical things, and eventually they relented and gave him the deal he wanted.</p><p>Someone else I spoke to reported him repeatedly saying that he would be \u201cvery antagonistic\u201d toward people he was in conflict with. He reportedly gave the example that, if someone tried to sue him, he would be willing to go into legal gray areas in order to \u201ccrush his enemies\u201d (a phrase he apparently used a lot), including hiring someone to stalk the person and their family in order to freak them out. (Emerson denies having said this, and suggests that he was probably describing this as a strategy that someone&nbsp;<i>else</i> might use in a conflict that one ought to be aware of.)</p><p>After Chloe eventually quit, Alice reports that Kat/Emerson would \u201ctrash talk\u201d her, saying she was never an \u201cA player\u201d, criticizing her on lots of dimensions (competence, ethics, drama, etc) in spite of previously primarily giving Chloe high praise. This reportedly happened commonly toward other people who ended or turned down working together with Nonlinear.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some texts between Kat Woods and Alice shortly after Alice had quit, before the final salary had been paid.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/vre0zgb0jp6xdce9zyiw\"></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/ta7oyivo8tmhuhle0dls\"></p><p>A few months later, some more texts from Kat Woods.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/nfgvaf2rv6bbqws4uein\"></p><p>(I can corroborate that it was difficult to directly talk with the former employee and it took a fair bit of communication through indirect social channels before they were willing to identify themselves to me and talk about the details.)</p><p><strong>Effusive positive emotion not backed up by reality, and other manipulative techniques</strong></p><p>Multiple people who worked with Kat reported that Kat had a pattern of enforcing arbitrary short deadlines on people in order to get them to make the decision she wants e.g.&nbsp;<i>\u201cI need a decision by the end of this call\u201d</i>, or (in an email to Alice) \u201c<i>This is urgent and important. There are people working on saving the world and we can\u2019t let our issues hold them back from doing their work.\u201d&nbsp;</i></p><p>Alice reported feeling emotionally manipulated. She said she got constant compliments from the founders that ended up seeming fake.&nbsp;</p><p>Alice wrote down a string of the compliments at the time from Kat Woods (said out loud and that Alice wrote down in text), here is a sampling of them that she shared with me:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the kind of person I bet on, you\u2019re a beast, you\u2019re an animal, I think you are extraordinary\"</p><p>\"You can be in the top 10, you really just have to think about where you want to be, you have to make sacrifices to be on the top, you can be the best, only if you sacrifice enough\"</p><p>\"You\u2019re working more than 99% because you care more than 99% because you\u2019re a leader and going to save the world\"</p><p>\"You can\u2019t fail if you commit to [this project], you have what it takes, you get sh*t done and everyone will hail you in EA, finally an executor among us.\"</p></blockquote><p>Alice reported that she would get these compliments near-daily. She eventually had the sense that this was said in order to get something out of her. She reported that one time, after a series of such compliments, the Kat Woods then turned and recorded a near-identical series of compliments into their phone for a different person.</p><p>Kat Woods reportedly several times cried while telling Alice that she wanted the employee in their life forever and was worried that this employee would ever not be in Kat\u2019s life.</p><p>Other times when Alice would come to Kat with money troubles and asking for a pay rise, Alice reports that Kat would tell them that this was a psychological issue and that actually they had safety, for instance they could move back in with their parents, so they didn\u2019t need to worry.</p><p>Alice also reports that she was explicitly advised by Kat Woods to cry and look cute when asking Emerson Spartz for a salary improvement, in order to get the salary improvement that she wanted, and was told this was a reliable way to get things from Emerson. (Alice reports that she did not follow this advice.)</p><p><strong>Many other strong personal costs</strong></p><p>Alice quit being vegan while working there. She was sick with covid in a foreign country, with only the three Nonlinear cofounders around, but nobody in the house was willing to go out and get her vegan food, so she barely ate for 2 days. Alice eventually gave in and ate non-vegan food in the house. She also said that the Nonlinear cofounders marked her quitting veganism as a \u2018win\u2019, as they thad been arguing that she should not be vegan.</p><p>(Nonlinear disputes this, and says that they did go out and buy her some vegan burgers food and had some vegan food in the house. They agree that she quit being vegan at this time, and say it was because being vegan was unusually hard due to being in Puerto Rico. Alice disputes that she received any vegan burgers.)</p><p>Alice said that this generally matched how she and Chloe were treated in the house, as people generally not worth spending time on, because they were \u2018low value\u2019 (i.e. in terms of their hourly wage), and that they were the people who had to do chores around the house (e.g. Alice was still asked to do house chores during the period where she was sick and not eating).</p><p>By the same reasoning, the employees reported that they were given 100% of the menial tasks around the house (cleaning, tidying, etc) due to their lower value of time to the company. For instance, if a cofounder spilled food in the kitchen, the employees would clean it up. This was generally reported as feeling very demeaning.</p><p>Alice and Chloe reported a substantial conflict within the household between Kat and Alice. Alice was polyamorous, and she and Drew entered into a casual romantic relationship. Kat previously had a polyamorous marriage that ended in divorce, and is now monogamously partnered with Emerson. Kat reportedly told Alice that she didn't mind polyamory \"on the other side of the world\u201d, but couldn't stand it right next to her, and probably either Alice would need to become monogamous or Alice should leave the organization. Alice didn't become monogamous. Alice reports that Kat became increasingly cold over multiple months, and was very hard to work with.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuvloifuhbna\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuvloifuhbna\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>Alice reports then taking a vacation to visit her family, and trying to figure out how to repair the relationship with Kat. Before she went on vacation, Kat requested that Alice bring a variety of illegal drugs across the border for her (some recreational, some for productivity). Alice argued that this would be dangerous for her personally, but Emerson and Kat reportedly argued that it is not dangerous at all and was \u201cabsolutely risk-free\u201d. Privately, Drew said that Kat would \u201clove her forever\u201d if she did this. I bring this up as an example of the sorts of requests that Kat/Emerson/Drew felt comfortable making during Alice\u2019s time there.</p><p>Chloe was hired by Nonlinear with the intent to have them do executive assistant tasks for Nonlinear (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211022160447/https://www.nonlinear.org/operations.html\"><u>this is the job ad they responded to</u></a>). After being hired and flying out, Chloe was informed that on a daily basis their job would involve driving e.g. to get groceries when they were in different countries. She explained that she didn\u2019t have a drivers\u2019 license and didn\u2019t know how to drive. Kat/Emerson proposed that Chloe learn to drive, and Drew gave her some driving lessons. When Chloe learned to drive well enough in parking lots, she said she was ready to get her license, but she discovered that she couldn\u2019t get a license in a foreign country. Kat/Emerson/Drew reportedly didn\u2019t seem to think that mattered or was even part of the plan, and strongly encouraged Chloe to just drive without a license to do their work, so she drove ~daily for 1-2 months without a license. (I think this involved physical risks for the employee and bystanders, and also substantial risks of being in jail in a foreign country. Also, Chloe basically never drove Emerson/Drew/Kat, this was primarily solo driving for daily errands.) Eventually Chloe had a minor collision with a street post, and was a bit freaked out because she had no idea what the correct protocols were. She reported that Kat/Emerson/Drew didn\u2019t think that this was a big deal, but that Alice (who she was on her way to meet) could clearly see that Chloe was distressed by this, and Alice drove her home, and Chloe then decided to stop driving.</p><p>(Car accidents are the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading_causes_of_injury_deaths_highlighting_unintentional_2018-508.pdf\"><u>second most common cause of death</u></a> for people in their age group. Insofar as they were pressured to do this and told that this was safe, I think this involved a pretty cavalier disregard for the safety of the person who worked for them.)</p><p>Chloe talked to a friend of hers (who is someone I know fairly well, and was the first person to give me a negative report about Nonlinear), reporting that they were very depressed. When Chloe described her working conditions, her friend was horrified, and said she had to get out immediately since, in their words, \u201cthis was clearly an abusive situation\u201d. The friend offered to pay for flights out of the country, and tried to convince her to quit immediately. Eventually Chloe made a commitment to book a flight by a certain date and then followed through with that.</p><p><strong>Lax on legalities and adversarial business practices</strong></p><p>I did not find the time to write much here. For now I\u2019ll simply pass on my impressions.</p><p>I generally got a sense from speaking with many parties that Emerson Spartz and Kat Woods respectively have very adversarial and very lax attitudes toward legalities and bureaucracies, with the former trying to do as little as possible that is asked of him. If I asked them to fill out paperwork I would expect it was filled out at least reluctantly and plausibly deceptively or adversarially in some way. In my current epistemic state, I would be actively concerned about any project in the EA or x-risk ecosystems that relied on Nonlinear doing any accounting or having a reliable legal structure that has had the basics checked.</p><p>Personally, if I were giving Nonlinear funds for any project whatsoever, including for regranting, I\u2019d expect it\u2019s quite plausible (&gt;20%) that they didn\u2019t spend the funds on what they told me, and instead will randomly spend it on some other project. If I had previously funded Nonlinear for any projects, I would be keen to ask Nonlinear for receipts to show whether they spent their funds in accordance with what they said they would.</p><p><strong>This is not a complete list</strong></p><p>I want to be clear that this is not a&nbsp;<i>complete</i> list of negative or concerning experiences, this is an&nbsp;<i>illustrative</i> list. There are many other things that I was told about that I am not including here due to factors like length and people\u2019s privacy (on all sides). Also I split them up into the categories as I see them; someone else might make a different split.</p><p><strong>Perspectives From Others Who Have Worked or Otherwise Been Close With Nonlinear</strong></p><p>I had hoped to work this into a longer section of quotes, but it seemed like too much back-and-forth with lots of different people. I encourage folks to leave comments with their relevant impressions.</p><p>For now I\u2019ll summarize some of what I learned as follows:</p><ul><li>Several people gave reports consistent with Alice and Chloe being very upset and distressed both during and after their time at Nonlinear, and reaching out for help, and seeming really strongly to want to get away from Nonlinear.</li><li>Some unpaid interns (who worked remotely for Nonlinear for 1-3 months) said that they regretted not getting paid, and that when they brought it up with Kat Woods she said some positive sounding things and they expected she would get back to them about it, but that never happened during the rest of their internships.</li><li>Many people who visited had fine experiences with Nonlinear, others felt much more troubled by the experience.</li><li>One person said to me about Emerson/Drew/Kat:<ul><li><i>\"My subjective feeling is like 'they seemed to be really bad and toxic people'. And they at the same time have a decent amount of impact. After I interacted repeatedly with them I was highly confused about the dilemma of people who are mistreating other people, but are doing some good.\"</i></li></ul></li><li>Another person said about Emerson:<ul><li><i>\u201cHe seems to think he\u2019s extremely competent, a genius, and that everyone else is inferior to him. They should learn everything they can from him, he has nothing to learn from them. He said things close to this explicitly. Drew and (to a lesser extent) Kat really bought into him being the new messiah.\u201d</i></li></ul></li><li>One person who has worked for Kat Woods (not Alice or Chloe) said the following:<ul><li><i>I love her as a person, hate her as a boss. She\u2019s fun, has a lot of ideas, really good socialite, and I think that that speaks to how she\u2019s able to get away with a lot of things. Able to wear different masks in different places. She\u2019s someone who\u2019s easy to trust, easy to build social relationships with. I\u2019d be suspicious of anyone who gives a reference who\u2019s never been below Kat in power.</i></li><li><i>Ben: Do you think Kat is emotionally manipulative?</i></li><li><i>I think she is. I think it\u2019s a fine line about what makes an excellent entrepreneur. Do whatever it takes to get a deal signed. To get it across the line. Depends a lot on what the power dynamics are, whether it\u2019s a problem or not. If people are in equal power structures it\u2019s less of a problem.</i></li></ul></li></ul><p>There were other informative conversations that I won\u2019t summarize. I encourage folks who have worked with or for Nonlinear to comment with their perspective.</p><h2>Conversation with Nonlinear</h2><p>After putting the above together, I got permission from Alice and Chloe to publish, and to share the information I had learned as I saw fit. So I booked a call with Nonlinear, sent them a long list of concerns, and talked with Emerson, Kat and Drew for ~3 hours to hear them out.</p><p><strong>Paraphrasing Nonlinear</strong></p><p>On the call, they said their primary intention in the call was to convince me that Alice is a bald-faced liar. They further said they\u2019re terrified of Alice making false claims about them, and that she is in a powerful position to hurt them with false accusations.</p><p>Afterwards, I wrote up a paraphrase of their responses. I shared it with Emerson and he replied that it was a \u201cGood summary!\u201d. Below is the paraphrase of their perspective on things that I sent them, with one minor edit for privacy. (The below is written as though Nonlinear is speaking, but to be clear this 100% my writing.)</p><ul><li>We hired one person, and kind-of-technically-hired a second person. In doing so, our intention wasn't just to have employees, but also to have members of our family unit who we traveled with and worked closely together with in having a strong positive impact in the world, and were very personally close with.</li><li>We nomadically traveled the globe. This can be quite lonely so we put a lot of work into bringing people to us, often having visitors in our house who we supported with flights and accommodation. This probably wasn't perfect but in general we'd describe the environment as \"quite actively social\".</li><li>For the formal employee, she responded to a job ad, we interviewed her, and it all went the standard way. For the gradually-employed employee, we initially just invited her to travel with us and co-work, as she seemed like a successful entrepreneur and aligned in terms of our visions for improving the world. Over time she quit her existing job and we worked on projects together and were gradually bringing her into our organization.</li><li>We wanted to give these employees a pretty standard amount of compensation, but also mostly not worry about negotiating minor financial details as we traveled the world. So we covered basic rent/groceries/travel for these people. On top of that, to the formal employee we gave a $1k/month salary, and to the semi-formal employee we eventually did the same too. For the latter employee, we roughly paid her ~$8k over the time she worked with us.</li><li>From our perspective, the gradually-hired employees gave a falsely positive impression of their financial and professional situation, suggesting they'd accomplished more than they had and were earning more than they had. They ended up being fairly financially dependent on us and we didn't expect that.</li><li>Eventually, after about 6-8 months each, both employees quit. Overall this experiment went poorly from our perspective and we're not going to try it in future.</li><li>For the formal employee, we're a bit unsure about why exactly she quit, even though we did do exit interviews with her. She said she didn't like a lot of the menial work (which is what we hired her for), but didn't say that money was the problem. We think it is probably related to everyone getting Covid and being kind of depressed around that time.</li><li>For the other employee, relations got bad for various reasons. She ended up wanting total control of the org she was incubating with us, rather than 95% control as we'd discussed, but that wasn't on the table (the org had $250k dedicated to it that we'd raised!), and so she quit.</li><li>When she was leaving, we were financially supportive. On the day we flew back from the Bahamas to London, we paid all our outstanding reimbursements (~$2900). We also offered to pay for her to have a room in London for a week as she got herself sorted out. We also offered her rooms with our friends if she promised not to tell them lies about us behind our backs.</li><li>After she left, we believe she told a lot of lies and inaccurate stories about us. For instance, two people we talked to had the impression that we either paid her $0 or $500, which is demonstrably false. Right now we're pretty actively concerned that she is telling lots of false stories in order to paint us in a negative light, because the relationship didn't work out and she didn't get control over her org (and because her general character seems drama-prone).</li></ul><p>There were some points around the experiences of these employees that we want to respond to.</p><ul><li>First; the formal employee drove without a license for 1-2 months in Puerto Rico. We taught her to drive, which she was excited about. You might think this is a substantial legal risk, but basically it isn't, as you can see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/laws-of-puerto-rico/title-nine-highways-and-traffic/chapter-27-vehicle-and-traffic-law-2000/subchapter-ii-requirements-and-procedure-for-issuance-expiration-and-renewal-of-drivers-licenses/5073-illegal-use-of-the-driving-license-and-penalties\"><u>here</u></a>, the general range of fines for issues around not-having-a-license in Puerto Rico is in the range of $25 to $500, which just isn't that bad.</li><li>Second; the semi-employee said that she wasn't supported in getting vegan food when she was sick with Covid, and this is why she stopped being vegan. This seems also straightforwardly inaccurate, we brought her potatoes, vegan burgers, and had vegan food in the house. We had been advising her to 80/20 being a vegan and this probably also weighed on her decision.</li><li>Third; the semi-employee was also asked to bring some productivity-related and recreational drugs over the border for us. In general we didn't push hard on this. For one, this is an activity she already did (with other drugs). For two, we thought it didn't need prescription in the country she was visiting, and when we found out otherwise, we dropped it. And for three, she used a bunch of our drugs herself, so it's not fair to say that this request was made entirely selfishly. I think this just seems like an extension of the sorts of actions she's generally open to.</li></ul><p>Finally, multiple people (beyond our two in-person employees) told Ben they felt frightened or freaked out by some of the business tactics in the stories Emerson told them. To give context and respond to that:</p><ul><li>I, Emerson, have had a lot of exceedingly harsh and cruel business experience, including getting tricked or stabbed-in-the-back. Nonetheless, I have often prevailed in these difficult situations, and learned a lot of hard lessons about how to act in the world.</li><li>The skills required to do so seem to me lacking in many of the earnest-but-naive EAs that I meet, and I would really like them to learn how to be strong in this way. As such, I often tell EAs these stories, selecting for the most cut-throat ones, and sometimes I try to play up the harshness of how you have to respond to the threats. I think of myself as playing the role of a wise old mentor who has had lots of experience, telling stories to the young adventurers, trying to toughen them up, somewhat similar to how Prof Quirrell<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref03ez0hl92kmc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn03ez0hl92kmc\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;toughens up the students in HPMOR through teaching them Defense Against the Dark Arts, to deal with real monsters in the world.</li><li>For instance, I tell people about my negotiations with Adorian Deck about the OMGFacts brand and Twitter account. We signed a good deal, but a California technicality meant he could pull from it and take my whole company, which is a really illegitimate claim. They wouldn't talk with me, so I was working with top YouTubers to make some videos publicizing and exposing his bad behavior. This got him back to the negotiation table and we worked out a deal where he got $10k/month for seven years, which is not a shabby deal, and meant that I got to keep my company!</li><li>It had been reported to Ben that Emerson said he would be willing to go into legal gray areas in order to \"crush his enemies\" (if they were acting in very reprehensible and norm-violating ways). Emerson thinks this has got to be a misunderstanding, that he was talking about what other people might do to you, which is a crucial thing to discuss and model.</li></ul><p>(Here I cease pretending-to-be-Nonlinear and return to my own voice.)</p><h2>My thoughts on the ethics and my takeaways</h2><p><strong>Summary of My Epistemic State</strong></p><p>Here are my probabilities for a few high-level claims relating to Alice and Chloe\u2019s experiences working at Nonlinear.</p><ul><li>Emerson Spartz employs more vicious and adversarial tactics in conflicts than 99% of the people active in the EA/x-risk/AI Safety communities: 95%</li><li>Alice and Chloe were more dependent on their bosses (combining financial, social, and legally) than employees are at literally every other organization I am aware of in the EA/x-risk/AI Safety ecosystem: 85%<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpwa0kj9axw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpwa0kj9axw\">[9]</a></sup></span></li><li>In working at Nonlinear Alice and Chloe were both took on physical and legal risks that they strongly regretted, were hurt emotionally, came away financially worse off, gained ~no professional advancement from their time at Nonlinear, and took several months after the experience to recover: 90%</li><li>Alice and Chloe both had credible reason to be very scared of retaliation for sharing negative information about their work experiences, far beyond that experienced at any other org in the EA/x-risk/AI Safety ecosystem: 85%<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyl41dasvaar\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyl41dasvaar\">[10]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p><strong>General Comments From Me</strong></p><p>Going forward I think anyone who works with Kat Woods, Emerson Spartz, or Drew Spartz, should sign legal employment contracts, and make sure all financial agreements are written down in emails and messages that the employee has possession of. I think all people considering employment by the above people at any non-profits they run should take salaries where money is wired to their bank accounts, and not do unpaid work or work that is compensated by ways that don\u2019t primarily include a salary being wired to their bank accounts.</p><p>I expect that if Nonlinear does more hiring in the EA ecosystem it is more-likely-than-not to chew up and spit out other bright-eyed young EAs who want to do good in the world. I relatedly think that the EA ecosystem doesn\u2019t have reliable defenses against such predators. These are not the first, nor sadly the last, bright-eyed well-intentioned people who I expect to be taken advantage of and hurt in the EA/x-risk/AI safety ecosystem, as a result of falsely trusting high-status people at EA events to be people who will treat them honorably.</p><p>(Personal aside: Regarding the texts from Kat Woods shown above \u2014 I have to say, if you want to be allies with me, you must not write texts like these. A lot of bad behavior can be learned from, fixed, and forgiven, but if you take actions to prevent me from being able to learn that the bad behavior is even going on, then I have to always be worried that something far worse is happening that I\u2019m not aware of, and indeed I have been&nbsp;<i>quite</i> shocked to discover how bad people\u2019s experiences were working for Nonlinear.)</p><p>My position is not greatly changed by the fact that Nonlinear is overwhelmingly confident that Alice is a \u201cbald-faced liar\u201d. From my current perspective, they probably have some legitimate grievances against her, but that in no way makes it less costly to our collective epistemology to incentivize her to not share her own substantial grievances. I think the magnitude of the costs they imposed on their employees-slash-new-family are far higher than I or anyone I know would have expected was happening, and they intimidated both Alice and Chloe into silence about those costs. If it were only Alice then I would give this perspective a lot more thought/weight, but Chloe reports a lot of the same dynamics and similar harms.</p><p>To my eyes, the people involved were genuinely concerned about retaliation for saying anything negative about Nonlinear, including the workplace/household dynamics and how painful their experiences had been for them. That\u2019s a red line in my book, and I will not personally work with Nonlinear in the future because of it, and I recommend their exclusion from any professional communities that wish to keep up the standard of people not being silenced about extremely negative work experiences. \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HiFromMichaelV/status/1161174071469641728\"><u>First they came for the epistemology. We don't know what happened after that.</u></a>\u201d</p><p>Specifically, the things that cross my personal lines for working with someone or viewing them as an ally:</p><ul><li>Kat Woods attempted to offer someone who was really hurting, and in a position of strong need, very basic resources with the requirement of not saying bad things about her.</li><li>Kat Woods\u2019 texts that read to me as a veiled threat to destroy someone\u2019s career for sharing negative information about her.</li><li>Emerson Spartz reportedly telling multiple people he will use questionably legal methods in order to crush his enemies (such as spurious lawsuits and that he would hire a stalker to freak someone out).</li><li>Both employees were actively afraid that Emerson Spartz would retaliate and potentially using tactics like spurious lawsuits and further things that are questionably legal, and generally try to destroy their careers and leave them with no resources. It seems to me (given the other reports I\u2019ve heard from visitors) that Emerson behaved in a way that quite understandably led them to this epistemic state, and I consider that to be his responsibility to not give his employees this impression.</li></ul><p>I think in almost any functioning professional ecosystem, there should be some general principles like:</p><ul><li>If you employ someone, after they work for you, unless they've done something egregiously wrong or unethical, they should be comfortable continuing to work and participate in this professional ecosystem.</li><li>If you employ someone, after they work for you, they should feel comfortable talking openly about their experience working with you to others in this professional ecosystem.</li></ul><p>Any breaking of the first rule is very costly, and any breaking of the second rule is by-default a red-line for me not being willing to work with you.</p><p>I do think that there was a nearby world where Alice, having run out of money, gave in and stayed at Nonlinear, begging them for money, and becoming a fully dependent and subservient house pet \u2014 a world where we would not have learned the majority of this information. I think we're not that far from that world, I think a weaker person than Alice might have never quit, and it showed a lot of strength to quit at the point where you have ~no runway left and you have heard the above stories about the kinds of things Emerson Spartz considers doing to former business partners that he is angry with.</p><p>I\u2019m very grateful to the two staff members involved for coming forward and eventually spending dozens of hours clarifying and explaining their experiences to me and others who were interested. To compensate them for their courage, the time and effort spent to talk with me and explain their experiences at some length, and their permission to allow me to publish a lot of this information, I (using personal funds) am going to pay them each $5,000 after publishing this post.</p><p>I think that whistleblowing is generally a difficult experience, with a lot riding on the fairly personal account from fallible human beings. It\u2019s neither the case that everything reported should be accepted without question, nor that if some aspect is learned to be exaggerated or misreported that the whole case should be thrown out.

To avoid this, I started off by saying that my decision to quit is final, and not an ultimatum that warrants negotiation of what would make me want to stay. I did offer to elaborate on the reasons for why I was leaving. As I was explaining my reasons, she still insisted on offering me solutions to things I would say I wanted, to see if that would make me change my mind anyway.&nbsp; One of the reasons I listed was the lack of financial freedom in not having my salary be paid out as a salary which I could allocate towards decisions like choices in accommodation for myself, as well as meals and travel decisions. She wanted to know how much I wanted to be paid. I kept evading the question since it seemed to tackle the wrong part of the problem. Eventually I quoted back the number I had heard her reference to when she\u2019d talk about what my salary is equivalent to, suggesting that if they\u2019d pay out the 75k as a salary instead of the compensation package, then that would in theory solve the salary issue. There was a miscommunication around her believing that I wanted that to be paid out on top of the living expenses - I wanted financial freedom and a legal salary. I believe the miscommunication stems from me mentioning that salaries are more expensive for employers to pay out as they also have to pay tax on the salaries, e.g. social benefits, pension (depending on the country). Kat was surprised to hear that and understood it as me wanting a 75k salary&nbsp;<i>before taxes</i>. I do not remember that conversation concluding with her thinking I wanted everything paid for&nbsp;<i>and also</i> 75k.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnylc0clu1ffa\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefylc0clu1ffa\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Note that Nonlinear and Alice gave conflicting reports about which month she started getting paid, February vs April.

The guiding thought here is, as Ben asked, \"What would you tell your friend if they wanted to start working for this organization?\" I would want my friend to be able to make their own independent decision, having read about my experience and the experiences of others who have worked there. My main goal is to create a world where we can all work together towards a safe, long and prosperous future, and anything that takes away from that (like conflict and drama) is bad and I have generally avoided it. Even when I was working at Nonlinear, I remember saying several times that I just wanted to work on what was important and didn't want to get involved in their interpersonal drama. But it's hard for me to imagine a future where situations like that are just overlooked and other people get hurt when it could have been stopped or flagged before. I want to live in a world where everyone is safe and cared for. For most of my life I have avoided learning about anything to do with manipulation, power frameworks and even personality disorders. By avoiding them, I also missed the opportunity to protect myself and others from dangerous situations.

For the purposes of this post, I will refer to the set of values reflecting the self-interest of an individual agent as \u201cselfish\u201d and the set of values reflecting the interests of all future generations in addition to the current as \u201caltruistic.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Let us consider a world in which the creation of AGI entails X-risks (risks of extinction) that decrease over time with development of alignment capabilities. In this world, in the event that an X-risk does not materialize, AGI would also be likely to able to cure aging and allow for lives of joy beyond imagination for the current generation and all future generations.&nbsp;</p><p>So, consider a situation in which one could activate AGI today with an X-risk of 50% or it would be released in 70 years with an X-risk of 1%. To an agent who is 55 years old, the coin-flip may make sense, from a selfish perspective: there is a 50% chance of living millennia in bliss and a 50% chance of dying vs. a very high chance of living 15-50 years longer. From a strictly selfish perspective, this gamble might make sense. Conversely, from an altruistic perspective, such a coin flip would be abhorrent: you are risking quadrillions upon quadrillions of blissful future lives for the benefit of yourself and the relatively small cohort who could benefit from the acceleration.</p><p>Of course, the addition of S-Risks (risks of creating worlds of immense suffering) could change the selfish equation as a selfish agent may view significant risks of subjecting him or herself to hell to be unacceptable. But agents may believe themselves capable of identifying an S-Risk emergence and capable of committing suicide (translating a personal S-Risk into an X-Risk).</p><p>I think this potential for huge risk-tolerance divergence from egoists vs utilitarians and others who care about future generations is worth noting as we consider policies for Artificial General Intelligence. We probably want to make sure that institutions involved appropriately factor in the interests of future generations, because gambling with our own lives, given the possible benefits, may make selfish sense to some.</p>", "user": {"username": "Brad West"}}, {"_id": "9ddheDChiMhveCfSw", "title": "What do XPT results tell us about biorisk?", "postedAt": "2023-09-13T20:05:23.797Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This post was co-authored by the Forecasting Research Institute and Bridget Williams.

Participants were later grouped into teams to discuss their forecasts and develop a team forecast. Teams were asked to combine their rationales into a team wiki describing the strongest argument for the team\u2019s median forecast, along with rationales for lower- and higher-end forecasts that they considered plausible, and key areas of disagreement and uncertainty.</p><p>The arguments discussed below are taken from the rationales in team wikis. Forecasters participated in the team wiki process to varying degrees and not all arguments or reasoning will be captured here. As such these arguments should not be taken to present an exhaustive review of forecasters\u2019 opinions, or as a consensus view of XPT participants.</p><h2>Arguments related to risks from natural pathogens</h2><p><strong>Base rates</strong></p><p>Forecasters disagreed about the base rates of major epidemics. Many expressed uncertainty about the time period to use as a reference class and uncertainty in the accuracy of evidence, particularly for events many centuries ago. Team rationales usually mentioned base rates of a pathogen killing more than 1% of the population in a five-year period of between 0.1% to 0.5% annual risk, and most commonly mentioned 0.3% to 0.35%, a rate that varied with the time period chosen and the events included. Several teams noted that extrapolation of this base rate would imply a ~20-24% probability of this outcome occurring by 2100.</p><p>Forecasters noted several ways that developments in technology would alter risks from the historical base rate. Forecasters presented many considerations that would suggest deviating from this base rate, often not providing judgment on how these considerations weighed against each other. However, medians lower than that implied by the historical base rate suggested that most forecasters believed the risk posed by natural pathogens had decreased.</p><p><strong>Changes in demographics, travel, and land use</strong></p><p>Climate change and changing patterns of land use (including population density patterns and agricultural land use) may increase the risk of pathogen emergence. Travel and global connectivity increase the speed at which a pathogen can spread, which can increase risk. Several teams also noted that aging populations may be at higher risk of pandemics.</p><p>On the other hand, one team noted that many of the worst historical epidemics occurred when a pathogen was introduced to an immunologically-naive population (such as the introduction of smallpox to the Americas). In our globally-connected world, large-scale mortality would now require a novel human pathogen to emerge, rather than an existing pathogen simply spreading into a new population.</p><p><strong>Technology and improved health</strong></p><p>Forecasters noted that advances in medicine and public health \u2014 including antibiotics, vaccines, and disease surveillance \u2014 as well as improvement in human health more broadly, reduce the likelihood of widespread mortality from pathogens and provide a reason to deviate from the historical base rate. Most forecasters expected technology to provide more ways to combat disease in the future:</p><p><i>\u201cModern medicine has already vastly reduced the risk of death from pathogens and is likely to continue to reduce that risk. In particular, the faster development of vaccines is likely to prevent slower spreading pathogens killing so many people, leading to milder, more controllable, pandemics . . .&nbsp;Far better pandemic-prevention education and public hygiene relative to prior eras in which non-genetically engineered pathogens killed 1% or more of humans over a five-year period.\u201d</i></p><h2>Arguments related to risks of engineered or released pathogens</h2><p><strong>Base rates</strong></p><p>Forecasters disagreed about the base rates of laboratory-escaped pathogens and bioweapons use. As well as uncertainty about the appropriate time period to use as a reference class, forecasters also disagreed on whether to count only instances of confirmed, successful bioweapons use, to include attempted or suspected use of bioweapons, or to include instances where such a weapon may have been used if it had been obtainable. Similarly, forecasters disagreed on whether to include only confirmed instances of laboratory escape, or suspected instances or near miss events.</p><p>Most forecasters opted to count only actual instances that would have resolved the question, rather than attempted use, which resulted in a zero base rate for most bioweapons use questions. The exception was state bioweapons use causing at least 1,000 deaths, with forecasters usually using a non-zero base rate, including the Japanese use of bioweapons against China during World War II and sometimes earlier incidents such as the Siege of Caffa and colonial use of smallpox against Indigenous peoples of America and Australia.</p><p><strong>Impact of technology</strong></p><p>Most teams suggested that technology would make it easier to synthesize or manipulate pathogens in the future, increasing the number of actors who have the capacity to create a dangerous pathogen. Several forecasters suggested that it would be easier to create dangerous pathogens than to defend against them. However, forecasters disagreed on how easy it would be to create a pathogen with the necessary virulence and transmissibility:</p><p><i>\u201cThere are two types of disagreement in relation to this question . . . The first disagreement is how difficult it is to engineer a sufficiently lethal virus to satisfy the question criteria . . . The second disagreement relates to the probability of an engineered virus being 'successfully' used if it exists.\u201d</i></p><p><strong>The strategic value of bioweapons</strong></p><p>Many forecasters suggested that bioweapons have limited strategic value, to nation states and non-state actors. Forecasters noted the inability to target a bioweapon, the absence of previous examples of effective bioweapons, and the difficulty and cost of developing bioweapons. Given these difficulties, many questioned why actors would pursue bioweapons given the availability of other weapons that don\u2019t face these problems. As one forecaster noted:</p><p><i>\u201cWith so many other ways to kill people\u2014bullets, poisons, nukes, and so on\u2014that are more easily aimed at the intended target, I'm struggling to see the incentive for a state to resort to biological weapons on a mass scale.\u201d</i></p><p>However, some forecasters noted some circumstances where bioweapons may be thought to have strategic value. The indiscriminate mass harm that bioweapons may pose could be valuable to non-nuclear states and non-state actors may seek a weapon of mass destruction for deterrence, or omnicidal non-state actors. Some forecasters also suggested that technology may overcome some of the existing limitations to bioweapons, including through making them easier and cheaper to develop, and possibly enabling bioweapons that may be targeted (through genetic targeting or by creating immunity within a specific population).</p><h1>Comparison to other estimates</h1><p>These results add to existing estimates of biorisk extinction and existential risk (shown in the table below). These estimates are for slightly different outcomes, which complicates comparison. However, the extinction risk estimates of the XPT biorisk experts were 3x lower than the existential risk estimate presented by Toby Ord in <i>The Precipice</i>. The XPT superforecaster&nbsp;median estimate was two orders of magnitude lower than Ord\u2019s.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 0%);border-style:solid\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Source</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Forecast</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Outcome</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><a href=\"https://theprecipice.com/\"><u>Ord 2020</u></a></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">3.3%</td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Existential catastrophe by 2120</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf\"><u>Sandberg &amp; Bostrom 2008</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">2.05%</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Human extinction by 2100</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>XPT biorisk experts (n=7)</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgr3v7ire8x\"><sup><a href=\"#fngr3v7ire8x\">[16]</a></sup></span></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>1.01%</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Human extinction (&lt;5,000 population) by 2100</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/2568/ragnar%25C3%25B6k-seriesresults-so-far/\"><u>Metaculus 2021</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">0.17%</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">&gt;95% population decline by 2100</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>XPT superforecasters (n=77)</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>0.012%</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Human extinction (&lt;5,000 population) by 2100</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291086909_12_Risks_that_threaten_human_civilisation_The_case_for_a_new_risk_category\"><u>Pamlin &amp; Armstrong 2015</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">0.01%</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Infinite impact by 2115</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Of the anthropogenic risks that were asked about in the XPT (AI, nuclear, and biorisk)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs21vzs2qxs\"><sup><a href=\"#fns21vzs2qxs\">[17]</a></sup></span>, biorisk was considered the least likely to cause a catastrophe or human extinction, by all groups in the XPT, including superforecasters, all experts taken as a single group, and each type of expert group included in the tournament\u2014 domain, non-domain, and generalist x-risk expert.

Experts generally predicted greater risk of pathogens causing significant mortality, particularly from engineered pathogens. However, when asked about several pathways to risk (lab-escaped pathogens and bioweapons use), the estimates of the groups were fairly similar.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm286s24dxn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm286s24dxn\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;What should we make of this? One possibility is that one (or both) of the groups are not connecting their overall risk estimates with their estimates of specific risk pathways. Another possibility is that the experts are considering pathways to risk that aren\u2019t captured by the questions asked in the XPT, such as the intentional release of a pathogen by an AI (and assuming that this would not be considered a non-state actor).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpyp8215q35\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpyp8215q35\">[19]</a></sup></span></p><p>It is unclear how these results should inform risk estimates, including which group we should trust more on these questions. Although superforecasters have a track record of accurate prediction, this is largely on short-run questions and it\u2019s an open question whether this will translate to longer-run questions such as those asked in the XPT. It\u2019s also worth noting that for some questions, there were only a small number of expert respondents, and even the full group of biorisk experts are unlikely to be representative of the field, given we aimed to recruit some experts with an interest in existential risk. Two XPT questions related to biorisk but not discussed in this post \u2014 on malaria mortality and mRNA vaccines \u2014 will resolve in 2024 and will provide some more information on the groups\u2019 accuracy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbeirk8oogij\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbeirk8oogij\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>A limitation of the XPT is that it asked forecasters to provide their all-things-considered estimate of outcomes. This required them to make assumptions about the likelihood of various policies being implemented. In future, it may be useful to ask forecasters to provide estimates of risk conditional on different policies being implemented\u2014 or to ask a greater number of shorter-run questions that could inform assessments of the expected impact of policy options, such as the number of detected episodes of zoonotic spillover, the proportion of synthetic DNA companies that voluntarily conduct customer and order screening, the number of individuals who graduate with virology degrees, or the progress of AI in understanding biology.</p><p>If nothing else, the XPT results provide an indication of how a group of superforecasters, and a subset of biorisk experts (although not necessarily a representative sample) think about biorisk, including the magnitude of risks and some pathways to risk. As questions resolve in the future we will have more information to assess the accuracy of these groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Appendix 1</h1><p>Links to question details and summaries in the XPT report for biorisk questions</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Question</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Page for question details</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Page for question summary</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">1.

Below, you can find the results of these activities.</li><li>Main outcomes<ul><li>Importance/general Demand:<br>Roughly twice as many people expressed interest in mental health as a cause area (N = 164) compared to those interested in resources for individuals with a background in psychology or how to make an impact with various psychology-related topics (N = 76/77)&nbsp;</li><li>Neglectedness:&nbsp;<br>The EA Psychology Research Initiative by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eapsychology.org/\"><u>Lucius Caviola, among others</u></a>, appears to meet the infrastructural needs around general psychology-related impact regarding longtermist goals. Those infrastructural needs around helping people to have an impact in the mental health space do not yet seem to be covered, even though the work of the HLI paved the way for mental health as a cause area taken seriously within EA.&nbsp;</li><li>Mental Health-related activities most requested:<br>Among the mental health-related network activities, the&nbsp; most requested ones are mentoring, meetups, workshops, as well as materials related to topics on how to make an impact in the mental health space. The piloted events (talks and workshops/meetups) at EAGxs demonstrated significant interest, evinced by the high number of participants and high perceived impact ratings.</li></ul></li><li>Conclusions:&nbsp;<ul><li>More mental health-related infrastructure building seems impactful. The space would benefit from more organized, targeted resources that enable people to make a more substantial impact in a shorter period of time.&nbsp;</li><li>I believe it would be a good idea to invest in follow-up funding based on the results of this initiative to establish cost-effective corresponding structures and to hire at least one project/community manager for a year. Based on the survey results, this person would build the pool of volunteers to offer and measure the impact of requested events, materials, and a mentoring service.</li><li>How can you help?&nbsp;<br>If you\u2019d like to fund follow-up activities, feel free to reach out to me at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:inga@rethinkwellbeing.org\"><u>inga@rethinkwellbeing.org</u></a>.<br>If you\u2019d be interested in the project manager role, you can apply in &lt;15min <a href=\"https://forms.gle/vsrh4t9wQfiyhAdN7\">via this form</a>.&nbsp;<br>If you are interested in collaborating, or hosting network activities, or creating resources for people engaged in mental health as a volunteer, express your interest via<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAa9_Sql-kPkFaZYhKwlaNqRUil9GvS0cG9hH1G-zq2o3vRQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\">&nbsp;<u>this form</u></a> (it takes 3 minutes).</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Outcomes</h3><p><strong>Materials created</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ea-psych.com/\"><u>HIPsy website</u></a> summarizing relevant resources has been created and updated.

This would require follow-up funding, i.e., a two-month salary, to run an appropriate hiring and fundraising process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why do I believe funding these activities might be highly impactful? Many of the people who took part in the surveys are on the way of trying to figure out how to best make an impact in the mental health space and could do so quicker with the help of the right resources. I embarked on the same journey 2 years ago when I learned about EA and tried to find the best next steps forward. Most of the events and materials suggested as options in the survey are ones that I would have benefitted from as well, as they would have enabled me to move quicker and, therefore do more good, and it seems to be the case that surveys participants felt the same way. Also, I saw loads of people trying to make an impact in the mental health space who made \u201cwrong decisions\u201d, and wasted lots of resources (time, money) due to a lack of easily available and helpful information. Examples of \u201cwrong\" decisions I have heard more than once: coming up with and implementing interventions that don\u2019t target key bottlenecks or have shown not to work well or are missing relevant aspects to cause engagement, not collecting speaking effectiveness data on new interventions in time, not tailoring interventions to target groups well enough.</p><p>Are you interested in...&nbsp;</p><ul><li>... providing follow-up funding&nbsp;<br>(reach out to me at <a href=\"mailto:inga@rethinkwellbeing.org\"><u>inga@rethinkwellbeing.org</u></a><u>)</u><ul><li>for a 2 salary to find and hire a program manager with a background in mental health and to apply for follow-up funding or/and</li><li>for 12 month salary for the program manager to run this project.</li></ul></li><li>... the project manager role:&nbsp; I am happy to advise you or help write a follow-up grant funding application.

Recently, Martha Nussbaum <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+kgCBYpJ78\">brought up these concerns</a>. They're worth taking seriously. Thankfully, political scientists and economists have in fact looked at them (somewhat) seriously.</p><p>In this post I'm going to tell you a tiny bit about me, explain the institutional criticism of aid in a bit more detail, and then explain the results of two papers testing this relationship. I'll also explain a tiny bit about the limitations of this kind of work. &nbsp;The upshot of all this is that <strong>we have very little strong evidence that aid systematically harms political institutions. </strong>My best personal guess is that while aid can sometimes have medium-sized positive or negative effects on politics in recipient countries in specific cases, on average right now and in the recent past it has very small effects in either direction.</p><h2>All About Me</h2><p>I'm a political scientist by training and most of my teaching is in a development studies department. When I was considering grad school, I was really interested in political accountability and the ways that \"easy money\" like oil can distort political relationships. My reading of recent history suggested to me that getting oil before having representative institutions meant locking in autocratic rule.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdvjl1s6t6es\"><sup><a href=\"#fndvjl1s6t6es\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I thought about studying oil states but then somewhat unrelatedly I tried living in Cairo for about half a year and found it quite challenging culturally\u2014so I figured studying oil states was probably not going to work for me. My next idea was thinking about aid. In a lot of ways it seemed similar to oil: it was \"easy money\" for governments that let them provide goods or services to their citizens without taxing them. In many very poor countries it was also a large flow in terms of government expenditure or GDP. I wrote my <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=b855f6718e10362381a645251afe70313b477760#page=13\">big undergrad paper</a> on this. While doing so I read the <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/380592\">work of Deborah Brautigam</a> on this topic and then I went to do my PhD with her.</p><h2>Aid and institutions in theory</h2><p>The \"aid harms institutions\" story isn't dumb. It makes internal sense, and the early (cross-sectional) evidence that we had on it sometimes suggested harm. There are so many ways that aid could harm institutions or governance in recipient countries. It could do so by acting like oil. This primarily means allowing governments to exist absent taxation. If citizens aren't taxed, so the theory goes, then maybe they won't demand representation or results from government in the same way. And if governments don't have to collect tax, then maybe they won't do state building things like building up good ways of gathering information on everybody. If we look at European states, you can easily tell a story where states felt the acute need for more money (often for fighting wars) and this set off a chain of events that built strong states and created demands for state accountability to at least some segment of the population.</p><p>Aid could also harm institutions in more mundane ways. For example, donors might want to hire local staff and might pay well by local standards. This seems like a clear positive, but if enough donors do this they might poach all of the best people from government bureaucracies. Donors might also want lots of reporting to make sure money is well spent. Again this seems good, but with so many donors all wanting this kind of reporting it can be a large drain on the time and attention of a limited number of already overworked bureaucrats in aid-receiving countries.&nbsp;</p><p>However, aid also isn't oil. Donors care about how recipients act in a way that buyers of oil do not. Aid is often explicitly or implicitly tied to recipients doing or not doing certain things. It's easy to tell a story where donors do things that help improve institutions or governance, like donors withholding aid to Kenya in the early 1990s and pushing the country towards democratization.</p><h2>Testing aid's effect on institutions</h2><p>Early work testing the effects of aid on institutions tended to find a negative relationship. I read some of this work while doing my undergrad paper. Looking back, however, a lot of that work is not up to answering our question. One common problem is usually that it was cross-sectional: it is statistical work that has data on many counties at one point in time. You can think of this like a scatter plot, where aid is on the x-axis and some measure of good governance is on the y-axis. When you run these regressions you will often see a correlation where places with more aid have worse governance. However, it pretty unclear if we should interpret this as saying that aid causes problems in governance or aid goes to places with worse governance. Fire engines suspiciously appear near houses with fires.</p><p>The authors of this work understood that this was a problem and tried to deal with it in various ways (control variables, IV methods), but for reasons I won't get into here these methods are pretty unreliable in this context and have rightly fallen out of favour. It's just very hard to nail down causation in this context.</p><p>Some more recent papers come at this question using panel data, which means that they have data on many countries over many years. This lets one follow the trajectory of a country over time, as aid to it rises and falls. This is still <strong>far</strong> from something like a randomized control trial, but it's usually better than using a cross-section. Two papers that do this are \"<a href=\"https://www.sarahbermeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Bermeo_AidNotOil_IOfinal.pdf\">Aid Is Not Oil: Donor Utility, Heterogeneous Aid, and the Aid-Democratization Relationship</a>\" by Sarah Blodgett Bermeo and \"<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438781500111X\">Does foreign aid harm political institutions?</a>\" (<a href=\"https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Publications/Working-paper/PDF/wp2015-094.pdf\">pdf</a>) by Sam Jones and Finn Tarp.</p><p>Sarah's paper examines how aid influences democratization in non-democratic states. I like it because she also examines some past research and shows how the authors arrived at results that conflict with hers.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzfedf9d8c2o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzfedf9d8c2o\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The basic takeaway is that she finds that during the Cold War aid did make autocracies less likely to democratize, but that this effect is mostly gone in the post-Cold War period. The only exception is that if a country is strategically really important then <i>maybe</i> it can still use aid in this way. I'm saying maybe because it really hinges on whether or not you think her interaction terms have sufficient power to detect these effects (I'm skeptical). Nevertheless, the basic takeaway is that in the post-Cold War period aid doesn't seem to do anything to institutions.</p><p>Sam and Finn's paper looks at the effect of aid on measures of governance. I won't discuss all of their empirical approaches but they do some cross-sectional and some panel analyses examining the effect of aid on measures of &nbsp;democracy, the number of veto players over political decisions, the level of executive constraints, a &nbsp;political terror scale, and a measure of judicial independence. Their data runs from 1983-2010. They tend to find small <i>positive</i> effects of aid on political institutions.</p><h2>Should you believe either of these results?&nbsp;</h2><p>A litte?&nbsp;</p><p>The authors did their best and it's an improvement on the work that came before it, but because we have nothing like a clean experiment there is a lot of room for skepticism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefev629p5su1c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnev629p5su1c\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, <strong>any skepticism one has of these sort of results should also be applied to the claims of Deaton, which rely on no systematic analysis at all.</strong> I've been pretty disheartened to see people like Larry Temkin or Martha Nussbaum defer to Deaton on this when his analysis rests on the kind of loose hunches that I had as an undergrad. The hunches are reasonable, but we also should temper our hunches with at least a passing glance at empirical evidence.</p><p>I think the main takeaway here is that while the evidence that we have isn't very good (because the question is so hard to study), what evidence we do have suggests that <strong>aid in general likely does not systematically help or hinder governance in recipient countries</strong> (or that the effects are too small for us to reliably pick them up, in which case they probably don't matter much).</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fndvjl1s6t6es\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefdvjl1s6t6es\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Yes, I know this isn't some novel insight.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnzfedf9d8c2o\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefzfedf9d8c2o\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>In part, the answer is ridiculous p-hacking.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnev629p5su1c\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefev629p5su1c\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I've obviously only covered a small amount of the research on this question, but this post is informed by my reading of most of it.

In hindsight, my life before we met looks like it was designed to prepare me for you, like Fate left her fingerprints on so many formative books and conversations. Yet, for all that preparation, when my friend finally introduced us, I almost missed you! \"Earning to give-me-a-<i>break</i>, am I right?\" I didn't recognize you at first as the one I'd been looking for\u2014I didn't even know I'd been looking. But that encounter made an indelible impression on me, one that eventually demanded a Proper Introduction, this time performed in your own words. At second sight, I could make out the form of the one I am now privileged to know so well.</p><p>We survived the usual stages: talking, seeing each other casually, managing a bit of long (inferential) distance. It has been said that love is about changing and being changed\u2014Lord, how I've changed. And you have too! I loved you when <a href=\"https://youtu.be/olX_5WSnBwk?t=406\">CEA was a basement</a>, I loved you in your crypto era, and I'll love you through whatever changes <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XTBGAWAXR25atu39P/third-wave-effective-altruism\">the coming years</a> may bring.&nbsp;</p><p>I will admit, however, that thinking about the future scares me. I don't mean the far future (though I worry about that, too, of course); I mean our future. We're both so young, and there's so much that could go wrong. What if we make mistakes? What if I can't find an impactful job? What if your health (epistemic or otherwise) fails? In this light, our relationship appears quite fragile. All I can do is remind myself that we have weathered many crises together, and every day grants us greater understanding of the challenges that lie ahead and deeper humility with which to meet them.</p><p>I also understand you better with each passing year. And that's a relief because, let's face it, loving you is complicated! There's so much to understand. Sometimes I feel like I'll never fully Get You, and then I grow a little jealous toward people who have known you longer or seem to know a different side of you. When I get to thinking this way, I am tempted to pronounce that I am merely \"adjacent\" to you, but we both know that this would be true only in the sense that a wave is adjacent to the ocean. And you? You make me feel seen in a way I never thought was possible.</p><p>I know you've lost people recently. Some expected perfection of you and the company you keep, others missed the Way Things Were so much that they forgot the beauty in the Way Things Are. They insisted that you haven't been yourself lately, but darling, you're only as broken as you think you are. I am no fair weather lover; our honeymoon phase has come and gone, and I am here to stay. As long as you are a part of me, I will be a part of you, and I will continue to take your name.</p><p>We tend to talk the most when some Issue requires resolution, but I hope you know that for every day we argue, there are 99 days when I think of you with nothing but fondness. 99 days when I relish your companionship and delight in my memories with you: dancing, traveling the world, reading in the park, raising the next generation, talking late into the night, bouncing a spikeball off Toby Ord's window . . .</p><p>I love your tweets, even when they make me cringe, I trust your judgement, even after you buy a castle, and I cherish a meal with you, even when it's a lukewarm bottle of Huel shared in an Oxford train station. When we disagree, I love how you challenge me to refine my map of the world. I am constantly impressed by your boundless empathy, and I am so thankful for everything you've taught me. I love your eccentric friends and rationalist neighbors. My parents like you too, by the way, even if they don't really get what I see in you.</p><p>I love you x 99.</p>", "user": {"username": "Rocket"}}]
