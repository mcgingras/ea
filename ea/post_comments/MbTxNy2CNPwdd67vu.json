It means that whatever happens, no matter what, it\u2019s always your fault. Even if you tell Professor McGonagall, she\u2019s not responsible for what happens, you are. Following the school rules isn\u2019t an excuse, someone else being in charge isn\u2019t an excuse, even trying your best isn\u2019t an excuse. There just aren\u2019t any excuses, you\u2019ve got to get the job done no matter what.\u201d Harry\u2019s face tightened. \u201cThat\u2019s why I say you\u2019re not thinking responsibly, Hermione. Thinking that your job is done when you tell Professor McGonagall\u2014that isn\u2019t heroine thinking. Like Hannah being beat up is okay then, because it isn\u2019t your fault anymore. Being a heroine means your job isn\u2019t finished until you\u2019ve done whatever it takes to protect the other girls, permanently.\u201d In Harry\u2019s voice was a touch of the steel he had acquired since the day Fawkes had been on his shoulder. \u201cYou can\u2019t think as if just following the rules means you\u2019ve done your duty. \u2013HPMOR, chapter 75.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "parentCommentId": "4g97aopN6GpRT5kvt", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "yGB9xfjeydDWDCnQp", "postedAt": "2015-01-08T20:50:49.452Z", "postId": "MbTxNy2CNPwdd67vu", "htmlBody": "<p>Are there really that many opportunities to be a &quot;sidekick&quot; in EA?
