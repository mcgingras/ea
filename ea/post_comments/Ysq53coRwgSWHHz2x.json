I believe it would have been better to assign a score to each of the levels of opposition/support (e.g. ranging from -2 for strong opposition to 2 for strong support). Then one could calculate the effect size of the intervention from (\"mean score in the treatment group\" - \"mean score in the control group\")/\"standard deviation in the 2 groups\", and report the p-value. Having lots of categories allows one to test many different hypotheses, and then selectively report the statistically significant ones.</p><p>In any case, the 1st infographic contains information about both the direct and indirect deaths, so it is not straightforward to interpret whether the increase in opposition to retaliation illustrated just above was due to gaining awareness of the direct deaths from the detonations, or indirect ones from the nuclear winter. The survey asks one question to understand what motivated the change in the level of opposition/support (see Q2 in the last page). One of the potential answers was \"Avoid risk of killing civilians in other countries, or triggering global famine\" (4), which refers to nuclear winter.</p><p>The study does not report the results of the answers to Q2. However, I speculate the difference between the fraction of people answering 4 in the control and treatment group was not statistically significant at a 95 % confidence level (i.e. the p-value was higher than 0.05). In the section \"Key findings\", there is a box saying:</p><blockquote><p>All statistics quoted in this section are statistically significant at a 95% confidence level.</p></blockquote><p>The study is called \"Public awareness of nuclear winter and implications for escalation control\", so a statistically significant difference in the fraction of people answering 4 would presumably have been reported. I would say that, even without statistical significance, it is generally better to report all results to avoid <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias\">selection bias</a>.</p><p>I do not have any particular expertise in government decision-making.

With Putin pulling out of New START, many nuclear weapons that are not currently deployed could become so. Also, in an all-out nuclear war, currently nondeployed nuclear weapons could be used (with some delay). Furthermore, even if only two thirds as many nuclear weapons are used, the amount of soot would not scale down linearly because of hitting higher average combustible loading areas.</p><p>I agree that targeting would likely not maximize burned material, and I consider that in my <a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Cost-effectiveness%20national%20US.pdf\">Monte Carlo analysis</a>.</p><p>While it is true that most city centers have a higher percentage steel and concrete than Hiroshima, at least in the US, suburbs are still built of wood, and that is the majority of overall building mass. So I don't think the overall flammability is that much different. There is also been the counteracting factor of much more building area per person, and taller average buildings in cities. Of course steel buildings can still burn, as shown by 9/11.</p><p>The linear burn area scaling is a good point. Do you have data for the 400 kT average? I think if you have multiple detonations in the vicinity, then you could have burn area outside the burn area that one would calculate for independent detonations. This could be due to combined thermal radiation from multiple fireballs, but also the thermal radiation from multiple surrounding firestorms so it creates one big firestorm. Also, because assuming a linear burn area means small/less dense cities would be targeted, correcting the linear burn area downward by a factor of 2-3 would not decrease the soot production by a factor of 2-3.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The large area covered by the Australian bushfires and the low amount of soot reaching the stratosphere calls this into question.</p></blockquote><p>There is a fundamental difference between a moving front fire (conflagration) like a bushfire and a firestorm where it all burns at once. If you have a moving front, the plume is relatively narrow, so it gets heavily diluted and does not rise very high (also true for a oil well fire). Whereas if you have a large area burning at once, it gets much less diluted and will likely go into the upper troposphere. Then solar lofting typically takes it to the stratosphere. Nagasaki was a moving front fire, and I do give significant probability mass to moving front fires instead of firestorms in my analysis.</p><p>So overall I got a median of about 30 Tg to the stratosphere (<a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Cost-effectiveness%20national%20US.pdf\">Fig. 6</a>) for a full-scale nuclear war, similar to Lu\u00edsa's. I could see some small downward adjustment based on the linear burn area assumption, but significantly smaller than Bean's adjustment for that factor.</p><p>Added 20 September: though the blasted area goes with the 2/3 exponent of the yield because energy is dissipated in the shock wave, the area above the threshold thermal radiation for starting fires would be linear if the atmosphere were transparent. In reality, there is some atmospheric absorption, but it would be close to linear. So I no longer think there should be a significant downward adjustment from my model.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Denkenberger"}}, {"_id": "hkfStPznGZayJekQB", "postedAt": "2023-08-14T02:03:42.735Z", "postId": "Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x", "htmlBody": "<p>&gt;Current US + Russia arsenals are around <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/8301/the-countries-holding-the-worlds-nuclear-arsenal/\">11,000 warheads, </a>but current deployed arsenals are only about <a href=\"https://fas.org/initiative/status-world-nuclear-forces/\">3000</a>.

(2007) explained, for fires with a diameter exceeding the atmospheric scale height (about 8 km), pyro-convection would directly inject soot into the lower stratosphere.\" Another way of getting at this is looking at the maximum height of buoyant plumes. It scales with the <a href=\"https://cushman.host.dartmouth.edu/books/EFM/chap10.pdf\">thermal power raised to the one quarter exponent</a>. The Kuwait oil fires were between <a href=\"https://publications.iafss.org/publications/fss/4/1279/view/fss_4-1279.pdf\">90 MW and 2 GW</a>. Whereas firestorms could be ~three orders of magnitude more powerful than the biggest Kuwait oil fire. So that implies much higher lofting.

If there is a fire 8 km wide, I would argue that it is intuitive that it could rise ~16 km to the stratosphere. It turns out it's a little more complicated than this, because it depends on the potential temperature. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_temperature\">potential temperature</a> is the temperature of a parcel of air would have to be at sea level in order to become neutrally buoyant at the particular altitude. A typical value for the potential temperature at the tropopause is about 100\u00b0C. Because combustion temperatures are more like 1000\u00b0C, if you don't have dilution, it would rise high in the stratosphere. And if the fire is very wide, there is not that much dilution. In reality, there is significant dilution, but another fire model generally found the smoke going to the upper troposphere (<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JD033056\">the Lawrence Livermore National Lab study</a>).</p><blockquote><p>Re firestorms more broadly, I don't see any reason to assume those would routinely form. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Some argue that Hiroshima was exceptional that it did firestorm, and some argue that Nagasaki was exceptional that it did not, but I just went with around 50/50 for my model.</p><blockquote><p>It's been a while since I looked into this, but those are harder to generate than you might think when that's the goal, and I don't think it's likely to be a goal of any modern targeting plan. &nbsp;The only sophisticated model I've seen is the one by the Los Alamos team, which got about 70% of the soot production that Robock et al did, and only 12% of that reached the stratosphere.</p></blockquote><p>As noted above, the Livermore model does generally support Robock's estimates of lofting of particles. However, the Livermore model did have a shorter particle lifetime in the stratosphere (~4 years vs 8-15 for Robock), partly because the Livermore particles were not mostly soot (black carbon). So I think this is a potentially important possibility. However, inclusion of the non-soot smoke may actually make the sunlight reduction greater than Robock's estimate (for the same amount burned).</p>", "parentCommentId": "nCxp7PHDtgfXqtnKh", "user": {"username": "Denkenberger"}}, {"_id": "5pcd9CWxmyYsMKLWa", "postedAt": "2023-08-15T12:34:25.482Z", "postId": "Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>My understanding is that the warning systems are generally designed such that the ICBMs could launch before the attacking warheads reach the silos.

This is partly because in overshoot scenarios, population can go to significantly below the equilibrium due to people \"eating the seed corn.\"</p>", "parentCommentId": "L7S74CfE7Sg54Zjug", "user": {"username": "Denkenberger"}}, {"_id": "DubKc3bfjR26HBsCh", "postedAt": "2023-08-18T17:39:11.747Z", "postId": "Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x", "htmlBody": "<p>Mearsheimer does claim that states rationally pursue security.

Therefore, our modeling is informed by the Hiroshima firestorm, and the Hamburg firestorm, due to its rough similarity to the Hiroshima firestorm in size and duration. The assumption that all 100 detonations cause fires, and that these fires are more like the Hiroshima firestorm than Nagasaki, is a worst-case scenario. The studies of Penner et al.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033056#jgrd56654-bib-0034\"><strong>1986</strong></a>) and Toon et al.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033056#jgrd56654-bib-0046\"><strong>2007</strong></a>) also use fire parameters based on these historical cases (Hiroshima and Hamburg), so our fire parameters have the additional benefit of being similar to these previous studies. To produce simulations of fires similar to Hiroshima and Hamburg, it is assumed that the terrain is flat (i.e., topography does not provide shielding of thermal radiation) and there is uniform fuel loading over the area where thermal radiation is sufficient to ignite standard construction materials, such as wood. The WRF model source code is modified to allow for specification of surface fluxes of heat, water vapor and smoke (or black carbon), requiring quantification of these three fluxes, as well as the fire shape, size and duration.</p><p>The Hiroshima firestorm burned an area of about 11 to 13&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 4 to 9\u2009h, taking 20 to 30\u2009min to develop into a firestorm (Glasstone,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033056#jgrd56654-bib-0017\"><strong>1962</strong></a>; Rodden et al.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033056#jgrd56654-bib-0039\"><strong>1965</strong></a>). The Hamburg firestorm burned a comparable 12&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in about 6\u2009h (Carrier et al.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033056#jgrd56654-bib-0005\"><strong>1985</strong></a>). Therefore, we specify a circular area with a 2&nbsp;km radius (12.57&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) for our fires. Each fire has a 30\u2009min ramp-up period as surface fluxes increase linearly from zero, followed by a 4\u2009h fire duration where surface fluxes are constant. The 4\u2009h duration is chosen because it is the shortest time estimate for the fire in Hiroshima, and releasing a given mass of emissions and burning a given fuel amount over the shorter time period will result in higher smoke concentrations and heat fluxes, thus providing a worst-case estimate.</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": "CwADa4KHkxTK5bAmz", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "NoAkgrxrDLxTmfrkh", "postedAt": "2023-08-24T19:50:04.222Z", "postId": "Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x", "htmlBody": "<p>I was thinking of all of the assumptions, i.e. about the severity of the winter and the adaptive response.&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry if I'm being thick, but what do you mean by 'eating the seed corn' here?</p>", "parentCommentId": "CQKfuwzEFPWWhkQvW", "user": null}, {"_id": "4oD8D6NHhwcxyiSgw", "postedAt": "2023-08-24T22:24:47.609Z", "postId": "Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for clarifying. If instead one uses a mean (though I do think the tails should be weighted more heavily) closer to Luisa's and my analysis of 30 Tg, then <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0/tables/1\">Xia </a>predicts about 1.6 billion starvation fatalities and about 110 million direct fatalities (though this latter number would probably be higher because Xia assumes that all areas hit would firestorm, which I don't, so I think more area would be hit to produce that amount of soot to the stratosphere). This is pessimistic in that it assumes no international food trade, no planting location adaptation, limited response in biofuels and animals, stored food runs out in a year, and no resilient foods. However, it is optimistic in assuming food only goes to the people who would survive. The extreme case would be if there is not enough food to go around, if the food is shared equally, then everyone would die. \"Eating the seed corn\" means that desperate people would eat the seeds and not be able to grow food in the future. This could apply to eating wild animals including fish to extinction, and then not being able to have food in the future. The Xia number is also optimistic in assuming that nonfood trade will continue, such that countries will still have the agricultural equipment, fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. to produce the crops. There is also the chance of losing cooperation within countries, significantly increasing mortality. For instance, if farming is lost, there would be around 99.9% mortality returning to hunting and gathering with the current climate, worse in nuclear winter conditions (assuming we can figure out how to revert to hunting and gathering, which is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Secret-Our-Success-Evolution-Domesticating/dp/0691166854\">not guaranteed</a>).
