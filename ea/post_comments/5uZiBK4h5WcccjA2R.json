'Avoid schisms' is prudent for movement-building.</p><p>However, let me try to steel-man a possible counter-argument. In modern culture, we see many examples of woke activists taking over movements and organizations from the inside, by making ideologically motivated demands, playing various victim cards, demanding more 'diversity and inclusion', and trying to nudge the movement/organization in partisan political directions. Ever since the '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_march_through_the_institutions\">long march through institutions</a>' (1967) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_for_Radicals\">Rules for Radicals</a> (1971), this has been refined into an extremely &nbsp;common and effective tactic, and it has arguably had very negative effects in academia, media, corporations, and governments.&nbsp;</p><p>Movements and organizations often find it difficult to protect themselves from woke takeover, because they don't understand what's happening, they don't have good counter-arguments, they're too guilt-prone and easily shamed, and they're too conflict-averse. &nbsp;All too often, the movement/organization feels like they face a dilemma: either (1) give in to the woke activists, submit to all their demands, and take the movement in partisan politicized directions, or (2) accept a schism in which the woke get to take over the larger portion of the original movement, and a minority of anti-woke, ornery, heterodox contrarians go off and start their own movement (which is what we're currently seeing in American academia, media, corporations, and state governments).</p><p>I hope EAs see what's happening here, and understand the clear and present dangers of a woke takeover of the EA movement. We need to find a third option between accepting a woke takeover, and falling into a woke-versus-antiwoke schism. IMHO, that third option needs to be grounded in a radically honest discussion of what's really been happening in the EA movement over the last few months. &nbsp; I don't know what the optimal solution would be. But it <i>might</i> involve making it clear to the minority of woke activists in EA that their ideological values are simply not consistent with EA ethical and epistemic values -- just as many other kinds of political, religious, and ideological values are not consistent with EA values.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "BHfv9dt8BTfgiTy5Q", "postedAt": "2023-02-23T17:12:15.529Z", "postId": "5uZiBK4h5WcccjA2R", "htmlBody": "<p>I feel like discussions about what we'd like social norms to be &nbsp;and (relatedly) how to react to \"scandals\" have an inherent dynamic that increases polarization. This often goes like this:<br><br>There's a scandal or the possibility of a scandal and there's a tradeoff to make with respect to several things of importance. (E.g., creating a welcoming and safe environment vs. fear that this devolves into a culture where 99% of people will end up cancelled eventually with no chance of redemption for increasingly less severe transgressions.) Many people have some opinion on where they would set this tradeoff, but different people would set the weights in different places. (And some people may just say things that they expect will be received well, increasing the momentum that the pendulum is currently swinging.) Moreover, people operate in different parts of the EA community and have widely different day-to-day experiences filtered by their personality, standing in the movement, preferred ways of socializing, things like gender or ethnicity, and so on. So, even if two people in some sense agreed that the ideal norms for the movement would set the tradeoff in one specific way, they may disagree, based on the different glimpses of the movement they catch, &nbsp;about where the pendulum is currently at.</p><p>Now, since people often care really strongly about what the norms should be, it can be quite distressing if someone wants the pendulum to be at a 60 degree angle and thinks it's currently at a 120 degree angle, and then a person who wants it to be at the 120 angle comes and talks as though it's <i>already</i> at the 60 degree angle. While these two people only differ by 60 degrees (one wants it at 60, the other at 120), it seems to them as though they differ by 120 degrees (they both think the pendulum is currently far away from them). This impression of vast differences will cause them to argue their case even more vehemently, which further amplifies the <i>perceived</i> difference until it feels like 180 degrees \u2013 total opposition.<br><br>I'm not sure what to do about this. One option could be to debate less where the pendulum is exactly in a <i>movement-wide sense</i> (since that's impossible to begin with, given that the answer will be different for different parts of EA \u2013 both geographically and in terms of more subtle differences to what people see and experience \u2013 and also because no one should be confident about it given the limited glimpses that they catch). Instead, we could say things like \"I think the pendulum is too far to the left in such and such situations (e.g., Bay area community house x).\" Or, alternatively, we could focus more on what the movement should ideally look like. (E.g., maybe write down the reaction you'd like to see instead of focusing on why you don't like other people's reactions.) People will still disagree on these things, but maybe the disagreements will feel more like the 60 degrees rather than the doubled 120 degrees?<br><br>To make clear that one is making statements about where one wants the pendulum to be instead of where it's currently at, I think it's &nbsp;also useful to simply <i>acknowledge all the values at stake in the tradeoff</i>. This makes clear to others that you at least see where they're coming from. It also makes clear that you're not engaged in frantic pendulum-pushing where you think the pendulum has to move in a specific direction at all costs without worrying about how far it already went in some places.</p><p>Lastly, maybe it would be good if people thought about what sort of viewpoints they disagree with but still find \"defensible.\" I think it makes total sense to regard some viewpoints as indefensible and try to combat them and so on, but if we resort to that sort of reaction too quickly, then it becomes really difficult to coordinate on anything. Therefore, I often find it refreshing when people disagree in a way that makes clear that other perspectives are still heard and respected.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "bHib3AKqsBZJFhXz2", "postedAt": "2023-02-23T17:12:51.557Z", "postId": "5uZiBK4h5WcccjA2R", "htmlBody": "<p>BTW, it's interesting that there seems to be a cadre of EAs who get notifications whenever I post something, and they immediately disagree-vote on it, within a few minutes, if it involves any criticism of wokeness.

After all, billions of dollars are committed to EA, many people consider themselves to be EAs, and there are lots of organizations aligned with the movement. Given that, how could EA die? To me, EA dying might look like: (1) limited new funding being committed to EA (or funding that was committed disappearing), (2) the number of people who identify as EAs decreasing, and (3) EA organizations failing. I think we have some <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1\">evidence</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/C89mZ5T5MTYBu8ZFR/regulatory-inquiry-into-effective-ventures-foundation-uk\">for</a><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5zgxdpNaByWDMjgam/?commentId=EiQ2JgXhrN2tWSpjP\"> 3;</a> from conversations with people, I am guessing we'll start to see (2); and I'm worried that EA is going to have an increasingly hard time finding new funding (plus the demise of FTX alone constitutes (1)). So I'm really worried that EA (as we know it) is dying.</p><p>To perhaps bend this metaphor to its breaking point, unless you think EA definitely <i>isn't</i> dying, it's still sensible to have an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_healthcare_directive\">advanced directive</a> and organ donation plan in place. In other words, I think it's worth considering what a productive schism would look like\u2014and what the likely trajectory of EA sans-schism is\u2014before we rule out the \"divide and conquer\" approach, even if schisming is an outcome we could ideally avoid.</p><p>One thing I remain steadfastly optimistic about is the creativity, brilliance, and motivation of EAs.
