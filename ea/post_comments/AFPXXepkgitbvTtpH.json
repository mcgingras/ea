And i know some of these things you have pointed out (for example you do say that pet food is made up of by-products that are not suitable for human consumption), but i would like to hear your response to these points.</p><ol><li>Lack of scientific evidence. This article claims that vegan diets can meet all the nutritional requirements of cats, but this claim is not backed up by <strong>strong </strong>scientific evidence. While there have been some studies on vegan diets for cats, they are limited in scope and do not provide conclusive evidence that such diets are safe and healthy for cats in the long term.</li><li>Overstating the environmental impact: This article suggests that feeding cats a vegan diet would significantly reduce the amount of meat consumed, thus reducing the environmental impact of meat production. However, it overlooks the fact that the majority of meat produced for pet food is made up of by-products that are not suitable for human consumption. Therefore, the environmental impact of pet food production is not as significant as this article suggests.</li><li>Ignoring the natural diet of cats: While it is possible to create nutritionally complete vegan diets for cats, it goes against their natural diet as obligate carnivores. A vegan diet may not provide all the nutrients that cats need, which could lead to health problems in the long term. And i know you have responded to this comment, however you seem to be neglecting the fact that cat's evolved to specifically eat meat. This comes back to the lack of scientific evidence as well, and we do not know the long term impacts of changing their diets. And i would just like to say that herbivores themselves eat small amounts of meat from time to time, and so if herbivores, which evolved to get the absolute most out of plants, need to eat meat sometimes, what will that say about transitioning carnivores to meat?</li><li>Overlooking animal welfare concerns: This article argues that feeding cats a vegan diet would reduce the number of animals killed for pet food production, but it overlooks the potential negative impact on the welfare of cats. Some cats may not be able to digest a vegan diet properly, leading to digestive issues and other health problems. Which again, leads to the lack of evidence on this topic.</li><li>Disregarding personal choice: This article suggests that humans should make domestic cats vegan, but it ignores the fact that cat owners may have different beliefs and preferences when it comes to feeding their pets. It is important to respect personal choice and allow cat owners to make informed decisions about what to feed their pets.</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "FeltSteam0"}}, {"_id": "EsGmRgPY67xFWqnHE", "postedAt": "2023-05-07T04:25:40.076Z", "postId": "AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p><strong>Repudiating what \u201cobligate carnivore\u201d means</strong> - Kindly, but stridently, we have to correct folks that obligate carnivore stems from observation, not a diet requirement</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Could you provide a source for this? In biology, \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore#:~:text=.%5B4%5D-,Obligate%20carnivores,-%5Bedit%5D\">obligate carnivore</a>\" means \"obligate meat eater\". They cannot get sufficient nutrition from plants alone. This doesn't rule out an artificial diet providing the missing nutrients, or someone incorrectly classifying a non-obligate carnivore as obligate due to bad data. But it does not mean \"based on observation\". Your description holds for the order carnivora, but that is not synonymous with carnivore because biology as a field is dumb.&nbsp;</p><p>In your Opportunities section you suggest doing more rigorous RCTs on vegan cat diets (which I agree with), but the rest of your post feels like you considered the question settled.

I wish you had gone into these in detail, because the papers look quite bad to me.&nbsp;</p><p>The main <a href=\"https://sustainablepetfood.info/vegetarian-feline-diets/#3\">website</a> you link to links to a review article in which only 4 studies with a combined 39 subjects use blood tests rather than owner reports, and more than half of those were given vegetarian diets, not vegan (even though the table header says vegan). The only RCT didn't compare with carnivorous diets.

However a) this is not a common behaviour and b) it is in <strong>no shape or form</strong> essential for a herbivore's well-being.</p><p>Herbivores have evolved an amazing digestive tract to acquire all their needs from plant matter. Opportunistic carnivorous behaviour is simply an advantageous behaviour for getting a bit of extra protein and nutrients, not a requirement for a healthy life. For instance, a wild ruminant may acquire a small, but useful survival advantage by munching on some ground laying bird\u2019s eggs or even their live chicks when the ruminant happens to encounter them. But as I've mentioned this is not essential, nor particularly common. The ruminant can acquire all their nutritional needs through plant matter - their specialised anatomy, bacteria in their digestive tracts and well evolved metabolic pathways enabling them to do so.</p><p>Your claim applies even less so for herbivorous pets because humans can (and should!) ensure their pet\u2019s diet contains everything they need for good wellbeing.

(3) There's nothing magical about meat. We know how metabolism and biochemistry works, so for meat to essential, there would need to be essential nutrients that are only found in meat. That has not be found after <i>decades</i> of research.</li><li>Vegan diets for cats will constantly develop and be iterated. Again, we should continue to make better and better formulations.

It's supported by fundamentals of biochemistry, metabolism, and digestion too. I won't presume to know your biology knowledge. Earlier, you said \"biology as a field is dumb\", which may or may not be indicative of much personal study of biology. So I apologize if this is over-explaining, but I feel that I may have glossed over it when making the post:</p><p>Mammals such as cats will digest food matter into constituent molecules. Those molecules are chemically converted to other molecules--collectively, metabolism--, and energy and biomass (muscles, bones) are built from those precursors. For cats to truly be obligate carnivores, there would have to be something exceptional about meat: (A) There would have to be essential molecules--nutrients--that cannot be sourced anywhere else OR (B) the meat would have to be digestible in a way that's not possible with plant matter.&nbsp;</p><p>(A) is very easy to correct for. Just test formulations for missing nutrients (molecules) and add them. So far, there are no \"special\" meat molecules that can't be sourced from elsewhere. (B) is making a more digestible formulation. If we extract pea protein and measure the digestibility, we'll know if it'll work for a cat or not.</p><p>On (A), AAFCO is setting this already with their nutritional guidelines, e.g. minimum amount of proteins, vitamins, etc. On (B), part of the ingredient testing is making sure the food is digestible for cats (also testing for toxicity).&nbsp;</p><p>So any plant-based food that passes AAFCO guidelines is nutritionally complete for cats. Ami does, for example.</p><p>One of my points is that people's assumptions about carnivory fail to consider biochemistry. Yes, the formal scientific studies are lacking, but it really shouldn't matter based on what's known about more fundamental biology. Do we need long term studies to absolutely know that <i>Yellowclothea</i> people are safe to wear purple?&nbsp;</p><p>I agree that more formal studies higher on hierarchy of evidence would convince folks, seemingly like yourself. And to that point, I advocate for more of it.

However, here are three related ideas that might be more viable:</p><p>1) There was a debate a few years back about whether cats should eat grain-free diets versus diets with grain. Vets think eating food with grain <a href=\"https://www.petmd.com/cat/nutrition/grain-free-cat-food-better\">is fine</a> for most cats. Food with grain is liable to have less meat (since there is more other stuff in it, i.e., grain), so switching cats from grain-free diets to diets with grain would presumably reduce their meat consumption. Cat owners would likely be open to this because grain-free foods are typically more expensive and grain-free diets have been linked to <a href=\"https://www.thewildest.com/cat-nutrition/grain-free-cat-food\">heart disease</a> in dogs.</p><p>2) Slightly separate from the grain-free issue, cat foods vary significantly in terms of how much protein they have; for instance, it looks like the foods on <a href=\"https://catinfo.org/docs/SortableCatFoodChartCatinfo.org2-22-13.htm\">this chart </a>range from 26%-70% protein. So another way to reduce cats' meat consumption might be to convince pet owners to buy food with less protein (or, if necessary, do research to establish whether this is healthy for cats).</p><p>3) Cat foods have different kinds of protein\u2014the above chart mentions lamb, beef, chicken, salmon, tuna, rabbit, duck, trout, venison, mackerel, and shrimp, among many others.

The majority of the animal-based parameters were within normal reference ranges and when there were deviations from normal reference ranges, there were rarely clinical signs reported alongside the finding. In addition, whilst the broad literature in this area commonly makes reference to concerns around nutrient deficiencies, such as that of taurine, folate, and cobalamin, there were a limited number of studies that measured these outcomes (generally, only two studies for key outcomes), with limited evidence of these deficiencies arising (with some of the alterations likely being attributable to confounding; for example, as a result of secondary disease, e.g., giardiasis in a dog). These conclusions should, however, be interpreted cautiously, given the breadth and quality of the evidence presented as described below</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This review has found that there is <i>no convincing evidence</i> of major impacts of vegan diets on dog or cat health. There is, however, a limited number of studies investigating this question and those studies available often use small sample sizes or short feeding durations.

Is this the only reason the authors conclude cats can be fed a vegan diet? But then it sounds like a better and more responsible conclusion by the authors would have been: it seems theoretically possible that a vegan cat food could exist with correct supplementation, but no healthy vegan diet for cats exists yet (all studies show specific supplementation thus far is neccesarry for existing vegan foods otherwise your cats might very quickly develop major adverse health outcomes - am I wrong?).</p><p>They also highlight they didn't review the suitability of the supplements?
