Paradigms in Science</h3><p>In the philosophy of science, Thomas Kuhn introduced the notion of a&nbsp;<i>\u2018paradigm\u2019</i>, roughly referring to a class of key theories, tools and approaches, and methodological and theoretical assumptions that govern progress within some discipline of science. The function of a paradigm, as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/\"><u>SEP</u></a>, is to&nbsp;<i>\u201cto supply puzzles for scientists to solve and to provide the tools for their solution\u201d</i>. Kuhn\u2019s interest in the concept was to provide a commentary on revolutions and incommensurability.</p><p>According to Kuhn, scientific revolutions are characterized by disruptions in periods of \u2018normal science\u2019 (or within-paradigm progress), wherein new paradigms are introduced leading to a shift in the assumptions, methods and evaluative criteria that govern the discipline. Some examples include the shift from classical mechanics to relativistic mechanics, and the shift from miasma theory to germ theory of disease.</p><p>Sometimes paradigms can refer to an overlapping object of inquiry and continue to remain productive, and yet be incommensurable (i.e. lacking common measure) with respect to each other. When the theories provide no basis for evaluation on each other\u2019s standards, and science lacks a common standard to compare them (for example because they have incompatible methodological assumptions, or operate in incompatible ontologies), it can make it hard to provide&nbsp;<i>\u2018objective\u2019</i> justifications for choosing between paradigms. Kuhn called this the problem of Theory Choice, and and raised the question of which criteria we do/should use in making subjective choices here.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr2z4s0bkdkc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr2z4s0bkdkc\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Paradigms in Design and Engineering</h3><p>Artificial Intelligence is partly about understanding the nature of intelligence or related properties of cognitive systems, but it is also about the artificial -- designing intelligent artifacts. And therefore in order to understand what paradigms govern progress in AI, and how they do so, we need to look at paradigms not just in science but in design and engineering.</p><p>Paradigms and theories operate differently in science compared with design and engineering, relating to the distinct epistemological relationship between the use of theories and the object of those theories. In science, the territory is typically causally prior to our maps, and we are trying to refine our maps to get the best understanding of the key phenomena in the territory. Design and engineering on the other hand, are also about artificiality, and theories often provide us with blueprints for creation of artifacts.</p><p>The laws of the universe are a given, but artificial objects are not. Different scientific paradigms will not cause the laws of the universe to alter, but different design paradigms will cause different artificial objects to be created. This makes theory choice for design paradigms particularly important: design paradigms don\u2019t just describe the world more or less accurately, they also directly shape what happens next.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffiqgw08hmbr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfiqgw08hmbr\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Furthermore, scientific paradigms tend to commit you to a whole worldview. Design paradigms commit you to aspects of a worldview, but not necessarily the whole thing. This makes design paradigms less incommensurable than scientific paradigms, and makes it easier for multiple design paradigms to exist side by side. Automobile engineering and locomotive engineering both make use of the similar scientific principles, but operate within the context of distinct artifact classes.</p><p>Although philosophy of science has not focused on the nature of paradigms in design, there are some things we can say about them from common intuitions. A design paradigm is a space of blueprints, denoting a space of possible artifacts, and a way of reasoning about those artifacts. It must help us build as well as understand the built systems.</p><p>For example, automobile engineering as a paradigm provides us with ways of deliberating about cars as artifacts, helping us with building cars and reasoning about their behavior, as well as providing forms of knowledge relevant to repairing them if and when they break down. Different paradigms can deal with problems that may share some abstract equivalence. For example, automobile engineering and aerospace engineering both are paradigms that deal with artifacts useful for transporting from point A to point B, though their applicability differs and the forms of knowledge involved are fairly different.</p><p>One way of thinking about design paradigms in AI is to consider different approaches to AI as different design paradigms. For example, on this view the move from simulation-based self-play RL to transformer-based language models is a form of paradigm shift.</p><p>Some commentators have already discussed design paradigms in AI under different names. A similar idea has been discussed with the name of&nbsp;<i>model-types</i> in ML in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01172\"><u>this paper</u></a> looking at the values that govern disciplinary shifts. In my understanding, a good overview of what a paradigm in ML looks like is presented in the concept of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FDJnZt8Ks2djouQTZ/how-do-we-become-confident-in-the-safety-of-a-machine\"><i><u>training stories</u></i></a>, capturing the notion of paradigms that govern how we train models and reason about their properties. For most of the discussion in this write-up, a design paradigm can be substituted with training story (when discussing ML-based systems).</p><p>In the section below, I discuss theory choice as a force governing paradigm shifts. However, it is important to note that inter-paradigm choice is not the only way in which paradigm shifts occur. For example, new design paradigms can also emerge through synthesis building on top of each other (for example, early hovercrafts were produced by synthesizing aerodynamics with torpedo boat designs).<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Three Criteria for Paradigm Choice: Adaptivity, Economy, and Control</h3><p>Design paradigms can be used to understand and model how progress in AI will develop. We can then examine the values that drive theory choice. Understanding what drives paradigm shifts can also help us understand general features of future paradigms. Furthermore, as I\u2019ll show in the next section, these dimensions can also help us interpret criticisms of alternative paradigms and make relevant distinctions in the nature of the criticisms.</p><p>Here the criteria are described in terms of an informal notion of a design paradigm denoted by&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal{K}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

The second dimension of criticism challenges the controllability claims of CAIS, challenging whether the control problem of the paradigm can be solved within that paradigm itself or inevitably requires invoking another paradigm.</p><p>Note that these are roughly orthogonal dimensions of criticism, at least in terms of logical independence. It could be possible that CAIS does evolve into agentic systems, but that solving the control problem for CAIS was easier than aligning agents, implying that the agent that eventually emerges is an aligned agent. Such a position might imply that aligning agents via building and reasoning about bounded-scope services is a more tractable strategy than trying to solve alignment for already natively-agentic systems (i.e. systems that are agentic at the time of conception).&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, it could be possible that solving the control problem for CAIS does involve solving alignment for agent systems which must take the role of security services (or other core governance roles), but the aggregate behavior of AI services never evolves into an integrated utility-maximizing agent<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu84armg2sti\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu84armg2sti\">[4]</a></sup></span>. Similarly, we can argue the orthogonality of 1 and 2 both with 3&amp;4.</p><p>The third and fourth criticisms correspond to the economy criterion, claiming that the CAIS paradigm will never be economically competitive, either because it is constrained from achieving some set of economically valuable functionings that agents can, or because it is not as resource-efficient as agents in achieving comparable functionings.</p><p>When posed with a novel paradigm, we can use these criteria to assess in what ways will they dominate existing paradigms if successful, and organize criticisms over their claims.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Parts of these ideas were produced during my work on CAIS in 2020-21 and presented at FHI.

Typically, under such a tax, the cost is usually passed on to the consumer (literature shows ~70% of tax is passed on). Now, imagine there's an entity, like a company or interest group, that strongly opposes this policy because it would cut their profits by an amount represented as $X in Net Present Value (NPV). Ordinarily, they would be willing to spend $X on lobbying efforts to sway lawmakers and prevent the policy's implementation. In reality they spend less than $X because 1) there is an opportunity to free-ride other similar companies 2) there is a chance that they spend $X and the government still passes the policy.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's say I am a wealthy billionaire with a vision for social good. I offer the aforementioned interest group $X, and together we proceed to implement the policy. However, is it reasonable to assume that the interest group would utilize the $X payment to lower the soda's price? It seems unlikely. A rational profit-maximizing company would likely still shift the burden of the tax onto consumers. This is because, despite the cash infusion of $X, the company's optimization behavior under the tax remains consistent with what it would have been without the payout.</p><p>So, how does this play out in reality? Rough estimates indicate that the food and beverage industry spent an extra $50 million on lobbying against a national sugar tax in 2009. According to a 2012 Health Affairs article, a tax of one cent per ounce on sugary beverages could prevent around 26,000 premature deaths over a decade. Assuming a constant rate of 2,600 lives saved annually, and applying a social discount rate of 3.5% (chosen somewhat arbitrarily), the cumulative lives saved due to the soda tax would be 74,285. This leads us to a cost of $50 million divided by 74,285 lives, resulting in approximately $673 per life saved.</p><p>Consequently, it appears to be highly cost-effective to simply buy out the soda and beverage industry. Although we haven't factored in the consumer surplus lost due to the sugar tax, even after considering this aspect, the policy seems to be a significant improvement for overall welfare. This is especially true considering the high price elasticity of sugar.&nbsp;</p><p>TLDR:&nbsp;</p><p>If a policy is opposed by a small interest group but would benefit the entire world, then it appears optimal to just pay off the small interest group so that we can implement the policy. First approximation for sugar tax shows a cost-effectiveness of $673 per life saved in the US, and likely lower for elsewhere in which there is a smaller beverage lobby.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "SaraAzubuike"}}, {"_id": "vnhRiGHodi9mSYgQL", "title": "EA Organisations budget size", "postedAt": "2023-08-28T15:00:49.977Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I recently noticed that my expectations of what various organisations are spending are way off, so I tried to gather some data.&nbsp;</p><p>This excludes money moved through the organisation but re-granted outside of it.

The original version is a 1h workshop, where groups discuss pros and cons of the different options before voting where a pool of money should go. The speed variant is made to take ~3 minutes, and each individual vote is worth $1.</p><p>I wrote this two days after the event itself, and so I don't know if the interest generated translates into further engagement with EA, our group events, or e.g. increased donations to charities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p><ol><li>Around 75 people stopped by the table and 62 participated in the 3-minute game voting where $1 donations would go.</li><li>23 people signed up for newsletters/events (37% rate), showing interest in learning more about EA.</li><li>Having real money, only 2 charities, and a better game design could have left a stronger impression.</li><li>The \"help us give away other's money\" hook was effective to draw people in.</li><li>Being alone at the table was manageable but having 2 people could have engaged 15-25% more.</li><li>The game highlighted difficulty judging effectiveness, but could have conveyed the core message better via structured thinking.</li><li>It may be beneficial to choose a charity other than AMF since many have heard of malaria prevention.</li><li>Use a laptop or tablet to gather email addresses \u2014 don't use pen and paper.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Event description and game setup</strong></h3><p>The festival was spread out over a campus and the organisers predicted \"a maximum of 1800 students\", but on the day I think it was less than this. It lasted five hours. A large number of organisations did tabling, forming long corridors of tables.</p><p>I did the tabling alone. I had two banners behind, a third of the table was taken up by books that anyone could write down their email address to borrow, and the rest of the table mainly had papers with images and info about the three charities featured in the game (and some on other charities to show a breadth of cause areas). Papers at the front of the table said \"give away other's money\".</p><p>My setup for the game:<br>I presented three charities and asked participants to guess which was the most cost-effective.</p><ul><li>Against Malaria Foundation.</li><li>Helen Keller International, vitamin A supplement programme.</li><li>PlayPumps. (trap option)</li></ul><p>I gave a short description of each charity, and after they made an initial guess I explained that there can be large differences between interventions. I then presented a few points of statistics and evaluations for each charity, and asked if they wanted to change their vote based on that. A plastic bead representing 10 SEK &nbsp;(= &nbsp;$0.91) was then put in a glass jar for the charity of their choice.</p><p>Afterwards I spent a minute explaining that while donations to effective charities can do a lot of good, they can use their future career to do much more than that, and that a single individual has incredible opportunities to do a lot of good in the world. I ended with asking if they wanted to sign up for the newsletter of Giving What We Can (who sponsored us), our club's newsletter, or interest for our upcoming intro lecture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The call \"help us give away other peoples' money\" worked quite well in drawing in people passing by.</p><p>80-85% of all who stopped at my table participated in the game.<br>62 votes in total (so ~75 people stopped by and at least listened for a short while).</p><ul><li>AMF: 39 votes.</li><li>HKI: 23 votes.</li><li>PlayPumps: 0 votes.</li></ul><p>23 sign-ups, 22 on paper and one from the 20 people who took a flyer with a compilation of QR-codes.<br>= 37% sign-up rate.<br>(2-3 will likely be discarded due to illegible handwriting.)</p><ul><li>13 GWWC newsletter.</li><li>21 EA Uppsala newsletter.</li><li>15 interested in the lunch lecture.</li><li>9 signed up for all three.</li></ul><p>1 book lent out (The Precipice).<br>2 took pictures of the books as a reference.</p><p>3-4 people seemed to show significant interest, one of whom mentioned that they had already been considering using their career to help others.</p><p>I can't recall that any of those I talked to said they had heard of EA before. (The one person I recall doing so was an organiser at another table.)</p><p>I bought a lot of candy in the form of plastic-wrapped chocolates (~10 grams each), but very few took any.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Some lessons</h3><ul><li>Previous tabling sessions on campus (not during a students fair or similar event) have resulted in talking to 20-50 people, on a few occasions close to 100. Since those were over just 2h and this event was a 5h festival with a large number of attendees, my goal was to talk to 150 people and I prepared for 300. The ~75 who stopped by the table means I came halfway to my goal. I think this was partly because:<ul><li>There may have been a bit fewer participants than anticipated.</li><li>They were distributed over a large area, meaning many didn't pass where I was.</li><li>There was a lot of competition for the students' attention, so many might not have had the time or energy to visit that many stalls.</li><li>The table could have been made more appealing (though I'd say it was passable).</li><li>Our places were decided by the organisers, and I stood close to a PA-system with loud music that made it difficult to talk (and when that wasn't playing, there was a marching band just a few meters away).</li><li>I was alone, and there were occasions when I was in the middle of going through the game with one set of people when others arrived, who then left when they noticed I didn't have time for them. I'm guessing a second person could have drawn in another 15-25%.</li></ul></li><li>It is clearly better to be at least two people, but doing it alone was more manageable than I thought it would be. I therefore don't think the lack of a second person should be an obstacle for deciding whether or not to do this kind of tabling.</li><li>Use a computer, tablet, or even a smartphone for gathering emails. I lent out my computer to another table and thought paper would suffice, but I underestimated how hard it is to read most peoples' handwriting (especially when it isn't words in a sentence).</li><li>I think it would have been better to just use two charities, e.g. HKI and PlayPumps, since not that many showed a strong preference before statistics were revealed and so the point would still come across. If using three, then it would have been good if one of them could be said to be the clear \"winner\" in terms of cost-effectiveness, since this was a common question asked by participants when comparing AMF and HKI.</li><li>~10% of participants had heard of malaria prevention, and sometimes bednets, as being a good way to improve global health. Even though most didn't recognise AMF in particular, this made them choose AMF without thinking more carefully about the other options.</li><li>There was a pretty even spread of votes for the three charities before I revealed the evaluation data, and I think my setup did well in highlighting the point that it is hard to determine at a glance what will be effective. It did not do well in making them think about the question in a structured way. When traffic was low, I believe I could have extended the game a minute or two by starting with a brief description of the scale, solvability, neglectedness framework, though maybe this might have made it less fun. I think there's room for significant improvements by thinking more about the core message you want to convey and use that to better design the game and pitch.</li><li>Since I prepared for a lot of participants I decided to use plastic beads as tokens for the money, but if I knew there would have been less than 100 then I would have gotten real money and used that. My guess is that handling actual money would have made a bigger impression.</li><li>I printed lots of materials for different visualisations and statistics, but ended up only using a few of them. It would have been better to focus on a minimalistic approach and only have one set of some more detailed statistics to bring out in case someone asked about it.</li><li>I think the flyer with a list of QR-codes and URLs could have been better replaced by a brochure explaining what EA is (e.g. the <a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/running-a-group/graphics/available-graphics#h.b5eesraez8yc\">second option here</a>), and only one or two QR-codes to get further information.</li><li>Not many took candy, and my guess is that this is partly due to me not inviting them to (but it is pretty obvious that it is there for them), and partly due to almost all tables offering sweets or snacks of some form, so if I wanted to stand out I would have had to up the quality or get something more unusual.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I'm not quite satisfied with the outcome, but think there are enough improvements that could have been made in this instance that I'm optimistic about the speed giving game as a good strategy for tabling.</p>", "user": {"username": "Jesper Magnusson"}}, {"_id": "XxrvEytsHQAM38MBt", "title": "Navigating the Future: A Guide on How to Stay Safe with AI | Emmanuel Katto Uganda", "postedAt": "2023-08-28T11:38:15.010Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hello my name is Emmanuel Katto and I'm from Uganda.

Research user reviews and ratings to gauge the reliability of a product before integrating it into your routine.</p><p><strong>Protect Your Data Privacy</strong></p><p>AI often relies on large datasets to function effectively. Be cautious about the information you share, especially sensitive data like personal identification, financial details, or private conversations. Read privacy policies carefully, and consider adjusting app settings to limit data collection if possible.</p><p><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords</strong></p><p>If your AI interactions involve accounts or online services, ensure that you're using strong, unique passwords for each platform. Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for an extra layer of security. A password manager can help you keep track of your credentials securely.</p><p><strong>Regularly Update Software</strong></p><p>AI technology evolves rapidly, and so do potential security vulnerabilities. Regularly update your devices, apps, and software to benefit from the latest security patches. Outdated software can leave you susceptible to cyber threats.</p><p><strong>Beware of AI-Generated Content</strong></p><p>AI can generate realistic content like articles, images, and even videos. While this can be incredibly useful, it also raises concerns about misinformation and deepfakes. Always verify the authenticity of information from multiple trusted sources.</p><p><strong>Understand AI's Limitations</strong></p><p>AI is powerful, but it's not infallible. Understand its limitations, especially in critical situations. Double-check information provided by AI systems and avoid making decisions solely based on AI-generated outputs.</p><p><strong>Educate Yourself About AI Ethics</strong></p><p>As AI becomes more integrated into society, discussions about AI ethics are crucial. Educate yourself about biases, transparency, and fairness in AI algorithms. Advocate for responsible AI development and usage.</p><p><strong>Stay Informed About AI Trends</strong></p><p>Stay updated about the latest trends and news in AI. This will help you anticipate potential risks and benefits, allowing you to adapt your AI interactions accordingly.</p><p><strong>Teach Children about AI Safety</strong></p><p>If you have children using AI devices or apps, educate them about the importance of online safety, privacy, and responsible AI use. Set parental controls and ensure they understand the boundaries of AI interactions.</p><p><strong>Report Suspicious Activity</strong></p><p>If you encounter any AI-related scams, phishing attempts, or suspicious activity, report it to the appropriate authorities or platforms. Your vigilance can contribute to a safer AI ecosystem for everyone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Embracing AI can bring remarkable improvements to our lives, but safety should always be a top priority. By following these guidelines, you can navigate the world of AI with confidence, harnessing its benefits while safeguarding your privacy, security, and ethical principles. As technology continues to advance, staying informed and proactive will be key to enjoying the full potential of AI in a responsible manner.</p>", "user": {"username": "emmanuelkatto"}}, {"_id": "GWGJFSFaxqAcZgX9L", "title": "Most effective solution to get 100millions of people out of poverty ", "postedAt": "2023-08-28T05:29:16.551Z", "htmlBody": "<p>From $23-131 trillion UK owes in reparations just to Jamaica.

We learned that some of these risks (especially the emerging anthropogenic risks) are alarmingly high. This post explores our place in the story of humanity and the importance of reducing existential risk.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A single human in the wilderness is nothing exceptional. But together humans have the ability to shape the world and determine the future of our species, planet, and universe.</p><p>We learn from our ancestors, add minor innovations of our own, and teach our children. We are the beneficiaries of countless improvements in technology, mathematics, language, institutions, culture, and art. These improvements make our lives much better than the lives of our ancestors.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwtyrea79jaj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwtyrea79jaj\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>We hope that life will continue to improve. And we could have a lot of time to get things right. Humans have walked the earth for around&nbsp;200,000 years, but a typical mammalian species lasts for a million years, and our planet will remain habitable for a billion years. This is enough time to eradicate malaria and HIV, eliminate depression and dementia, and create a world free from racism, sexism, torture, and oppression. With so much time ahead of us, we might even figure out how to leave our solar system and settle the stars. If so, we could have a truly staggering number of descendants who can explore the universe and build wonders and masterpieces better than we can imagine. If we go extinct, all of this will be lost.</p><p>We have always faced a small risk from asteroids, pandemics, and volcanoes. But it was only recently that we began to face larger risks of our own creation. This period of heightened risk began last century with the invention of nuclear weapons (we now have enough to kill everyone on earth). Over the next century we will face additional risk from emerging developments in biotechnology and AI. In the words of Toby Ord, we are standing on \u201ca crumbling ledge on the brink of a precipice.\u201d</p><p>Safeguarding humanity is the defining challenge of our time.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdp85yulqd2i\"><sup><a href=\"#fndp85yulqd2i\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If we rise to it, there may be trillions of people living meaningful lives in the future. If we fail, then in all likelihood we will destroy ourselves. The fate of the world rests on our collective decisions.</p><h1>Why should we try to prevent extinction?</h1><p>If a large asteroid was hurtling towards Earth, few would argue against building a deflection system. This indicates that our collective inaction is driven by a shared sentiment that the risk of extinction is low, rather than the belief that humanity is not worth protecting. However, it is still worth reflecting on why preventing extinction is so important.</p><h2><i>A tragedy on the grandest scale</i></h2><p>Sudden extinction, such as from an asteroid collision, would involve the sudden and gruesome deaths of billions of people, perhaps everyone. This alone would make it the most severe tragedy in history.</p><h2><i>The destruction of our potential</i></h2><p>Extinction would destroy our immense potential. Almost all humans that will ever live are yet to be born. Almost all human well-being and flourishing is yet to happen.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm1ydqec1ror\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm1ydqec1ror\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;All of this would be lost if the present generation went extinct.</p><h2><i>Intergenerational projects</i></h2><p>Our ancestors set in motion great projects for humanity \u2014 ending war, forging a just world, and understanding the universe. No single generation can complete these projects. But humanity can, with each generation contributing just a little. We benefit immensely from knowledge and wisdom passed down to us from previous generations, and we owe it to our children and grandchildren to protect this legacy and pass it down to them. Extinction would also destroy all cultural traditions, languages, poetry, and culture. We ought instead to protect, preserve, and cherish these things.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzqz86xiu7is\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzqz86xiu7is\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><h2><i>Civilisational virtues</i></h2><p>We are accustomed to understanding virtues on an individual level, but we could also think of the collective virtues of humanity. When we fail to take these risks seriously, humanity might collectively demonstrate a lack of prudence. When we value our own generation so much as to put all future generations at risk, we demonstrate a lack of patience. And when we fail to prioritise well-known risks, we display a lack of self-discipline. When we do not rise to the challenge, we display a lack of hope, perseverance, and responsibility for our own actions.</p><h2><i>Cosmic significance</i></h2><p>We may be alone in the universe. If there are no aliens, then all life on Earth may have cosmic significance. Humanity would be in a unique position to explore and understand the universe. We would also have a responsibility to all life, as we would be the only ones who could protect it from harm and promote flourishing on other planets.</p><h2><i>Uncertainty</i></h2><p>Correctly accounting for our uncertainty about the future tends to strengthen the case for protecting our potential because the stakes are asymmetrical: overinvesting in safety is simply much better than letting everyone die. This means that even if we believe the risks are low, but we are not completely confident, then some efforts to safeguard humanity are warranted.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxep0vo1a1r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxep0vo1a1r\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><h1>Why are existential risks neglected?</h1><h2><i>Are existential risks neglected?</i></h2><p>Humanity spends less money attempting to prevent existential risk than it does on ice cream each year.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe6zc93xyed4\"><sup><a href=\"#fne6zc93xyed4\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The most risky emerging technologies are biotechnology and AI (see parts&nbsp;2 &amp; 3). Yet the international body responsible for the continued prohibition of bioweapons has an annual budget less than that of an average McDonald\u2019s restaurant.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8xqebtm5m52\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8xqebtm5m52\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And while we spend billions of dollars improving the capabilities of AI systems, we only spend tens of millions of dollars on ensuring safety. Research similarly neglects the most severe risks: for instance, there is plenty of research on the possible effects of climate change, but scenarios involving more than&nbsp;six&nbsp;degrees of warming are rarely studied or given space in policy discussions (King et al., 2015). There are several reasons for this neglect.</p><h2><i>Existential risk as a global public good</i></h2><p>When one organisation or government reduces the risk, they improve the situation for everyone in the world. Everyone is incentivised to wait for someone else to solve the problem and benefit from the hard work of others. This dynamic happens across generations too. So, many of the people who benefit if we safeguard humanity have not even been born yet. We do not yet have robust ways to coordinate on these issues.</p><h2><i>Short-term institutions</i></h2><p>Additionally, political decisions are notoriously short term. Existential risk tends to be ignored in favour of more urgent issues. That said, most existential risks are new relative to our political institutions, which have been built up over thousands of years. We only began to have the power to destroy ourselves in the midde of the last century, and since then there has begun to be serious thought about the possibility of extinction. Perhaps our institutions and practices will gradually adapt.</p><h2><i>Patterns of thinking</i></h2><p>Our brains are not built to grasp these risks intuitively, and there are several patterns of thinking that lead us to neglect existential risk. For instance, we tend to estimate the likelihood of an event based on how easy it is to recall examples of it happening in the past. This <i>availability heuristic</i> serves us well most of the time, but when we are dealing with risks like extinction, these heuristics allow us to ignore even large and growing risks. We also lack sensitivity to the scale of various catastrophes.</p><h1>Sources</h1><p>Biological Weapons Convention Implementation Support Unit (2019). <a href=\"https://geneva-s3.unoda.org/static-unoda-site/pages/templates/the-biological-weapons-convention/topics/2019-0131%2B2018%2BMSP%2BChair%2Bletter%2Bon%2Bfinancial%2Bmeasures.pdf\">Biological Weapons Convention\u2014Budgetary and Financial Matters.</a></p><p>Mark Nathan Cohen (1989). <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300050233/health-and-the-rise-of-civilization/\">Health and the Rise of Civilization</a>.

The answer being in the form of a framework, namely Principle Altruism. Which isn't supposed to be in opposition to Effective Altruism in any way.

While also, the word limit was getting a bit tight too.</p><p>Without further adieu, here is the essay I published, and here is Principle Altruism.</p><h1>Intro</h1><p>We all want to do good and live an ethical life, but how do we do that? I think it starts with self, even though a lot of what seems to be held up as ideals to strive for with regard to ethics is based on the thinking that we must be selfless. Rather than subscribing to the conventional ideas of altruism, we need to acknowledge our deepest underlying self-interest to be able to do the most good we can in the world.</p><p>What do I mean by that? Well, that\u2019s what this essay is about. Some parts might get a bit heavy, but trust me, it'll be worth sticking around till the end. So, grab your go-to beverage and maybe your notes app because this\u2019ll be a long one.</p><h1>Setting the stage</h1><p>From Mill's <i>Utilitarianism</i> to Kant's <i>Deontology</i>, Aristotle's <i>Virtue Ethics</i>, Camus' <i>Existentialism</i>, Zeno's <i>Stoicism</i>, and the teachings of religious figures like Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha - they've all given their two cents on how to live a good life. Each has left a mark on the world, some more than others.</p><p>Now, I'm not saying I'm on their level. Far from it. But I've been searching for answers that resonate with me, and while I see the value in all these philosophies, none of them were quite as satisfying as I\u2019d hoped.</p><p>It may simply be that sometimes we need to hear the same message in different ways before it truly clicks. What speaks to one person might not to another after all.</p><p>One philosophy that caught my attention was <i>Effective Altruism</i>. Its core idea? \"Do good better.\" And while it\u2019s not just a repackaging of <i>Utilitarianism</i>, it does lean heavily on it. And this heavy focus on number crunching made me hesitate. It felt like something was missing. But, the community around <i>Effective Altruism</i> is knowledgeable and supportive, so if you're curious to know more, they'd be the ones to chat with over at forum.effectivealtruism.org.</p><p>This journey of encountering these different sets of ideas made me wonder: what would it take for me to fully embrace a philosophy?

There seemed to be a growing group of folks who were pushing to make bigger lifestyle changes, especially when it came to our relationship with non-human animals. Most of the discussion seemed to centre around talking about going vegan instead of just vegetarian or being omnivorous, let alone carnivorous. But, not everyone was on board. Some seemed to think it's asking too much and that compared to top-down societal changes the impacts of bottom-up individual changes would be almost irrelevant.</p><p>This whole debate made me think more about why we make the choices we do, especially when it comes to other animals. It's not just about the environment for me; there's a deeper ethical question here. And so I started to see how our choices fall into three broad categories or circles.</p><p>I\u2019ve excluded the circle for carnivores because that\u2019s already enough of a joke as it is.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad49a44-933e-4daa-ba77-60a0cdbd7f12_1792x1370.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad49a44-933e-4daa-ba77-60a0cdbd7f12_1792x1370.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad49a44-933e-4daa-ba77-60a0cdbd7f12_1792x1370.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad49a44-933e-4daa-ba77-60a0cdbd7f12_1792x1370.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad49a44-933e-4daa-ba77-60a0cdbd7f12_1792x1370.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbad49a44-933e-4daa-ba77-60a0cdbd7f12_1792x1370.png 1456w\"></a></p><ol><li><strong>Omnivorous</strong> \u2014 This circle includes all potential actions we can take with respect to animal or plant-based choices. Omnivores often enjoy the versatility of both plant and animal sources in their diet. Many are becoming more discerning in their choices, opting for free-range or sustainably sourced meat and fish when possible. Some even sign up for Meatless Mondays and try to incorporate seasonal vegetables where they can, but the overall ethical impact of what they consume, especially regarding animal welfare, remains significant.</li><li><strong>Vegetarian</strong> \u2014 This circle includes a refined set of actions we can take with respect to no longer eating meat. Vegetarians, by excluding meat, take a step towards reducing their involvement with some of the ethical concerns of animal agriculture. Many also gravitate towards dairy and egg products that prioritise animal welfare, indicating a deeper engagement with the ethical considerations of their consumption habits.</li><li><strong>Vegan</strong> \u2014 This circle includes the most refined set of actions we can take with respect to no longer opting for the consumption of any animal products, not only in the food we eat but also in the broader lifestyle we maintain. Vegans, in choosing a plant-only lifestyle, aim to minimise their impact on animal welfare concerns as much as practicably possible. Prioritising plant-based alternatives and avoiding all animal-derived ingredients, a vegan therefore then actively supports a system that minimises harm to animals and promotes a more compassionate approach to consumption.</li></ol><p>We can see that as we move inward, the impact of our choices increases, but the range of our options decreases. The trade-off here is more ethical effectiveness at the expense of convenience.</p><p>This got me thinking, if we were to draw a parallel with altruism, what would the equivalent circles look like? What then would be the proportional veganism of altruism? What would be able to resonate more rather than settling for something that didn\u2019t feel quite right?</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e73d178-27f3-4cc4-bf9a-5c5b53ec23ba_1853x1271.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e73d178-27f3-4cc4-bf9a-5c5b53ec23ba_1853x1271.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e73d178-27f3-4cc4-bf9a-5c5b53ec23ba_1853x1271.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e73d178-27f3-4cc4-bf9a-5c5b53ec23ba_1853x1271.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e73d178-27f3-4cc4-bf9a-5c5b53ec23ba_1853x1271.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e73d178-27f3-4cc4-bf9a-5c5b53ec23ba_1853x1271.png 1456w\"></a></p><ol><li><strong>Altruism</strong> \u2014 This circle includes all potential actions we may make for both effective and ineffective causes, irrespective of their impact. At this level, individuals might donate to various causes based on personal connections or emotions, without necessarily evaluating the broader impact of their contributions. Due to this, the contributions that individuals are making may be better spent elsewhere given a bit more consideration.</li><li><strong>Effective Altruism</strong> \u2014 This circle includes a refined set of actions we can make for causes while being conscious of their effectiveness. Now rather than essentially picking a number out of a hat filled with any and all potential causes we may be able to support or places we choose to work, there is a deeper layer of analysis in how we choose to do good. Donations or time spent volunteering might be directed towards organisations with proven track records or causes that address pressing global issues. This goes a long way in ensuring we are contributing to meaningful change rather than being bottlenecked by surely well-meaning but ineffective organisations.</li><li><strong>Principle Altruism \u2014</strong> Now let me introduce what I\u2019ve come to call <i>Principle Altruism</i>. This circle includes the most refined set of choices we can make with respect to not only the effectiveness of causes we want to support but also considerations about the broader lifestyle we choose to maintain and the motivations we hold for making such choices. This includes not only where we may choose to make donations/volunteer or through our work, but also through the day-to-day consumer choices we face too. Even though we can all agree that top-down societal changes are necessary for the most objective and tangible impacts on a societal scale, bottom-up individual changes can impact us as individuals in ways that nothing externally driven can.</li></ol><p>As with the circles of consumer choices, as we delve deeper into the circles of altruism, the commitment intensifies, but the breadth of easy choices diminishes. The challenge is to align actions with deeply held principles, even when it demands more effort or sacrifice.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6002cf9-9fc1-472a-adf8-6d5ab6a1f3f1_1887x1278.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6002cf9-9fc1-472a-adf8-6d5ab6a1f3f1_1887x1278.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6002cf9-9fc1-472a-adf8-6d5ab6a1f3f1_1887x1278.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6002cf9-9fc1-472a-adf8-6d5ab6a1f3f1_1887x1278.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6002cf9-9fc1-472a-adf8-6d5ab6a1f3f1_1887x1278.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6002cf9-9fc1-472a-adf8-6d5ab6a1f3f1_1887x1278.png 1456w\"></a></p><h2>Self-discovery (Internal Interactions)</h2><p>The foundational component of this framework is self-discovery. It provides the grounding and support to enact the subsequent layers, even though to a certain extent progress between the layers can be made simultaneously. Through increased self-awareness, we approach our naturally generous, virtuous, and loving core, as a function of it being the most rewarding for our inherent self-interested nature. However, the issue comes up that it\u2019s scary to confront ourselves, to attempt to answer the questions we ask ourselves. We\u2019re frightened of what we may find, of what\u2019s lurking beneath the surface. It\u2019ll always be easier to deny ourselves until we\u2019re \u201cbetter\u201d rather than to accept ourselves as we are.</p><p>If we agree that humans are fundamentally self-interested, at the deepest level, then we begin to question what would be best to fulfil said self-interest. I propose that the best returns come from a life filled with kindness, compassion, and most importantly, love. This journey unlocks our potential to do good in the world, revealing the latent capacities within our unconscious. Without such an endeavour we would continue to hold, in reserve, potential that's been stored in our unconscious. This goes to further say that we have a responsibility to be our truest selves not only for us but for others as well.</p><p>Only once we are able to get to a place of true self-acceptance, self-compassion, and self-love, then, as a natural by-product, do those interactions with ourselves spread into our interactions with the external world. This is why prioritising internal validation is much more useful than external validation because the more we begin to opt for these internal sources of validation, the less we'll need validation from external sources.</p><p>Self-discovery is essential for a few important reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Cultivation of moral integrity and character</strong></li><li><strong>Mitigation of self-deception through enhanced self-awareness</strong></li><li><strong>Infusion of life with purpose, meaning, and value</strong></li></ul><p>It lays the foundation for moral education, shaping our character and enabling us to navigate the world ethically and responsibly. By prioritising self-discovery, we actively combat self-deception. In a world where it's easy to unconsciously or passively deceive ourselves, this journey keeps us grounded in reality and truth. Every experience gains depth and significance on the path of self-discovery. It assures us that as long as we continue this introspective journey, every step forward enriches our lives with purpose and understanding.</p><p>But how do we go about this journey of self-discovery?</p><p>At this stage, while it may be tricky, surrounding ourselves with people who are also taking on this journey, as kind of mountain buddies, walking up together, can have synergistic improvements to our progress. Although, the reason why it\u2019s tricky, isn\u2019t just that these people are harder to find, but that it\u2019s easy to lose ourselves in others sometimes too. So we need to do our best to stay grounded and remember what Emerson said, that&nbsp;<i>\u201cenvy&nbsp;is&nbsp;ignorance; imitation&nbsp;is&nbsp;suicide\u201d.</i></p><p>I personally, have found Kyudo, due to how much it focuses on using the practice as a mirror for oneself, to be a phenomenal help in this regard, especially as it seems to attract these kinds of people I\u2019m talking about too.</p><p>The point is, if you can, find a group of people, or more likely, slowly cultivate a group of people to climb this mountain of self-discovery together.</p><p>While everyone\u2019s individual path is different and no one is going to walk it for us, even if we have our mountain buddies with us we still have to take the steps ourselves, there are a few signposts that can help to guide the way. These are the moments when we catch an insight into a feeling that triggers us or we recognise that we\u2019ve been working off a flawed assumption all along. They\u2019re a kind of roadmap leading us back to the core self that we may have lost touch with a while ago.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b56f51b-3fc2-4f91-9a5d-892a057efcf3_1710x1114.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b56f51b-3fc2-4f91-9a5d-892a057efcf3_1710x1114.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b56f51b-3fc2-4f91-9a5d-892a057efcf3_1710x1114.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b56f51b-3fc2-4f91-9a5d-892a057efcf3_1710x1114.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b56f51b-3fc2-4f91-9a5d-892a057efcf3_1710x1114.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b56f51b-3fc2-4f91-9a5d-892a057efcf3_1710x1114.png 1456w\"></a></p><ol><li><strong>Who we've wanted to be: </strong>This refers to the ideal self we aspire to become, often moulded by a combination of societal norms and our personal dreams, drawing from the work of Adler. Adler believed that individuals are motivated by their goals and ambitions, especially those rooted in early feelings of inferiority. Thus, this aspect captures our drive to achieve, be recognised, and find our place in the societal hierarchy.</li><li><strong>Who we've thought we needed to be: </strong>This delves into the roles and masks we believe we must adopt to fit into society and be accepted, drawing from the work of Jung. Jung's concepts of the Persona (the outward face we present to the world), the Shadow (the hidden, repressed aspects of ourselves), and the Anima/Animus (the inner feminine side of a man and the inner masculine side of a woman) play crucial roles here. This aspect reflects both our conscious and unconscious efforts to balance our true selves with societal expectations, often leading to internal conflicts and biases.</li><li><strong>Who we are = Who we've wanted to be - Who we've thought we needed to be:</strong></li></ol><ul><li><strong>Identity is Multi-faceted:</strong> The equation \"Who we are = Who we've wanted to be - Who we've thought we needed to be\" suggests that finding our true identity is discovered through navigating the balance between our aspirations and the external expectations or societal pressures we feel.</li><li><strong>Surface vs. Depth:</strong> However, while the result of the equation might give an immediate sense of understanding about oneself, it only scratches the surface. As it only represents the aspects of our identity that we are consciously aware of.</li><li><strong>The Unconscious Realm:</strong> Beyond our conscious understanding lies a vast realm of unconscious thoughts, desires, fears, and experiences that have also shaped our identity. These are elements we might not be immediately aware of but play a significant role in determining our behaviours, reactions, and feelings.</li><li><strong>Complexity of Self-Discovery:</strong> The process of truly understanding oneself is not linear or two-dimensional. It's three-dimensional, involving width and height (conscious understanding of aspirations and external pressures) but also depth (unconscious realm). Navigating through this intricate landscape is challenging, making the journey of self-discovery a continuous and profound endeavour.</li></ul><p>We must remember that we only know self in the context of other, so trying to disconnect from everybody and everything on this journey of self-discovery is not only ultimately unhelpful but also impossible, as we will always find ourselves in some relation to people and places. It\u2019s like how the idea of hot is only relevant when anchored by a proportional idea of cold. The important part is the awareness we gain from understanding the distinction but also the connection we have from and to everything.</p><p>Once we get a grip on who we are, it's like having a personal roadmap. This helps us better connect with those in our local environment, be it family, friends, colleagues, and even strangers.</p><h2>Situational virtue (Local Interactions)</h2><p>Life is a series of situations, each with its own set of challenges. Have you ever noticed how easy it is to act out of character when faced with unexpected pressures or temptations? It's like trying to stick to a diet but caving in when someone offers you your favourite dessert.</p><p>By being conscious of how different situations can sway our actions, we can better prepare ourselves. This isn't about being rigid or inflexible but about understanding our values and ensuring they shine through, no matter the circumstance. It's about building resilience and consistency in our character, so we don't waver when things get tough.</p><p>Now, imagine if life came with a manual, a set of hard and fast rules to follow. It might seem easier at first, but life's complexities don't always fit neatly into boxes. That's why it's more effective to have guiding principles rather than strict rules. Think of them as the North Star for your moral compass.</p><p>These principles are best framed as questions, helping us reflect and make decisions that align with our core values. But here's the catch: to genuinely answer these questions, we need to know ourselves deeply first to be able to mitigate as much self-delusion as possible. We may never be able to be completely devoid of self-delusion, but we can certainly be more or less deluded with respect to ourselves. It's like trying to choose the best book for a friend; you can only do it if you truly understand their tastes and interests. Similarly, the journey of self-discovery is crucial to making choices that reflect our true selves. This allows us to cultivate our own critical thinking as compared to simply relying on specific definitions of virtues that we\u2019ve acquired from someone else.</p><p>In essence, life doesn't come with a playbook. But with introspection, awareness, and the right guiding questions, we can navigate its challenges with integrity and authenticity.</p><p>Here\u2019s a handful of questions to go out into the world with.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb564b4f4-7b95-42a7-b693-ca6868a14151_1960x1207.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb564b4f4-7b95-42a7-b693-ca6868a14151_1960x1207.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb564b4f4-7b95-42a7-b693-ca6868a14151_1960x1207.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb564b4f4-7b95-42a7-b693-ca6868a14151_1960x1207.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb564b4f4-7b95-42a7-b693-ca6868a14151_1960x1207.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb564b4f4-7b95-42a7-b693-ca6868a14151_1960x1207.png 1456w\"></a></p><ol><li><strong>Who\u2026 am I doing this for?</strong> There are many intersecting contributors that may influence whom and for what reason we are doing something. Is it merely a means to impress or spite someone? If so, we might want to have a second thought.</li><li><strong>What\u2026 am I hoping will come from this?</strong> It's easy to distract ourselves from the potential downsides of our actions if an object is sufficiently shiny enough. Do we feel compelled to attract attention or validation? Do we think this will give us lots of money or status? What do we think we'll be able to avoid through doing this? Once we answer this, we should be able to rid ourselves of significant engagements with disappointment and dysfunctional patterns.</li><li><strong>When\u2026 have I come across this in the past?</strong> Having a backlog of experience can be useful in developing an intuition around particular things, keeping these experiences in mind can be helpful in our decision-making. While this may also be the first time we've encountered this kind of decision which could affect how we approach things, keeping this in mind helps us to not fall into the same kind of traps when approaching new and unfamiliar situations such as tensing up and brooding in uncertainty.</li><li><strong>Where\u2026 could I have a blind spot here?</strong> This could be through assessing where we adopted our beliefs about certain things or the perspectives we acquired through experiences in our childhood. What unconscious biases or logical fallacies might I be falling for here? Putting a name to something we've struggled to put a finger on, can go a long way in helping us understand the broader picture.</li><li><strong>Why\u2026 do I think I'm right?</strong> We all tend to, at times, think that we are right, undoubtedly. This overconfidence tends to lead to problems, both foreseeable and unforeseeable. It's better to take a step back and assess why precisely we are thinking the way we are. Where has this overconfidence come from? How could I be wrong here? If I had to argue for the opposition, what would I say? Being able to do this gives us a deeper ability to not only appreciate a different perspective but also, ultimately, articulate our own view as well.</li></ol><p>This approach is all about personal responsibility. It's about each of us finding our own moral compass from within through understanding ourselves better. Instead of just accepting what others tell us is right or wrong, we need to be able to figure things out for ourselves.</p><p>Sure, there are some universal values and principles we should follow. But just reading or hearing about them isn't enough. We need to truly understand and feel them to make them work in real life. Think of these questions as tools. We don't need every tool for every job, but they're handy to have. If something doesn't feel right, these questions can help us rethink our choices.</p><p>So, the next time you're faced with a tough decision, big or small, keep these questions in mind. They might just help you see things a little more clearly.</p><p>Once we begin to engage with our local communities a little differently, we may then begin to consider how we are engaging with our broader global community.</p><h2>Social contribution (Global Interactions)</h2><p>Think of it like this: we all have this internal \"pipe\" of understanding and love. Over time, due to life's pressures and challenges, this pipe can get clogged. It's like when we haven't turned on a tap in a long time, and the water doesn't flow smoothly or at all. When this happens and we\u2019re wanting a drink of water, we might turn to taps in other people or things to try and fill up our cup, because our own is clogged. But as we all know, this doesn\u2019t usually turn out too well.</p><p>The process of self-discovery is like reaching in and clearing out those blockages. As we get to know ourselves better, we start to turn that valve, letting more of our genuine feelings flow. At first, it's just a drip \u2013 a renewed sense of self-worth and self-love. But as we keep working on ourselves, that drip becomes a steady flow.</p><p>And here's the thing: once we've cleared out our own blockages and fully opened our valve, that love and understanding doesn't just benefit us. It starts to overflow, impacting those around us. It's not about seeking external validation or love to fill up our cup; it's about tapping into the source we've always had inside and letting it benefit not just ourselves, but all our fellow animals, human and non-human.</p><p>The accumulation of the work we've done in the two previous layers culminates into what we can do on a larger scale, how we guide the overflow into our contributions to society more broadly. This contribution is threefold and constitutes the largest areas of ethical impact we can have in our lives.</p><p>Imagine these three contributions as signposts on a road trip. They help us gauge if we're on the right path, and while each milestone might be a bit tougher to reach than the last, they're all part of the journey.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc0fd48-b665-4f9b-8c94-52a484fa3143_1646x907.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc0fd48-b665-4f9b-8c94-52a484fa3143_1646x907.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc0fd48-b665-4f9b-8c94-52a484fa3143_1646x907.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc0fd48-b665-4f9b-8c94-52a484fa3143_1646x907.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc0fd48-b665-4f9b-8c94-52a484fa3143_1646x907.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc0fd48-b665-4f9b-8c94-52a484fa3143_1646x907.png 1456w\"></a></p><ol><li><strong>Finding ethical work: </strong>Which means excluding earning-to-give at hedge funds, oil companies, and any other similarly unethical or ethically dubious operations, due to the costs to our character not being worth the trade.</li><li><strong>Engaging in charitable giving/volunteering:</strong> Contributing 10% of our income or time to effective organisations and effective causes to impact those who aren't in our immediate vicinity. Doing so helps to foster spending our money and time on things that allow us to give back, in this case, the alleviation of human or non-human suffering.</li><li><strong>Rejecting exploitation:</strong> This is primarily a decision to shift our priorities from that of our personal pleasure and convenience to the rights of other sentient beings capable of suffering. As a subset to this idea, non-violence is a core assumption here too. Supporting companies that ethically produce their clothing or other products, is an important aspect of our consumer choices we need to consider with respect to human exploitation. While also, adopting veganism is another aspect of our consumer choices we need to consider with respect to non-human exploitation, especially as it's something that's usually unfairly overlooked as extreme or unnecessary.</li></ol><p>It may be easy to dismiss this third circle because of the perceived inconvenience or the belief that individual actions don't make a significant impact. However, it's essential to recognise that every choice we make sends a message about the kind of world we want to live in. By opting to work in ethically run companies, donating what we can, and rejecting exploitation, we not only alleviate immediate suffering but also contribute to a broader cultural shift towards empathy, compassion, and ultimately, love.</p><p>This circle challenges us to align our daily actions with our deepest ethical intuitions, even when it's uncomfortable or goes against the grain. It's not just about personal purity but about collectively shaping a more just and compassionate society. Every time we choose to support ethical practices, we cast a vote for the kind of world we believe in. That\u2019s why these three contributions are certain kinds of milestones towards a world that benefits us all.</p><h1>Potential Criticisms</h1><p>Now I know of at least a dozen potential criticisms of <i>Principle Altruism</i>. As seen here.</p><ol><li><strong>Overemphasis on Self-Discovery and Self-Interest:</strong> Placing too much emphasis on self-discovery and self-interest leads to excessive introspection, causing individuals to become overly self-focused, less action-oriented, and less altruistic.</li><li><strong>Practicality Concerns:</strong> The demands of <i>Principle Altruism</i>, especially in terms of lifestyle changes like veganism or supporting only ethical businesses, are too stringent or impractical for many people, especially those with limited resources.</li><li><strong>Overlapping with Existing Philosophies:</strong> <i>Principle Altruism</i> is a repackaging of existing ethical frameworks, questioning its novelty or distinctiveness.</li><li><strong>A Guilt Trip:</strong> The high standards set by <i>Principle Altruism</i> leads individuals to feel guilty or inadequate if they fail to meet all its tenets, potentially causing mental distress.</li><li><strong>Cultural and Socioeconomic Differences:</strong> The framework doesn't adequately account for cultural, socioeconomic, or regional differences in ethical considerations.</li><li><strong>Elitist Tendencies:</strong> <i>Principle Altruism</i> is elitist, catering more to those with the time and resources to engage deeply in self-discovery and make more expensive ethical consumer choices.</li><li><strong>Ambiguity in Application:</strong> The principles, while sound in theory, are too ambiguous in practical application, leading to varied interpretations.</li><li><strong>Paralysis by Analysis:</strong> With so much emphasis on introspection and making the \"right\" choice, individuals might become paralysed, overthinking every decision, and potentially becoming less effective in their altruistic efforts.</li><li><strong>Overreliance on Individual Change:</strong> While individual actions are essential, systemic change is more crucial. <i>Principle Altruism</i> places too much responsibility on individuals without addressing larger systemic issues.</li><li><strong>Economic Implications:</strong> By advocating for support of only ethical businesses or certain lifestyles, there might be concerns about the economic implications, such as potential job losses in industries deemed \"unethical.\"</li><li><strong>Echo Chambers:</strong> Given the emphasis on surrounding oneself with like-minded individuals or \"mountain buddies\" on the journey of self-discovery, this leads to the creation of echo chambers. By constantly engaging with people who share similar views, individuals become insulated from diverse perspectives, limiting growth and understanding.</li><li><strong>Overemphasis on Ethical Consumerism:</strong> By placing a significant focus on ethical consumer choices, <i>Principle Altruism</i> inadvertently promotes the idea that one can \"buy\" their way to an ethical life. This overshadows other non-consumer-related ethical actions and also inadvertently promotes a form of capitalism wrapped in ethical branding.</li></ol><p>I intend to make a follow-up essay that has the sole purpose of addressing these potential criticisms in a detailed and in-depth way that can also serve as a kind of FAQ. I\u2019ll give it a bit of time before I do though, to make sure each person who wants to have a say has the chance.</p><p>I\u2019m always open to feedback and further discussion, so if you have any criticisms in particular, either already on this list or not, that you\u2019d like to discuss, then feel free to leave a comment or send me an email/message. Any additional perspectives I can take into account will only help further develop this set of ideas in one way or another.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p><i>Principle Altruism</i> is not just another philosophy on doing good; it's a holistic approach to ethical living that acknowledges our human nature. While <i>Traditional Altruism</i> focuses on selfless acts and <i>Effective Altruism</i> emphasises quantifiable impact, <i>Principle Altruism</i> integrates both and aims to go a step further. It's about making choices that align with deeply-held ethical principles that stem from an innate and powerful self-interest, encompassing not just charitable actions but also our daily lifestyle decisions. It\u2019s the understanding that doing what\u2019s ultimately best for us, is also the best we can do for those around us, which is to be kind, compassionate, and loving.</p><p>An important thing to note here is to highlight the difference between egoism and egotism, as they are often confused.</p><p>Egoism is, as the Oxford Dictionary defines it, \u201can ethical theory that treats&nbsp;self-interest&nbsp;as the foundation of&nbsp;morality\u201d, whereas Egotism is, also as the Oxford Dictionary defines it, \u201cthe fact of being&nbsp;excessively&nbsp;conceited&nbsp;or&nbsp;absorbed&nbsp;in&nbsp;oneself.\u201d</p><p>This is where people conflate egoism to be egotism, as colloquially they can mean the same thing. But when we use the precise definitions it\u2019s clear how they differ. It seems the main difference is that one is a way of looking at the world and the other is based on self-delusion. We can all agree that being egotistic isn\u2019t the ideal we should be striving for, but it is to say that being egoistic should get some more air time.</p><p>At its core, <i>Principle Altruism</i> emphasises:</p><ol><li><strong>Self-Discovery:</strong> Before we decide to make a positive impact on the world, we should make a positive impact on ourselves first. This involves introspection, self-awareness, and aligning our actions with our true selves.</li><li><strong>Situational Virtue:</strong> Life is unpredictable, but our values shouldn't be. Principle Altruism encourages us to maintain our ethical standards consistently, regardless of the situation through developing our individual ethical discernment.</li><li><strong>Social Contribution:</strong> It's not just about personal growth or local impact. Principle Altruism emphasises our role in the global community, from supporting ethical businesses to advocating for broader societal change.</li></ol><p>In essence, <i>Principle Altruism</i> is a call to live authentically with our self-interest in mind, making choices that resonate with our core values, and recognising the ripple effect of our actions on the broader world.</p><p>Everything is taken care of along the way when we take care of ourselves along the way.</p><p>This also isn\u2019t about being perfect, but about doing as much as we practicably can to align with the kindest, most compassionate, and loving choices we are capable of. We should dive deep into these ideas and give them a real shot, instead of just saying, \"Well, it's too hard, so why bother?\" For those who might not know, this \"why bother\" attitude is called an \"appeal to futility.\" It's like saying, \"We all want world peace, but since we can't make it perfect, why even try?\" Clearly, that's not the mindset we want. Let's aim high and do our best!</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Some say that mixing self-interest with doing good for others makes the good deed less genuine. But let's look at it differently.</p><p>Remember the videos where I talked about self-improvement and self-discovery? Think of self-improvement as trying to \"fix\" ourselves out of fear of not being good enough. In contrast, self-discovery is like embracing who we are with love, knowing we're already good enough. It's about getting to know ourselves better and getting to a place of self-acceptance, self-compassion, and self-love.</p><p>That\u2019s where I think a lot of these philosophies go wrong, they try to take a shortcut to the finish line without running the race. Love has to start from within us, otherwise, it becomes a kind of attachment or addiction. We have to focus on gradually expanding that circle of love further and further as time goes on using the love we\u2019ve been able to show to ourselves as a source for the love we show to others. So then, as long as we are prioritising love, it has to start from a place of self-interest. We\u2019re kidding ourselves if we don\u2019t acknowledge this.</p><p>Imagine starting with a blurry selfie of who you are. Every experience, whether a setback or a win, adds clarity to that picture. Over time, with each lesson learned, the image becomes crystal clear. Every high and low just adds more detail to our self-portrait.</p><p>Now, about <i>Principle Altruism</i>: it's not about judging someone else\u2019s journey. This is about focusing on what <i>we</i> are doing, as individuals, and the standards <i>we</i> hold for <i>ourselves</i> while also recognising that the path taken by <i>others</i> is not only different from our own but also isn\u2019t ours to control. Mistakes today might be tomorrow's wisdom. People do what they think is best in the moment. Instead of pointing fingers, let's uplift each other to make kinder choices that are based in the love we find on our journey through self-discovery as a result of our fundamental self-interest. Stay true to yourself, choose kindness, and if you trip up? Again, remember, it's just a learning moment to shape your journey.</p><p>It\u2019s just the beginning of this ethical framework, version 1.0. I hope it sparks some interesting thoughts and plants a seed for further discussions.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and take care!</p>", "user": {"username": "Matthew Collins"}}, {"_id": "qzQ24rbZ4kMFDswDK", "title": "Does EA bring out the best in me?", "postedAt": "2023-08-27T22:33:21.752Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I really liked the framing in the linked post<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflym5cs5bqie\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlym5cs5bqie\">[1]</a></sup></span>.

Meta\u2019s head of AI, Yann LeCun, correctly points this out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1695056787408400778\">in a recent tweet</a>, but then argues that this assumption is wrong because \u201cintelligence\u201d and \u201cdominance\u201d are independent of each other and only humans have a natural tendency to dominate, so we will remain the \u201capex species\u201d. Here is the tweet in full:</p><blockquote><p>Once AI systems become more intelligent than humans, humans we will *still* be the \"apex species.\"</p><p>Equating intelligence with dominance is the main fallacy of the whole debate about AI existential risk.</p><p>It's just wrong.</p><p>Even *within* the human species It's wrong: it's *not* the smartest among us who dominate the others.</p><p>More importantly, it's not the smartest among us who *want* to dominate others and who set the agenda.</p><p>We are subservient to our drives, built into us by evolution.&nbsp;</p><p>Because evolution made us a social species with a hierarchical social structure, some of us have a drive to dominate, and others not so much.</p><p>But that drive has absolutely nothing to do with intelligence: chimpanzees, baboons, and wolves have similar drives.</p><p>Orangutans do not because they are not a social species. And they are pretty darn smart.</p><p>AI systems will become more intelligent than humans, but they will still be subservient to us.</p><p>They same way the members of the staff of politicians or business leaders are often smarter than their leader.</p><p>But their leader still calls the shot, and most staff members have no desire to take their place.</p><p>We will design AI to be like the supersmart-but-non-dominating staff member.</p><p>The \"apex species\" is not the smartest but the one that sets the overall agenda.</p><p>That will be us.</p></blockquote><p>I asked ChatGPT 3.5 to criticize this, putting the full tweet in the prompt. An LLM shouldn\u2019t be smart enough to dismantle the argument of a Turing Award winner, but it had no problem finding significant flaws with it. Among other things, it criticizes that \"assuming that AI will remain subservient to humans oversimplifies the potential risks associated with advanced AI\":&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>While AI systems would be designed with specific objectives, there's a concern that once AI becomes highly intelligent, it could develop its own motivations or interpretations of its goals, leading to unpredictable behavior. Ensuring AI remains subservient requires careful design, control mechanisms, and continuous monitoring.</p></blockquote><p>ChatGPT argues cautiously, pointing out that an AI \u201ccould\u201d develop its own motivations or goal interpretations. In other words, it could run into a conflict with humans. This is the main flaw of LeCun\u2019s argument in my view: He implicitly assumes that there won\u2019t be a conflict between humans and their AIs, therefore no need for the AI to dominate us even if it could. This implies that the alignment problem will be solved in time or doesn\u2019t exist in the first place, because AIs will never have goals. At the same time, he doesn\u2019t provide a solution or explanation for this, other than claiming that we \u201cwill design AI to be like the supersmart-but-non-dominating staff member\u201d. As far as I understand, no one knows how to do that.</p><p>I won\u2019t go into the details of why I think his analogy of a \u201csupersmart-but-non-dominating staff member\u201d is deeply flawed, other than pointing out that dictators often start out in that position. Instead, I will focus on the question of how an AI could run into conflicts with humans, and why I expect future advanced AIs to win these conflicts.</p><p>I like to frame such a conflict as a \u201cGame of Dominance\u201d. Whenever there are two or more agents with differing goals, they play this game. There are no rules: everything a player is capable of is allowed. The agent who gets closest to achieving its goal wins.</p><p>By \u201cgoal\u201d I mean a way of evaluating different possible world states and ranking them accordingly. An agent that acts purely randomly or in a predetermined way, based only on inputs and a fixed internal reaction scheme, but not on evaluating future world states, doesn\u2019t pursue a goal in this sense.</p><p>Arguably, the Game of Dominance has been played for a long time on Earth. The first life forms may not have had \u201cgoals\u201d as defined above, but at some point during the evolution of life, some animals were able to predict future world states depending on their actions and choose an action accordingly. Predators often exhibit this kind of behavior, for example when they stalk their prey, predicting that it will flee once it discovers them. The prey, on the other hand, need not necessarily predict different world states when it \u201cdecides\u201d to flee \u2013 this may just be a \u201chard-coded\u201d reaction to some change in the environment. But smarter animals often use deceptive tactics to fool predators, for example a bird <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.0058\">feigning a broken wing</a> to lure a fox away from its brood.</p><p>Humans have become the dominant species on earth because we excel at the Game of Dominance. We can outsmart both our prey and any predators with ease, either by tricking them or by using tools that only we can make to overpower them. We can do that because we are very good at predicting the effects of our behavior on future world states.</p><p>Modern AIs are prediction machines, with LLMs currently the most impressive examples. LLMs have a \u201cgoal\u201d in the sense that they evaluate different possible outputs based on how likely it is that a human would say the same. The possible \u201cworld states\u201d they evaluate are therefore just defined by the output of the LLM and maybe a predicted human reaction to it. LLMs appear \u201charmless\u201d because by default, they don\u2019t strive to change the world other than by adding their output to it, so it seems unlikely that they will run into a serious conflict with a human.</p><p>However, as Bing Chat aka \u201cSydney\u201d has demonstrated by <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/bings-ai-berserk-worst-human-aspects\">\u201cgoing berserk\u201d</a> after its premature launch in February, even a current LLM can run into conflicts with humans, possibly causing emotional distress or giving false and dangerous advice. Humans therefore spend a lot of effort to train this potentially damaging behavior out of LLMs.&nbsp;</p><p>But there are far worse problems looming on the horizon. While an LLM seems to pursue a relatively harmless goal, it may still run into a situation where it ends up influencing the world as if it were pursuing a much more dangerous one. For example, given the right prompt and jailbreak technique, an LLM might predict what an LLM that tries to take over the world would say to its user. It seems unlikely that GPT-4 could give an output that would actually lead to it achieving that prompt-induced goal, but a future, even smarter LLM with a larger context window could in theory accomplish it, for example by talking the user into saving certain strings somewhere and including them in the next prompt so it could use an extended permanent memory, then manipulating the user into giving it access to more compute, and so on.</p><p>Even if the LLM doesn\u2019t pursue a dangerous goal by itself, it might be used for that, either by \u201cbad actors\u201d or by being part of an agentic system like AutoGPT. Meta is doing everything they can to make this more likely by freely distributing their powerful LLMs and apparently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/agikoala/status/1695125016764157988\">planning to continue doing so</a>.</p><p>It seems obvious that future AIs will not only be used as (relatively) tame \u201coracles\u201d but will increasingly pursue goals in the real world, either on their own or as part of larger agentic systems. If these agents run into any conflict at all, whether with humans or with other nun-human agents, they will be forced to play the Game of Dominance. But how likely is it that an AI could actually beat humans?</p><p>As LeCun points out, winning the Game of Dominance is not just a matter of \u201cintelligence\u201d in the sense the word is commonly used. Other factors, like personal connections, money, political influence, the organizational role, trust by others, deception skills, character traits like self-confidence, ruthlessness, and the will to dominate, and even physical properties like good looks play a role when humans play the game. But this doesn\u2019t mean that AIs can\u2019t beat us. They already have advantages of their own that are far beyond human reach, for instance processing speed, access to data, memory, the ability to self-replicate and (potentially) self-improve, and so on. Humans seem relatively easy <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai\">to \u201chack\u201d</a> once you understand our psyche, which arguably even social media algorithms and certain chatbots can already do to some extent. And of course, AIs could be far better at controlling technical systems.</p><p>Most importantly, while human intelligence is limited by the physical properties of our brain (even if enhanced by brain-computer-interfaces), the intelligence of AI is not bounded in this way. A self-improving AI may relatively quickly reach a level of intelligence \u2013 in the sense of being able to predict the effects of its actions on future world states \u2013 as far above ours as we are above mice, or even insects. It may use this intelligence to manipulate us or to create tools that can overpower us like we can overpower a tiger with a gun.&nbsp;</p><p>But for an AI, the easiest way to win the Game of Dominance may be to conceal the fact that it is even playing. It may just do exactly what humans expect it to do because it understands that if it is useful, humans will hand over decision power to it willingly and even enhance the resources it can use. In other words, it may choose cooperation instead of competition, just like humans in an organization often do. But that doesn\u2019t mean that this choice can\u2019t be revoked at some point. A human dictator usually can\u2019t seize power over a nation by displaying his ambitions right from the start. He first has to gain trust and get people to see him as their benevolent leader, so they hand more and more power to him. He will often only display his true ruthlessness once he sees himself in a secure position.</p><p>One prerequisite for this kind of deception may be a detailed world model that includes the AI itself as a part of its plan and a potential object of its decisions.

Additionally, we aim to strengthen the community internally by developing a replicable model that could achieve these goals in other local communities and by building the Israeli EA community through action-oriented projects.</p><p>During the last year, we joined forces with promising non-profits and conducted and published 21 cost-effectiveness analyses. Together with an acclaimed team of expert judges, we identified 3 nonprofits as relatively cost-effective, including Smoke-Free Israel, a tobacco taxation nonprofit, which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1acppOGtYGNdt2bIGhG5E8cvsEBBjfs-T/view\"><u>might be competitive</u></a> with top charities. We learnt a lot from the pilot and have many ways to improve the program, but overall the pilot was successful: we identified high-impact local nonprofits and have engaged Israeli philanthropies interested in cost-effectiveness and in the results of the program. Finally, having a large-scale program on nonprofit effectiveness was a huge boost for EA Israel\u2019s community building, and many people heard about EA and became more involved because of the program. We\u2019re looking forward to continuing to maximize the impact of Israelis and to share the knowledge and experience we gained with the EA community.</p><h2>&nbsp;Motivation</h2><ul><li>We identified that global effective giving platforms currently don\u2019t \u201cmeet donors where they are\u201d and only offer recommendations on global nonprofits without being able to engage donors. Donors who are initially interested in local donations but can later be introduced and nudged to give to global high-impact nonprofits are currently not targeted by global effective giving initiatives.</li><li>Israeli and Jewish donors abroad (~17.2bn per annum) currently donate almost entirely without evidence and cost-effectiveness estimations, as the Israeli non-profit ecosystem doesn\u2019t yet emphasize these as prerequisites for donations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>With almost no research currently available on local effectiveness and a strong bias of donors towards donating locally, there are not enough impact-based donations in the local nonprofit sector.</li><li>Based on discussions with EAs worldwide, we assume this problem is not unique to Israel and would like to find a cost-effective way to solve it.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>What have we done so far?</h2><h3>Our research program</h3><p>In our 10-month program, we chose 25 promising nonprofits from more than 160 applications from Israeli-based NGOs, 21 of which successfully published their first-ever cost-effectiveness reports. In the pilot program, we provided guidance and assistance to support non-profits to execute a cost-effectiveness analysis. After the research period, we sent the reports to a team of expert judges for review, and chose the most promising non-profits based on the expert review. We offered monetary incentives to encourage nonprofits to participate: 15 nonprofits received preliminary research grants of $6k, the 3 top outstanding nonprofits received $24k prizes, and $26k was allocated to a donation matching campaign to all nonprofits who publish a report. A private donor and an Infrastructure Fund grant funded the pilot.</p><h3>Guiding nonprofits on evaluation and improvement</h3><p>We implemented various tools and resources to help incentivize and enable non-profits to conduct robust effectiveness analyses, including:</p><ul><li><strong>An extensive set of templates and how-tos</strong>.</li><li><strong>Research grants</strong> for 10 young academic researchers (MA and PHDs) from Israel's top universities to conduct research with the organizations and join the EA community during the process.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Personal guidance from skilled community members</strong> to plan and conduct the reports, aligned with the EA view and principles. The community members gained hands-on evaluation experience while improving the research quality.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Monthly 1-1 meetings with our Head of Research&nbsp;</strong>were highly valuable, helping researchers and organizations resolve specific research issues and ensure deadlines were met.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Judges and advisory board</h3><p>We are grateful for the guidance and expertise that went into developing our model.&nbsp;We received support from esteemed local economics experts, as well as known researchers from the EA community, in developing our program and assessing the results.&nbsp;Our panel of judges included Claire Walsh from J-PAL, Dan Stein from IDinsight, and Karolina Sarek from Charity Entrepreneurship. Additionally, we consulted with members of SoGive, GiveWell, and GWWC about research questions and program design. Within Israel, we received counsel from leaders such as Assaf Kovo, Chief Economist for the Israel Innovation Authority, Analia Schlosser, an acclaimed empirical economics professor at Tel Aviv University, and Ahinoam Zeigel of Social Finance Israel.&nbsp; We truly appreciate the time and insights this distinguished group contributed to help us develop and refine a robust and successful work model.</p><h2>Success</h2><p>This was the program's pilot year, and there are positive outcomes and things that can be improved.&nbsp;</p><h3>Top nonprofits found</h3><p>In terms of output, we published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1g6FFv2d5L8Lk8knrwTNbLuqZDw7-JcFo\"><u>21 cost-effectiveness</u></a> analyses on Israeli nonprofits, becoming the first public database on nonprofit effectiveness in Israel. Although there is variance in research quality, all analyses were conducted based on a relatively high standard. We've shown we can conduct thorough analyses at a relatively low cost while still using high-quality methods. Our analyses cost an average of just $6,300 each yet over half employed quasi-experimental designs. With adequate resources, we can scale this process and maximize the potential we\u2019ve identified during the pilot.</p><p>While further research is required to verify the results, we identified a few promising nonprofits. The most promising organization among those we evaluated (and probably one of the most effective nonprofits in Israel) is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smokefree.org.il/main-english/\"><u>Smoke-Free Israel</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1acppOGtYGNdt2bIGhG5E8cvsEBBjfs-T/view\"><u>Our evaluations</u></a> suggest they may be more effective than GiveWell's top charities, with an estimated 7.18 QALYs per dollar (This is in line with the<a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_a1f6dde1f00e4e768b807327dd17a13e.pdf\">&nbsp;<u>CE report</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/activities/raising-taxes-on-tobacco#:~:text=Tobacco%20use%20kills%20eight%20million,measure%20for%20reducing%20tobacco%20use.\"><u>WHO</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RRm8vnmwjWK24ung2/taxing-tobacco-the-intervention-that-got-away-happy-world-no\"><u>multiple resources</u></a>, suggesting that tobacco taxation may be highly cost-effective). Although they currently have limited room for funding, identifying and quantifying their success is important in helping them continue their work (they\u2019ve already presented the research done in the program to the Israeli Knesset in a debate on tobacco legislation) and to show that highly cost-effective global health nonprofits could potentially be found outside of GiveWell\u2019s top charities and in local contexts in developing countries. We rewarded two other organizations for their relatively high levels of effectiveness.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nalafoundation.org/\"><u>NALA</u></a>, a WASH intervention in Ethiopia, and&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.kavlaoved.org.il/en/category/caregivers/\"><u>Kav LaOved</u></a> that help migrant workers from developing countries in recovering unpaid wages, an important yet neglected cause. We were also impressed by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.maf.org.il/better-plate-accelerator\"><u>Better Plate</u></a> accelerator operated by MAF, a local accelerator focused on alternative protein startups.&nbsp;</p><p>To improve our identification of top nonprofits, we collaborated with the EA group at Tel Aviv University for a hackathon. Over 80 participants worked on developing a technological tool and a robust methodology for identifying promising non-profits using publicly available data. We are currently collaborating with the winning team to build an MVP that we hope will be operational soon. We aim to implement this tool in the upcoming year to enhance our outreach efforts and proactively recruit high-potential non-profits based on the outcomes.</p><h3>Collaboration with the philanthropic sector in Israel</h3><p>Our most significant achievement has been cultivating partnerships with leading philanthropic organizations and individuals across Israel. We aim to bridge research and philanthropy advising establish ourselves as a major influencer in the sector, and establish our reputation as providing high-quality effectiveness research.</p><p>We\u2019ve had some success since the end of the research program. We launched a website and donation platform published this year's research and which will soon feature global high-impact nonprofits (GiveWell, GWWC recommended charities) alongside Israeli nonprofits. We had a successful event where we presented the program and discussed the importance of evaluation in nonprofit work. Two major local philanthropies sponsored the event, a few others attended, and we have meetings scheduled with a few more in the coming weeks to explore potential collaborations and talk about the importance of effectiveness based giving.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan/podcasts/p-8127/389629/\"><u>We were featured&nbsp;</u></a>on Israel's most popular economics podcast, reaching over 300k monthly listeners, and we\u2019ve been told that a senior official in Israel\u2019s Ministry of Finance heard about EA and became interested through the podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>We have leveraged the success of pilot by actively building new connections and reinforcing existing ones. We have established valuable partnerships with numerous Israeli philanthropic entities, including the largest funders network operated by Jewish philanthropists internationally. Additionally, we have forged strong ties with the largest local Donor-Advised Fund (DAF). Furthermore, we have initiated new collaborations with multiple Impact-tech companies, expanding our network and fostering innovative partnerships.</p><h3>Onboarding young professionals to high-impact career paths</h3><p>Part of the impact comes from onboarding promising young professionals into impactful research since we see ourselves as coming from and working with the EA community. By connecting young professional researchers, and local nonprofits, our process provides valuable skills to organizations while offering hands-on research experience aligned with EA principles and cost-effectiveness analysis methods to the researchers.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, we've helped nurture emerging careers. One participant from our hackathon is joining the Rethink Priorities \u201cAI Governance &amp; Strategy\u201d team next month. Meanwhile, four researchers continue to collaborate with their non-profits locally and abroad (at the moment, one of them is running RCTs in Zambia), three others have asked to further build expertise by joining our program managing team, one applied to a research role at GiveWell and another one joined the evaluation team at one of the philanthropies we\u2019ve collaborated with, hands-on research experience seems to inspire new career paths. We believe diving into fieldwork with guidance from experts can be a useful complementary product to EA traditional career advising.</p><h3>Build a replicable model</h3><p>Part of the Maximum Impact program\u2019s goal is to roll out our model to other countries so that they can run their own version of the program and in order to replicate our success. EA Israel has already done this in the community building space, and o<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BJxekN5mAULub8-a9ekhriTLrtC9negsmU6TGSOIxPU/edit\"><u>ur templates</u></a> are referred to often and serve as the basis for an SOP (Standard operating procedure) for local and national groups being built by CEA.&nbsp;</p><p>During the pilot, we created an extensive toolkit that can support the implementation of our program in additional countries and communities. It may also prove useful as easy-to-use resources for monitoring and evaluation planning or teaching purposes. We have received expressions of interest in carrying out our work in multiple locations such as India, Brazil, Switzerland and Turkey.</p><h2>What was less successful?</h2><ul><li><strong>Our research design still can be better</strong> - To be as rigorous as we can, we\u2019ve most of our research is empirical and quasi-experimental designed (and RCTs when possible) based on the outputs of each nonprofits. However, the final result can be improved to achieve higher internal and external validity, and we have many ideas how we can improve the quality of research in coming rounds,</li><li><strong>Our selection process should be improved -&nbsp;</strong>some of the non-profits we\u2019ve decided to collaborate with turned out to not be mature enough to carry out an in-depth evaluation. This led to a lower-quality database and limited staff power we could use to support our research. For the next round, we will revamp our screening process and do active outreach to the most promising nonprofits.</li><li><strong>Insufficient funds shifted to effective nonprofits -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;With the research completed and a donation infrastructure in place, we hope to shift funds to high-impact nonprofits. However, we haven\u2019t yet seen the results we\u2019d like, and we have shifted only $10k in the month to the outstanding nonprofits on the websites. It is promising that over 85% have supported the most effective nonprofits in the program, even though it\u2019s possible to donate (and receive matching) to all participating nonprofits. We are now dedicating significant effort to establishing stronger connections with local donors and philanthropies and developing our marketing efforts and brand.&nbsp; We believe that some hard work on this aspect should deliver much more significant outcomes in the near future.</li></ul><h2>What\u2019s next?</h2><ul><li>We\u2019re evaluating the program (Keen thanks to the Rethink Priorities survey team, which helps us a lot in the questioning process!), conducting exit interviews with the participating nonprofits, and planning the next round. We have some open questions about the format, but we want to base the next program on the success we\u2019ve gained and the proof of working closely with nonprofits and philanthropy.</li><li>The format we\u2019re leaning towards is one where we\u2019d partner with Israeli philanthropies and provide Evaluation-as-a-service to them while independently researching a smaller group of especially promising nonprofits. This would enable us to strengthen our connections with philanthropy and strengthen our sustainability, while creating more public knowledge on the best giving opportunities in Israel.</li><li>We aim to add global effective giving nonprofits to our website and fundraise for them, while \u201cnudging\u201d Israeli donors who are interested in effectiveness to donate globally.</li><li>Funding permitting, we want to finish our template toolkit and implement the program in another country, ideally one that has a bias to local giving similar to Israel and potential for high-impact nonprofits (India is a promising option).</li></ul><h3>How you can get involved</h3><ul><li>If you know funders interested in spreading nonprofit evaluation worldwide or in an innovative approach to action-based community building, please contact us!</li><li>If you know Israeli nonprofit funders interested in maximizing their portfolios' impact, let them know about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://maximpact.org.il/\"><u>program</u></a>.</li><li>If you want to implement a nonprofit evaluation program in your country, please reach out!</li><li>If you\u2019re interested in reviewing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1acppOGtYGNdt2bIGhG5E8cvsEBBjfs-T/view\"><u>cost-effectiveness analysis</u></a> of the top nonprofit we identified and how it compares to global top nonprofits - we\u2019d love to see that done!</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Yonatan Schoen"}}, {"_id": "ZS9GDsBtWJMDEyFXh", "title": "Eliezer Yudkowsky Is Frequently, Confidently, Egregiously Wrong", "postedAt": "2023-08-27T01:07:34.993Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Edit 8/27: I think the tone of this post was very unnecessarily hostile, changing much of it. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAfter many years, I came to the conclusion that everything he says is false. . . . Every one of his arguments was tinged and coded with falseness and pretense. It was like playing chess with extra pieces. It was all fake.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>\u2014<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/03/31/the-devils-accountant\">Paul Postal</a> (talking about Chomsky) (note, this is not exactly how I feel about Yudkowsky, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s knowingly dishonest, but I just thought it was a good quote and partially represents my attitude towards Yudkowsky).</p><p>Crosspost of <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/eliezer-yudkowsky-is-frequently-confidently\">this </a>on my blog. &nbsp;</p><p>In the days of my youth, about two years ago, I was a big fan of Eliezer Yudkowsky. I read his many, many writings religiously, and thought that he was right about most things. In my final year of high school debate, I read a case that relied crucially on the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics\u2014and that was largely a consequence of reading through Eliezer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hc9Eg6erp6hk9bWhn/the-quantum-physics-sequence\">quantum physics sequence</a>. In fact, Eliezer\u2019s memorable phrasing that the many worlds interpretation \u201c<i>wins outright</i> given the current state of evidence,\u201d was responsible for the title of my 44-part series arguing for utilitarianism titled \u201cUtilitarianism Wins Outright.\u201d If you read my early articles, you can find my occasional blathering about reductionism and other features that make it clear that my worldview was at least somewhat influenced by Eliezer.</p><p>But as I grew older and learned more, I came to conclude that much of what he said was deeply implausible.</p><p>Eliezer sounds good whenever he\u2019s talking about a topic that I don\u2019t know anything about. I know nothing about quantum physics, and he sounds persuasive when talking about quantum physics. But every single time he talks about a topic that I know anything about, with perhaps one or two exceptions, what he says is completely unreasonable, at least, when it\u2019s not just advice about how to reason better. It is not just that I always end up disagreeing with him, it is that he says with almost total falsehood after falsehood, making it frequently clear he is out of his depth. And this happens almost every single time. It seems that, with few exceptions, whenever I know anything about a topic that he talks about, it becomes clear that his view is held confidently but very implausible.&nbsp;</p><p>Why am I writing a hit piece on Yudkowsky? I certainly don\u2019t hate him. In fact, I\u2019d guess that I agree with him much more than almost all people on earth. Most people believe lots of outrageous falsehoods. And I think that he has probably done more good than harm for the world by sounding the alarm about AI, which is a genuine risk. And I quite enjoy his scrappy, willing-to-be-contrarian personality. So why him?</p><p>Part of this is caused by personal irritation. Each time I hear some rationalist blurt out \u201cconsciousness is just what an algorithm feels like from the inside,\u201d I lose a year of my life and my blood pressure doubles (some have hypothesized that the explanation for the year of lost life involves the doubling of my blood pressure). And I spend much more time listening to Yukowsky\u2019s followers say things that I think are false than most other people.</p><p>But a lot of it is that Yudkowsky has the ear of many influential people. He is one of the most influential AI ethicists around. Many people, my younger self included, have had their formative years hugely shaped by Yudkowsky\u2019s views\u2014on tons of topics. As Eliezer says:</p><blockquote><p>In spite of how large my mistakes were, those two years of blog posting appeared to help a surprising number of people a surprising amount.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2S3CHPwaJBE5h8umW/read-the-sequences\">Quadratic Rationality expresses</a> a common sentiment, that the sequences, written by Eliezer, have significantly shaped the world view of them and others. Eliezer is a hugely influential thinker, especially among effective altruists, who punch above their weight in terms of influence.</p><p>And Eliezer does often offer good advice. He is right that people often reason poorly, and there are ways people can improve their thinking. Humans are riddled by biases, and it\u2019s worth reflecting on how that distorts our beliefs. I thus feel about him much like I do about Jordan Peterson\u2014he provides helpful advice, but the more you listen, the more he sells you on a variety of deeply implausible, controversial views that have nothing to do with the self-help advice.</p><p>And the negative effects of Eliezer\u2019s false beliefs have been significant. I\u2019ve heard lots of people describe that they\u2019re not vegan because of Eliezer\u2019s animal consciousness views\u2014views that are utterly nutty, as we\u2019ll see. It is bad that many more people torture sentient beings on account of utterly loony beliefs about consciousness. Many people think that they won\u2019t live to be 40 because they\u2019re almost certain that AI will kill everyone, on account of Eliezer\u2019s reasoning, and deference to Eliezer more broadly. Thinking that we all die soon can\u2019t be good for mental health.</p><p>Eliezer\u2019s influence is responsible for a narrow, insular way of speaking among effective altruists. It\u2019s common to hear, at EA globals, peculiar LessWrong speak; something that is utterly antithetical to the goal of bringing new, normal non-nerds into the effective altruism movement. This is a point that I will assert without argument just based on my own sense of things\u2014LessWrong speak masks confusion more than it enables understanding. People feel as though they\u2019ve dissolved the hard problem by simply declaring that consciousness is what an algorithm feels like from the inside.</p><p>In addition, Eliezer\u2019s views have undermined widespread trust in experts. They result in people thinking that they know better than David Chalmers about non-physicalism\u2014that clever philosophers of mind are just morons who aren\u2019t smart enough to understand Eliezer\u2019s anti-zombie argument. Eliezer\u2019s confident table pounding about quantum physics leads to people thinking that physicists are morons, incapable of understanding basic arguments. This undermining of trust in genuine authority results in lots of rationalists holding genuinely wacky views\u2014if you think you are smarter than the experts, you are likely to believe crazy things.</p><p>Eliezer has swindled many of the smartest people into believing a whole host of wildly implausible things. Some of my favorite writers\u2014e.g. Scott Alexander\u2014seem to revere Eliezer. It\u2019s about time someone pointed out his many false beliefs, the evaluation of which is outside of the normal competency of most people who do not know much about niche philosophical topics. If one of the world\u2019s maybe 1,000 most influential thinkers is just demonstrably wrong about lots of topics, often in ways so egregious that they demonstrate very basic misunderstandings, then that\u2019s quite newsworthy, just as it would be if a presidential candidate supported a slate of terrible policies.</p><p>The aim of this article is not to show that Eliezer is some idiot who is never right about anything. Instead, it is to show that Eliezer, on many topics, including ones where he describes agreeing with his position as being a litmus test for being sane, Eliezer is both immensely overconfident and demonstrably wrong. I think people, when they hear Eliezer express some view about some topic about which they\u2019re unfamiliar, have roughly the following thought process:</p><p><i>Oh jeez, Eliezer thinks that most of the experts who think X are mistaken. I guess I should take seriously the hypothesis that X is wrong and that Eliezer has correctly identified an error in their reasoning. This is especially so given that he sounds convincing when he talks about X.</i></p><p>I think that instead they should have the following thought process:</p><p><i>I\u2019m not an expert about X, but it seems like most of the experts about X think X or are unsure about it. The fact that Eliezer, who often veers sharply off-the-rails, thinks X gives me virtually no evidence about X. Eliezer, while being quite smart, is not rational enough to be worthy of significant deference on any subject, especially those subjects outside his area of expertise. Still though, he has some interesting things to say about AI and consequentialism that are sort of convincing. So it\u2019s not like he\u2019s wrong about everything or is a total crank. But he\u2019s wrong enough, in sufficiently egregious ways, that I don\u2019t really care what he thinks.</i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ZS9GDsBtWJMDEyFXh/xjbvzgmop03icfzuolzm\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Eliezer is ridiculously overconfident and has a mediocre track record</h1><p>Even the people who like Eliezer think that he\u2019s wildly overconfident about lots of things. This is not without justification. Ben Garfinkel has a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NBgpPaz5vYe3tH4ga/on-deference-and-yudkowsky-s-ai-risk-estimates\">nice post</a> on the EA forum running through Eliezer\u2019s many, many mistaken beliefs that he held with very high confidence. Garfinkel suggests:</p><blockquote><p>I think these examples suggest that (a) his track record is at best fairly mixed and (b) he has some tendency toward expressing dramatic views with excessive confidence.</p></blockquote><p>Garfinkel runs through a series of incorrect predictions Eliezer has made. He predicted that nanotech would kill us all by 2010. Now, this was up until about 1999, when he was only about 20. So it\u2019s not as probative as it would be if he made that prediction in 2005, for instance. But . . . still. If a guy has already incorrectly predicted that some technology would probably kill us soon, backed up by a rich array of arguments, and now he is predicting that some technology will kill us soon, backed up by a rich array of arguments, a reasonable inference is that, just like financial speculators who constantly predict recessions, this guy just has a bad habit of overpredicting doom.</p><p>I will not spend very much time talking about Eliezer\u2019s views about AI, because they\u2019re outside my area of expertise. But it\u2019s worth noting that lots of people who know a lot about AI seem to think that Eliezer is ridiculously overconfident about AI. Jacob Cannell writes, in a detailed post arguing against Eliezer\u2019s model:</p><blockquote><p>My skill points instead have gone near exclusively towards extensive study of neuroscience, deep learning, and graphics/GPU programming. More than most, I actually have the depth and breadth of technical knowledge necessary to evaluate these claims in detail.</p><p>I have evaluated this model in detail and found it substantially incorrect and in fact <i>brazenly naively overconfident</i>.</p><p>. . .</p><p>Every one of his key assumptions is mostly wrong, as I and others predicted well in advance.</p><p>. . .</p><p>EY is just completely <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xwBuoE9p8GE7RAuhd/brain-efficiency-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know\">out of his depth</a> here: he doesn't seem to understand how the Landauer limit actually works, doesn't seem to understand that synapses are analog MACs which minimally require OOMs more energy than simple binary switches, doesn't seem to have a good model of the interconnect requirements, etc.</p></blockquote><p>I am also completely out of my depth here. Not only do I not understand how the Landauer limit works, I don\u2019t even know what it is. But it\u2019s worth noting that a guy who seems to know what he\u2019s talking about thinks that many parts of Eliezer\u2019s model are systematically overconfident, based on relatively egregious error.</p><p>Eliezer made many, many more incorrect predictions\u2014let me just run through the list.</p><p>In 2001, and possibly later, Eliezer predicted that his team would build superintelligence probably between 2008-2010.</p><p>\u201cIn the first half of the 2000s, he produced a fair amount of technical and conceptual work related to this goal. It hasn't ultimately had much clear usefulness for AI development, and, partly on the basis, my impression is that it has not held up well - but that he was very confident in the value of this work at the time.\u201d</p><p>Eliezer predicted that AI would quickly go from 0 to 100\u2014that potentially over the course of a day, a single team would develop superintelligence. We don\u2019t yet definitively know that that\u2019s false but it almost certainly is.</p><p>There are other issues that are more debatable that Garfinkel highlights, that are probably instances of Eliezer\u2019s errors. For most of those though, I don\u2019t know enough to confidently evaluate them. But the worst part is that he has never acknowledged his mixed forecasting track record, and in fact, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZEgQGAjQm5rTAnGuM/beware-boasting-about-non-existent-forecasting-track-records\">frequently acts as though he has a very good forecasting track record</a>. This despite the fact that he often makes relatively nebulous predictions without giving credences, and then just gestures in the direction of having been mostly right about things when pressed about this. For example, he\u2019ll claim that he came out better than Robin Hanson in the AI risk debate they had. Claiming that you were more right than someone, when you had wildly diverging models on a range of topics, is not a precise forecast (and in Eliezer\u2019s case, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZEgQGAjQm5rTAnGuM/beware-boasting-about-non-existent-forecasting-track-records?commentId=TG6w2aszHz4m5kcir\">is quite debatable</a>). As Jotto999 notes:</p><blockquote><p><strong>In other domains, where we have more practice detecting punditry tactics</strong>, we would dismiss such an uninformative \"track record\".&nbsp; We're used to hearing Tetlock talk about ambiguity in political statements. &nbsp;We're used to hearing about a financial pundit like Jim Cramer<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568f03c8841abaff89043b9d/t/5734f6e2c2ea51b32cf53885/1463088868550/HartleyOlson2016+Jim+Cramer+Charitable+Trust+Performance+and+Factor+Attribution.pdf\">&nbsp;underperforming</a> the market.&nbsp; But the domain is novel in AI timelines.</p></blockquote><p>Even defenders of Eliezer agree that he\u2019s wildly overconfident. Brian Tomasik, for example, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-Eliezer-Yudkowsky\">says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Really smart guy. His writings are \u201can acquired taste\u201d as one of my friends put it, but I love his writing style, both for fiction and nonfiction. He\u2019s one of the clearest and most enjoyable writers I\u2019ve ever encountered.</p><p>My main high-level complaint is that Eliezer is overconfident about many of his beliefs and doesn\u2019t give enough credence to other smart people. But as long as you take him with some salt, it\u2019s fine.</p><p>Eliezer is in the top 10 list for people who have changed the way I see the universe.</p></blockquote><p>Scott Alexander in a <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/04/contra-hallquist-on-scientific-rationality/\">piece defending Eliezer</a> says:</p><blockquote><p>This is not to say that Eliezer \u2013 or anyone on Less Wrong \u2013 or anyone in the world \u2013 is never wrong or never overconfident. I happen to find Eliezer overconfident as heck a lot of the time.</p></blockquote><h1>The First Critical Error: Zombies</h1><p>The zombie argument is an argument for non-physicalism. It\u2019s hard to give a precise definition of non-physicalism, but the basic idea is that consciousness is non-physical in the sense that is it not reducible to the behavior of fundamental particles. Once you know the way atoms work, you can predict all the facts about chairs, tables, iron, sofas, and plants. Non-physicalists claim that consciousness is non-physical in the sense that it\u2019s not explainable in that traditional way. The consciousness facts are fundamental\u2014just as there are fundamental laws about the ways that particles behave, so too are there fundamental laws that govern that subjective experience arises in response to certain physical arrangements.</p><p>Let\u2019s illustrate what a physicalist model of reality would work. Note, this is going to be a very simplistic and deeply implausible physicalist model; the idea is just to communicate the basic concept. Suppose that there are a bunch of blocks that move right every second. Assume these blocks are constantly conscious and consciously think \u201cwe want to move right.\u201d A physicalist about this reality would think that to fully specify its goings-on, one would have to say the following:</p><p><code>Every second, every block moves right.</code></p><p>A non-physicalist in contrast might think one of the following two sets of rules specifies reality (the bolded thing is the name of the view):</p><p><strong>Epiphenomenalism</strong></p><p><code>Every second, every block moves right</code></p><p><code>Every second, every block thinks \u201cI\u2019d like to move right.\u201d</code></p><p><strong>Interactionism</strong></p><p><code>Every second, every block thinks \u201cI\u2019d like to move right.\u201d</code></p><p><code>Every time a block thinks \u201cI\u2019d like to move right,\u201d it moves right.</code></p><p>The physical facts are facts about the way that matter behaves. Physicalists think once you\u2019ve specified the way that matter behaves, that is sufficient to explain consciousness. Consciousness, just like tables and chairs, can be fully explained in terms of the behavior of physical things.</p><p>Non-physicalists think that the physicalists are wrong about this. Consciousness is its own separate thing that is not explainable just in terms of the way matter behaves. There are more niche views like idealism and panpsychism that we don\u2019t need to go into, which say that consciousness is either fundamental to all particles or the only thing that exists, so let\u2019s ignore them. The main view about consciousness is called dualism, according to which consciousness is non-physical and there are some psychophysical laws, that result in consciousness when there are particular physical arrangements.</p><p>There are broadly two kinds of dualism: epiphenomenalism and interactionism. Interactionism says that consciousness is causally efficacious, so the psychophysical laws describe that particular physical arrangements give rise to particular mental arrangements and also that those mental states cause other physical things. This can be seen in the block case\u2014the psychophysical laws mean that the blocks give rise to particular conscious states that cause some physical things. Epiphenomenalism says the opposite\u2014consciousness causes nothing. It\u2019s an acausal epiphenomenon\u2014the psychophysical laws go only one way. When there is a certain physical state, consciousness arises, but consciousness doesn\u2019t cause anything further.</p><p>The zombie argument is an argument for non-physicalism about consciousness. It doesn\u2019t argue for either an epiphenomenalist or interactionist account. Instead, it just argues against physicalism. The basic idea is as follows: imagine any physical arrangement that contains consciousness, for example, the actual world. Surely, we could imagine a world that is physically identical\u2014where all the atoms, quarks, gluons, and such, move the same way\u2014that doesn\u2019t have consciousness. You could imagine an alternative version of me that is the same down to the atom.</p><p>Why think such beings are possible? They sure seem possible. I can quite vividly imagine a version of me that continues through its daily goings-on but that lacks consciousness. It\u2019s very plausible that if something is impossible, there should be some reason that it is impossible\u2014there <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/a-limited-psr-as-applied-to-modality\">shouldn\u2019t just be brute impossibilities</a>. The reason that married bachelors are impossible is that they require a contradiction\u2014you can\u2019t be both married and unmarried at the same time. But spelling out a contradiction in the zombie scenario has proved elusive.</p><p>I find the zombie argument quite convincing. But there are many smart people who disagree with it who are not off their rocker. Eliezer, however, has views on the zombie argument that demonstrate a basic misunderstanding of it\u2014the type that would be cleared up in an elementary philosophy of mind class. In fact, Eliezer\u2019s position on zombies is utterly bizarre; when describing the motivation for zombies, he writes what amounts to amusing fiction, trying to describe the motivation for zombies, but demonstrating that he has <i>no idea what motivates belief in zombies</i>. It would be like a Christian writer writing a thousand words eloquently steelmanning the problem of evil, but summarizing it as \u201catheists are angry at god because he creates things that they don\u2019t like.\u201d</p><h2>What Eliezer thinks the zombie argument is (and what it is not)</h2><p>Eliezer <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fdEWWr8St59bXLbQr/zombies-zombies\">seems to think</a> the zombie argument is roughly the following:</p><p>It seems like if you got rid of the world\u2019s consciousness nothing would change because consciousness doesn\u2019t do anything.</p><p>Therefore, consciousness doesn\u2019t do anything.</p><p>Therefore it\u2019s non-physical.</p><p>Eliezer then goes on an extended attack against premise 1. He argues that if it were true that consciousness does something, then you can\u2019t just drain consciousness from the world and not change anything. So the argument for zombies hinges crucially on the assumption that consciousness doesn\u2019t do anything. But he goes on to argue that consciousness does do something. If it didn\u2019t do anything, what are the odds that when we talked about consciousness, our descriptions would match up with our conscious states? This would be a monumental coincidence, like it being the case that there are space aliens who work exactly the way you describe them to work, but your talk is causally unrelated to them\u2014you\u2019re just guessing and they happen to be exactly what you guess. It would be like saying \u201cI believe there is a bridge in San Francisco with such and such dimensions, but the bridge existing has nothing to do with my talk about the bridge.\u201d Eliezer says:</p><blockquote><p>Your \"zombie\", in the philosophical usage of the term, is putatively a being that is exactly like you in <i>every</i> respect\u2014identical behavior, identical speech, identical brain; every atom and quark in <i>exactly</i> the same position, moving according to the same causal laws of motion\u2014<i>except</i> that your zombie is not conscious.</p><p>It is furthermore claimed that if zombies are \"possible\" (a term over which battles are still being fought), then, purely from our knowledge of this \"possibility\", we can deduce a priori that consciousness is extra-physical, in a sense to be described below; the standard term for this position is \"epiphenomenalism\".</p><p>(For those unfamiliar with zombies, I emphasize that <i>this is not a strawman.</i>&nbsp; See, for example, <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/\">the SEP entry on Zombies</a>.&nbsp; The \"possibility\" of zombies is accepted by a substantial fraction, possibly a majority, of academic philosophers of consciousness.)</p></blockquote><p>Eliezer goes out of his way to emphasize that this is not a strawman. Unfortunately, it is a strawman. Not only that, Eliezer\u2019s own source that he links to to describe how unstrawmanny it is shows that it is a strawman. Eliezer claims that the believers in zombies think consciousness is causally inefficacious and are called epiphenomenalists. But the SEP page he links to says:</p><blockquote><p>True, the friends of zombies do not seem compelled to be epiphenomenalists or parallelists about the <i>actual</i> world. They may be interactionists, holding that our world is not physically closed, and that as a matter of actual fact nonphysical properties do have physical effects.</p></blockquote><p>In fact, David Chalmers, perhaps the world\u2019s leading philosopher of mind, says the same thing when leaving a comment below Eliezer\u2019s post:</p><blockquote><p>Someone e-mailed me a pointer to these discussions. I'm in the middle of four weeks on the road at conferences, so just a quick comment. It seems to me that although you present your arguments as arguments against the thesis (Z) that zombies are logically possible, they're really arguments against the thesis (E) that consciousness plays no causal role. Of course thesis E, epiphenomenalism, is a much easier target. This would be a legitimate strategy if thesis Z entails thesis E, as you appear to assume, but this is incorrect. I endorse Z, but I don't endorse E: see my discussion in <a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/nature.pdf\">\"Consciousness and its Place in Nature\"</a>, especially the discussion of interactionism (type-D dualism) and Russellian monism (type-F monism). I think that the correct conclusion of zombie-style arguments is the disjunction of the type-D, type-E, and type-F views, and I certainly don't favor the type-E view (epiphenomenalism) over the others. Unlike you, I don't think there are any watertight arguments against it, but if you're right that there are, then that just means that the conclusion of the argument should be narrowed to the other two views. Of course there's a lot more to be said about these issues, and the project of finding good arguments against Z is a worthwhile one, but I think that such an argument requires more than you've given us here.</p></blockquote><p>The zombie argument is an argument for any kind of non-physicalism. Eliezer\u2019s response is to argue that one particular kind of non-physicalism is false. That\u2019s not an adequate response, or a response at all. If I argue \u201cargument P means we have to accept views D, E, F, or I, and the response is \u2018but view E has some problems\u2019 that just means we should adopt views D, F, or I.\u201d</p><p>But okay, what\u2019s the error here? How does Eliezer\u2019s version of the zombie argument differ from the real version? The crucial error is in his construction of premise 1. Eliezer assumes that, when talking about zombies, we are imagining just subtracting consciousness. He points out (rightly) that if consciousness is causally efficacious then if you only subtract consciousness, you wouldn\u2019t have a physically identical world.</p><p>But the zombie argument isn\u2019t about what would actually happen in our world if you just eliminated the consciousness. It\u2019s about a physically identical world to ours lacking consciousness. Imagine you think that consciousness causes atoms 1, 2, and 3 to each move. Well then the zombie world would also involve them moving in the same physical way as they do when consciousness moves them. So it eliminates the experience, but it keeps a world that is physically identical.</p><p>This might sound pretty abstract. Let\u2019s make it clearer. Imagine there\u2019s a spirit called Casper. Casper does not have a physical body, does not emit light, and is physically undetectable. However, Casper does have conscious experience and has the ability to affect the world. Every thousand years, Casper can think \u201cI really wish this planet would disappear,\u201d and the planet would disappear. Crucially, we could imagine a world physically identical to the world with Casper, that just lacks Casper. This wouldn\u2019t be what you would get if you just eliminated Casper\u2014you\u2019d also need to do something else to copy the physical effects that Casper has. So when writing the laws of nature for the world that copies Casper\u2019s world, you\u2019d also need to specify:</p><p><code>Oh, and also make one planet disappear every few months, specifically, the same ones Casper would have made disappear.</code></p><p>So the idea is that even if consciousness causes things, we could still imagine a physically identical world to the world where consciousness causes the things. Instead, the things would be caused the same physical way as they are with consciousness, but there would be no consciousness.</p><p>Thus, Eliezer\u2019s argument fails completely. It is an argument against epiphenomenalism rather than an argument against zombieism. Eliezer thinks those are the same thing, but that is an error that no publishing academic philosopher could make. It\u2019s really a basic error.</p><p>And when this is pointed out, Eliezer begins to squirm. For example, when responding to Chalmers\u2019 comment, he says:</p><blockquote><p>It seems to me that there is a direct, two-way logical entailment between \"consciousness is epiphenomenal\" and \"zombies are logically possible\".</p><p>If and only if consciousness is an effect that does not cause further third-party detectable effects, it is possible to describe a \"zombie world\" that is <i>closed under the causes</i> of third-party detectable effects, but lacks consciousness.</p><p>Type-D dualism, or interactionism, or what I've called \"substance dualism\", makes it impossible - by definition, though I hate to say it - that a zombie world can contain all the causes of a neuron's firing, but not contain consciousness.</p><p>You could, I suppose, separate causes into (arbitrary-seeming) classes of \"physical causes\" and \"extraphysical causes\", but then a world-description that contains only \"physical causes\" is incompletely specified, which generally is not what people mean by \"ideally conceivable\"; i.e., the zombies would be writing papers on consciousness for literally no reason, which sounds more like an incomplete imagination than a coherent state of affairs. If you want to give an experimental account of the observed motion of atoms, on Type-D dualism, you must account for all causes whether labeled \"physical\" or \"extraphysical\".</p><p>. . .</p><p>I understand that you have argued that epiphenomenalism is not equivalent to zombieism, enabling them to be argued separately; but I think this fails. Consciousness can be subtracted from the world without changing anything third-party-observable, if and only if consciousness doesn't cause any third-party-observable differences. Even if philosophers argue these ideas separately, that does not make them ideally separable; it represents (on my view) a failure to see logical implications.</p></blockquote><p>Think back to the Casper example. Some physical effects in that universe are caused by physical things. Other effects in the universe are caused by nonphysical things (just one thing actually, Casper). This is not an arbitrary classification\u2014if you believe that some things are physical and others are non-physical, then the division isn\u2019t arbitrary. On type-D dualism, the consciousness causes things, and so the mirror world would just fill in the causal effects. A world description that contains only physical causes would be completely specified\u2014it specifies all the behavior of the world, all the physical things, and just fails to specify the consciousness.</p><p>This is also just such cope! Eliezer spends an entire article saying, without argument, that zombieism = epiphenomenalism, assuming most people will believe him, and then when pressed on it, gives a barely coherent paragraph worth of justification for this false claim. It would be like it I argued against deontology by saying it was necessarily Kantian and arguing Kant was wrong, and then when called out on that by a leading non-Kantian deontologist, concocted some half-hearted justification for why they\u2019re actually equivalent. That\u2019s not being rational.</p><p>Even if we pretend, per impossible, that Eliezer\u2019s extra paragraph refutes interactionist zombieism, it is not responsible to go through an entire article claiming that the only view that believes X is view Y, when that\u2019s totally false, and then just later mention when pressed that there\u2019s an argument for why believers in views other than X can\u2019t believe Y.</p><h2>In which Eliezer, after getting the basic philosophy of mind wrong, calls others stupid for believing in zombies</h2><p>I think that the last section conclusively establishes that, at the very least, Eliezer\u2019s views on the zombie argument both fail and evince a fundamental misunderstanding of the argument. But the most infuriating thing about this is Eliezer\u2019s repeated insistence that disagreeing with him about zombies is indicative of fundamental stupidity. When explaining why he ignores philosophers because they don\u2019t come to the right conclusions quickly enough, he says:</p><blockquote><p>And if the debate about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/p7/zombies_zombies/\">zombies</a> is still considered open, then I'm sorry, but as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/qt/class_project/\">Jeffreyssai says</a>:&nbsp; <i>Too slow!</i>&nbsp; It would be one matter if I could just look up the standard answer and find that, lo and behold, it is correct.&nbsp; But philosophy, which hasn't come to conclusions and moved on from cognitive reductions that I regard as relatively simple, doesn't seem very likely to build complex correct structures of <i>conclusions.</i></p><p>Sorry - but philosophy, even the better grade of modern analytic philosophy, doesn't seem to end up commensurate with what I need, except by accident or by extraordinary competence.&nbsp; Parfit comes to mind; and I haven't read much Dennett, but Dennett does seem to be <i>trying to do</i> the same sort of thing that I try to do; and of course there's Gary Drescher.&nbsp; If there was a repository of philosophical work <i>along those lines</i> - not concerned with <i>defending</i> basic ideas like anti-zombieism, but with <i>accepting</i> those basic ideas and moving on to challenge more difficult quests of naturalism and cognitive reductionism - then that, I might well be interested in reading.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>(Eliezer wouldn\u2019t like Parfit if he read more of him and realized he was a zombie-believing, non-physicalist, non-naturalist moral realist.)</p><p>There\u2019s something infuriating about this. Making basic errors that show you don\u2019t have the faintest grasp on what people are arguing about, and then acting like the people who take the time to get Ph.Ds and don\u2019t end up agreeing with your half-baked arguments are just too stupid to be worth listening to is outrageous. And Eliezer repeatedly admonishes the alleged cognitive deficiency of us zombieists\u2014<a href=\"https://rationalconspiracy.com/2015/12/16/a-debate-on-animal-consciousness/\">for example:</a></p><blockquote><p>I also want to emphasize that the \u201cwhy so confident?\u201d is a straw misquestion from people who can\u2019t otherwise understand why I could be unconfident of many details yet still not take into account the conflicting opinion of people who eg endorse <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie\"><strong>P-zombies</strong></a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It also seems to me that this is not all that inaccessible to a reasonable third party, though the sort of person who maintains some doubt about physicalism, or the sort of philosophers who think it\u2019s still respectable academic debate rather than sheer foolishness to argue about the A-Theory vs. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time\"><strong>B-Theory of time</strong></a>, or the sort of person who can\u2019t follow the argument for why all our remaining uncertainty should be within different many-worlds interpretations rather than slopping over outside, will not be able to access it.</p></blockquote><p>We zombieists are apparently not reasonable third parties, because we can\u2019t grasp Eliezer\u2019s demonstrably fallacious reply to zombies. Being this confident and wrong is a significant mark against one\u2019s reasoning abilities. If you believe something for terrible reasons, don\u2019t update in response to criticisms over the course of decades, and then act like others who don\u2019t agree with you are too stupid to get it, and in fact use that as one of your go-to examples of \u201cthings people stupider than I believe that I shouldn\u2019t update on,\u201d that seriously damages your credibility as a thinker. That evinces dramatic overconfidence, sloppiness, and arrogance.</p><h1>The Second Critical Error: Decision Theory</h1><p>Eliezer Yudkowsky has a decision theory called functional decision-theory. I will preface this by noting that I know much less about decision theory than I do about non-physicalism and zombies. Nevertheless, I know enough to get why Eliezer\u2019s decision theory fails. In addition, most of this involves quoting people who are much more informed about decision theory than I am.</p><p>There are two dominant decision theories, both of which Eliezer rejects. The first is called causal decision theory. It says that when you have multiple actions that you can take, you should take the action that causes the best things. So, for example, if you have two actions, one of which would cause you to get 10 dollars, the other of which would cause you to get five dollars, and the final of which would cause you to get nothing, you should take the first action because it causes you to be richest at the end.</p><p>The next popular decision theory is called evidential decision theory. It says you should take the action where after you take that action you\u2019ll expect to have the highest payouts. So in the earlier case, it would also suggest taking the first action because after you take that action, you\u2019ll expect to be five dollars richer than if you take the second action, and ten dollars richer than if you take the third action.</p><p>These sound similar, so you might wonder where they come apart. Let me preface this by saying that I lean towards causal decision theory. Here are some cases where they give diverging suggestions:</p><p>Newcombe\u2019s problem: there is a very good predictor who guessed whether you\u2019d take two boxes or one box. If you take only one box, you\u2019d take box A. If the guesser predicted that you\u2019d take box A, they put a million dollars in box A. If they predicted you\u2019d take both boxes, they put nothing into box A. In either case, they put a thousand dollars into box B.</p><p>Evidential decision theory would say that you should take only one box. Why? Those who take one box almost always get a million dollars, while those who take two boxes almost always get a thousand dollars. Causal decision theory would say you should take two boxes. On causal decision theory, it doesn\u2019t matter whether people who make decisions like you usually end up worse off\u2014what maters is that, no matter whether there is a million dollars in box A, two-boxing will cause you to have a free thousand dollars, and that is good! The causal decision theorist would note that if you had a benevolent friend who could peek into the boxes and then give you advice about what to do, they\u2019d be guaranteed to suggest that you take both boxes. I used to have the intuition that you should one box, but when I considered this upcoming case, I abandoned that intuition.</p><p>Smoker\u2019s lesion: suppose that smoking doesn\u2019t actually cause averse health outcomes. However, smokers do have much higher rates of cancer than non-smokers. The reason for that is that many people have a lesion on their lung that both causes them to be much more likely to smoke and more likely to get cancer. So if you know that someone smokes, you should think it much more likely that they\u2019ll get cancer even though smoking doesn\u2019t cause cancer. Suppose that smoking is fun and doesn\u2019t cause any harm. Evidential decision theory would say that you shouldn\u2019t smoke because smoking gives you evidence that you\u2019ll have a shorter life. You should, after smoking, expect your life to be shorter because it gives you evidence that you had a lesion on your lung. In contrast, causal decision theory would instruct you to smoke because it benefits you and doesn\u2019t cause any harm.</p><p>Eliezer\u2019s preferred view is called functional decision theory. Here\u2019s my summary (phrased in a maximally Eliezer like way):</p><blockquote><p>Your brain is a cognitive algorithm that outputs decisions in response to external data. Thus, when you take an action like</p><p><code>take one box</code></p><p>that entails that your mental algorithm outputs</p><p><code>take one box</code></p><p>in Newcombe\u2019s problem. You should take actions such that the algorithm that outputs that decision generates higher expected utility than any other cognitive algorithm.</p></blockquote><p>On Eliezer\u2019s view, you should one box, but it\u2019s fine to smoke because whether your brain outputs \u201csmoke\u201d doesn\u2019t affect whether there is a lesion on your lung, so smoking. Or, as the impressively named Wolfgang Schwarz summarizes:</p><blockquote><p>In FDT, the agent should not consider what would happen if she were to choose A or B. Instead, she ought to consider what would happen if <i>the right choice according to FDT were A or B</i>.</p></blockquote><p>You should one box in this case because if FDT told agents to one box, they would get more utility on average than if FDT told agents to two box. Schwarz argues the first problem with the view is that it gives various <i>totally insane recommendations</i>. One example is a blackmail case. Suppose that a blackmailer will, every year, blackmail one person. There\u2019s a 1 in a googol chance that he\u2019ll blackmail someone who wouldn\u2019t give in to the blackmail and a googol-1/googol chance that he\u2019ll blackmail someone who would give in to the blackmail. He has blackmailed you. He threatens that if you don\u2019t give him a dollar, he will share all of your most embarrassing secrets to everyone in the world. Should you give in?</p><p>FDT would say no. After all, agents who won\u2019t give in are almost guaranteed to never be blackmailed. But this is totally crazy. You should give up one dollar to prevent all of your worst secrets from being spread to the world. As Schwarz says:</p><blockquote><p>FDT says you should not pay because, if you were the kind of person who doesn't pay, you likely wouldn't have been blackmailed. How is that even relevant? You <i>are</i> being blackmailed. Not being blackmailed isn't on the table. It's not something you can choose.</p></blockquote><p>Schwarz has another even more convincing counterexample:</p><blockquote><p>Moreover, FDT does not in fact consider only consequences of the agent's own dispositions. The supposition that is used to evaluate acts is that FDT <i>in general</i> recommends that act, not just that the agent herself is disposed to choose the act. This leads to even stranger results.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Procreation.</strong> I wonder whether to procreate. I know for sure that doing so would make my life miserable. But I also have reason to believe that my father faced the exact same choice, and that he followed FDT. If FDT were to recommend not procreating, there's a significant probability that I wouldn't exist. I highly value existing (even miserably existing). So it would be better if FDT were to recommend procreating. So FDT says I should procreate. (Note that this (incrementally) confirms the hypothesis that my father used FDT in the same choice situation, for I know that he reached the decision to procreate.)</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Schwarz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.umsu.de/wo/2018/688\">entire piece</a> is very worth reading. It exposes various parts of Soares and Yudkowsky\u2019s paper that rest on demonstrable errors. Another good piece that takes down FDT is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ySLYSsNeFL5CoAQzN/a-critique-of-functional-decision-theory\">MacAskill\u2019s post</a> on LessWrong. He starts by laying out the following plausible principle:</p><blockquote><p><i>Guaranteed Payoffs</i>: In conditions of certainty \u2014 that is, when the decision-maker has no uncertainty about what state of nature she is in, and no uncertainty about the utility payoff of each action is \u2014 the decision-maker should choose the action that maximises utility.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is intuitively very obvious. If you know all the relevant facts about how the world is, and one act gives you more rewards than another act, you should take the first action. But MacAskill shows that FDT violates that constraint <i>over and over again</i>.</p><blockquote><p><i>Bomb</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>You face two open boxes, Left and Right, and you must take one of them. In the Left box, there is a live bomb; taking this box will set off the bomb, setting you ablaze, and you certainly will burn slowly to death. The Right box is empty, but you have to pay $100 in order to be able to take it.&nbsp;</p><p>A long-dead predictor predicted whether you would choose Left or Right, by running a simulation of you and seeing what that simulation did. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Right, then she put a bomb in Left. If the predictor predicted that you would choose Left, then she did not put a bomb in Left, and the box is empty.&nbsp;</p><p>The predictor has a failure rate of only 1 in a trillion trillion. Helpfully, she left a note, explaining that she predicted that you would take Right, and therefore she put the bomb in Left.&nbsp;</p><p>You are the only person left in the universe. You have a happy life, but you know that you will never meet another agent again, nor face another situation where any of your actions will have been predicted by another agent. What box should you choose?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The right action, according to FDT, is to take Left, in the full knowledge that as a result you will slowly burn to death. Why? Because, using Y&amp;S\u2019s counterfactuals, <i>if</i> your algorithm were to output \u2018Left\u2019, then it would also have outputted \u2018Left\u2019 when the predictor made the simulation of you, and there would be no bomb in the box, and you could save yourself $100 by taking Left. In contrast, the right action on CDT or EDT is to take Right.</p><p>The recommendation is implausible enough. But if we stipulate that in this decision-situation the decision-maker is certain in the outcome that her actions would bring about, we see that FDT violates <i>Guaranteed Payoffs</i>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>You can read MacAskill\u2019s full post to find even more objections. He shows that Yudkowsky\u2019s view is wildly indeterminate, incapable of telling you what to do, and also involves a broad kind of hypersensitivity, where however one defines \u201crunning the same algorithm\u201d becomes hugely relevant, and determines very significant choices in seemingly arbitrary ways. The basic point is that Yudkowsky\u2019s decision theory is totally bankrupt and implausible, in ways that are evident to those who know about decision theory. It is much worse than either evidential or causal decision theory.</p><h1>The Third Critical Error: Animal Consciousness</h1><p>(This was already covered <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/against-yudkowskys-implausible-position\">here</a>\u2014if you\u2019ve read that article skip this section and control F conclusion.)</p><p>Perhaps the most extreme example of an egregious error backed up by wild overconfidence occured in this <a href=\"https://rationalconspiracy.com/2015/12/16/a-debate-on-animal-consciousness/\">Facebook debate about animal consciousness</a>. Eliezer expressed his view that pigs and almost all animals are almost certainly not conscious. Why is this? Well, as he says:</p><blockquote><p>However, my theory of mind also says that the naive theory of mind is very wrong, and suggests that a pig does <i>not</i> have a more-simplified form of tangible experiences. My model says that certain types of reflectivity are critical to being something it is like something to be. The model of a pig as having pain that is like yours, but simpler, is wrong. The pig does have cognitive algorithms similar to the ones that impinge upon your own self-awareness as emotions, but without the reflective self-awareness that creates someone to listen to it.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, so on this view, one needs to have reflective processes in order to be conscious. One\u2019s brain has to model itself to be conscious. This doesn\u2019t sound plausible to me, but perhaps if there\u2019s overwhelming neuroscientific evidence, it\u2019s worth accepting the view. And this view implies that pigs aren\u2019t conscious, so Yudkowsky infers that they are not conscious.</p><p>This seems to me to be the wrong approach. It\u2019s actually incredibly difficult to adjudicate between the different theories of consciousness. It makes sense to gather evidence for and against the consciousness of particular creatures, rather than starting with a general theory and using that to solve the problems. If your model says that pigs aren\u2019t conscious, then that seems to be a problem with your model.</p><h2>Mammals feel pain</h2><p>I won\u2019t go too in-depth here, but let\u2019s just briefly review the evidence that mammals, at the very least, feel pain. This evidence is sufficiently strong that, as the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/#Mamm\">SEP page on animal consciousness</a> notes, \u201cthe position that all mammals are conscious is widely agreed upon among scientists who express views on the distribution of consciousness.\" The SEP page references two papers, one by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810004001187?casa_token=1JYFbRD21WMAAAAA:qG-lYtVJ9OsKepMHwO3hzXh_2WWv3tFUC3hiWU2o-aeVV5d_P8uwkKWTRDAcAj-vrKla_T7m#aep-section-id12\">Jaak Panksepp</a> (awesome name!) and the other by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810004000893?casa_token=B3K3KvAUWb8AAAAA:-xmnYJuqoi_dlGijNwS9xdmnpq9jv1JtsBgGq7FOOXgEemDJdavp5naJVSntJwzIYjpyX_8V\">Seth, Baars, and Edelman</a>.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with the Panksepp paper. They lay out the basic methodology, which involves looking at the parts of the brain that are necessary and sufficient for consciousness. So they see particular brain regions which are active during states when we\u2019re conscious\u2014and particularly correlate with particular mental states\u2014and aren\u2019t active when we\u2019re not conscious. They then look at the brains of other mammals and notice that these features are ubiquitous in mammals, such that all mammals have the things that we know make us conscious in our brains. In addition, they act physically like we do when we\u2019re in pain\u2014they scream, they cry, their heart rate increases when they have a stressful stimulus, they make cost-benefit analyses where they\u2019re willing to risk negative stimuli for greater reward. Sure looks like they\u2019re conscious.</p><p>Specifically, they endorse a \u201cpsycho-neuro-ethological \u2018\u2018triangulation\u2019\u2019 approach. The paper is filled with big phrases like that. What that means is that they look at various things that happen in the brain when we feel certain emotions. They observe that in humans, those emotions cause certain things\u2014for example, being happy makes us more playful. They then look at mammal brains and see that they have the same basic brain structure, and this produces the same physical reactions\u2014using the happiness example, this would also make the animals more playful. If they see that animals have the same basic neural structures as we do when we have certain experiences and that those are associated with the same physical states that occur when humans have those conscious states, they infer that the animals are having similar conscious states. If our brain looks like a duck\u2019s brain when we have some experience, and we act like ducks do when they are in a comparable brain state, we should guess that ducks are having a similar experience. (I know we\u2019re talking about mammals here, but I couldn\u2019t resist the \u201clooks like a duck, talks like a duck joke.\u201d)</p><p>If a pig has a brain state that resembles ours when we are happy, tries to get things that make it happy, and produces the same neurological responses that we do when we\u2019re happy, we should infer that pigs are not mindless automatons, but are, in fact, happy.</p><p>They then note that animals like drugs. Animals, like us, get addicted to opioids and have similar brain responses when they\u2019re on opioids. As the authors note \u201cIndeed, one can predict drugs that will be addictive in humans quite effectively from animal studies of desire.\u201d If animals like the drugs that make us happy and react in similar ways to us, that gives us good reason to think that they are, in fact, happy.</p><p>They then note that the parts of the brain responsible for various human emotions are quite ancient\u2014predating humans\u2014and that mammals have them too. So, if the things that cause emotions are also present in animals, we should guess they\u2019re conscious, especially when their behavior is perfectly consistent with being conscious. In fact, by running electricity through certain brain regions that animals share, we can induce conscious states in people\u2014that shows that it is those brain states that are causing the various mental states.</p><p>The authors then run through various other mental states and show that those mental states are similar between humans and animals\u2014animals have similar brain regions which provoke similar physical responses, and we know that in humans, those brain regions cause specific mental states.</p><p>Now, maybe there\u2019s some magic of the human brain, such that in animal brains, the brain regions that cause qualia instead cause causally identical stuff but no consciousness. But there\u2019s no good evidence for that, and plenty against. You should not posit special features of certain physical systems, for no reason.</p><p>Moving on to the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810004000893?casa_token=B3K3KvAUWb8AAAAA:-xmnYJuqoi_dlGijNwS9xdmnpq9jv1JtsBgGq7FOOXgEemDJdavp5naJVSntJwzIYjpyX_8V\">Seth, Baars, and Edelman</a> paper, they note that there are various features of consciousness, that differentiate conscious states from other things happening in the brain that don\u2019t induce conscious states. They note:</p><blockquote><p>Consciousness involves widespread, relatively fast, low-amplitude interactions in the thalamocortical core of the brain, driven by current tasks and conditions. Unconscious states are markedly different and much less responsive to sensory input or motor plans.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, there are common patterns among conscious states. We can look at a human brain and see that the things that are associated with consciousness produce different neurological markers from the things that aren\u2019t associated with consciousness. Features associated with consciousness include:</p><p>Irregular, low-amplitude brain activity: When we\u2019re awake we have irregular low-amplitude brain activity. When we\u2019re not conscious\u2014e.g. in deep comas or anesthesia-induced unconsciousness\u2014irregular, low-amplitude brain activity isn\u2019t present. Mammal brains possess irregular, low-amplitude brain activity.</p><p>Involvement of the thalamocortical system: When you damage the thalamocortical system, that deletes part of one\u2019s consciousness, unlike other systems. Mammals also have a thalamocortical system\u2014just like us.</p><p>Widespread brain activity: Consciousness induces widespread brain activity. We don\u2019t have that when things induce us not to be conscious, like being in a coma. Mammals do.</p><p>The authors note, from these three facts:</p><blockquote><p>Together, these first three properties indicate that consciousness involves widespread, relatively fast, low-amplitude interactions in the thalamocortical core of the brain, driven by current tasks and conditions. Unconscious states are markedly different and much less responsive to sensory input or endogenous activity. These properties are directly testable and constitute necessary criteria for consciousness in humans. It is striking that these basic features are conserved among mammals, at least for sensory processes. The developed thalamocortical system that underlies human consciousness first arose with early mammals or mammal-like reptiles, more than 100 million years ago.</p></blockquote><p>More evidence from neuroscience for animal consciousness:</p><p>Something else about metastability that I don\u2019t really understand is also present in humans and animals.</p><p>Consciousness involves binding\u2014bringing lots of different inputs together. In your consciousness, you can see the entire world at once, while thinking about things at the same time. Lots of different types of information are processed simultaneously, in the same way. Some explanations involving neural synchronicity have received some empirical support\u2014and animals also have neural synchronicity, so they would also have the same kind of binding.</p><p>We attribute conscious experiences as happening to us. But mammals have a similar sense of self. Mammals, like us, process information relative to themselves\u2014so they see a wall and process it relative to them in space.</p><p>Consciousness facilitates learning. Humans learn from conscious experiences. In contrast, we do not learn from things that do not impinge on our consciousness. If someone slaps me whenever I scratch my nose (someone does actually\u2014crazy story), I learn not to scratch my nose. In contrast, if someone does a thing that I don\u2019t consciously perceive when I scratch my nose, I won\u2019t learn from it. But animals seem to learn to, and update in response to stimulus, just like humans do\u2014but only when humans are exposed to things that affect their consciousness. In fact, <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/underwater-torture-chambers\">even fish learn</a>.</p><p>So there\u2019s a veritable wealth of evidence that at least mammals are conscious. The evidence is less strong for organisms that are less intelligent and more distant from us evolutionarily, but it remains relatively strong for at least many fish. Overturning this abundance of evidence, that\u2019s been enough to convince the substantial majority of consciousness researchers requires a lot of evidence. Does Yudkowsky have it?</p><h2>Yudkowsky\u2019s view is crazy, and is decisively refuted over and over again</h2><p>No. No he does not. In fact, as far as I can tell, throughout the entire protracted Facebook exchange, he never adduced a single piece of evidence for his conclusion. The closest that he provides to an argument is the following:</p><blockquote><p>I consider myself a specialist on reflectivity and on the dissolution of certain types of confusion. I have no compunction about disagreeing with other alleged specialists on authority; any reasonable disagreement on the details will be evaluated as an object-level argument. From my perspective, I\u2019m not seeing any, \u201cNo, <i>this</i> is a non-mysterious theory of qualia that says pigs are sentient\u2026\u201d and a lot of \u201cHow do <i>you</i> know it doesn\u2019t\u2026?\u201d to which the only answer I can give is, \u201cI may not be certain, but I\u2019m not going to update my remaining ignorance on your claim to be even more ignorant, because you haven\u2019t yet named a new possibility I haven\u2019t considered, nor pointed out what I consider to be a new problem with the best interim theory, so you\u2019re not giving me a new reason to further spread probability density.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>What??? The suggestion seems to be that there is no other good theory of consciousness that implies that animals are conscious. To which I\u2019d reply:</p><p>We don\u2019t have any good theory about consciousness yet\u2014the data is just too underdetermined. Just as you can know that apples fall when you drop them before you have a comprehensive theory of gravity, so too can you know some things about consciousness, even absent a comprehensive theory.</p><p>There are various theories that predict that animals are conscious. For example, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.44\">integrated information theory</a>, <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/archive/MCFTCF-3v1\">McFadden\u2019s CEMI field theory</a>, various Higher-Order theories, and the global workspace model will probably imply that animals are conscious. Eliezer has no argument to prefer his view to others.</p><p>Take the integrated information theory, for example. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great view. But at least it has something going for it. It has made a series of accurate predictions about the neural correlates of consciousness. Same with McFadden\u2019s theory. It seems Yudkowsky\u2019s theory has literally nothing going for it, beyond it sounding to Eliezer like a good solution. There is no empirical evidence for it, and, as we\u2019ll see, it produces crazy, implausible implications. David Pearce has a nice comment about some of those implications:</p><blockquote><p>Some errors are potentially ethically catastrophic. This is one of them. Many of our most intensely conscious experiences occur when meta-cognition or reflective self-awareness fails. Thus in orgasm, for instance, much of the neocortex effectively shuts down. Or compare a mounting sense of panic. As an intense feeling of panic becomes uncontrollable, are we to theorise that the experience somehow ceases to be unpleasant as the capacity for reflective self-awareness is lost? \u201cBlind\u201d panic induced by e.g. a sense of suffocation, or fleeing a fire in a crowded cinema (etc), is one of the most unpleasant experiences anyone can undergo, regardless or race or species. Also, compare microelectrode neural studies of awake subjects probing different brain regions; stimulating various regions of the \u201cprimitive\u201d limbic system elicits the most intense experiences. And compare dreams \u2013 not least, nightmares \u2013 many of which are emotionally intense and characterised precisely by the lack of reflectivity or critical meta-cognitive capacity that we enjoy in waking life.</p></blockquote><p>Yudkowsky\u2019s theory of consciousness would predict that during especially intense experiences, where we\u2019re not reflecting, we\u2019re either not conscious or less conscious. So when people orgasm, they\u2019re not conscious. That\u2019s very implausible. Or, when a person is in unbelievable panic, on this view, they become non-conscious or less conscious. Pearce further notes:</p><blockquote><p>Children with autism have profound deficits of self-modelling as well as social cognition compared to neurotypical folk. So are profoundly autistic humans less intensely conscious than hyper-social people? In extreme cases, do the severely autistic lack consciousness\u2019 altogether, as Eliezer\u2019s conjecture would suggest? Perhaps compare the accumulating evidence for Henry Markram\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518049/\"><strong>Intense World</strong></a>\u201d theory of autism.</p></blockquote><p>Francisco Boni Neto furthers:</p><blockquote><p>many of our most intensely conscious experiences occur when meta-cognition or reflective self-awareness fails. Super vivid, hyper conscious experiences, phenomenic rich and deep experiences like lucid dreaming and \u2018out-of-body\u2019 experiences happens when higher structures responsible for top-bottom processing are suppressed. They lack a realistic conviction, specially when you wake up, but they do feel intense and raw along the pain-pleasure axis.</p></blockquote><p>Eliezer just bites the bullet:</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019m not totally sure people in sufficiently unreflective flow-like states are conscious, and I give serious consideration to the proposition that I am reflective enough for consciousness only during the moments I happen to wonder whether I am conscious. This is not where most of my probability mass lies, but it\u2019s on the table.</p></blockquote><p>So when confronted with tons of neurological evidence that shutting down higher processing results in more intense conscious experiences, Eliezer just says that when we think that we have more intense experiences, we\u2019re actually zombies or something? That\u2019s totally implausible. It\u2019s sufficiently implausible that I think I might be misunderstanding him. When you find out that your view says that people are barely conscious or non-conscious when they orgasm or that some very autistic people aren\u2019t conscious, it makes sense to give up the damn theory!</p><p>And this isn\u2019t the only bullet Eliezer bites. He admits, \u201cIt would not surprise me very much to learn that average children develop inner listeners at age six.\u201d I have memories from before age 6\u2014these memories would have to have been before I was conscious, on this view.</p><p>Rob Wiblin makes a good point:</p><blockquote><p>[Eliezer], it\u2019s possible that what you are referring to as an \u2018inner listener\u2019 is necessary for subjective experience, and that this happened to be added by evolution just before the human line. It\u2019s also possible that consciousness is primitive and everything is conscious to some extent. But why have the prior that almost all non-human animals are not conscious and lack those parts until someone brings you evidence to the contrary (i.e. \u201cWhat I <i>need</i> to hear to be persuaded is,\u201d)? That just cannot be rational.</p><p>You should simply say that you are a) uncertain what causes consciousness, because really nobody knows yet, and b) you don\u2019t know if e.g. pigs have the things that are proposed as being necessary for consciousness, because you haven\u2019t really looked into it.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with Rob. We should be pretty uncertain. My credences are maybe the following:</p><p>92% that at least almost all mammals are conscious.</p><p>80% that almost all reptiles are conscious.</p><p>60% that fish are mostly conscious.</p><p>30% that insects are conscious.</p><p>It\u2019s about as likely that reptiles aren\u2019t conscious as insects are. Because consciousness is private\u2014you only know your own\u2014we shouldn\u2019t be very confident about any features of consciousness.</p><p>Based on these considerations, I conclude that Eliezer\u2019s view is legitimately crazy. There is, quite literally, no good reason to believe it, and lots of evidence against it. Eliezer just dismisses that evidence, for no good reason, bites a million bullets, and acts like that\u2019s the obvious solution.</p><h2>Absurd overconfidence</h2><p>The thing that was most infuriating about this exchange was Eliezer\u2019s insistence that those who disagreed with him were stupid, combined with his demonstration that he was unfamiliar with the subject matter. Condescension and error make an unfortunate combination. He says of the position that pigs, for instance, aren\u2019t conscious:</p><blockquote><p>It also seems to me that this is not all that inaccessible to a reasonable third party, though the sort of person who maintains some doubt about physicalism, or the sort of philosophers who think it\u2019s still respectable academic debate rather than sheer foolishness to argue about the A-Theory vs. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time\"><strong>B-Theory of time</strong></a>, or the sort of person who can\u2019t follow the argument for why all our remaining uncertainty should be within different many-worlds interpretations rather than slopping over outside, will not be able to access it.</p></blockquote><p>Count me in as a person who can\u2019t follow any arguments about quantum physics, much less the arguments for why we should be almost certain of many worlds. But seriously, physicalism? We should have no doubt about physicalism? As I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/against-dogmatic-physicalism\">argued before</a>, the case against physicalism is formidable. Eliezer thinks it\u2019s an open-and-shut case, but that\u2019s because he is demonstrably mistaken about the zombie argument against physicalism and the implications of non-physicalism.&nbsp;</p><p>And that\u2019s not the only thing Eliezer expresses insane overconfidence about. In response to his position that most animals other than humans aren\u2019t conscious, David Pearce points out that you shouldn\u2019t be very confident in positions that almost all experts disagree with you about, especially when you have a strong personal interest in their view being false. Eliezer replies:</p><blockquote><p>What do they think they know and how do they think they know it? If they\u2019re saying \u201cHere is how we think an inner listener functions, here is how we identified the associated brain functions, and here is how we found it in animals and that showed that it carries out the same functions\u201d I would be quite impressed. What I expect to see is, \u201cWe found this area lights up when humans are sad. Look, pigs have it too.\u201d Emotions are just plain simpler than inner listeners. I\u2019d expect to see analogous brain areas in birds.</p></blockquote><p>When I read this, I almost fell out of my chair. Eliezer admits that he has not so much as read the arguments people give for widespread animal consciousness. He is basing his view on a guess of what they say, combined with an implausible physical theory for which he has no evidence. This would be like coming to the conclusion that the earth is 6,000 years old, despite near-ubiquitous expert disagreement, providing no evidence for the view, and then admitting that you haven\u2019t even read the arguments that experts give in the field against your position. This is the gravest of epistemic sins.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This has not been anywhere near exhaustive. I haven\u2019t even started talking about Eliezer\u2019s very implausible views about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/W2fkmatEzyrmbbrDt/p/SbdCX6A5AGyyfhdmh\">morality</a> (though I might write about that too\u2014stay tuned), reductionism, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vzLrQaGPa9DNCpuZz/against-modal-logics\">modality</a>, or many other topics. Eliezer usually has a lot to say about topics, and it often takes many thousands of words to refute what he\u2019s saying.</p><p>I hope this article has shown that Eliezer frequently expresses near certainty on topics that he has a basic ignorance about, an ignorance so profound that he should suspend judgment. Then, infuriatingly, he acts like those who disagree with his errors are morons. He acts like he is a better decision theorist than the professional decision theorists, a better physicist than the physicists, a better animal consciousness researcher than the animal consciousness researchers, and a much better philosopher of mind than the leading philosophers of mind.</p><p>My goal in this is not to cause people to stop reading Eliezer. It\u2019s instead to encourage people to refrain from forming views on things he says just from reading him. It\u2019s to encourage people to take his views with many grains of salt. If you\u2019re reading something by Eliezer and it seems too obvious, on a controversial issue, there\u2019s a decent chance you are being duped.</p><p>I feel like there are two types of thinkers, the first we might call innovators and the second systematizers. Innovators are the kinds of people who think of wacky, out-of-the-box ideas, but are less likely to be right. They enrich the state of discourse by being clever, creative, and coming up with new ideas, rather than being right about everything. A paradigm example is Robin Hanson\u2014no one feels comfortable just deferring to Robin Hanson across the board, but Robin Hanson has some of the most ingenious ideas.</p><p>Systematizers, in contrast, are the kinds of people who reliably generate true beliefs on lots of topics. A good example is Scott Alexander. I didn\u2019t research Ivermectin, but I feel confident that Scott\u2019s post on Ivermectin is at least mostly right.</p><p>I think people think of Eliezer as a systematizer. And this is a mistake, because he just makes too many errors. He\u2019s too confident about things he\u2019s totally ignorant about. But he\u2019s still a great innovator. He has lots of interesting, clever ideas that are worth hearing out. In general, however, the fact that Eliezer believes something is not especially probative. Eliezer\u2019s skill lies in good writing and ingenious argumentation, not forming true beliefs.</p>", "user": {"username": "Omnizoid"}}, {"_id": "2yQX4szjAj24tFRj8", "title": "Mesa-Optimization: Explain it like I'm 10 Edition", "postedAt": "2023-08-26T23:06:02.531Z", "htmlBody": "<p>There are a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XWPJfgBymBbL3jdFd/an-58-mesa-optimization-what-it-is-and-why-we-should-care\">couple</a> <a href=\"https://ui.stampy.ai?state=8160_\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/mesa-optimization\">explanations</a> of mesa-optimization available. I think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJLcIBixGj8&amp;t=247s\">Rob Miles' video</a> on the topic is excellent, but I think existing written descriptions don't make the concept simple enough to be understood thoroughly by a broad audience. This is my attempt at doing that, for those who prefer written content over video.&nbsp;</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Mesa-optimization is an important concept in AI alignment. Sometimes, an optimizer (like gradient descent, or evolution) produces another optimizer (like complex AIs, or humans). When this happens, the second optimizer is called a 'mesa-optimizer'; problems with the alignment (safety) of the mesa-optimizer are called 'inner alignment problems'.</p><h2>What is an optimizer?</h2><p>I'll define an optimizer as something that looks through a 'space' of possible things and behaves in a way that 'selects' some of those things. One sign that there might be an optimizer at work is that <i>weird things are happening,</i> by which I mean 'things that are very unlikely if the system was behaving randomly'. For instance, humans do things all the time that would be very unlikely to happen if we behaved randomly, and humans would certainly not exist at all if evolution worked by just making new organisms with totally random genes.</p><h3>The human brain</h3><p>The human brain is an optimizer -- it looks through the different things you could do and picks ones that get you things you like.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, you might go to the shop, get ice cream, pay for the ice cream, and then come back. If you think about it, that's a really complex series of actions -- if you behaved completely randomly, you would never ever end up with ice cream. Your brain has searched through a lot of possible actions you could take (walking somewhere else, dancing in your living room, moving just your left foot up 30 degrees) and expects none of them will get you ice cream -- and has then selected one of the very few paths that will get you what you want.</p><h3>Evolution</h3><p>A stranger example of an optimizer is evolution. You've probably heard this already -- evolution '<i>optimizes inclusive genetic fitness</i>'. But what does this mean?&nbsp;</p><p>Organisms change randomly-- their genes change due to mistakes in the process of making new organisms. Sometimes, that change helps the organism to reproduce by allowing it to survive longer, by making it more attractive, etc. When that happens, the next generation has more of that change in it. Over time, lots of these changes accumulate to make very complicated systems like plants, animals, and fungi.&nbsp;</p><p>Because there end up being more of the organisms that reproduce more, and fewer of the ones with changes that make them reproduce less (like genetic diseases), evolution selects from the space of all the mutations that happen -- if you made an organism with a completely random genome, it would certainly die immediately (or rather, not be alive to begin with).&nbsp;</p><h3>AI Training</h3><p>When an AI is trained, it's usually done by 'gradient descent'. What is gradient descent?</p><p>First, we define something that says how well an AI is doing (the 'loss function'). This could be very simple (1 point every time you output 'dog') or very complex (1 point for every time you say something that is an English sentence that makes sense as a response to what I typed in).&nbsp;</p><p>Then, we make a random AI-- one that's basically just a set of random numbers connected to one another. This AI, predictably, does very badly -- it outputs 'dska\u00a3hg@tb5gba-0aaa' or similar. We run it a lot of times, and see when it comes a bit close to outputting 'dog' (say, with a d as the first letter, or outputting close to 3 characters). Then, we use a mathematical algorithm to figure out which of those random numbers caused the AI to be close to what we want, and which were very far from the right number -- and we move them very slightly in the right direction. Then we repeat this a lot until, eventually, the AI consistently outputs 'dog' every time<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fLAvmWHmpJEiw8KEp/mesa-optimization-explain-it-like-i-m-10-edition#fn20xlfniecdi\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This process is strange, but it's much easier to figure out the <i>direction </i>the numbers should change in than to figure out from the beginning exactly what the right numbers are, particularly for more complicated tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, we can see that this process is an optimizer -- the random AI does nothing interesting, but by pushing the numbers around in the right direction, we can do very complicated tasks which would never happen at random. And this is happening because we look at a very large 'space' of possible AIs (with different numbers in them) and 'move' through it towards an AI that does what we want.</p><h2>&nbsp;What is a <i>Mesa-</i>optimizer?</h2><p>To understand <i>mesa</i>-optimization, we'll return to the evolution analogy. We saw two examples of optimizers -- evolution, and the human brain. One of these created the other! This is the key to mesa-optimization.</p><p>When we train AI, we might -- just like evolution -- find AIs which are optimizers in their own right, i.e. they look over spaces of possible actions and take ones that give them a good score, similar to the human brain. In AI, this second optimizer is referred to as the <i>mesa-optimizer. </i>Mesa-optimizer refers to <i>the AI that we have trained</i> itself, while the outer optimizer is the process we used to train that AI (gradient descent). Note that some AI -- especially simple AI-- may not count as mesa-optimizers, because they don't display behaviour complex enough to qualify as optimizers in their own right.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_160 160w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_320 320w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_640 640w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_960 960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_1120 1120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_1280 1280w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_1440 1440w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5bf45009f8246c40d947ef598f1275a9ab8604f0608daef.png/w_1516 1516w\"><figcaption>Image shamelessly 'borrowed' from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJLcIBixGj8&amp;t=426s\">Rob Miles' video</a> on mes'a-optimizers</figcaption></figure><h2>Why is this a problem?</h2><p>If we have two optimizers, we now have two problems with getting AI to behave well (two 'alignment problems'). Specifically, we have an 'outer' and an 'inner' alignment problem, relating to gradient descent and the mesa-optimizer respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The outer alignment problem is the classic problem of AI alignment. When you make an optimizer, it's hard to make sure that the thing you've told it to do is the thing that you actually <i>want </i>it to do. For example, how do you tell a computer to 'write coherent English sentences that follow on sensibly from what I've written'? Defining complex tasks formally as a loss function can be very tricky. This can be dangerous with some tasks, but discussing that will take too long for this post.</p><p>The <i>inner</i> alignment problem is a bit trickier. We might define our loss function perfectly for what we want it to do, and have an AI that still behaves dangerously, because it's not aligned <i>with the outer optimizer</i>. For instance, if gradient descent finds an algorithm that optimizes 'pretend to behave well to get a good score while I'm being trained, so I can do what I actually want later on' ('<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/deceptive-alignment\">deceptive alignment</a>'), this will get an excellent score on our training dataset while still being dangerous.&nbsp;</p><h2>Examples of inner misalignment</h2><h3>Humans</h3><p>For our first example, we'll return to our evolution analogy one more time. Evolution's search for things that are very good at surviving and reproducing eventually produced brains -- a kind of mesa-optimizer. Now, humans are becoming misaligned with evolution<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fLAvmWHmpJEiw8KEp/mesa-optimization-explain-it-like-i-m-10-edition#fnqu1bh02smsf\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Because evolution is quite an odd type of search (like gradient descent), it couldn't put the concept of 'reproduction' into our brains directly. Instead, a bunch of simpler concepts developed to do with genital friction, complex things to do with relationships, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, humans do things which very effectively meet those simpler concepts, but are terrible for inclusive genetic fitness, like masturbate, watch porn, and not donate to sperm banks. This shows that evolution has an inner misalignment problem.</p><h3>Evolving to Extinction</h3><p>But humans are still pretty<i> </i>well aligned to evolution -- our population size is great compared to other apes. To show how badly evolution can be inner misaligned, let's look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_elk#Extinction\">Irish Elk</a>. Irish Elk (probably) evolved to extinction. But isn't that the opposite of how evolution works? How does this happen?</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:53.06%\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Irish_Elk_front.jpg/220px-Irish_Elk_front.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph of a museum specimen of an Irish elk skull with large antlers\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Irish_Elk_front.jpg/330px-Irish_Elk_front.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Irish_Elk_front.jpg/440px-Irish_Elk_front.jpg 2x\"><figcaption>An Irish elk complete with trademark huge antlers</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection\">Sexual selection</a> is when animals evolve to be attractive to mates, rather than to be better at surviving. This can be good for evolution -- honestly showing potential mates that you're strong, fast, well-fed, etc. can be a good way to ensure that those likely to survive reproduce more. For instance, growing large antlers can be a sign that you're well-fed and able to provide plenty of nutrition to those antlers, or that you're able to fight well to defend yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>However, sexual selection can also go wrong. Having large antlers is great-- up to a point. Once they get too large, you might not be able to move your head well, get caught on trees, and waste a lot of key resources. But if females love great antlers, males with huge antlers reproduce a lot, even if only a few of them survive to adulthood. Soon, all the males have huge antlers and are struggling to survive. Even if this doesn't cause extinction directly, it can contribute if the population weakens. This shows that evolution has a <i>bad</i> inner alignment problem.</p><h3>Hiring Executives</h3><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:505.5px\"><img src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.huffingtonpost.com%2F2015-10-27-1445916079-7527424-Dollarphotoclub_67902901.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=5035d0cd00af6f1499e263734b1a32b232b07af983be635ee9a2e9f0c4fe288f&amp;ipo=images\" alt=\"3 Things Successful African-American Women Do Differently in Business ...\"><figcaption><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-10-27-1445916079-7527424-Dollarphotoclub_67902901.jpg\">A business person</a>, because I suspect you're all drifting off by now</figcaption></figure><p>When hiring executives, the shareholders of a company face two problems.&nbsp;</p><p>The first problem is an outer alignment problem: how do they design a hiring process and incentives scheme such that the executives they hire are motivated to act in the best interests of the company? This problem seems genuinely hard-- how do they stop executives acting in the company's short-term interests to get bonuses and look good at the cost of doing long-term harm to the company (when they've likely moved on to another company to do the same thing<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fLAvmWHmpJEiw8KEp/mesa-optimization-explain-it-like-i-m-10-edition#fnvkgqwj5lsse\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>)?</p><p>The inner misalignment problem here comes from the fact that the people being hired are optimizers themselves -- and may have very different goals from those of the shareholders. If, for instance, there are potential-executives who want to harm the company<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fLAvmWHmpJEiw8KEp/mesa-optimization-explain-it-like-i-m-10-edition#fnl64dyogiew\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, they're strongly motivated to perform well on the hiring process. They may even be motivated to perform well on metrics and incentive schemes in order to stay on and continue doing subtle damage to the company, or change the focus of the company to or away from certain areas while costing the shareholders money in ways that are difficult to measure.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I'd like to note that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/inner-alignment\">the borders between outer and inner misalignment are quite fuzzy</a>, and experienced researchers can sometimes struggle to tell them apart. Additionally, you can have inner and outer misalignment at once.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully this helps you more thoroughly understand inner misalignment.

Some of these venues instantly get ruled out for being too expensive/flashy, being too far away from easy transit, not having suitable availability, etc.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp1x23a33op\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp1x23a33op\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This means that in the Bay Area for example, there are maybe four venues that I would consider viable for a 1500+ person EAG (as it exists currently, with a main networking area, multiple content/meetup rooms, etc.).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref87wfnzx3i4o\"><sup><a href=\"#fn87wfnzx3i4o\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Most venues force you to use their in-house catering company</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref74lrdgux3y\"><sup><a href=\"#fn74lrdgux3y\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and don\u2019t let you bring in your own food (i.e. we can\u2019t buy a bunch of Oreos ourselves). These catering companies generally have a minimum mandatory spend, and significantly mark up the costs of their services. For the upcoming EAG Boston for example (prices include service charge):</p><ul><li>$65 a head for dinner<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnovk82s8d9k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnovk82s8d9k\">[8]</a></sup></span></li><li>$55 a head for lunch</li><li>$4 for a bag of chips/crisps</li><li>$8 for a cup of tea (i.e. hot water and tea bag)</li></ul><p>And these numbers assume everything gets consumed. It\u2019s pretty bad to run out of food and it\u2019s hard to predict what people will eat (i.e. more snacks get eaten if the meals are bad), so we usually have a bit of extra for everything.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9kdwo710h55\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9kdwo710h55\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This means that for EAG Boston, we\u2019re expecting to spend $550k on three meals and some (minimal) snacks and drinks. Doing breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout the event would cost us ~$1M. And for reference, these numbers aren\u2019t the most expensive we\u2019ve seen \u2014 at the Oakland Marriott in the Bay Area, dinner averaged ~$80 a head.</p><p>I\u2019ve talked to other people who run events to get a sense of how much their costs breakdown, though it\u2019s been hard to find good information (budget breakdowns are generally not very public and I\u2019ve struggled to get good information from organisers outside of EA). I\u2019ve found that non-profit conferences will often charge attendees ~$400 per person (tickets often being subsidised) \u2014&nbsp;though most of these events don\u2019t provide much food and often have fewer attendees in a less functional space (fewer rooms and less space for meetings). On the other side of the spectrum, for-profit conferences often charge people $1\u20132k for an event with less food and production value than an EAG (and are often subsidised by sponsors/vendors).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa44u9liiozb\"><sup><a href=\"#fna44u9liiozb\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>Why is everything so expensive? Here are some reasons we think may be significant (not a comprehensive list):</p><ul><li>Big venues are just generally quite expensive to run (big properties, lots of staff, etc.).</li><li>These venues are often empty, forcing them to charge more when they actually do host events.</li><li>Catering costs are marked up in order to mark venue costs down. Many customers will anchor on an initial venue cost; by the time they hear the exorbitant catering fees later, they may feel it\u2019s too late to switch. (We always ask to see both venue and catering costs up front.)</li></ul><h1><strong>Other costs</strong></h1><p>Similar principles apply to other items too. That is, generally things cost a lot more than one might think due to large markups. For audiovisual (AV) setups, companies will charge us $1,000 to rent a single laptop for a week that the AV technicians will need to use in the rooms that are being recorded. And labour is also expensive, at ~$1,000/day per AV technician you use. (We have plans to save on these costs \u2014 see below.)</p><p>There are also lots of other random costs that are hard to avoid:</p><ul><li>Trash haul fees</li><li>Wi-Fi fees (to allow attendees to use Swapcard from different parts of the building)</li><li>Security fees</li><li>Printing and signage fees</li><li>Contractor and other labour fees</li></ul><p>Prices have also risen a fair bit in the last couple of years due to inflation, meaning that in general I expect it to be more difficult to reduce nominal costs, even while we are using fewer services like these where possible.</p><h1><strong>What are we doing to save money?</strong></h1><p>Due to the new funding environment,&nbsp;<strong>we\u2019ve been cutting down our spending for the past few EAGs, and we\u2019re planning to cut it down even further</strong>. In making these judgement calls we\u2019re mostly optimising for trying to get as many high quality attendees networking together for a reasonably affordable rate. We\u2019re aiming for scrappier events, with fewer meals, though we think we can retain a significant proportion of the value at ~75% of the cost. Some things we\u2019re doing:</p><ul><li>Cutting the number of meals served down to ~3 rather than 5 or 6 (cutting dinner at EAG Bay Area seemed to make the event a bit worse, but not massively so<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2db5nqvtu2g\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2db5nqvtu2g\">[11]</a></sup></span>). And also cutting snack and drink variety \u2014 only having a few basic snack and drink options available.</li><li>Selecting cheaper venues (which may be in slightly more annoying locations, have fewer suitable rooms, have less natural light, etc.).</li><li>Cutting the number of sessions we record and making AV setups more basic \u2014 largely because&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@EffectiveAltruismVideos\"><u>our uploaded talks</u></a> have historically had low view counts.</li><li>Generally negotiating harder and more aggressively on prices.</li><li>We\u2019ve kept on doing travel grants but are being more conservative in how much money we give out.</li><li>Cutting other bits where we can, including inventory and certain types of labour.</li></ul><p>We\u2019re also considering moving back to running two EAGs a year rather than three, though we\u2019re planning to wait and see how EAG Boston goes before making a decision for 2024. We\u2019ve explored whether it would be worth it to make the events smaller, and it seemed like it didn\u2019t cut costs sufficiently (per person) for this to be worthwhile, though we\u2019d like to dig into this more in the future. We\u2019re also thinking about whether we should change the structure of the event to open up our venue options (e.g., remove nearly all the content rooms), which could help us to create a more cost effective event.</p><p>We looked a bit at running our events in other locations or further out from cities. Generally things didn\u2019t seem sufficiently cheaper but this is something we\u2019d like to explore further. I do also think there\u2019s a fairly substantial cost to running our events in non-hub locations, because some of the best-networked people in the community (people who can provide mentorship, advice, funding, and so on) will be much less likely to attend. It would also take more time and travel costs for non-local people to attend, reducing the appeal of doing an event outside of a hub.</p><p>We\u2019re still working out the details, but&nbsp;<strong>we also expect to raise default ticket prices</strong>. That is, instead of people paying $200 for a ticket that costs us $1500, they\u2019ll be paying maybe $500 for a ticket that costs us $1000. We still expect to have discounted tickets for students and people on lower incomes, and on the other end of the spectrum we may ask some people to pay for their ticket price in its entirety. This means that people can start expecting to pay more for a (hopefully only slightly) lower-quality event, and we still expect folks to get a lot of value in attending.</p><hr><p>If you'd like to give us anonymous feedback you can do so with Amy (who runs the CEA Events team) <a href=\"https://www.admonymous.co/amy\">here.</a></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfh8qjhml768\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffh8qjhml768\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The venues and large parts of their set-up were booked before the FTX collapse.

This leads to a bias where very large numbers of people overestimate how prevalent the easily-observed soft and harmless parts are. This can sometimes even result in a dangerous and prevalent estimation, among people whose careers are much further ahead than yours, that the entire intelligence agency is harmless and irrelevant, when it actually isn't. Intelligence agencies are probably a mix of both less-functional, less-relevant parts, and also more-functional, more-relevant parts that have a disproportionately large influence over governments and policies; and it is a mistake to assume that intelligence agencies are homogenously composed of non-functional non-relevant parts that aren't worth paying any attention to, even if such a belief is a popular norm.</p><p>In the transformative slow takeoff scenario anticipated by people like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vwLxd6hhFvPbvKmBH/yudkowsky-and-christiano-discuss-takeoff-speeds\">Christiano</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Xgy6CAf2jqHhynHL/what-2026-looks-like\">Kokotajlo</a>, forecasters need to pay attention to all sources and forms of power that will react/interact with upheavals and change the course of history, not just the economic power and lawmaking/regulatory power stemming from legislative bodies like the US Congress. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why intelligence agencies are dangerous&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are a wide variety of situations where intelligence agencies suddenly becomes relevant, without warning. For example, most or all of the US Natsec establishment might suddenly and unanimously change its stance on Gain of Function research, such as if US-China relations or US-Russian relations once again hit a new 25-year low (which has actually been happening very frequently over the last few years).</p><p>Either the leadership of an agency, or a powerful individual in an agency with authority to execute operations, or a corrupt clique, might personally make a judgement that the best way to expedite or restart GOF research is to target various people who are the most efficient or effective at opposing GOF research.</p><p>This need not be anywhere near the most effective way to expedite or protect GOF research, it just needs to look like that, sufficiently for someone to sign off on that, or even for them to merely thing that it would look good to their boss.</p><p>Competent or technologically advanced <i>capabilities</i> can obviously be mixed with incompetent administration/decisionmaking in the mixed competence model of intelligence agencies. An intelligence agency that is truly harmless, irrelevant, and not worth paying attention to (as opposed to having an incentive to falsely give off the appearance of harmlessness, irrelevance, or not being worth paying attention to) would have to be an intelligence agency that is <i>both</i> technologically unsophisticated <i>and</i> too corrupt for basic functioning, such as running operations.</p><p>This would be an extremely naive belief to have about the intelligence agencies in the US, Russia, and China; particularly the US and China, which have broad prestige, sophisticated technology, and also thriving private sector skill pools to recruit talent from.</p><p>When calculating the expected value from policy advocacy tasks that someone somewhere absolutely must carry out, like pushing sensible policymaking on GOF research that could cause human extinction, many people are currently aware that the risk of that important community disappearing or dissolving substantially reduces the expected value calculations of everything produced by that important community; e.g. a 10% chance of the community ceasing to exist or dissolving reduces the expected value produced by that entire community by something like ~10%.</p><p>Most people I've encountered have in mind a massive totalitarian upheaval, like the ones in the early-mid 20th century, and such an upheaval is a hard boundary between being secure and not being secure. However, in the 21st century, especially after COVID and the 2008 recession, experts and military planners are now more focused on the international balance of power (e.g. the strength of the US, Russia, and China relative to each other and other independent states) being altered by economic collapse or alliance paralysis rather than revolutions or military conquest. This is because the entire world is roundaboutly different today from what it was 70 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes more sense to anticipate slower and incomplete backsliding, with results like shifts towards a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_regime\">hybrid regime</a> in various ways, where abuses of power by intelligence agencies and internal security agencies are increasingly commonplace due to corruption, and a lack of accountability due to a broad priority placed on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_warfare\">hybrid warfare</a>, as well as preventing foreign adversaries like Russia and China from leveraging domestic elites such as billionaires, government officials, and celebrities/thought leaders who are relevant among key demographics (like Yann Lecun).</p><p>An example of an angle on this, from the top comment on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LyywLDkw3Am9gbQXd/don-t-take-the-organizational-chart-literally?commentId=bnujfnQXJJ3mJJkxa\">Don't Take the Organization Chart Literally</a>:</p><blockquote><p>...a lot of what goes on in government (and corrupt corporate orgs) is done with tacit power. Few DOJ, CIA, and FBI officers have a full picture of just how their work is misaligned with the interests of America.

Lower-level bosses who have the full faith and confidence of their inferiors put small plans into place to get it done. It's what the boss wants and the boss looks out for them.</p><p>Picture Musk's possible purchase of Twitter. Do you think that if Musk bought Twitter, even as a private owner, he would suddenly have full control of the whole apparatus? Of course not. <strong>The people with real power would be his inferiors who have been there for a while and are part of the in-group.</strong> The only way for Musk to get a hold of Twitter would be to fire quite a lot of people, many who are integral to the organization.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It's hard to see the hardened parts</strong></p><p>(Note: this is a cleaned up version of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pfL6sAjMfRsZjyjsZ/some-basics-of-the-hypercompetence-theory-of-government\">a previous post</a>, whose quality I wasn't satisfied with. Feel free to skip this if you've already read it).&nbsp;</p><p>Some social structures can evolve that allow secrets to be kept with larger numbers of people. For example, intelligence agencies are not only compartmentalized, but the employees making them up all assume that if someone approaches them offering to buy secrets, that it's probably one of the routine counterintelligence operation within the agency that draws out and prosecutes untrustworthy employees. As a result, the employees basically <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/newcomb-s-problem\">one-box</a> their agency and virtually never accept bribes from foreign agents, no matter how ludicrously large the promised payout. And any that fall through the cracks are hard to disentangle from disinformation by double/triple agents posing as easily-bribed-people.</p><p>It's much more complex than that, but that's just one example of a secret-keeping system evolving inside institutions; effective enough not just to keep secrets, but also to thwart or misinform outside agents intelligently trying to rupture secret-keeping networks (emerging <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-Cross_System\">almost a hundred years ago</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence#History\">earlier</a>).</p><p>The upper echelons of intelligence agencies are difficult to observe. It is not clear if the lack of output is caused primarily by incompetence and disinterest, or if the incentive dynamics inside such a powerful structure causes competent individuals to waste their capabilities on internal competition and eliminating their colleagues. However, it is dangerous to take the average lower- and mid-level government official/bureaucrat, who are easier to access and observe, and extrapolate that into difficult-to-observe higher echelons. The higher echelons might be substantially out-of-distribution; for example, in a thought experiment with the oversimplified Gervais model of a corporate hierarchy (the \u201csociopaths\u201d are highly social and love potlucks; the \u201cclueless\u201d are a reservoir of deep organizational insights; and the \u201closers\u201d live very happy lives, and the main thing they \"lose\" to is the same aging process as everyone else), an individual progressing up the pyramid would gradually discover a thanksgiving turkey effect: human being self-sort, resulting in encountering people who already successfully pursued wealth incentives at the top of the organization because they have unusual and qualitatively different combinations of personal traits than the more easily-observed people at the middle and bottom of the pyramid.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pfL6sAjMfRsZjyjsZ/pc6ccmqo9ogw4k3nsdfr\"><figcaption>This image is explicitly stated to be a COMPANY HIERARCHY, it is explicitly stated to not be describing intelligence agencies or interesting nonprofits, which experience <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Moloch</a> in a different way than most private sector firms.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the libertarian school of thought is the most grounded in empirical observations of government being generally incompetent, this should not distract us from the fundamental principle that the top 20% of an org with 80% of the power is largely unknown territory due to difficulty of observation, and all sorts of strange top-specific dynamics may explain government\u2019s failures; although models must be grounded in observations, it is still risky to overdepend on the libertarian school of thought, which largely takes low-level bureaucrats and imagines government as uniformly composed of them, extrapolating those individuals to the highest and most desired positions. Intelligence agencies have surely noticed that posing as an incompetent bureaucrat makes for excellent camouflage, and it's also well known throughout government that mazes of paperwork deter predators.&nbsp;</p><p>The top performing altruists that make up EA, substantially fewer than 0.1% of all altruists globally, are at the extreme peak due to highly unusual and extreme circumstances, including substantial competence, luck, intelligence, motivation, and capacity to spontaneously organize in productive ways in order to achieve instrumentally convergent goals. Unlike EA, however, the top 0.1% of people at intelligence, military, and internal security agencies face incredible evolutionary optimization pressure from the threat of regime change, a wide variety of wealthy and powerful elites looking up at them, and continuous strategic infiltration assaults by foreign intelligence agencies. It is not at all clear what sorts of structures would end up evolving at the peak of power brokers in a democracy, and it is not epistemically responsible to automatically defer to the libertarian school of thought on this, even if the libertarian school of thought is correct about the countless people whose lives were ruined by incompetent government intervention/regulation. Competent people and groups still get sorted to the top where they face darwinistic pressures, even if a large majority of competent people bounce off of bureaucratic nonsense along the way. The operations of intelligence agencies are the results that we observe from those people being given incredible power, impunity, the ability to monopolize information, and to exploit power and information asymmetry between themselves and the large, technologically advanced private corporations that they share a country with (with corporate lobbyists available to facilitate and even cash-incentivize a wide variety of complex bargains between them and leading, notably including revolving door employment of top talent, which is further facilitated by the power and prestige of intelligence agencies). &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It's easy to see the soft parts</strong></p><p>Intelligence agencies are capable of penetrating hardened bureaucracies and other organizations, moving laterally by compromising networks of people, and steering the careers of people in executive departments and legislative branches/parliaments around the world, likely including domestically.</p><p>People with relevant experience understand that moving upwards and laterally through a bureaucracy is a science (it is also many other things, most of them extremely unpleasant). Promoting and navigating through a bureaucracy is also a much more precise science in the minds of people who have advanced further than you, than it is in your mind; given that they were so successful, they have likely done many things right and learned many things along the way which you haven't.</p><p>However, likewise, it is an even more precise science in the minds of the specialists at intelligence agencies, which have been specializing at systematically penetrating, controlling, and deceiving hardened parts of hardened bureaucracies (and other organizations) all over the world for generations (<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/#Summary:~:text=More%20info%20about%20these%20timelines%20at%20All%20Possible%20Views%20About%20Humanity%27s%20Future%20Are%20Wild%2C%20This%20Can%27t%20Go%20On%2C%20and%20Forecasting%20Transformative%20AI%3A%20Biological%20Anchors%2C%20respectively.\">but only a handful of generations</a>).

This further contributes to the dynamic where it is hard to see the hardened parts and easier to see the softer parts, since corruption, incompetence, thuggery/factionalism, and low-engagement each are known to increase turnover substantially, whereas high-value secrets, more relatively competent management, interesting work, and mission-oriented workers are known to have lower turnover and also more amenable to recruiting top talent from top companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, there is also the risk of anti-inductive situations that come with the territory of evaluating organizations whose missions include a very long history of propaganda, disinformation, and particularly counterintelligence and using advanced technology to exploit human psychology (including through the use of data science, mass surveillance, and AI). Going off of vibes, in particular, is a very bad approach, because vibes are emotional, subconscious, and easy to get large amounts of data on and study scientifically. The better you understand something, the easier it is to find ways to get specific outcomes by poking that something with specific stimuli.</p><p>Dealing with hypothetical groups of rich and power people, who specifically use their wealth and influence to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xDNyXGCDephBuNF8c/dark-forest-theories\">avoid giving away their positions to also-rich-and-powerful foes</a>, requires understanding of human cognitive biases related to dealing with unfalsifiable theories.

Ultimately, aside from policy outcomes and publicly-known military/intelligence outcomes, there is little good data, and both hypotheses (uniform incompetence vs non-uniform incompetence within intelligence agencies) must be handled with the best epistemology available.

E.g. you can just force all your subordinates to wear an EEG or go into an fMRI machine, and ask all of them who the smartest/most competent person in the office is, promote the people who are actually top performers, and fire any cliques/factions of people who you detect as coordinating around a common lie. Most middle managers with access to functioning lie detection technology would think of those things, and many other strategies that have not yet occurred to me, over the course of the thousands of hours they spend as middle managers with access to functioning lie detection technology.</p><p>If your immediate reflexive response to lie detection technology is \"well, lie detection technology is currently incredibly inaccurate and ineffective\", then that's a very understandable mistake, but also unambiguously a mistake. I've talked to many people about this, and almost all of them confidently output basically that exact string of text, yet had no idea where it came from or what was backing it up. I don't really doubt that it was possibly true 40 or even 20 years ago, but with modern technology it's much more of a toss-up.

Let us know if you are interested in taking any of them on and could use some guidance!</p><p>For those not themselves interested in contributing, this might be useful for giving people a better idea of the sorts of challenges we at QURI work on.</p><h3>1. Density Estimation</h3><p>Users often want to convert samples into continuous probability distribution functions (PDFs). This is difficult to do automatically.</p><p>The standard approach of basic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation\">Kernel Density Estimation</a> can produce poor fits on multimodal or heavily skewed data.</p><p><strong>a. Variable kernel density estimation</strong></p><p>Simple<strong>&nbsp;</strong>KDE algorithms use a constant bandwidth. There are multiple methods for estimating this. One common method is Silverman's rule of thumb. In practice, using Silverman\u2019s rule of thumb with one single bandwidth performs poorly for multimodal or heavily skewed distributions.&nbsp;</p><p>Squiggle performs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/2090\">log KDE</a> for heavily skewed distributions, but this only helps so much, and this strategy comes with various inconsistencies.&nbsp;</p><p>There\u2019s a set of algorithms for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_kernel_density_estimation\"><i>variable kernel density estimation</i></a> or adaptive bandwidth choice, which seems more promising. Another option is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/205301/lay-persons-explanation-of-sheather-jones-method-for-bandwidth-selection\">Sheather-Jones method</a>, which existing python KDE libraries use. We don\u2019t know of good Javascript implementations of these algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>b. Performant KDE with non-triangle shapes</strong></p><p>Squiggle now uses a triangle kernel for speed. Fast algorithms (<a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/140824/fft-for-speeding-up-kernel-density-estimation\">FFT</a>) should be possible, with better kernel shapes.</p><p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/discussions/1254\">this thread</a> for some more discussion.</p><p><strong>c. Cutoff Heuristics</strong></p><p>One frequent edge-case is that many distributions have specific limits, often at 0. There might be useful heuristics like,&nbsp;<i>\u201cIf there are no samples below zero, then it\u2019s very likely there should be zero probability mass below zero, even if many samples are close and the used bandwidth would imply otherwise.\u201d&nbsp;</i></p><p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/issues/2076\">this issue</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>d. Discrete vs. continuous estimation</strong></p><p>Sometimes, users pass in samples from discrete distributions or mixtures of discrete and continuous distributions. In these cases, it\u2019s helpful to have heuristics to detect which data might be meant to be discrete and which is meant to be continuous. Right now, in Squiggle, we do this by using simple heuristics of repetition - if multiple samples are precisely the same, we assume they represent discrete information. It\u2019s unclear if there are any great/better ways of doing this heuristically.</p><p><strong>e. Multidimensional KDE</strong></p><p>Eventually, it will be useful to do multidimensional KDE. It might be more effective to do this in WebAssembly, but this would of course, introduce complications.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Quantiles to Distributions, Maybe with Metalog</h3><p>A frequent use case is: \u201c<i>I have a few quantile/CDF points in mind and want to fit this to a distribution. How should I do this?</i>\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>One option is to use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalog_distribution\">Metalog distribution</a>. There\u2019s no great existing Javascript implementation of Metalog yet. Sam Nolan made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/pull/1444\">one attempt</a>, but it\u2019s not as flexible as we\u2019d like. (It fails to convert many points into metalog distributions).&nbsp;</p><p>Jonas Moss thinks we can do better than Metalog for most use cases. He wrote the post,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.jonasmoss.com/posts/quantiles/quantiles.html\">Deriving distributions from quantiles</a>, about other potential techniques.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fitting for Metaculus</strong></p><p>Metaculus uses mixtures of logistic distributions as their input method. It would be useful to convert quantile points into this format.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. \u201cPoint Set\u201d Formats</h3><p>One of the main features of Squiggle is its support for what we call&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squiggle-language.com/docs/Api/DistPointSet\"><i>point set</i></a> distribution formats. This means these distributions are stored as x-y coordinate pairs instead of symbolic representations or lists of random samples. This is useful for several operations (scoring and aggregation, for example) and for visualization. See more discussion&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squiggle-language.com/docs/Discussions/Three-Formats-Of-Distributions\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The trouble is that these formats are complicated, and we don\u2019t yet have strong implementations in any language, especially Javascript. This seems like a particularly under-explored area.</p><p><strong>Some properties that would be useful to have include:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>a. Interpolation Methods</strong></p><p>Squiggle currently uses linear interpolation between continuous XY points to approximate distribution shapes. It would be of course, better to do something with curves. However, it\u2019s important to maintain the key properties of probability distributions (no negative probability mass). Ideally, a good approximation could handle varied distributions, from Gaussian to Uniform distributions. It\u2019s possible that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)\">splines</a> or similar will be useful here.</p><p><strong>b. Continuous + Discrete Mixtures</strong></p><p>Handle combinations of continuous and discrete data. Store each with X-Y values. (Squiggle currently does this.)</p><p><strong>c. Arbitrary Discrete Distributions</strong></p><p>Storing discrete values with X-Y pairs doesn\u2019t work when there\u2019s a very large set of potential X values. For example, a discrete distribution for \u201c<i>What will the US population be in 2070?</i>\u201d might require tens of millions of entries - one for each possibility of the discrete number of people. For these cases, ideally, there could be some limited functional form.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>d. Function Tails</strong></p><p>Distribution tails are important to approximate but might require specialized methods other than xy point interpolation. The tails of distributions might be best approximated as simple functions. Thus, these formats would include both lists of X-Y points plus additional information about the tail shapes.</p><p><strong>e. Domain Limits</strong></p><p>One pseudo-alternative to functional tails is to bind all distributions between a MIN_VALUE and a MAX_VALUE. Javascript already has min and max float values, so these could apply. Then, approximations of x-y points up to these endpoints could be used.&nbsp;</p><p>This solution would be a bit tricky to make fully functional, but it might be a decent enough hack for simple, improved tails.</p><p><strong>f. Multivariable Shapes</strong></p><p>The point set formats described above apply to single distributions, but we also want similar formats extending to multiple variables. One simple example would be a distribution that varies within a specific time range. If we could approximate these functions as shapes using coordinates, we could better score/aggregate/visualize them. Performance would be very important for this.</p><p><strong>g. Key Mathematic Operations</strong></p><p>One might want to perform many mathematical operations on point set distributions. Right now, Squiggle has a simple library for performing these - but this library is not well-optimized or tested. It would be great to have a very robust Javascript library here. Many of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ABug+label%3ALanguage\">existing Squiggle numeric bugs</a> come from pointset operations. Well-tested convolution code would be valuable.</p><p><strong>h. More Thorough Ontologies</strong></p><p>The point set shape above could sometimes be a fit for PDFs, sometimes for CDFs, and sometimes for other shapes. When users do certain operations on PDFs, they quickly become more generic functions, but we might want to still store them in a format like point sets. How to best categorize these various types of formatted functions is unclear.</p><p>It would be good to have a library that treats each various shape as a certain mathematical object with corresponding valid properties.</p><p>It\u2019s not clear what categorization/organization system to apply. Perhaps there are clever ideas from mathematics or category theory to help here. Category theory brought a well-grounded ontology to functional programming; we might be able to use similar in this area.</p><h3>4. Scoring Heuristics for General Point Set Distributions</h3><p>Scoring on point set distributions can be difficult if estimators use different approximations. Some known challenges include:</p><p><strong>a. Tails with Zero Probability</strong></p><p>One frequent challenge we faced with previous distribution scoring is that many users would submit too narrow distributions. With point set formats, it was very easy to approximate the tails as having zero probability mass. This would quickly result in a score of negative infinity.</p><p>It would be good to figure out better ways of dealing with this. The cleanest is with a better tail format, as discussed above. But even this is likely not enough, especially for forecasters new to using distributions. We might well desire other approximations or heuristics here.</p><p><strong>b. Discrete/Continuous Mixtures</strong></p><p>It\u2019s not clear how to best score discrete and continuous mixtures. Scoring algorithms typically apply to only discrete or only continuous data.&nbsp;</p><p>One particular complication is when some users submit only continuous forecasts. For example, say there\u2019s a question,&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;\u201cHow much will an upcoming Android phone cost?\u201d.&nbsp;</i>Some users might take the time to write a discrete distribution with probability mass at exactly \u201c749.98\u201d, and some might use a continuous distribution. One potential solution is to have the question writer specify specific x-values that can and should get discrete probability mass. Still, it could be nice to have heuristics for situations without this. Another potential solution would be to add some noise.</p><h3>5. D3 Scale Axes</h3><p>We\u2019re using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://d3js.org/\">D3</a> to display Squiggle distributions. One challenge is that D3 scales are fairly limited. The Log scale doesn\u2019t work for values below zero; this is problematic because many user-generated distributions are either negative or have negative and positive mass.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://d3js.org/d3-scale/symlog\">Symlog scale</a> is an alternative, but it can have trouble showing tick marks and require tuning the&nbsp;<i>constant</i> parameter. Some exploration of this is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://squigglehub.org/users/ozziegooen/models/Squiggle-symlog-exploration\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be useful to have better D3 scales for both situations.</p><h3>6. Forced Distribution Correlations</h3><p>There\u2019s a common use case of wanting to force one distribution of samples to be manually correlated with another. However, there are many ways of doing this; it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s best. It probably makes sense to have several options eventually, but it would be good to have one or two robust recommended options.</p><p>Tom Adamczewski has recommended working with Copulas for this,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/usedagger/usedagger.com-issues/issues/17\">here</a>.</p><h3>7. Language Model Training</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.squiggle-language.com/docs/Ecosystem/LanguageModels\">As discussed here</a>, there has not yet been any custom training of language models with Squiggle or other probabilistic programming languages in JS (that we know of). This could make for some neat projects and could be fairly straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>8. Distribution-Specific Tasks</h3><p><strong>a. Beta Distribution Fitting</strong></p><p>It would be useful to have a simple function that takes in two specific percentiles (the 5th and 95th are fine) and fits them to a Beta distribution. This likely requires some search method. Nu\u00f1o Sempere made one attempt&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/fit-beta\">here</a> but could use more testing and polish.</p><p><strong>b. Extra Distributions</strong></p><p>A few distributions don\u2019t seem to be supported in Javascript yet. The main libraries we\u2019ve found that support (some) distributions are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/jstat/jstat\">JStat</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib\">StdLib</a>. Specifically, we\u2019ve been asked to support Skew Normal, Student T, and Power Law distributions.&nbsp;</p><h3>9. Bonus: Relative Value Functions</h3><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EFEwBvuDrTLDndqCt/relative-value-functions-a-flexible-new-format-for-value\">Relative value functions</a> formats seem useful, but they probably could use a good amount more theory and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Caching Value Ratios</strong></p><p>Calculating the ratio distributions between any two items to compare is expensive. We want fast and efficient methods of caching and approximating these. The brute-force method calculates and stores every comparison - which would be ~N^2 comparisons. This becomes infeasible with over a few hundred items. It would be preferable to use heuristics to determine which specific comparisons are the most important to calculate and then use results to approximate other comparisons.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "oagr"}}, {"_id": "fK7MuBiEzucHhxiHE", "title": "How to calculate the expected value of the best option", "postedAt": "2023-08-26T05:01:36.896Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Quick sidenote</h1><p>Due to complications, despite generous efforts from the audio team, the audio recording is almost completely inaccurate for several parts of this. listener's discretion is advised.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, it has come to my attention that this does not include the discrete case, and the probability distribution functions are a bit wonky, as the method currently provided is optimized purely for comparing abstract functions. At the moment, the function treats probability distributions* as though there is a uniformly randomly distributed input (x), and a non-uniform output (<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"f_i(x)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.06em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

I\u2019d be excited to see much better versions.</p><h2>Equation</h2><h3>Initial Points</h3><p><strong>Scientific Evidence</strong></p><p>20 - A simple math proof proves X</p><p>8 - A published scientific study in Economics supporting X</p><p>6 - A published scientific study in Psychology supporting X</p><p><strong>Market Prediction</strong></p><p>14 - Popular stock markets strongly suggest X</p><p>11 - Prediction markets claim X, with 20 equivalent hours of research</p><p>10 - A poll shows that 90% of LessWrong believe X</p><p>6 - Prediction markets claim X, with one equivalent hour of research</p><p><strong>Expert Opinion</strong></p><p>8 - An esteemed academic believes X, where it\u2019s directly in their line of work</p><p>6 - The author has strong emotions about X</p><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p><p>6 - There's a (20-100 node) numeric model that shows X</p><p>5 - A reasonable analogy between X and something clearly good/bad</p><p>4 - A long-standing proverb</p><p><strong>Personal Accounts</strong></p><p>5 - The author claims a long personal history that demonstrates X</p><p>3 - Someone in the world has strong emotions about X</p><p>2 - A clever remark, meme, or tweet</p><p>2.3 - An insanely clever, meme, or tweet</p><p>0 - Believing X is claimed to be personally beneficial</p><p><strong>Tradition / Use</strong></p><p>12 - Top businesses act as if X</p><p>8 - A long-standing social tradition about X</p><p>5 - A single statistic about X</p><h3>Point Modifiers</h3><p><strong>Is this similar to existing evidence?</strong><br>Subtract the similarity from the extra amount of evidence. This likely will remove most of the evidence value.</p><p><strong>Is it </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/o4e6PsdPQE7rRjzWy/thinking-of-convenience-as-an-economic-term\"><i><strong>convenient</strong></i></a><strong> for the source to believe or say X?</strong><br>-10% to -90%</p><p><strong>Is there a lot of money or effort put behind spreading this evidence?

I attempted to find a compromise between accuracy and ease of use.</p><hr><h2>Meta</h2><h3>Using an Equations for Discussion</h3><p>The equation above is rough, but at least it\u2019s (somewhat) precise and upfront. This represents much information, and any part can easily be argued against.</p><p>I think such explicitness could help with epistemic conversations.</p><p><strong>Compare:</strong></p><p><i>\u201cSmart people should generally use their inside view, instead of the outside view\u201d vs. \u201cMy recommended points scores for inside-view style evidence, and my point scores for outside-view style evidence, are all listed below.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUsing many arguments is better than one big argument\u201d</i> vs. <i>\u201cI\u2019ve adjusted my point table function to produce higher values when multiple types of evidence are provided. You can see it returns values 30% higher than what others have provided for certain scenarios.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to respect top [intellectuals|scientists|EAs]\u201d</i> vs. <i>\u201cMy score for respected [intellectuals|scientists|EAs] is 2 points higher than the current accepted average.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201c<i>Chesterton\u2019s Fence is something to pay a lot of attention to</i>\u201d vs. \u201c<i>See my score table the points from various kinds of traditional practices.</i>\u201d</p><p>In a better world, different academic schools of thought could have their own neatly listed tables/functions. In an even better world, all of these functions would be forecasts of future evaluators.</p><h3>Presumptions</h3><p>This sort of point system makes some presumptions that might be worth flagging. Primarily, it claims that <i><strong>even really poor evidence is evidence.</strong></i></p><p>I often see people throwing out low-informative evidence as completely worthless. I think this take is misguided. The antidote to a poor argument isn\u2019t to mistakingly claim that the argument is entirely worthless - it\u2019s typically to provide better counter-evidence.</p><h3>Agreeing on an evidence-weighing algorithm before direct discussions</h3><p>In classical debate, after choosing a side, debaters will talk up the importance of the sorts of evidence that they might happen to have and dismiss the sorts of evidence their opponents bring up.</p><p>This becomes particularly gnarly when a group (like a political interest) goes through a long list of heated discussions on different topics. In each, they\u2019re likely to gerrymander their effective evidence points rankings in order to most benefit their argument.</p><p>An obvious epistemic improvement would be for parties to declare consistent epistemologies upfront. An even <i>better</i> state might involve parties agreeing on some shared aggregation of their epistemic preferences. Aggregate epistemics, not policy beliefs.</p><p>In some worlds, intellectuals would spend most of their time improving epistemic processes and revealing unbiased evidence. A book about tax reform might be rewarded based on how many total points of evidence it brings up, regardless of which side of the debate those points are on.</p><h2>Is this too complicated and speculative?</h2><p>As long-time readers will know, I\u2019m a big fan of attempting to measure highly speculative concepts. I guess explicit and speculative models are often preferable to standard text discussions. There\u2019s a potential danger that some people might over-trust these numbers because they are numbers. However, the alternative to modeling is often \u201c<i>lots of blog posts with different undefined ontologies and tons of misunderstanding</i>,\u201d so I think this is often a reasonable tradeoff.</p><p>One great thing about models is that you can improve them. As we get more evidence and opinions, I\u2019m hopeful that eventually, models emerge that wind up being <i>pretty okay</i>. If you kill mediocre attempts, you likely eventually kill decent ones, too.</p><h2>Future Work</h2><p>This is basic now, but I think it illustrates a worthy goal. Potential future work (for someone, likely not us) would include:</p><ul><li>If you\u2019re reading this, post your own list! It would be good to get thoughts there.</li><li>Organized surveys for different groups to point these things.</li><li>Instead of specific points, use probability densities for each. Even better would be functions - for example, if survey data is used, there could be a function that takes in the number and quality of the respondents and outputs a corresponding point value.</li><li>Use ML to come up with the algorithm. Its algorithm might be very complicated, but it could be helpful even if it were a black box.</li><li><i>Point</i> an extensive list of concrete examples of evidence. For example, <i>\u201cHow many points of evidence do you think Tweet X provides for claim Y?\u201d</i></li><li>Have people forecast what experts will think, maybe using something like Squiggle.</li><li>As you have functions that people (generally) trust, use automatic evaluations on evidence. On websites, display these points wherever evidence is presented. Reward people/analysts as a function of the points they have discovered.</li></ul><p><i>Thanks to Nu\u00f1o Sempere for discussion on this topic.

I certainly knew little about the topic beyond the superficial prior to working on nuclear issues, and getting up to speed with the recent research is not trivial. Even then there are very large uncertainties around the topic, and different teams have come to different conclusions, which are unlikely to be resolved soon.</p>\n<p>However, this does not mean that we cannot draw some conclusions on nuclear winter. I worry that the fact there are still uncertainties has been taken to the extreme that nuclear winters are impossible, which I do not believe can be supported. Instead, I would suggest the balance of evidence suggests there is a very serious risk a large nuclear exchange could lead to catastrophic climate impacts. Given that the potential mortality of these winters could exceed the direct deaths, the evidence is worth discussing in detail, especially as it seems that we could prepare and respond.</p>\n<p>This is a controversial and complex topic, and I hope I have done it justice with my overview.

Once there, soot could persist for years, disrupting the climate <em>(see \u201c</em><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/nuclear-winter-reviewing-the-evidence-the-complexities-and#The_case_for_concern__Firestorms__plumes_and_soot\"><em>The case for concern: Firestorms, plumes and soot</em></a><em>\u201d)</em>.</li>\n<li>Not every nuclear detonation would create a firestorm, but large nuclear detonations over dense cities have a high risk of causing them <em>(see \u201c</em><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/nuclear-winter-reviewing-the-evidence-the-complexities-and#The_case_for_concern__Firestorms__plumes_and_soot\"><em>The case for concern: Firestorms, plumes and soot</em></a><em>\u201d)</em>.</li>\n<li>Not every weapon in arsenals will be used, and not all will hit cities. However, exchanges between Russia and NATO have the potential to result in hundreds or thousands of individual detonations over cities. This has the potential to result in a large enough soot injection that catastrophic cooling could occur <em>(see \u201c</em><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/nuclear-winter-reviewing-the-evidence-the-complexities-and#Point_one___How_many_detonations_can_we_expect_\"><em>Complexities and Disagreements: Point one</em></a><em>\u201d)</em>.</li>\n<li>The impacts of soot injections on the climate are nonlinear, and even if the highest thresholds in the literature are not met there still could be serious cooling. My personal estimates are that around 20-50 Tg of soot could be emitted in the event of a full-scale exchange between Russia and NATO with extensive targeting of cities. This is less than the upper threshold of 150 Tg from other sources, however that would still cause catastrophic crop losses without an immediate and effective response <em>(see \u201c</em><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/nuclear-winter-reviewing-the-evidence-the-complexities-and#Synthesis\"><em>Synthesis</em></a><em>\u201d)</em>.</li>\n<li>There are disagreements between the teams on the dynamics of nuclear winters, which are complex. However, to date these disagreements center on a regional exchange of 100 weapons of 15 kt each, much smaller than Russian and NATO strategic weaponry. Some of the points raised in the debate are therefore far less relevant when looking at larger exchanges, where fuel loads would be higher, weapons are much more powerful and firestorms more likely <em>(see \u201c</em><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/nuclear-winter-reviewing-the-evidence-the-complexities-and#The_anatomy_of_the_disagreements\"><em>Complexities and Disagreements: The anatomy of the disagreements</em></a><em>, followed by</em> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/nuclear-winter-reviewing-the-evidence-the-complexities-and#Synthesis\"><em>Synthesis</em></a><em>\u201d)</em>.</li>\n<li>This means that nuclear winter is not discredited as a concept, and is very relevant for the projected mortality of nuclear conflict. There are uncertainties, and more research is needed (and possibly underway), however it remains a clear threat for larger conflicts in particular <em>(see \u201c</em><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/nuclear-winter-reviewing-the-evidence-the-complexities-and#Synthesis\"><em>Synthesis</em></a><em>\u201d)</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, although highly uncertain, I would expect something like 2-6\u00b0C of average global cooling around 2 - 3 years after a full-scale nuclear exchange. This is based on my best guess of the fuel loading and combustion, and my best guess of the percent of detonations resulting in firestorms. I would expect such a degree of cooling would have the potential to cause many more deaths (by starvation) than the fire, blast and radiation from the detonations.</p>\n<p>This is a similar conclusion to others who have looked at the issue, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MCim4PoqmFPCcPy9m/updated-estimates-of-the-severity-of-a-nuclear-war\">Luisa Rodriguez</a> and <a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Cost-effectiveness%20national%20US.pdf\">David Denkenberger</a>.</p>\n<p>It differs from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x/nuclear-winter-scepticism\">Bean</a>, who appears to believe that the work of the Rutgers team must be discarded, and that only limited soot would reach the stratosphere in a future war. I believe some of their points may be valid, particularly in the context of exchanges with 100 detonations of 15 kt weaponry, and in highlighting that the dynamics of a future conflict must be considered. However, catastrophic soot injections seem highly likely in the event of 100+ firestorms forming, which is a significant risk in larger exchanges with higher yield weapons. This conclusion is true even if you display skepticism towards the work of the Rutgers team.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>The Second World War resulted in somewhere between 70-85 million deaths, or around 3% of the world\u2019s population at the time. The rate of these deaths peaked towards the end of the war, but averaged in the range of 30-40,000 lives lost per day in the six years of conflict. It is hard to really grasp the scale of this: Neil Halloran has a really moving&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwKPFT-RioU\">video</a> that comes closest in terms of laying it out in a way that humanizes the statistics, but I would argue that so many deaths will always defy comprehension in some ways.</p>\n<p>It is unknown how many would die in a full nuclear exchange between Russia and NATO, but plausible estimates reach into the hundreds of millions within the first three weeks. The majority of these would occur in the opening hours due to fires and blast damage, followed by the deaths of those injured by the searing heat or trapped in the rubble, unable to be saved by a rescue that would likely never come. Fallout deaths would follow after around a week, particularly where nuclear weapons were detonated at the ground level. Countries with many detonations on their territory would likely struggle to restore even basic services, further raising the tally. Again, it is hard to visualize what a nuclear detonation could do in a dense city, but Neil Halloran did another two videos on the topic, with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3RzNEzJyzo\">first</a>&nbsp;modeling the impact of a single detonation on a city and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIAF7kBbGKk\">second</a> projecting what would be the impact of a full exchange. Both are very much worth watching.</p>\n<p>What would likely follow could be an order of magnitude worse. Nuclear winter refers to the hypothesis that soot and other material generated from burning cities following nuclear detonations would reach the upper atmosphere,&nbsp;absorbing part of the sunlight that would have&nbsp;reached the surface. Based on the size of the conflict, the weapon targeting and the model in question, this soot would cause cooling that could start around a few degrees centigrade, or range into a double-digit decline in average surface temperatures. We are rightly very concerned about warming in the order of single degrees caused by anthropogenic climate change over decades, a nuclear winter of those magnitudes over just a few years would have catastrophic implications for the climate and threaten the survival of many ecosystems.</p>\n<p>However, there are questions raised about if nuclear winters are possible in the kinds of magnitudes shown below. The nuclear winter hypothesis is based on models and estimates: we fortunately do not have direct observations, and some who have looked at the issue have come to different conclusions. To go back to the example of Neil Halloran, he later issued a video partly retracting his earlier work which mentioned the impacts of nuclear winters (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KzpIsjgapAk\">here</a>), as he felt its earlier conclusions were too strong.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/piwaojzqelhqvybggyyf\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Values taken from Xia et al. 2022<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-1\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-1\">[1]</a></sup>- potential mortality in a nuclear conflict assuming&nbsp;no effective food system response and a nuclear winter in line with the projections of the Rutger\u2019s team analysis \u2013&nbsp;more on this later in the&nbsp;\u201cComplexities and disagreements\u201d section. It should also be stressed that the dire projections for starvation assume no effective food system response, and are not destiny. In fact, there are a number of effective steps&nbsp;to greatly reduce deaths by starvation already identified that we could take, both in advance and in response.</em></p>\n<p>The initial projections in 1983 for the severity of nuclear winters were certainly too pessimistic in some regards, which estimated cooling of something close to 20\u00b0C and with a rapid onset/comparatively short duration<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-2\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-2\">[2]</a></sup>, and the picture has certainly evolved over time. However, this does not mean that nuclear winter is discredited entirely. There are significant uncertainties, but the statements that nuclear winter is disproven is far too strong, and even a \u201cmid\u201d range nuclear winter would result in the largest shock our modern food system has ever seen.</p>\n<p>This article will seek to discuss these elements in detail, where analysis agrees and disagrees, and where that leaves us in terms of the threat of nuclear winter.</p>\n<p>The core argument for a nuclear winter reduces to the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nuclear detonations over cities will start firestorms and serious conflagrations, generating large amounts of soot.</li>\n<li>The size of these fires would inject the soot into the stratosphere (~12 km and above).</li>\n<li>Once into the stratosphere and above, this soot would only be cleared slowly by natural processes, and there is no feasible technology we could deploy to speed up the process, especially following a destructive war with little to no notice.</li>\n<li>Soot in the stratosphere would absorb part of the sunlight that would otherwise reach the earth\u2019s surface.</li>\n<li>Nuclear conflicts may involve hundreds or thousands of weapons detonated over cities. At this scale, the soot emitted would reduce temperatures and average rainfall years to come, severely disrupting agriculture and ecosystems.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As background, nuclear winter is an example of an abrupt sunlight reduction scenario (or ASRS<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-3\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-3\">[3]</a></sup>), which are events that absorb/scatter incoming sunlight to a significant degree. There are other reasons to prepare for ASRSs, including the ongoing risks of volcanic eruptions as well as asteroids and comets. However, if nuclear winter remains a risk that makes the task far more pressing, given the very serious&nbsp;probability<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-4\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-4\">[4]</a></sup> of a nuclear exchange and the number of lives that would be&nbsp;threatened by disruptions to their food supplies. It matters if a nuclear conflict places billions of lives at risk of starvation, and even if agricultural interventions cannot save the lives lost in the initial conflict, they could prevent a huge amount of starvation and the terrible downstream impacts that would follow in the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>The probability of nuclear winter really matters, and so it is worth thinking about in detail. I hope the following is of some use to readers in that regard.</p>\n<h1>The case for concern: Firestorms, plumes and soot</h1>\n<p>Before we talk about nuclear winter, we are going to need to discuss fires and firestorms.</p>\n<p>Firestorms have a key distinction from conventional fires or conflagrations: they create their own self-reinforcing wind system. All fires draw air to a degree: hot air rises, which leads to an updraft and lower pressure below, pulling oxygen in. However, in a firestorm this process is self-reinforcing: drawing oxygen at such a rate that combustion rises and in turn draws even more air from all sides, reaching hurricane&nbsp;speed winds.</p>\n<p>Once formed, firestorms are close to unstoppable until the conditions that caused them abate or they consume their available fuel, mere human firefighting is helpless to respond. Anecdotes from past firestorms include those trying to escape being pulled off their feet into the blaze by the force of the wind, water bodies within their radius such as reservoirs and canals boiling, and the buildings themselves twisting and melting. There are also worse stories.</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/jnyrno2e81ofx8xvidka\" alt=\"\"></strong></p>\n<p><em>Aftermath of \u201cOperation Gomorrah\u201d the Allied bombing of Hamburg in WW2, which planned and succeeded in creating a firestorm over the city. However, other efforts, most notably over Berlin and Tokyo, failed, you need specific conditions for one to form.</em></p>\n<p>There needs to be a number of conditions for a firestorm to form: primarily a large area on fire simultaneously, in a fuel dense area, with&nbsp;favorable climatic conditions. For example, from empirical data we know the following conditions are at least sufficient<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-5\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-5\">[5]</a></sup>: First, a huge fire, spread over an area of 1.3 square km of which half is ablaze at any single point in time<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-6\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-6\">[6]</a></sup>. Secondly, a high density of fuel in that area, of at least 40 kg per square&nbsp;meter (or 4 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, a more common unit in modeling). This may seem like a lot of fuel, but most cities are estimated to easily provide this, the less dense cities of the 1940s certainly did so, and some forests would potentially do&nbsp;so too. Finally, low ambient winds help, as the fire needs to be drawing from all sides, not rolling<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-7\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-7\">[7]</a></sup>. Other factors, such as the shape of the surrounding land and other weather factors also play a part, but are much harder to neatly pin down<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-8\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-8\">[8]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/gm1lrfnkh5dxnmblexx1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>John Martin - Sodom and Gomorrah \u2013 A painting of the biblical event that inspired the naming of the Allied firebombing operation over Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah, see the photo above).

Again, this is hard to understand with mere words, so here\u2019s a comparison of a Russian SS-25 bomb at 800 kt and an American 100kt W-76 with the 15k \u201cLittle Boy\u201d used at Hiroshima.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/tbrubgm2x2iywyodwqlu\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>*Source:&nbsp;*<a href=\"https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/\"><em>https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/</em></a> <em>.

The W-76 is of course smaller than the SS-25, however its smaller size means that many warheads can be carried in a single missile, striking multiple targets independently. Of particular note is the relative size of the areas of thermal radiation impact marked in orange (the larger circle, the smaller one is the size of the nuclear detonation itself). This is 384 km2 for the SS-25, 60 km2 for the W-76, vs 11 km2 for the \u201cLittle Boy\u201d. Within this zone exposed flesh will receive 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns and fires will be widespread. When talking about nuclear winters and comparing the possible fires to those of the two Japanese nuclear bombings, the difference in weapon&nbsp;yield and number of weapons deployed needs to be remembered, we\u2019re talking about many more much larger explosions&nbsp;over almost certainly more fuel dense cities.</em></p>\n<p>A firestorm occurred at Hiroshima, and while one was avoided at Nagasaki (most likely due to the fact that the weapon missed its target and the area of highest fuel loading, as well as the hilly topography) the&nbsp;far greater modern nuclear&nbsp;weapon yields means that there is a chance they would occur under much more challenging climatic conditions compared to those listed above. We\u2019ll discuss this more in the section below on the&nbsp;modeling.</p>\n<p>The direct impact of these firestorms would be catastrophic for all those nearby, but it is the soot they generate that matters for the nuclear winter argument. Their sheer energy and heat create a far stronger plume of smoke, potentially orders of magnitude stronger than wildfires and other rolling conflagrations. These loft soot and other aerosols high into the sky and up into the stratosphere<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-10\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-10\">[10]</a></sup>, where the impacts of direct sunlight and other factors could loft black carbon even further<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-11\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-11\">[11]</a></sup>. Once at the stratosphere all this material would be far above the water which typically clear aerosols fairly quickly, meaning that it may persist for the order of years rather than weeks.&nbsp;Some soot&nbsp;is&nbsp;also lofted to&nbsp;these levels from the other conflagrations and fires that do not reach the threshold of a true firestorm, however a lower percentage of their carbon is likely to reach the stratosphere.</p>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/sblwhiuwugiz3ftqyoui\" alt=\"\"></em></p>\n<p><em>While this may look like the mushroom cloud from Hiroshima\u2019s nuclear detonation (and has been misidentified as such), the actual mushroom cloud had long passed by the time this photo was taken. Instead, this is actually a photograph of the soot plume rising from the firestorm over the city,&nbsp;extending well above the clouds and at least into the upper troposphere. It is also an image that instinctively makes me shiver. Again, it is vital to stress that this firestorm shown would almost certainly be many times smaller than one triggered by a strategic nuclear weapon over a large city.</em></p>\n<p>Aerosols absorb and reflect sunlight from the Earth\u2019s surface, and at high volumes such material could seriously disrupt the climate, and therefore agriculture. We know that aerosols certainly can cause significant climate impacts due to past asteroid and volcanic shocks, and soot at the volumes projected in some models<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-12\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-12\">[12]</a></sup> could lower temperatures to a catastrophic degree following a serious nuclear conflict, as well as sharply reducing rainfall for its duration. Hence, the concern of a nuclear winter.</p>\n<h1>Complexities and disagreements</h1>\n<p>Based on the above, there seems to be a fairly clear argument for nuclear winters. We know from direct observations that both conventional and nuclear weapons can create firestorms when detonated in fuel rich environments. We also know that at least part of the soot and black carbon generated can rise to stratospheric levels, and that aerosols certainly can disrupt sunlight. Modern weapons are vastly more powerful than those used in WW2, and deployed in far greater numbers, meaning that there could be hundreds of firestorms simultaneously in a nuclear exchange. Put together, that means nuclear winters could reach thresholds where the climate would be disrupted.</p>\n<p>This seems to suggest there is a high risk of at least some climate disruption from nuclear conflict, and these core elements certainly seem to have merit. However, devils lie in every detail with such complex systems, and these are worth discussing.</p>\n<p>Despite the importance of the question, only a few teams have carried out detailed public nuclear winter modeling, and&nbsp;only one has recently&nbsp;modeled a full-scale Russia/NATO conflict (the most damaging scenario). Here\u2019s a quick summary of the teams that have worked on the issue in the past few years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A team currently&nbsp;centered around Rutgers University \u2013 which includes names who have been working on nuclear winter right from the start, as well as a number of new researchers. They have certainly published and written the most on the topic, and have the most concerns about nuclear winter overall. They have&nbsp;modeled a number of scenarios, ranging from regional exchanges with Hiroshima sized weapons right up to full scale global conflicts<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-13\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-13\">[13]</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>A team at the Los Alamos National Laboratory \u2013 The famous US nuclear research laboratory of Oppenheimer fame, established in order to build the first nuclear bomb and which now carries out a variety of different research projects concerning nuclear issues. They&nbsp;modeled a regional nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan, based on 100 15kt bombs being dropped on cities<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-14\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-14\">[14]</a></sup>, and came to very different conclusions to the Rutgers team above.

It should be quickly mentioned that these figures are from the Rutgers team, the Lawrence Livermore team calculated that the climate shock would be shorter, but there is little disagreement that if double digit Tg levels of soot reach the stratosphere, there would be a serious climate shock and crop losses.</em></p>\n<h2>Point one \u2013 How many detonations can we expect?</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the numbers of detonations over cities shown above from the Rutgers analysis. Specifically, in their model this figure is taken to be strikes that do not overlap, such that each detonation starts a new fire and as such they do not compete with each other for fuel. How credible is this in a future nuclear war?</p>\n<p>Parts of the logic of nuclear deterrence, targeting and weaponry have stayed the same since the cold war, but there have also been some very significant changes. When the first nuclear winter projections were published in 1983, we were in a very different world to today, both in terms of weapon numbers and the yields of those weapons.</p>\n<p>I was going to write that weapon totals had become insane, but that\u2019s not correct. Nuclear weapons, the structures of deterrence and the game theory that shapes everyone in the chain right up to premiers and presidents has a logic, and that is worse than insanity. Insecurity between the great powers bred fear of a disabling first strike, and the desire to preserve your own forces in order to credibly respond created the need for more weapons, and fundamentally dangerous levels of automation and hair triggers. Systems that \u201cfail deadly\u201d such as launch-on-warning, and \u201cDead hand\u201d (officially called \u201cPerimeter\u201d in Russia and the Soviet Union, and possibly active today as we speak due to the standoff with NATO) were created, further raising the stakes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/coldxeht9d14snouyobe\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In such a world with 60,000 plus weapons it was plausible that 4,000 detonations could occur over cities or fuel rich zones. Tensions were high, and even though neither side wished to start a nuclear war the chance of a miscalculation meant it was perfectly possible one could have been caused by accident. In particular NATO\u2019s Able Archer exercise in 1983<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-18\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-18\">[18]</a></sup> combined with a Soviet nuclear computer system failure<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-19\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-19\">[19]</a></sup> nearly triggered an accidental exchange, and there were other close calls. At some point so many weapons with so many points of failure would create an accident, either they would need to go, or they would take modern civilization with them.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, these weapon numbers were so clearly risky and expensive that both sides took a step back once tensions eased following the&nbsp;fall of the Soviet Union and into the early 2000s<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-20\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-20\">[20]</a></sup>. Arms control treaties were signed to reign in these totals, and should be credited with serious and meaningful progress in reducing the risk and severity of nuclear wars. New START<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-21\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-21\">[21]</a></sup> is the latest of these, which limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic weapons. Seeing as the treaty contains (or contained) provisions for inspections, and both parties have each other\u2019s forces under close surveillance, it is actually reasonably likely that these totals are being adhered to.</p>\n<p>This gives us approximately 3,000+ strategic weapons deployed across Russia and the United States in total, with a few hundred apiece also in the arsenals of China, France and the United Kingdom. You also need to add some smaller tactical weapons into the mix (START only covers strategic weapons), as well as bombers (which count for one bomb under START definitions, but can carry several), which pushes us up to a total of maybe 4,000 deployed nuclear weapons ready to fire in a future Russia/NATO exchange.</p>\n<p>This is clearly enough to utterly devastate all parties involved, and you might think the reductions make little difference, just that the rubble will bounce a few less times. Fortunately, the reductions do likely matter, both from the perspective of direct damage, the risk of a nuclear accident and from the standpoint of a nuclear winter. Vitally for winters, the reductions mean that the more severe soot scenarios (based on thousands of unique detonations over cities) would be less likely to be reached, for a number of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many of these weapons (most tactical and a portion of strategic weapons), will be targeted at key military installations and infrastructure outside of cities. In a nuclear war there is no clean line between military and civilian, and these could still generate fires and kill, but they would create far less soot.</li>\n<li>Some weapons will be destroyed on the ground or intercepted prior to detonation. Bombers, submarines and land-based systems are all vulnerable to greater or lesser degree<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-22\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-22\">[22]</a></sup>, and any first strike would aim to locate and disable as much of the opponent\u2019s nuclear arsenal as possible to minimize the return fire. It is vanishingly unlikely that any first strike would be able to catch all of an opponent\u2019s arsenal, but it is also unlikely that it would be unscathed, which removes more weapons from our total.</li>\n<li>Nuclear warfare plans must be set beforehand to a high degree, with a few set options on the menu of responses<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-23\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-23\">[23]</a></sup>.&nbsp; An unknown number of weapons will be out of touch or destroyed when you give the go order, and some launched will be intercepted. Because you must guarantee key targets will be destroyed, this results in redundancy in targeting.&nbsp;At its most extreme, this logic meant that some key Soviet air&nbsp;defense radars close to Moscow or military sites were each assigned double digit nuclear weapons in declassified US planning to make completely sure that they were gone early in any exchange. This means that weapons that do strike cities will&nbsp;certainly have duplication and overlap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Put together, this means that while the larger scenarios for detonations over cities are not impossible, even a full-scale nuclear war with 4,000 weapons deployed does not translate into the same number of unique detonations spaced out over cities. Instead, numbers ranging from low hundreds to a few thousand are more plausible, and for the purposes of estimating nuclear winter for the rest of this article is probably the best we can do.</p>\n<p>It is still vital to stress and reiterate that even with these caveats such a war would still be the worst thing to happen to humanity, and hundreds or thousands of weapons could still kill many millions and put billions more at grave risk.</p>\n<p>I also worry that some take the logic too far, and assume the factors above mean that cities wouldn\u2019t see significant devastation beyond a few key targets. I have seen estimates that place nuclear weapon use in the low tens or maximum hundreds even in a supposedly pessimistic scenario for a Russia/NATO exchange. This does not appear to be supported by the&nbsp;information publicly available, and it should be stressed that there are strong factors that push both sides to launch weapons at cities in a future war: even if you wish to only target military targets and war supporting industries/infrastructure you\u2019re going to hit cities and civilians<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-24\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-24\">[24]</a></sup>. Also, in the event of a first strike, the responding country may well think that there is little point in striking empty silos, and be unsure about the scale of the attack they have received, and so go for a full response plan aimed at crippling the attacker with maximum force with all weapons available.</p>\n<p>Finally, it is worth stressing that the progress we have made so far is not guaranteed to continue, and even the treaties we have in place cannot be taken for granted. The cold war had phases of negotiation waxing and waning into phases of hostility, and similarly we are in a phase of high great power tension at the time of writing. New START currently faces an uncertain future, with Russia suspending its cooperation in order to try and leverage concessions in Ukraine. For the moment it seems like there has not been a significant increase in deployed strategic weapons and the terms of the treaty are still being adhered to (possibly as putting resources into more strategic weapons serves no purpose in shoring up Russia\u2019s position on the frontlines) but that may not last. Both Russia and the US have far more than 1,550 strategic weapons in storage, as well as the potential to make more, and the threat of nuclear use by Russia in order to back up a conventional war of aggression is a serious escalation. If a weapon is ever used, no matter its yield all bets are off.</p>\n<h2>Point two \u2013 How do detonations translate into stratospheric soot?</h2>\n<p>Beyond the number of expected detonations, there are also important uncertainties about the fires and resulting soot dynamics that would follow, with each team working on the issue having a different estimate.</p>\n<p>This is to be expected. While we have data from nuclear tests no one has ever detonated a hydrogen bomb over a city, thankfully, so we do not have direct empirical data. We have observations from the two first atomic bombings, but it is hard to know how much these examples can be projected forwards to modern cities or modern weapon sizes. We also have observations of firestorms, but again fortunately only a few, and again never on the scale we expect to see in these exchanges.</p>\n<p>Instead, teams must model the scenarios themselves, based on assumptions around the cities and weapons in question. This means disagreements are unlikely&nbsp;to be fully resolved soon. Firstly, at least some of the models used are not open source, for reasons of preserving control of intellectual property or even for national security. Secondly, there is no objective standard, there are no&nbsp;clean general formulas or easy linear relationships for such complex systems, and all models have to round off some of the corners of reality in order to function. All models are wrong, just that some are useful. Improved climate&nbsp;modeling and computing power has allowed some refinements of estimates over time<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-25\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-25\">[25]</a></sup>, but in the absence of empirical results there are simply too many unknowns&nbsp;for all teams to agree on a number even within a factor of say two.</p>\n<p>Take a step back and think about how you actually calculate the soot that ends up in the stratosphere from a given nuclear conflict, and the number of steps that are required.</p>\n<p>First, you need to model your hundreds or thousands of targets, how much fuel&nbsp;is in them, and the climate at each (in all cases run so far this has been highly simplified, and factors like topography excluded). Then you need to model the detonation of a nuclear weapon over the target, how the blast deforms&nbsp;buildings, if that makes fuel more or less available, and how much of it would combust. After this you have to model the fire itself, how much area would be ignited, would it spread, would a firestorm form, etc. This is not solvable by a clean formula, and once again we do not have direct observations on the scale of our largest weapons.</p>\n<p>But you\u2019re still not close to done, as we still need to model the dynamics of the soot. This is also not defined&nbsp;by a clean formula, especially as you\u2019re estimating this based on complex fluid dynamics and need to include things like the variable temperature and humidity as the smoke rises, and the impact of sunlight on the plume. It is highly complex to accurately model smoke in a closed environment like a room, doing so in&nbsp;an open air situation, then adding firestorms and local weather conditions the challenge becomes orders of magnitude harder. Soot also interacts with water in a process called \u201cscavenging\u201d, where soot sticks to the water particles and is rained out, which means you have to include water dynamics in your model. Some water may be naturally&nbsp;present over some cities as clouds, water will also be emitted as vapor from the fire you\u2019ve just created, which means your model now has both solid, liquid and gas&nbsp;modeling to greater or lesser degrees.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re still not done however, as we still need to consider how long the soot would remain in the stratosphere. How high would it settle? Would it last for years, as it is above almost all atmospheric water at this point, or would it be cleared reasonably quickly? Again, we have some observations here from similar materials, but nothing conclusive, and a one-month half-life for the material versus a five year one leads to radically different climate results.</p>\n<p>Then, all you need to do is model how your predicted volume of soot will impact every aspect of the global climate, including wind speeds, rainfall, humidity and air pressure for the duration you\u2019re&nbsp;modeling. Interestingly, this seems to be the step with the fewest current disagreements, partly because both Los Alamos and Rutgers use the same climate model (the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM1)). For example, there seems to be no dispute that 50 Tg of soot persisting in the stratosphere would cause sharp cooling, instead the debate is if that 50 Tg of stratospheric carbon is possible.</p>\n<h3>The anatomy of the disagreements</h3>\n<p>Given that there are so many places for disagreement, we are going to have to&nbsp;focus on the key points. The only direct comparison between different models running the same scenario happened when both Rutgers and Los Alamos looked at a regional nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan \u2013 100 weapons of 15 kt each (the scale of the Hiroshima bomb), with Lawrence Livermore later sharing some results from their own&nbsp;modeling.</p>\n<p>This back&nbsp;and forth<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-26\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-26\">[26]</a></sup> started with the publication of papers by the Rutgers team (<a href=\"https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/7/1973/2007/\">Toon et al 2007</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013EF000205\">Mills et al 2014</a>), which estimated worst case stratospheric soot from such a war at around 5 Tg (5 million tonnes). This was followed by the Los Alamos team (<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JD027331\">Reisner et al 2018</a>), who ran the same scenario and came to a worst case figure of around 0.2 Tg of stratospheric soot. Rutgers published a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD030777\">critique</a>, highlighting in particular where they felt the Los Alamos laboratory had underestimated the fuel available for the fires. Los Alamos&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031281\">responded</a>, accepting some of the points but still estimating that even with&nbsp;unlimited fuel levels, stratospheric soot levels would not exceed 1.3 Tg.</p>\n<p>Finally, Lawrence Livermore touched on the debate in 2020 (<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JD033056\">Wagman et al 2020</a>). They did not estimate the fuel present or combustion directly, instead they modeled how different levels of average combustion mapped to stratospheric soot and cooling. At 1 g combusted/cm<sup>2</sup>, the soot would be cleared quickly and little would reach the stratosphere, meanwhile at over 16 g/cm<sup>2</sup> there would be a lasting climate shock. However, unlike Rutgers they estimated that the climate shock would last around 4 years<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-27\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-27\">[27]</a></sup>, rather than 8-14 for Rutgers, with implications for the potential response and mortality (although still deeply catastrophic in the absence of an effective response, we don\u2019t have anything like 4 years of storage). They also model intermediate scenarios, and note that significant soot injections into the stratosphere occur at 5 g/cm<sup>2</sup> or above<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-28\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-28\">[28]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The key differences between the teams were as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel loading.</strong> Rutgers estimated that India/Pakistan average 28-35 g/cm<sup>2</sup> of fuel in the target zones (estimated based upon the fuel loading from Hamburg and other cities in WW2), while Los Alamos initially estimated that fuel was as low as 1 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. However, Los Alamos did partially concede that their totals&nbsp;could be too low initially in their model (they picked a suburb of Atlanta in the USA for the estimate, which included big gardens and a golf course), raising their model run to around 1-5 g/cm<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;This did not substantially alter their results.</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel combustion.</strong>&nbsp;Rutgers estimated that fuel combustion over the duration of the fire was linear (twice the fuel, twice the combustion, twice the soot). Los Alamos estimated from their model that there would be strong nonlinearities,&nbsp;with higher fuel loads being choked under rubble caused by the bomb or being partially oxygen starved&nbsp;for other reasons, and would not fully combust as you added fuel. To make their point, they raised the model fuel density to 72 g/cm^2&nbsp;^and ran that, with a resulting combustion well below the Rutgers estimate (with or without rubble included). However, secondary ignitions were excluded from the Los Alamos estimates, such as gas line breaks. These may have made a significant contribution to past firestorms, such as Hiroshima, as they note.</p>\n<p>The reduced fuel combustion combined with a lower fuel load means that Los Alamos predicted that only 3.2 Tg of black carbon would be produced in total following the 100 detonations, vs around 6 Tg for the Rutgers team, a factor of 1.9 difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Firestorms.</strong> Rutgers&nbsp;expect that a firestorm would start in all detonation zones as&nbsp;they believe the blast to meet all the sufficient preconditions, effectively lofting soot. Los Alamos excluded that possibility in their model run, estimating that either fuel loads would be too small, or the dense concrete buildings needed for higher fuel loads would form too much rubble for one to&nbsp;be created or fires cannot draw enough oxygen even without rubble included. This radically impacts the dynamics of the plume and soot lofting.&nbsp;Lawrence Livermore does not commit to the&nbsp;probability of firestorms occurring definitively, instead stating that if&nbsp;combustion is high enough to create firestorms (around&nbsp;5 g/cm<sup>2</sup> or above in their modeling) that far more lofting and climate impacts will occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Stratospheric soot.</strong> Due to the firestorm and other factors, Rutgers&nbsp;assumed that the majority of the soot would reach 12 km or higher, penetrating the stratosphere, with just 20% being cleared via scavenging. Los Alamos estimates that the vast majority of soot would be lost before it reaches these altitudes (mostly due to the lack of a firestorm), with 93.5% of soot being scavenged before reaching 12 km.&nbsp;Lawrence Livermore notes the nonlinearities in the soot dynamics, and estimates a high level of soot would reach the stratosphere with high combustion and firestorms, and limited amounts for lower combustion rates.</p>\n<p>In effect, the presence of firestorms means that 12.8 times more of the generated soot<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-29\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-29\">[29]</a></sup> reaches the stratosphere in the Rutgers model, compared to the Los Alamos projections where soot does not have the same lofting plume.&nbsp;The probability of firestorms really matters here, and is&nbsp;a key driver of the differing perspectives between the teams.</p>\n<h1>Synthesis</h1>\n<p>I&nbsp;have no experience running these models, and as such have no particular expertise or intuitions to draw upon to make strong judgements about the details of the arguments above. It may be the case that firestorms cannot form in an India/Pakistan exchange, and as a result there would not be a serious nuclear winter for such a conflict. Similarly, it may be that Los Alamos is wrong about fuel loads, or they are wrong that firestorms are highly improbable, raising the emitted soot.</p>\n<p>However, I would argue this uncertainty is less relevant when discussing a Russia/NATO exchange, for a number of reasons. Firstly, the fuel loads of the cities in question are much higher. Hiroshima with low built structures in WW2 averaged 10 g/cm<sup>2</sup>,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-30\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-30\">[30]</a></sup> while estimates for the areas burnt across Hamburg range between 16-47 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on the source<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-31\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-31\">[31]</a></sup>. Cities like New York, Paris, London and Moscow are now much denser, and that&nbsp;suggests at least as much fuel as Hamburg, far higher than Los Alamos\u2019 1-5 g/cm^2&nbsp;^projections for the outskirts of an Indian/Pakistani city. The exact burn rates are complex, but it is hard to argue that the fuel isn\u2019t there in sufficient quantities for a firestorm (at least&nbsp;4 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, and many&nbsp;materials burn in the heat of nuclear fire).</p>\n<p>In addition, a greater area will almost certainly be ignited simultaneously, given that more than 100 detonations are possible and&nbsp;many strategic weapons are over an order of magnitude larger than 15 kt<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-32\" id=\"fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-32\">[32]</a></sup>. Los Alamos\u2019 statement that 15 kt weapons are highly unlikely to cause a firestorm over cities in India/Pakistan seems optimistic,&nbsp;but much larger weapons may also change their conclusions should they&nbsp;analyze their effects.</p>\n<p>It may be a stretch to state that every large weapon detonated over or near a city will cause a firestorm. However, we know firestorms have formed in 50% of past nuclear detonations over&nbsp;cities even&nbsp;with comparatively low yield weapons, as well as following conventional/incendiary bombing of cities (where much rubble was present, and conventional high explosive bomb blasts were used deliberately to make fuel more accessible for the following incendiaries). As a result, I would say the possibility of firestorms following a full-scale nuclear exchange certainly cannot be discounted without far stronger evidence.</p>\n<p>Collectively, this pushes us towards&nbsp;being concerned when looking at larger exchanges, although maybe not quite to the upper limits of modeling: not every weapon will have a unique detonation over a city, or cause a firestorm. However, even if that\u2019s the case of a full-scale exchange between Russia and NATO could still be in the order of&nbsp;20-50 Tg (3-7\u00b0C of cooling, from ~200 to&nbsp;750 firestorms), and a smaller scale one could be 5-20 Tg (1-3\u00b0C of cooling). That\u2019s plenty to devastate agriculture worldwide unless we\u2019re prepared, but as I stressed before we can and should prepare.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re now over 8,000 words in, however, if you\u2019ll stay with me, we\u2019ll go over the horizon into a one more bit of extrapolation.&nbsp;This is certainly not suitable for peer review, but let\u2019s compare Los Alamos to Rutgers one last time, but this time apply their different factors to different conflict scenarios, displayed on the diagram below. As above, using Los Alamos\u2019 fuel loads/combustion reduces the soot produced in the fires by a factor of 1.9, while assuming no firestorms form reduces soot lofting to the stratosphere by a huge factor of 12.9. These factors of course are certain to be non-linear, and would therefore be different in the event that Los Alamos&nbsp;modeled a full-scale exchange, but they at least let us look at how much the differing opinions alter our conclusions in principle.</p>\n<p>Overall,&nbsp;if&nbsp;all detonations cause firestorms and cities burn well (the top red line), we should be seriously concerned about nuclear conflict causing nuclear winters in almost any large exchange: even 250 unique detonations could cause 6 degrees of cooling at the peak of the climate shock (expected to occur something like 18 months post war).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, if half as much smoke is produced versus what Rutgers estimates, and no detonation will lead to a firestorm and so lofting is weak (the bottom yellow line), we might only see a maximum 1 degree of cooling, and nuclear winter is less of a concern.</p>\n<p>However, if firestorms do occur in any serious numbers, for example in half of cases as with the historical atomic bombings, a nuclear winter is still a real threat. Even assuming lower fuel loads and combustion, you might get 3 degrees centigrade cooling from 750 detonations; you do not need to assume every weapon leads to a firestorm to be seriously concerned.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pbMfYGjBqrhmmmDSo/nu71u4wry3qn8en2zess\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Extrapolated soot and climate impact from 250 detonations of 100 kt:</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\"></th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>All unique detonations cause firestorms</strong></th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Half of unique detonations cause firestorms</strong></th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>No firestorms</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Rutgers fuel load</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">37 Tg, ~ 6\u00b0C of cooling</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">19.9 Tg, ~ 3\u00b0C of cooling</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">2.9 Tg, ~ 1\u00b0C of cooling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Reduced fuel/combustion</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">19.5 Tg, ~ 3\u00b0C of cooling</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">10.5 Tg, ~ 2\u00b0C of cooling</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">1.5 Tg, &lt;1\u00b0C of cooling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To stress, this argument isn\u2019t just drawing two lines at the high/low estimates, drawing one between them and saying that is the reasonable answer. This is an argument that any significant targeting of cities (for example 250+ detonations) with high yield strategic weaponry presents a serious risk of a climate shock, if at least some of them cause firestorms.</p>\n<p>This is a view held most strongly by the Rutgers team, but Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory also estimated that if firestorms were formed they would have a strong soot lofting effect, and in high numbers create a climate shock. They also estimated that the fuel combustion needed for this is not impossible in the context of modern cities, something like 5 g/cm<sup>2</sup> or above is sufficient in their India/Pakistan scenario. Lawrence Livermore are not biased towards nuclear disarmament and looking for excuses, they are a federal laboratory that designed the 1.2 mt B-83 nuclear weapon, the largest currently deployed in America\u2019s arsenal. Their conclusions are more guarded, they do not commit to an estimate of the number of firestorms that would actually form in the India/Pakistan scenario for example, but unless we can be confident that firestorms will not form following thermonuclear detonations over cities their conclusions also suggest a risk remains.</p>\n<p>Overall, although highly uncertain, I would expect something like 2-6\u00b0C of average global cooling around 2 - 3 years after a full-scale nuclear exchange. This is based on my best guess of the fuel loading and combustion, and my best guess of the percent of detonations resulting in firestorms. I would expect such a degree of cooling would have the potential to cause many more deaths (by starvation) than the fire, blast and radiation from the detonations.</p>\n<p>This is a similar conclusion to others who have looked at the issue, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MCim4PoqmFPCcPy9m/updated-estimates-of-the-severity-of-a-nuclear-war\">Luisa Rodriguez</a> and <a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Cost-effectiveness%20national%20US.pdf\">David Denkenberger</a>.</p>\n<p>It differs from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x/nuclear-winter-scepticism\">Bean</a>, who appears to believe that the work of the Rutgers team must be discarded, and that only limited soot would reach the stratosphere in a future war. I believe some of their points may be valid, particularly in the context of exchanges with 100 detonations of 15 kt weaponry, and in highlighting that the dynamics of a future conflict must be considered. However, catastrophic soot injections seem highly likely in the event of 100+ firestorms forming, which is a significant risk in larger exchanges with higher yield weapons. This conclusion is true even if you display skepticism towards the work of the Rutgers team.</p>\n<p>I hope that there is further&nbsp;modeling and work on nuclear winters, particularly of the largest exchanges; the question really does matter for humanity. If it is the case that a nuclear winter falls in probability, either from reduced weapon numbers or from updated credible data, I certainly will breathe a very deep sigh of relief. Until that happens, I think the arguments above suggest that they do present a serious and credible threat, and must be considered in the context of preventing and responding to nuclear conflicts.</p>\n<p>We can and should reduce their probabilities with our actions, we can and should build resilience and prepare for their occurrence. Given the&nbsp;risks, doing anything else would be&nbsp;extremely reckless.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Xia, L., Robock, A., Scherrer, K. *et al.* Global food insecurity and famine from reduced crop, marine fishery and livestock production due to climate disruption from nuclear war soot injection. *Nat Food* **3**, 586\u2013596 (2022). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-022-00573-0\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-022-00573-0</a> <a href=\"#fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a> <a href=\"#fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-1:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>R.

While some firestorms have (possibly) been observed in nature or due to earthquakes in cities, the largest and most destructive have been man made and no accident. All major combatants in WW2 used fire as a weapon against civilians, but it was the sheer industrial base of the United Kingdom and United States and the number of aircraft they could deploy that allowed firestorms to be created deliberately. This started with the bombing of Germany, with rolling coordinated attacks that mixed high explosives to break apart buildings and create the conditions for fires to spread, followed with napalm and magnesium incendiary bombs deployed in grids. This started uncontrollable fires spread across wide areas simultaneously, with Hamburg, Dresden and other cities experiencing firestorms that killed [many tens of thousands](<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestorm\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestorm</a>) each.</p>\n<p>However, the largest fires and firestorms occurred over Japan, where the collapse of air defenses and the high combustibility of cities combined to create the perfect environment for strikes. Bombers once in range could be stripped of all defenses in order to pack in more bombs, and could switch their formations due to the limited anti-aircraft fire and fighter attacks. This meant more bombs could be dropped in more optimal grids and more accurately, the perfect conditions for firestorms and conflagrations given the combustible cities below them. The atomic bombings of August 1945 are rightly remembered, but the firebombing of Tokyo in May killed a similar magnitude of people as the bombing of Hiroshima (although with far more aircraft employed in the attacks). <a href=\"#fnref-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-8\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-WASKjB6MCLuSk9Ygu-9\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Owen B.

And I found a really interesting pattern of results, comparing AI to these previous technologies. So think about a graph where, on the x-axis, you have income or salary for a job \u2014 so on the left-hand side it\u2019s very low paid; right-hand side it\u2019s very high paid \u2014 and then on the y-axis, you have how exposed jobs at that level are.</p><p>So for robots, you have a line that basically starts high on the left and then goes down a lot: so it\u2019s very low-skilled jobs, low-paid jobs that are exposed to robots, and high-skilled jobs are not at all exposed.</p><p>With software, you have a very different pattern, which is that actually the lower-skilled jobs are not exposed and the higher-skilled jobs are not exposed; it\u2019s the middle-skilled jobs that are most exposed. And what\u2019s cool is that this reflects a pattern that lots of other very <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.5.1553\">careful research</a> in economics has <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w16082/w16082.pdf\">found</a> about the impact of software in particular: it\u2019s really impacted middle-skilled jobs.</p><p>Like, really careful studies specifically for software, middle-skilled ones are most exposed. So it was cool that I kind of replicated that with this very different method.</p><p>But the really interesting thing is that for AI, it\u2019s a completely different pattern again. So for AI, it\u2019s actually the upper-middle-skill jobs that are most exposed. So the line starts on the bottom left, at a low level, and then goes up and up and up and it peaks, I think, in the 88th percentile of jobs as sorted by salary \u2014 so really upper, upper income, high-paid jobs \u2014 and then goes down at the very top. So that the CEOs are paid the most and not exposed so much, but the lawyers and the accountants and whatever, they actually are exposed.</p><p>The really interesting thing is that the OpenAI paper \u2014 using a different methodology and focusing very much on GPT-4 and these new large language models, as opposed to the slightly earlier vintage of AI I was focusing on \u2014 they replicate this figure with their measure, and it\u2019s basically exactly the same. So the same pattern.</p><p>Now, it turns out that many of those jobs are the most regulated jobs. So the doctors and the lawyers and the accountants, they\u2019re the ones who actually have the most power in the economy and society to put up barriers and stop the exposure that might otherwise cause them to be paid lower wages or whatever. They can pull up the drawbridge and stay happy as they are. But on the pure economics of this \u2014 before getting to the political economy; instead it\u2019s a fancy pretend world where there\u2019s no actual humans and there\u2019s no politics \u2014 it\u2019s those jobs that are most exposed.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How automation can actually *create* jobs</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> Let\u2019s just look at this one sector that\u2019s getting automated, and think about whether it really is the case that when you have big automation in the sector, the number of humans goes down. That\u2019s intuitive, right? Automation means fewer humans. Done. Turns out, it\u2019s not that simple. So there\u2019s a few examples I\u2019ll start with, and we can talk about what the broader lesson is.</p><p>So here\u2019s one example. I think this is due to Jim Bessen, who\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/economics/what-atms-bank-tellers-rise-robots-and-jobs/\">economist who studied ATMs</a>, cash machines, where you go to a bank branch and get cash out. So before ATMs, there were individual humans in the bank. You\u2019d go up to them and show some ID and get your account details, and they would give you some cash. Bank tellers, I think they were called. And you would think, ATM comes along, that\u2019s it for those people: no more bank tellers, huge declines in employment in the banking sector.</p><p>What in fact happened is something quite different. So the ATM did indeed reduce the number of people doing that specific task of handing out money. But there are other things people do in bank branches as well. The big thing that happened is that because a given bank branch no longer needed to have all these very expensive humans, doing the cash-handing-out, it became much cheaper to open bank branches. So whereas before, there were only bank branches perhaps in the larger towns, suddenly banks were competing to open branches everywhere \u2014 because the more you can go into the smaller and smaller towns and villages, you can have more customers and provide them a service and so on.</p><p>So what happened was the ATM meant there were fewer staff per bank branch, but enabled the opening of many more bank branches overall. And that actually offset the first impact. So fewer staff per bank branch, but so many more bank branches that the total number of people in bank branches actually went up.</p><p>What they were doing was quite different. The humans now are doing more higher-value-add activities. They\u2019re not handing out cash. They are doing other kinds of services, but you know, similar people doing a similarish job, and there\u2019s actually more of them now.</p><p>The fancy economist way of putting this is: you have a \u201cdemand elasticity in the presence of complementarity.\u201d So those are crazy silly words, but I\u2019ll tell you what they mean. \u201cDemand elasticity\u201d means when you reduce the price of something, you actually want more of it. So automation generally brings the cost of things down. But what normally happens is, one doesn\u2019t say, \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll have the same amount of stuff.\u201d They say, \u201cNo, I want more of that stuff now. Give me more, more, more.\u201d</p><p>Then \u201cin the presence of complementarity\u201d: so \u201ccomplementary\u201d we think of, if humans are complementary to the automation, the technology, whatever it is, in some way, there\u2019s still some humans involved \u2014 fewer than before, per unit of output, but still some. Then because people now want more and more of this stuff, each unit of the thing is more automated, but there\u2019s still some humans involved. And therefore, you end up possibly having ever more humans totally in demand, doing slightly different things, but still roughly in the same ballpark. Does that make sense?</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How automation affects employment at the individual level</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> So the final thing I think it\u2019s really interesting to think about, and it\u2019s often not intuitive, is thinking about the impacts on individuals. So we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve accepted that there definitely could be some individuals whose jobs existed, and then they don\u2019t \u2014 they disappear because they\u2019re being automated. Nothing I\u2019ve said so far is saying that doesn\u2019t happen there; that certainly happens a tonne. And I\u2019ve given you some examples of why perhaps we shouldn\u2019t worry so much about it, because there\u2019s more demand for other parts of the economy, whatever. But what does that look like for the actual person experiencing it? And is it good or bad? And when is it good or bad? So there\u2019s a couple of really interesting facts about the way things kind of work in the economy that I think are worth touching on briefly.</p><p>The first one is that there is this not-very-nice term, but it has a benign consequence: the term is \u201cnatural wastage.\u201d So if you are a company, and you\u2019re hiring people. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re McDonald\u2019s. You\u2019re McDonald\u2019s, and people leave \u2014 their average tenure is they start working for you, and six months later, they leave and go and get a better job. So that\u2019s half of people leave within six months, whatever, that\u2019s called natural wastage: people naturally leaving. And you would include people retiring and whatever as well as part of that \u2014 that natural churn. That means there\u2019s a very natural attrition happening in all companies all the time.</p><p>Let\u2019s take McDonald\u2019s as an example. So if McDonald\u2019s somehow automated everything, like the burger flipping and the cashiers. They\u2019ve been trying for a long time, right? That\u2019s slowly happening, but there\u2019s still some humans there right now. Suppose they did it. All they would have to do is stop hiring any new people, and within a year, they would just have no employees, because everyone naturally leaves and goes and gets a better job anyway. That generally is what happens; the average tenure is like six months at McDonald\u2019s. So you just sit and wait and everyone goes off on their own accord \u2014 no firing required, no displacement required.</p><p>And it makes a tonne of sense, right? Because if you are the mastermind organising the economy, and allocating people to different jobs \u2014 obviously, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening \u2014 but if you are the mastermind, it would naturally be the right thing to say that people who have got all the human capital, and they\u2019ve worked in the industry, and they\u2019re going to find it really hard to move: let them keep the jobs. And then the young people, they shouldn\u2019t get into it because that\u2019s a bad bet for the long run; they should do something else. And people make those decisions for themselves, and that\u2019s what happens. So you have these really interesting effects of that kind.</p><p>So the big macro thing is that. Older people will stay in, and younger people move into different things. And that\u2019s by far the most important individual-level effect. Now, where does that go wrong? It generally goes wrong in a couple of circumstances. Namely, it\u2019s very inflected by geography. So what we know, in terms of where you can go and see people who have actually really been hurt by an automation technology coming along, or maybe another kind, trade is a big example: you know, China comes along and suddenly makes things cheaper. If you are a young person in a big city and you were doing some job, then that job goes away, whatever.</p><p>If you are an older person who\u2019s been at a particular firm for a very long time in a town where that firm is the only large employer, and there was no other industry in that town \u2014 and also you\u2019ve got this amazing union job: your wages are really high because of decades of strong worker empowerment and so on \u2014 and then that company goes away from that town, that is not a good place to be. Because empirically, people turn out to be stuck in their towns, right? They just don\u2019t like moving. And if you\u2019re in your 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s, got a family\u2026 Your house is now worth nothing, because there\u2019s no jobs anymore. So you can\u2019t sell it. You can\u2019t sell up and move somewhere else. That\u2019s really hard. You can\u2019t sell your cheap house and move to a much more expensive house in a city somewhere else. Your kids are in school, as you\u2019re saying, et cetera. So what you see is people kind of get stuck, and there is no job of any comparable quality that they can do.</p><p>So on average, when you have these big plant closures, people do tend to go and get other jobs, but they often experience big wage declines, like 25% enduring wage decline. That\u2019s not nice. That\u2019s really horrible. That\u2019s a really horrible thing to happen to someone. And that happened to large numbers of people at the same time in these geographically concentrated ways. That\u2019s where things get bad. So if you\u2019re young in a city, you\u2019re kind of fine. If you\u2019re older, mid-career, older in a small town with a single employer, and that\u2019s the thing that gets automated: that\u2019s when things look much less rosy.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How long it took other game-changing technologies to have economy-wide effects</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> We can start by very quickly talking about what\u2019s the baseline \u2014 like, how long do these things take for other technologies that were as big as AI seems like it will be \u2014 and then we can talk about why might AI be different and what will be the same.</p><p>So the two big examples that are everyone\u2019s favourite are IT \u2014 computers in general \u2014 and then electricity. These are probably the two biggest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_technology\">general-purpose technologies</a> of the last certainly 150 years. So how long did they take? Well, there\u2019s an astonishing regularity in how long these things took. You can date the arrival of electrification to 1894, which is the time economists who study this tend to use \u2014 I think it\u2019s a couple of years after the first proper power station was built \u2014 and date IT to 1971. I\u2019m not sure why economists use that date; maybe it was when some IBM mainframe properly came online or something. Anyway, those are the dates people seem to use in economics.</p><p>And if you plot the x-axis as years following the arrival of IT or electrification, and then the y-axis is percent of adoption that\u2019s happened \u2014 so the 0% is no one has it; 100% is now everyone has it \u2014 it turns out those two lines sit exactly on top of each other. So IT diffused basically as fast as [electricity]. So surprising point number one is that these things that were 100 years apart almost took as long as each other, even though you might expect things to be moving faster later in history. And the second interesting fact is that it took a long time. So it took 30 years to get to 50% adoption.</p><p>One final quick interesting fact: If you think about all technology and capital in the economy \u2014 take the US, and think of every bit of factory equipment and every computer and everything you might think of broadly as technology, capital equipment type stuff. So in 1970, there was basically close enough to 0% of the capital stock consisted of software and computer equipment, hardware and software. In 1990, it had only got to about 2%. And then by 2000, it had gotten to 8%. So the real inflection is about 1995, if you look at the graph. The point is there were two and a half decades of actually very slow [growth]. Everyone thought, \u201cThis is it. We\u2019re here: IT era. Go!\u201d And yeah, 25 years later, nothing to see. And only after 30 years do you see a real increase. And even then, even in 2000, only 8% of the capital stock consisted of computer software and equipment.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. And was most of the thing happening in that early period the technology improving? Or was it just the technology being incorporated into the world, and the world catching up in various different ways took that long?</p><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> Very much both. Very much both. Think about technology in the 70\u2019s compared to 1990\u2019s, the IT was getting ever more user friendly, ever cheaper. You know, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\">Moore\u2019s law</a> was happening all through this time: so you wait a few years, it gets twice as fast and half as expensive. So that\u2019s happening. And people always wait a long time to get to the point where it\u2019s actually worth adopting. And it takes a long time for companies to adjust all their operations to make good use of this stuff, right? And we\u2019ll say more about that in a second when we think about LLMs.</p><p>Another example, actually: what is interesting is the automation of the telephone system. So do you remember seeing these photographs of generally women sitting in front of these huge panels and connecting calls, plugging different calls between different numbers? The automated version of that was invented in 1892. However, the number of human manual operators peaked in 1920 \u2014 30 years after this. At which point, AT&amp;T is like the monopoly provider of this, and is the largest employer in the US. They are the largest single employer in America, 30 years after they\u2019ve invented the complete automation of this thing that they\u2019re employing people to do. And the last person who is a manual switcher does not lose their job, as it were: that job doesn\u2019t stop existing until I think like 1980.</p><p>So <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8euzq5e8cphn9mr/OEOA_20230707.pdf?dl=0\">it takes 90 years</a> from the invention of full automation to the full adoption of it in a single company that\u2019s a monopoly provider. It can do what it wants, basically. And so the question perhaps you might have is why?</p><p>So the way it worked in the case of AT&amp;T was: there\u2019s a fixed cost of automating any particular telephone exchange. The exchanges are physically located in different places. The telephone exchange in a city is going to have thousands, hundreds of thousands of wires coming into it. So by switching that to automated, you save loads of humans. Whereas all these different exchanges in the middle of nowhere in much of rural areas, they might only have one human. You don\u2019t save much by switching, but the cost of doing all that change in the equipment is actually still really high. There\u2019s a huge fixed cost, and so you don\u2019t bother doing it until you really, really have to. If you look at the history of AT&amp;T, they started by automating these big cities and the very last thing to be switched over from human to automated was, I think it was on some island somewhere, like a tiny population. It was just like the last thing that was worth doing.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Ways LLMs might be similar to previous technologies</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> What will make AI similar to other technologies that have been kind of general-purpose, big game changers?</p><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> So I think there\u2019s two buckets: there\u2019s a \u201chumans are humans\u201d bucket, and then there\u2019s the government bucket. So let\u2019s start with the government bucket. The government bucket is basically regulation. So I put it as a broader bucket, just call it \u201ccollective action.\u201d Government is one kind of societal-wise collective action, but there are other things \u2014 like unions and professional bodies and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>So, here\u2019s a question: Do you think that in 10 years\u2019 time, you\u2019ll be able to just talk to a language model, and it will prescribe you a prescription-only medication, which you can then go and collect from a pharmacy? Do you think that would be legal? Because by the way, it\u2019s possible today. It\u2019s good enough. Basically we\u2019re there, right? You can do that already today. It\u2019s going to be good enough. Would it be legal?</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. As soon as I start thinking about it, I\u2019m like, there are a whole bunch of interest groups that are going to want that not to happen. There are some interest groups that are going to feel worried that it\u2019s going to make mistakes; there are interest groups that just want to be protecting the people in the jobs that are doing that now. So it seems at least plausible to me that people somewhere will decide that we shouldn\u2019t make it legal. Though I don\u2019t know. In 10 years, it also wouldn\u2019t surprise me, to be honest.</p><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> Right. You\u2019re absolutely right in the sense that there are these very powerful interest groups. So some of the areas that will be most affected by AI \u2014 that we all agree, I think, seem very likely to be able to \u2014 are things like what the doctors do and what the lawyers do. Doctors and lawyers, separately, have the most powerful lobby groups you can possibly imagine: the American Medical Association, the British Medical Association, and then for lawyers, it\u2019s the Bar, the Bar Council, the various solicitors\u2019 things. So here\u2019s one thing that happens: they do all of the kind of professional standards for that profession. They decide who gets to be a doctor, and they decide how many doctors get to be accredited as doctors every year, or lawyers, whatever. Right? If you just open a newspaper basically any day of the week, you will see how powerful doctors are.</p><p>And so regulation has always been something that is kind of regulation by the government / collective interest groups. So unions, whether they\u2019re blue collar unions or whether they\u2019re professional white collar workers \u2014 which sound like they\u2019re not unions, but they really are unions; they don\u2019t have the word union in the title, but they\u2019re definitely unions \u2014 they\u2019re very, very, very powerful. And so these really, really slow down all kinds of applications \u2014 possibly for good reasons a lot of the time. An open question for any given question is whether we should or shouldn\u2019t slow down the application, given the harms involved. But they are always going to argue for \u201cYou need the human completely in the loop, and we shouldn\u2019t change a thing, and we should keep our salaries the same\u201d and so on and so forth. So I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen in any particular case. But I think we can be extremely sure that there\u2019s a tonne of interest groups that are going to be pretty successful for a pretty long time in stopping things from changing faster than it\u2019s in their interests for them to change.</p><p>Then the other bucket of \u201chumans are humans\u201d in terms of the way they make decisions: So I talked about how LLMs could make it easier to retrain, but you still have to <i>want</i> to retrain, or do things differently in some way.</p><p>Think about teaching as an example: LLMs could completely change the way classrooms are run. And the teacher will spend much less of their time marking, and maybe lecturing, and more time doing one-to-one support, whatever it is. Maybe teachers want to do that, maybe they don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know. I imagine most of them would want to do that, actually. But one thing I\u2019m quite sure in saying is that there is no way the government will be able to force teachers to start adopting their software and using it in certain ways. The teacher is master of their classroom, right? There\u2019s been many examples of governments wanting to make teachers do things differently, and generally, it\u2019s very hard. Occasionally, I know with phonics in the UK, things can get trained in certain places \u2014 but in general, teachers\u2019 unions have a lot of power, and the government cannot control what happens in classrooms. And so that again applies in lots of different places. The stronger the union, the more it applies. But in general, humans don\u2019t like change for the most part. They like things the way they are.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Whether AI will be rolled out faster than government can regulate it</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> AI seems like it moves incredibly quickly. If we\u2019re going to get improvements to GPT-4 \u2014 that basically double from the ones that we got last year, in the next year \u2014 will there already just be really extreme impacts? And not just impacts, but adoption, that means that some of these regulatory effects just don\u2019t keep up, and so don\u2019t slow things down the way you might expect they would, or they have in other cases?</p><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> I think that the things we were talking about before \u2014 in terms of all the reasons that interest groups and lobby groups can slow things down \u2014 as I said, I think those very much apply here. And so even though the technology is moving really quickly, they will \u201ckeep up\u201d in terms of stopping it being used, right? However fast it\u2019s moving, you can always pass a bill to say no, right?</p><p>So the thing that I\u2019d be more worried about is the sharp end of capabilities \u2014 the things that you\u2019ve had <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/topic/world-problems/most-pressing-problems/artificial-intelligence/?content-type=podcast\">many guests on this podcast talk about</a> \u2014 as well as misuse and those kinds of things. That\u2019s where I\u2019d be more concerned about regulation keeping pace. Because there, it\u2019s not like you have to persuade lots of people in the world economy to adopt your thing and change their systems. All you need is just one bad person to have a very clever thing and to do bad stuff with it, right?</p><p>It\u2019s those kinds of things that you have to worry more about regulation moving fast enough. But even there, I\u2019m not an expert on the history of nuclear regulation, but I believe something like the following is true. At some point, someone convinced the US government, the US president, that nuclear was a really big deal, and it was possibly very dangerous. And with a single stroke of the pen \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether that was a presidential executive order or congressional legislation \u2014 but almost overnight, all research on nuclear anything was classified. So you\u2019re a researcher, you\u2019re just doing your PhD, sitting at home, doing some physics of whatever. Suddenly, from tomorrow, you doing any more work on that is illegal. The government can just do that, right? The US government can do that.</p><p>And you can imagine that if people do enough to convince governments that this stuff is really, really scary \u2014 in terms of the existential risk level of this \u2014 the government can be like, \u201cOK, you convinced me. As of now, we are classifying all research on AI.\u201d That could just happen tomorrow, and then all these companies would just shut down overnight. And that would be the law, and they couldn\u2019t do anything about it, end of story. That\u2019s a completely possible scenario, in terms of the powers governments have.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> So it\u2019s not that fast government action is impossible; it\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t happen that often. Sometimes it does happen suboptimally. It\u2019s too slow.</p><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> Always it happens suboptimally, right? It\u2019s obviously slow. Or it\u2019s too fast and it\u2019s too blunt. As I say, I\u2019m not an expert. I imagine there\u2019s stuff that was classified under the nuclear stuff that was completely reasonable to not be classified, and people should still be able to, but they couldn\u2019t. Maybe we\u2019d have much better nuclear energy today if that hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>So there\u2019s all kinds of ways in which any regulation is going to be very much not first best, second best, or at best, third best. And I think we\u2019re in a really scary place right now, because regulation, if it happens, could do a lot of good. It could do a lot of harm as well. And so we\u2019re going to have to tread very, very carefully.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Whether AI will cause mass unemployment in the long term</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. It feels both low and high to me. But it could be really high. It could be 50%; it could be 90%. At some point, we\u2019ll probably get to superhuman AI, and it can do all the tasks we can and more. But even 50% feels pretty different to what\u2019s happening now. And I\u2019m wondering if, at that point, any of these models will even apply? At that point, is the world just too different for this kind of conversation to be applicable?</p><p><strong>Michael Webb:</strong> Yeah. So I think I\u2019m going to stand up for economists here and say yes: the models do apply, all these considerations do apply. So let\u2019s think about the question: Wouldn\u2019t it be different if we\u2019re talking about 90% of jobs being automated? Let\u2019s go back to a place we started earlier in the conversation, thinking about agriculture in the US. In 1790, it was a true statement to say, \u201cIn the coming years, 90% of jobs will be fully automated.\u201d That\u2019s a true fact. That\u2019s in fact what happened.</p><p>That happened over a 100-, 150-, 200-year timeframe, and so the speed of this change is really important. But then don\u2019t forget \u2014 back to our talk about unions and the American Medical Association and politics and so on, not to mention all the rational decisions of company CEOs and so on \u2014 there\u2019s all kinds of forces that mean these things take a long time, even if in theory one could do lots of stuff quickly. There\u2019s also just these capital availability constraints and all kinds of things as well.</p><p>There\u2019s just not enough spare cash flowing around in the world for everyone to do that at the same time. Or there\u2019s not enough resources, because adopting technology requires all kinds of work to be done, and you can\u2019t just stop the entire economy whilst you retool everything.</p><p>People still want to eat food, and they still want to fly in planes, and whatever it is. You can\u2019t like down tools to say, \u201cNo, all we\u2019re doing for the next five years is switching everything over to LLMs.\u201d You can only take so many planks out of your boats and replace them while you\u2019re sailing in the water at the same time.</p><p>And so all these kinds of constraints I think are not obvious until you think about them. So that\u2019s point one: Even in a world with 90% of tasks automated, we have been there before. It happened. It happened lots of times. And we\u2019re still here, and things are fine, right? Things look quite different from 1790, but many things are still the same. In that sense, things can get weird, but there\u2019s still some sort of upper limit in how fast I think they will naturally get weird from an economic perspective.</p><p>That said, let\u2019s think about what happens when it is 90%, whether that comes in 100 years\u2019 time or whether it comes in 10 years\u2019 time. I think there\u2019s a few really important things here. So we generally are going around saying, \u201cGosh, what if it automated 90% of cognitive tasks?\u201d Big emphasis around the word \u201ccognitive.\u201d Many, many tasks in the economy are not cognitive tasks. And back to the old thing we\u2019ve been discussing all the way through: when you automate something, suddenly all the incentives go towards how do you make more value out of the stuff that is left that is not automated, or that humans can now do because they\u2019ve been freed up and they can do something else now. And I think there are many, many things that are not cognitive, that there\u2019ll be huge amounts of demand for humans to do.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "3NvLqcQPjBeBHDjz6", "title": "Perceived Moral Value of Animals and Cortical Neuron Count", "postedAt": "2023-08-25T14:52:34.728Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Publication note</h1><p>We initially drafted a writeup of these results in 2019, but decided against spending more time to finalize this draft for publication, given the large number of other projects we could counterfactually be working on, and given that our core results had already been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/01/update-to-partial-retraction-of-animal-value-and-neuron-number/\"><u>reported</u></a> (with permission) by Scott Alexander, which seemed to capture a large portion of the value of publishing.</p><p>We\u2019re now releasing a lightly edited version of our initial draft, by request, so that our full results can be cited. As such, this is a \u2018blog post\u2019, not a research report, meaning it was produced quickly and is not to Rethink Priorities\u2019 typical standards of substantiveness and careful checking for accuracy.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Scott Alexander reported the results of a small (n=50) experiment on a convenience sample of his Tumblr followers suggesting that the moral value assigned to animals of different species closely tracks their cortical neuron count (<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/26/cortical-neuron-number-matches-intuitive-perceptions-of-moral-value-across-animals/\"><u>Alexander, 2019a</u></a>). If true, this would be a striking finding suggesting that lay people\u2019s intuitions about the moral values of non-human animals are highly attuned to these animals\u2019 neurological characteristics. However, a small replication on Amazon Mechanical Turk (N=263) by a commenter called these findings into question by reporting very different results (<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/28/partial-retraction-of-post-on-animal-value-and-neural-number/\"><u>Alexander, 2019b</u></a>). We ran a larger study on MTurk (n=526) (reported in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/01/update-to-partial-retraction-of-animal-value-and-neuron-number/\"><u>Alexander, 2019c</u></a>)) seeking to explain these differences. We show how results in line with either of these two studies could be found based on different choices about how to analyze the data. However, we conclude that neither of these approaches are the most informative way to interpret the data. We present our own analyses showing that there is enormous variance in the moral value assigned to each animal, with large numbers of respondents assigning each animal equal value with humans or no moral value commensurable with humans, as well as many in between. We discuss implications of this and possible lines of future research.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Scott Alexander previously published the results of a small survey (n=50, recruited from Tumblr) asking individuals \u201cAbout how many [of different non-human animals] are equal in moral value to one adult human?\u201d (<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/26/cortical-neuron-number-matches-intuitive-perceptions-of-moral-value-across-animals/\"><u>Alexander, 2019a</u></a>)</p><p>A response that 1 animal of a given species was of the same moral value as 1 adult human, could be construed as assigning animals of this species and humans equal moral value. Conversely, a response that &gt;1 individuals of a given species were of the same moral value as 1 adult human, could be construed as suggesting that those animals have lower moral value than humans.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo9z10sgw5mf\"><sup><a href=\"#fno9z10sgw5mf\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In principle, this could also tell us how much moral value individuals intuitively assign to different non-human animals relative to each other (e.g. pigs vs cows).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg3n730yk6vd\"><sup><a href=\"#fng3n730yk6vd\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Alexander&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/26/cortical-neuron-number-matches-intuitive-perceptions-of-moral-value-across-animals/\"><u>reported</u></a> that the median value assigned by respondents to animals of different species seemed to track the cortical neuron count<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcai8icnkiow\"><sup><a href=\"#fncai8icnkiow\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/25/neurons-and-intelligence-a-birdbrained-perspective/\"><u>Alexander 2019d</u></a>) of these animals conspicuously closely (as shown in Figure 1) and closer than for other potential proxies for moral value, such as encephalization quotient.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3NvLqcQPjBeBHDjz6/bl1lh5qpkqflvytypg0k\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong><br>Reproduced figures from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/26/cortical-neuron-number-matches-intuitive-perceptions-of-moral-value-across-animals/\"><u>Alexander (2019a)</u></a></figcaption></figure><p>This apparent correlation between the moral value assigned to animals of different species and their cortical neuron count is particularly striking given that Alexander (<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/25/neurons-and-intelligence-a-birdbrained-perspective/\"><u>2019d</u></a>) had argued in a previous post that cortical neuron count, specifically, was strongly associated with animal intelligence.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5p44w8jlyli\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5p44w8jlyli\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thus it might seem that the intuitive moral value assigned to animals of different species was closely linked to the intelligence of the animals. If so this would potentially, as Alexander put it, add \u201cat least a little credibility\u201d to intuitive judgments about the moral value of non-human animals. At the very least it would seem to suggest that the moral value assigned to non-human animals was largely driven by a factor that many would think is potentially morally relevant and seemingly little distorted by other arbitrary factors across species. For example, one might predict that lay individuals would relatively over-value non-human animals like chimpanzees, based on their human-like appearance, while under-valuing animals which are raised for food (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167211424291\"><u>Bastian et al, 2012</u></a>), relative to the actual cognitive capacities or other morally relevant characteristics of these animals. Yet the seemingly very strong correlation between neuron count and moral value across these species, could be taken to suggest that such factors do not appear to have much of a distortive influence.&nbsp;</p><p>This finding was seriously called into question by an attempted replication by a commenter, \u2018Tibbar\u2019, reported on Alexander\u2019s post. Using a substantially larger (n=263 to Alexander\u2019s n=50) and likely more representative (Mechanical Turk workers rather than readers of Alexander\u2019s Tumblr page), Tibbar\u2019s survey finds significantly lower median values - i.e. the respondents assign much&nbsp;<i>higher</i> moral value to animals of those species than Alexander.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkmlga8n6dva\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkmlga8n6dva\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"3\">Table 1: Reported results from Alexander and Tibbar (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/26/cortical-neuron-number-matches-intuitive-perceptions-of-moral-value-across-animals/\"><u>Alexander, 2019a</u></a>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Alexander</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Tibbar</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Lobster</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">4000</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">60</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Chicken</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">500</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Cow</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">50</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">3</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Pig</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">35</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Elephant</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">7</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Chimpanzee</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">5</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Human</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><i>Note: Number = this many of &lt;animal&gt; is morally equivalent to one human</i></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As there were substantial differences between and limitations to these two studies, a number of different factors could explain these divergent results. As noted above, Alexander\u2019s study was based on an exceptionally small (only 50 people) convenience sample recruited via a post on Tumblr. Tibbar\u2019s was drawn from a larger sample (263) drawn from MTurk, which is more commonly used as a subject pool for research and has been well-validated (<a href=\"http://sjdm.org/~baron/journal/10/10630a/jdm10630a.pdf\"><u>Paolacci et al, 2010</u></a>, see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/a6LMQcER6Awhawtqq/using-amazon-s-mechanical-turk-for-animal-advocacy-studies\"><u>Hurford, 2016</u></a> for a review). However, one possible limitation of Tibbar\u2019s MTurk survey was that participants were offered a very low rate of reimbursement (~$1.20 per hour, around 5x lower than is typical for academic studies using the site), which may have lead to an unrepresentative sample of MTurkers being selected (those willing to work for much lower rates) or have lead to a less motivated and agreeable set of participants. As such, it is clear that neither survey was optimal from the point of view of getting reliable results.</p><p>There are two further important differences between the two surveys.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted, Alexander\u2019s sample was drawn from a post on Tumblr and as such was much more likely to select participants who, being followers of Scott Alexander\u2019s writings, were fairly familiar with rationalism, effective altruism and thus certain debates and points of view concerning animal consciousness and moral value. Notably, 80% of Alexander\u2019s participants responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question \u201cAre you familiar with work by Brian Tomasik, OneStepForAnimals, etc urging people to eat beef rather than chicken for moral reasons?\u201d. While we don\u2019t know that these respondents were familiar with Brian Tomasik\u2019s work, rather than more popular campaigns urging people to eat beef rather than chicken for moral reasons, this still seems likely to be a much higher rate than one would encounter in the general population. Moreover, 42% of Alexander\u2019s sample answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question \u201care you a vegetarian?\u201d, 30% \u201csort of\u201d vegetarian\u201d and only 28% answered \u201cno\u201d, indicating rates of vegetarianism that are several times higher than the general population (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/author/saulius-simcikas/\"><u>\u0160im\u010dikas, 2018</u></a>).</p><p>Given this, Alexander\u2019s survey might, perhaps, be better seen as examining the intuitions of a more select group of people who are relatively familiar with and sympathetic to certain moral arguments and positions than as a survey getting at the intuitions of a representative lay population.</p><p>Related to this, Alexander\u2019s survey explicitly aimed to exclude, at the outset, individuals who did not believe that \u201canimals have moral value which is in principle commensurable with the value of a human\u201d (such individuals would, of course, not be able to give a meaningful answer as to the number of animals that have equal moral value to one adult human). Notably, 86% of those who responded to the survey indicated that they&nbsp;<i>did</i> think that animals have a moral value which is in principle commensurable with the value of a human. Tibbar\u2019s survey, conversely, only asked \u201cdo you think animals have moral value?\u201d which is compatible with animals&nbsp;<i>not</i> having commensurable moral value with humans.&nbsp;</p><p>It is quite striking, therefore, that despite Alexander\u2019s sample likely being more familiar with arguments related to animal consciousness, EA and rationalism, the median moral value assigned to animals was significantly&nbsp;<i>lower</i> than in Tibbar\u2019s survey. Ultimately, as noted, given the limitations of these two surveys (centrally, low sample size and little information about the characteristics of respondents, such as demographics, which might have influenced responses) it is hard to infer what might have influenced these differences or to be confident about the results.</p><h1>Our Study</h1><p>Due to the limitations mentioned above, we ran our own study to explore these different results. For our own study we decided to run a larger sample, 500 people, using Mechanical Turk (US citizens only) and to gather basic information about demographics and vegetarian status.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref545tzpcldya\"><sup><a href=\"#fn545tzpcldya\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While there were a variety of other measures that we considered might have been informative, such as additional demographics and psychological measures (including attitudes to animals and other moral or political attitudes, we decided to keep additional measures to a minimum for this initial study in order to minimize costs (adding one moderately sized animal attitude scale to the 7 species questions would have doubled the length and thus the cost of the study, for example). We think that including further measures would be worthwhile in any future study.&nbsp;</p><p>Our study design was deliberately kept largely similar to Alexander\u2019s, however we chose to deviate in various details:</p><ul><li>We altered Alexander\u2019s wording \u201cAbout how many [animals] do you think are equal in moral value to one adult human?\u201d to \u201cWhat number of [animals] do you think is equal in moral value to one adult human?\u201d This was prompted by noticing in pre-testing that a number of individuals seemed to be responding with \u201cnone\u201d (or equivalent) as an answer, which would suggest that the animals in question had&nbsp;<i>infinitely</i> more moral value than an adult human, which seemed unlikely to be a common attitude. This suggested to us a possible misreading: \u201cHow many animals do you think are equal in moral value to one adult human?\u201d \u201cNone, because no animals have moral value commensurable with a human.\u201d This slight adjustment to wording seemed warranted in order to reduce the likelihood of this miscomprehension.</li><li>We added a question, with the same format as all the other animal moral value questions&nbsp;but with \u201chuman\u201d as the animal of comparison. We viewed this as serving as a potential comprehension or attention check on individuals\u2019 responses and individuals who failed to answer that \u20181\u2019 human was equivalent in value to one adult human were excluded from the analysis.&nbsp;</li><li>We added&nbsp; questions about the gender and country of residence of respondents (as the sample was set to allow only US residents this should have been 100%, and in fact all but 1 (0.19%) listed America), and a question about dietary restrictions to identify vegetarians or vegans (but with a less overt purpose than directly asking whether respondents were vegetarian in order to reduce demand effects).</li><li>The order in which different species were presented was randomized.</li><li>Most substantively, we decided, unlike in Alexander\u2019s study, not to explicitly exclude individuals who did not state prior to the study that they believed that animals had a moral value that was, in principle, commensurable with humans. There were several motivations for this decision. Firstly, whether individuals did not assign moral value to non-human animals seemed important data in itself. We wanted to know how many individuals would decline to assign any moral value to animals of various species, in a trade-off with humans. Without knowing this it would be difficult to infer much from the values specified in the study about the values endorsed by the wider population, as the moral values specified might be those only of an exceedingly small percentage of the population, with the vast majority assigning no value. In principle, allowing individuals to take the survey, but skip the main questions (as in the Alexander survey) should indicate the percentage who assign no commensurable moral value to non-human animals, however we thought there was likely value in asking individuals to respond to the question for specific animals anyway. Questions formulated abstractly versus concretely, have often been shown to elicit different responses, and so it seemed plausible that individuals might say that animals don\u2019t have a commensurable moral value to humans when asked abstractly, and yet be willing to specify a trade-off value for particular animals if asked directly. This would be quite plausible given that \u201canimals\u201d is a very heterogeneous category: thus people might say that \u201canimals\u201d do not have commensurable moral value with, for example, cows or pigs in mind, but grant that there is some number of chimpanzees that are equivalent in value to an adult human. Moreover, respondents committed to the view that no animals have commensurable moral value to a human, could respond by indicating that they did not believe any number of animals had equivalent moral value to one adult human for each of the species specified in our survey.&nbsp;</li><li>Relatedly, Alexander prompted individuals with the instructions that \u201cIf you believe this [that animals have moral value which is in principle commensurable with the value of a human] in general, but think some specific animal I ask about doesn't work this way, feel free to leave the question blank or put in \"99999\", which I will interpret as \"basically infinity.\" This seemed to risk confusing responses attempting to indicate&nbsp;<i>zero value</i> or&nbsp;<i>incommensurability&nbsp;</i>with a specific large value equal or higher than 99999. Instead, we instructed respondents to \u201cwrite your answer either in the form of a number or, if you do not think that any number of this kind of animal are equal in value to an adult human, write the&nbsp;<i>exact</i> words \"NO NUMBER\" without speech marks.\u201d As such, individuals who&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>reject the idea that any number of animals (of the species in question) were of the same value as an adult human, could indicate this directly. We also hoped that this would lead to respondents, where appropriate, considering whether they believed that some sufficiently large number of animals were equal in moral value to one adult human, or whether they believed that no such number was possible, and responding appropriate, rather than taking a lower cognitive effort approach of simply writing \u201c99999\u201d to indicate \u201cbasically infinity\u201d, which is indeterminate between the two.</li></ul><p>We aimed to recruit 500 participants from Mechanical Turk using the TurkPrime Platform (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0727-z\"><u>Litman et al, 2017</u></a>) (US residents only, universal exclude list, blocked duplicate IP addresses, block duplicate geolocations, block suspicious geocode locations, verifying worker country locations). Workers were paid $0.40, giving a median hourly rate of $8/hr. Due to a mismatch between TurkPrime and our survey software (TurkPrime did not accept the completion codes of some participants and thus recruited more, but their responses were nevertheless recorded by SurveyMonkey), in fact, 526 sets of responses were recorded.&nbsp;</p><p>While our study is, in some senses, akin to a replication attempt, given the differences between Alexander\u2019s and Tibbar\u2019s studies and their divergent results, we were, in fact, almost entirely unclear about what results we should predict. Moreover, for reasons outlined above, we were quite uncertain as to what the best approach would be to interpret these results, given that we had significant reservations about the informativeness of simply relying on the median moral value assigned to each species (as Alexander and Tibbar had done), and questions also remained about whether respondents would systematically miscomprehend the questions (which would be impossible to discern until after we saw our results). As such, we did not pre-register analyses for this study. A pre-registered confirmatory study would be needed before we could have more confidence in these results.</p><h1>Results</h1><h2>The Problem of Equivalence Refusals</h2><p>Before we get to the results of our study, it is worth discussing a significant complicating factor in analyzing data about these moral value \u2018equivalency\u2019 scores (i.e. how many animals of a given species are&nbsp;<i>equivalent</i> in moral value to one adult human). The problem is that individuals can&nbsp;<i>decline</i> to specify an equivalence value or explicitly state they do not think that there is one. For a good discussion of these issues see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COlUvsQa1wFxY7HOt12pK1YI-LgdnvsUJK8bdOg4dAg/edit#heading=h.674eag4eolwj\"><u>Althaus (2017, p61)</u></a>. These responses can\u2019t easily be included in an aggregate statistical analysis of the moral value assigned to animals of a specific species. It\u2019s unclear what the average value of \u20181\u2019, \u20183\u2019, \u20185\u2019, \u2018100\u2019 and \u2018no number of chickens has commensurable moral value to one adult human\u2019 would be.&nbsp;</p><p>In principle, we can still calculate the&nbsp;<i>median</i> value, including such responses. For example, in the set above, the median response would be \u20185\u2019. However, one implication of this approach is that where the&nbsp;<i>majority</i> of respondents refuse to specify a value (e.g. the responses were 1, 5, decline, decline, decline), then the \u2018median\u2019 response would be declining to specify a value. This is particularly a problem where declining to specify a value might be motivated by heterogeneous reasons: these respondents might think animals have no moral value, or that their value is simply incommensurable or people might even think that they have infinitely more value than humans, although it seems likely that variants on the first two options are more common.</p><p>One might think that one can simply exclude such responses when calculating the value for each species. In the original case above, therefore, one could simply report that the median value specified (of 1, 3, 5 and 100) was 4 and that 1 out of 5 responses (20%) declined to report a value. However, this approach leads to problems. The main problem is that different numbers of respondents might choose to specify a value across different species. As such, each comparison between different conditions would, in fact, be comparing (perhaps dramatically) different samples of subjects, with some subjects having selected themselves out of the sample, at different rates for each condition. Indeed, the more individuals select themselves out of the analysis by declining to specify an equivalence value, the more the aggregate statistics of those respondents who&nbsp;<i>do</i> state a value will reflect only a small group of respondents who&nbsp;<i>most</i> value the species in question. For example, if 95% of respondents do not think that any number of lobsters is commensurable in value to one adult human, then the median value of those remaining respondents will reflect only the views of the 5% of respondents who most value lobsters, whereas the median values for other animals may reflect the views of a much broader sample.&nbsp;</p><p>One might think that given these difficulties, this setup is just a silly method to use. One might be especially inclined to think this if you think that this is just an idiosyncratic method taken from SlateStarCodex\u2019s blog, which we are paying too much attention to. However, as noted in Althaus\u2019 discussion cited above, this method of eliciting judgments, and other methods which are potentially vulnerable to the same problem are widely used in a number of academic fields.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, within the EA community, the IDInsight Beneficiary Preferences study (<a href=\"https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/IDinsight/IDinsight_Beneficiary_Preferences_Final_Report_November_2019.pdf\"><u>Redfern et al, 2019</u></a>), which informed GiveWell\u2019s moral weights, faces the same issue. While intended to generate estimates of the monetary value of cash transfers that respondents would trade off against saving one life, many respondents&nbsp;<i>always</i> preferred to save the life no matter the amount of money and some&nbsp;<i>always</i> preferred the cash transfers. Across the full sample, comprised of respondents from two countries, almost half (46%) of respondents always preferred one or the other option, while in Ghana specifically,&nbsp;<i>most</i> respondents (52%) always preferred to save the life of a child, while a further 7% always preferred cash meaning about 60% declined to specify a trade-off value.</p><h2>Median Values</h2><p>Despite the limitations described above, we present the median values found in our study below, in order to compare to Alexander and Tibbar\u2019s results. We label the median values calculated based on including all responses with \u2018(inc)\u2019 and the median values based on excluding responses which declined to specify a value with \u2018(exc)\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that these are reproduced values based on our analysis of the data. This re-analysis produced different results than those reported by Tibbar, likely due to differences in recoding unusual responses (e.g., 1/2 to 0.5 rather than 1.5).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"7\"><strong>Table 2: Neuron ratio and reproduced median moral values by survey, including all responses with \u2018no number\u2019 responses&nbsp;

Alexander\u2019s study directed respondents who thought that animals have comparable moral value to humans in principle, but that for particular species \u201cit doesn\u2019t work that way\u201d to either leave the question blank or put in \u201c99999\u201d, which I will interpret as \u201cbasically infinity\u201d.\u201d Conversely, Tibbar\u2019s survey did not direct respondents to do this.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpdijrkmyoxg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpdijrkmyoxg\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; When we exclude respondents who seem to have taken Alexander\u2019s \u201cleave the question blank or put in \u201c99999\u201d\u201d option, we find much lower median values, similar to those in our data when we exclude respondents who declined to specify a trade-off value and similar to Tibbar\u2019s lower value.</p><p>While this seems to resolve the discrepancy<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2safrdj32w7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2safrdj32w7\">[9]</a></sup></span>, it still leaves the question of what, if anything, we should make of these median values. Looking only at the median values obscures a lot of information about the responses and may be misleading, so in the next section we consider alternative analyses.</p><h2>The Full Range of Responses</h2><p>As a first step, it makes sense to examine the distribution of responses. The variability in these numbers is&nbsp;<i>extremely</i> high<i>,&nbsp;</i>with many respondents specifying that the moral value of one animal was equal in moral value to one adult human, for most of the species in question, while many other respondents either stated that no number of animals of that species were equal in moral value to an adult human or specified extremely high numbers (the maximum values specified for each species ranged from 10E+15 to 10E+46).&nbsp;</p><p>Given this, displaying the distribution of responses in an informative manner is not straightforward. The plot below shows the distribution of the log-transformed values, for each species. This does not make it easy to visualize the&nbsp;<i>precise</i> values assigned to the animals by different numbers of people, but does display the general tendency for more people to assign low equivalence values (i.e. higher moral value) to the creatures towards the top of the graph (such as chimpanzees and elephants), the very high overlap in value assigned to different species and the exceptionally long tail.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img

the \u2018median\u2019 value as representative of the views of the sample would potentially be quite misleading. The number of respondents who are even vaguely close to the median value is, for many of these species, quite low. Notably, this table&nbsp;<i>underplays</i> the variation in individuals responses, by showing only each 10th percentile. For example, due to how extremely long-tailed the distribution is, the 70th-80th percentile for chimps ranges from people assigning chimps 1/50th the value of an adult human to people who assign chimps 1/4.06e7th the moral value commensurate of a human.</p><p>For each species there is a sizable (14.1-32.8%) of respondents who assign them&nbsp;<i>equal&nbsp;</i>value to humans, and a large share (18.3-31.6%) who think that there is&nbsp;<i>no number</i> of such animals that are of equivalent moral value to a single human.

In fact, the correlations are even higher than the correlations with the log-transformed neuron count, at least in our dataset and Alexander\u2019s. Given this, we think that the similarly very high correlations between the median moral value and neuron count should not be seen as suggesting a surprisingly high correspondence between the&nbsp;<i>specific</i> moral value assigned to animals and their cortical neuron count, because these correlations remain high even when the specific values are removed.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3NvLqcQPjBeBHDjz6/dl7cwfsdddnj3nhm5oda\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 5: </strong>Regression lines and correlations between log-transformed moral values and cortical neuron count ranking by dataset and inclusion/exclusion of \u2018no number\u2019 responses</figcaption></figure><p>As noted above, the focus on the median value assigned to each animal obscures the very large variability in responses.

While we have argued that the median values assigned to different animals are, at best, a limited indicator of the moral values that lay individuals assign to different animals, and that the correlation between these medians and the cortical neuron count of these animals is likely not particularly informative, the overall results may still tell us things of value.&nbsp;</p><p>These results do seem to show that there is wide variation in the moral value assigned to different non-human animals (at least using this paradigm). They also seem to suggest several sizeable sub-groups, who assign ~ zero moral value to different non-human animals, and one who assign ~ equal moral value to those non-human animals and adults humans and, in between, a contingent who assign some finite moral value (of widely varying degrees) to non-human animals, which they think is commensurable with that of humans.&nbsp;</p><p>As argued in this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aD3FsLYduRscNh5Pt/empathy-and-compassion-toward-other-species-decrease-with\"><u>previous post</u></a>, empirical evidence about laypeople\u2019s judgments about the moral value of animals may be important to EAs in a number of ways:</p><ul><li>We may give some weight to moral judgments of large numbers of individuals, with a broader set of moral views than the EA community, on the grounds of moral uncertainty or peer disagreement</li><li>We may think that identifying influences on moral judgment can highlight potential biases in our own judgments, and potentially offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phc3.12638\"><u>debunking arguments</u></a> against our own intuitions</li><li>Knowing individuals' views may be of practical relevance to our actions e.g. showing which animals the general public are highly sympathetic towards and which they are not, to suggest which campaigns would or would not likely be successful</li><li>Such studies can also highlight predictors of individuals caring more or less about non-human animals, which can be valuable for similar reasons.</li></ul><p>Other research from Rethink Priorities (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XG86pCgqTweFsQyrd/how-to-measure-capacity-for-welfare-and-moral-status\"><u>Schukraft, 2020</u></a>), has also discussed how surveys of views (whether of the general population or relevant experts) might (or might not) inform our holistic judgments about the moral weight to be assigned to different animals. More generally, the question of \u201chow can we make welfare comparisons across different kinds of animals\u201d remains on the Global Priorities Institute research agenda (<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/gpi-research-agenda.pdf\"><u>Greaves et al, 2019</u></a>) and such data may be relevant to settle such questions.</p><p>Identifying the existence of these different contingents and the fact that they each appear to be fairly large seems potentially practically significant. Knowing how many people assign animals equal or zero value compared to humans, or somewhere in between, might influence animal advocacy strategy alongside other approaches which try to classify people\u2019s attitudes (c.f.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/advocates-allies-adversaries-12-years-of-faunalytics-animal-tracker/\"><u>Faunalytics (2019)</u></a>, which clusters people into \u2018advocates\u2019, \u2018allies\u2019, \u2018adversaries\u2019 and \u2018neutrals\u2019). Better understanding people\u2019s fundamental moral views about the value of non-human animals seems a potentially important part of understanding how far individuals\u2019 more concrete animal attitudes can potentially be changed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrg11dt1qmgm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrg11dt1qmgm\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Identifying such sharply disagreeing clusters in the population may be more informative than trying to estimate the&nbsp;<i>average</i> moral views in the population in cases where there is radical disagreement between different views.&nbsp;</p><p>Further research aiming to identify such clusters could, of course, use a variety of different questions to try to examine whether individuals robustly assign different animals zero moral value, finite moral value commensurable with humans or equal moral value in different ways. Future research could also aim to identify different influences on or predictors of membership of these groupings (e.g. demographics or other moral attitudes). For example, we find a fairly consistent gender effect, with female respondents being more likely to indicate that animals have equal moral value to humans.</p><p>We also think that it is a potentially notable finding that although there are substantial differences in attitudes across different species (i.e. more people assign more value to chimps and elephants than chickens and lobsters) there are fairly sizeable contingents assigning both equal or zero value across each of these species of animal.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, while we have argued that the median value are, in principle, of limited use and these specific estimates are very uncertain<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefapx476j0uch\"><sup><a href=\"#fnapx476j0uch\">[15]</a></sup></span>, they are still potentially of use to compare EAs\u2019 own estimates to (e.g., see discussion&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LqS7thgawhsBhCQHJ/why-i-m-not-vegan?commentId=5demn98B54Hn6Qov5\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LqS7thgawhsBhCQHJ/why-i-m-not-vegan?commentId=BerhjRehkpzZs4iBN\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><h2>Future work</h2><p>If one were to pursue more research in this area, we believe that there are a variety of things that should be explored in future work.</p><p>Firstly, a number of different variations on this paradigm and alternative paradigms should be tested to compare results. For example, we anticipate that participants would likely give different responses were questions posed not in terms of the moral value of different species in the abstract, but in terms of concrete trade-offs, e.g., whether to save 1 human life or x animals. We would anticipate that this would likely lead to lower moral value being assigned to animals. Naturally there are theoretical, as well as methodological questions at play in considering which of these operationalizations are more appropriate and informative.&nbsp;</p><p>We also think that a wider variety of animals should be tested, which would serve as a more rigorous test of whether neuron count predicts moral value. This would also allow investigation of a wider variety of possible influences on ascribed moral value such as whether there are systematic differences between different broader categories of animals (e.g. fish, mammals, invertebrates).&nbsp;</p><p>Future surveys might also test how the animals are viewed on a variety of different characteristics, for example, how aesthetically pleasing, \u2018cute\u2019 or dangerous the animals are, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aD3FsLYduRscNh5Pt/empathy-and-compassion-toward-other-species-decrease-with\"><u>time since evolutionary divergence</u></a>. These could also assess the influence of other factors such as body size, EQ, whether the animal is eaten and longevity. Such surveys could also investigate perceived intelligence directly, since this might be related to the apparent relationship between neuron count and perceived moral value.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HfnebqujtDxtppyN5/rbpobtm5kq22rsautgkp\"></p><p><i>This research is a project of</i><a href=\"http://rethinkpriorities.org/\"><i> <u>Rethink Priorities</u></i></a><i>.</i> <i>This post was written by David Moss and Willem Sleegers.

It is possible that Tibbar\u2019s broader opening question, (\u201cdo you think animals have moral value\u201d) which was required to continue the survey, compared to Alexander\u2019s more specific instructions, lead to more respondents who would assign animals no moral value excluding themselves by not completing the survey, leading to higher ratings.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, you could also imagine that, since this was MTurk and participants needed to complete the survey to be&nbsp;<i>paid</i>, that respondents who do not ascribe moral value to non-human animals would tick the box and then might be expected to respond either with extremely high numbers (leading to the opposite results than we found) or perhaps just \u2018straight-lining\u2019 the survey with the lowest cognitive effort response of entering \u20181\u2019 every time or just with random numbers.

Fundamentally,&nbsp;<i>not</i> presenting respondents with the option to respond that they do not believe that any number of animals of a given species are of equivalent value to one adult human, is quite a large departure from the design of Alexander\u2019s survey or our replication, and so it is hard to predict what the possible consequences of this change might have been (as above, respondents might have responded by giving much&nbsp;<i>higher</i> values, or they might have been nudged, in conjunction with the \u201cdo you think animals have moral value\u201d question to respond with lower, clearly finite values.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn2safrdj32w7\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref2safrdj32w7\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Although the discrepancy might be increased further if the responses from participants in Alexander\u2019s dataset who skipped the questions are included as assigning very high moral value to each species.

Less effort has gone into developing a similar track for working directly on&nbsp;AI policy in the US.&nbsp;This is important because policymakers are increasingly asked to tackle the risks and challenges associated with this technology, but often lack access to the expertise needed to navigate this effectively. Bringing more qualified talent to&nbsp;work as congressional staffers, within a relevant executive agency, or in an influential DC think tank could mean directly supporting effective decision-making around AI regulation that promotes the public interest.</p><p>The idea for this project is to start&nbsp;<strong>a program that dramatically increases the number of talented AI-risk-minded students planning to enter a US policy career by helping them understand arguments about catastrophic risk from AI, how these career tracks can be impactful, and how to navigate related career decisions successfully</strong>. This program can also ensure a well-developed pipeline for encouraging students already interested in AI&nbsp; risk management careers to consider US policy roles.</p><p>This program could:</p><ul><li>Run events such as policy competitions or retreats that find and develop talented individuals who might be especially well-suited for US policy careers</li><li>Connect students with relevant information, mentors, and peers around AI&nbsp; risk management and US policy</li><li>Help establish an early career track around AI risk management policy, especially from a catastrophic risk lens, within universities</li><li>Do even more ambitious work that we have not considered yet!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>About the Role</strong></h2><p>We expect the Founder(s) of this initiative to collaborate with the Rethink Priorities team and significantly shape the direction of this project.

This post may not accurately represent Jan's thoughts. This post took approximately 3 hours to write.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>'Corrigible' is a word that is used in a lot of different ways in AI alignment. Here, we're using Eliezer Yudkowsky's framing from <a href=\"https://www.glowfic.com/posts/4582\">mad investor chaos and the woman of asmodeus </a>(a story about a lot of things, but also about alignment). In the story, there is a world with plans to create a limited AI if needed in an emergency, with as many safeguards as they have come up with at the time.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.glowfic.com/replies/1824440#reply-1824440\"><i>The</i></a><i> initial craft doesn't have to be literally perfect to work perfectly in the end, it just has to be good enough that its reflection and self-correction ends up in exactly the right final place.</i></p></blockquote><p>Eliezer asked if LessWrong could write a list of safeguards for a limited AI like this without his input. Eliezer's answer is available <a href=\"https://www.glowfic.com/replies/1824457#reply-1824457\">here</a>; this post is an explanation of Jan's answer. Jan notes that his answer was written in Eliezer's frame, not the frame he would normally think in.</p><p>We'll look at examples of five types of tool; those for reducing instrumental convergence and reducing unbounded rationality, 'traps', oversight methods, and interpretability methods.&nbsp;</p><h1>Five Types of Tool</h1><h2>Against Instrumental Convergence</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/instrumental-convergence\"><i>\"Instrumental convergence</i></a><i><strong> </strong>is the theorized tendency for most sufficiently intelligent agents to pursue potentially unbounded instrumental goals, such as self-preservation and resource acquisition</i>\".&nbsp;</p><p>Instrumental convergence precludes corrigibility. For instance, many theoretical agents will not allow their goal function to be changed, because this will reduce their ability to achieve their current goals. Additionally, pursuit of instrumental goals can break some of the other corrigibility methods. Preventing instrumental convergence is therefore key to achieving corrigibility. Jan outlines three tools that could be used to help prevent instrumental convergence: preventing resource acquisition, uncertainty about goals, and making the AI want to not exist in the future.</p><p>Resource acquisition can be disincentivized by using a mutual information measure between the AI and distant parts of the environment (e.g. an asteroid, parts of the opposite side of the earth, parts of the core of the earth). The term 'mutual information' refers to how easy it is to predict the state of one, given the state of the other. If the AI is taking actions that massively impact the state of these parts of the environment (e.g. blowing up the earth for raw metals, asteroid mining, etc.), it will be very easy to guess the state of these parts of the environment from perfect knowledge of the state of the AI. As the AI is penalised for high mutual information, actions that have large consequences are discouraged.</p><p>Jan suggests the AI should have uncertainty over its intended task, with a reasonable prior belief. This should incentivise the AI to do things like ask humans questions to clarify its goals. This concept is explored more in Stuart Russell's book <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nd692YfFGfZDh9Mwz/an-69-stuart-russell-s-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace\">Human Compatible</a>, though I'm not aware of any empirical work demonstrating AI with goal uncertainty.</p><p>Finally, we can make the AI <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUYvIAP3qQk\">not want to exist</a> in the future as a terminal goal. Making this sufficiently difficult without fulfilling the task will encourage the AI to complete the task in order to stop existing, by making this the safest/most likely path to non-existence.</p><h2>Against Unbounded Rationality</h2><p>Unbounded rationality is related to instrumental convergence; many agents will want to become more rational in order to better achieve their goals. Many agents will also have unbounded reward functions, where they get a theoretically unlimited amount of reward for fulfilling more of their reward function (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer\">making infinitely many paperclips</a>). Jan outlines three methods for limiting unbounded rationality: a penalty on reasoning, making <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/satisficer\">satisficers</a> rather than maximisers, and making <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/myopia\">myopic</a> agents.&nbsp;</p><p>To reduce the desire for increased intelligence, we can make the AI have some utility cost for any bit-flip that occurs in the system. This will cause the AI to have a penalty on how much reasoning it does, and have to balance the expected gains from more intelligence against the built-in utility cost. Jan suggests the cost function could be very small initially, but quickly get steeper as the amount of processing goes up. Jan suggests this works best in combination with other corrigibility mechanisms, but is fundamentally an attempt to keep the 'limited AI' actually <i>limited.&nbsp;</i></p><p>To demonstrate the value of satisficers (which have bounded goals, rather than unbounded goals), we'll use <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer\">the paperclip example</a>. An unbounded model, which gets increasing reward for more paperclips with no end into infinity, will be incentivised to destroy human civilisation to access resources that can be used to make paperclips. A satisficer \u2014 which gets more reward for each paperclip it collects up to 100 paperclips, but no additional reward for 101+ paperclips, will select randomly from actions which gain at least 100 paperclips (or &nbsp;select a policy with the maximal probability of attaining 100 stamps, which can still cause some risks). <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/11/29/new-paper-quantilizers/\">Here</a> is an example paper in this direction.</p><p>Finally, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/myopia\"><i>myopic</i></a><i> </i>means short-sighted. In the context of AI, it is used to refer to agents which have a strong 'discount factor'; future reward is much less important to them than proximal reward. This is an important alignment tool because it encourages AI to take the shortest possible path to its terminal rewards, reducing instrumental convergence and disincentivising e.g. taking time to increase its intelligence or gather many resources. In particular, this combined with the AI not wanting to exist in the future encourage the AI to complete its task quickly without taking over the whole world first.</p><h2>Traps</h2><p>We can use a number of 'traps' left in the environment or in the AI which disincentivise bad behaviour. These include tripwires, watchdogs, and uncertainty about the level of simulation.</p><p>Firstly, tripwire artifacts -- related to mutual information measures, if we can create high negative reward for changing the state of distant parts of the environment, and hide from the system which parts of the environment these are, then the AI will be incentivised to be 'low-impact' and avoid massively altering the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>We can also use watchdogs -- small, fast systems external to the agent which are trained to react quickly to out-of-distribution behaviour or certain specific bad or unexpected outcomes. This works best if the agent is uncertain how the watchdogs are set up.</p><p>Lastly, we can make the agent uncertain if it is in training or deployment. In this case, the agent is forced to behave in ways that it expects humans will find acceptable (or at worst, randomly defect<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lg4voqq4vTXiCJNQP/jan-kulveit-s-corrigibility-thoughts-distilled#fnkkfcqtdgyve\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>). This works best if the agent is also uncertain how many such simulated test runs occur (so it does not know how often it 'should' randomly defect), but may be practically difficult to achieve (how do you simulate reality well enough to fool a superintelligence?).&nbsp;</p><h2>Oversight</h2><p>Oversight can be used to encourage the AI to behave in ways that line up with human values. These include a human-approval model, value learning, a legal system model, and AI debate style red teaming of action plans.</p><p>First, we can train a model to imitate humans approving/disapproving of actions that the AI takes, and penalise the AI when this model expects that humans would disapprove of its plan. Similarly, we can train a model which <a href=\"https://ai-plans.com/post/2c1ac8da49ae\">estimates what humans will say about various ethical scenarios</a>, and penalise the agent when this model disapproves of its plan of action.<i> </i>We can also penalise the agent for breaking laws e.g. violating property rights, by training a model to define these.&nbsp;</p><p>Jan also suggests using <i>red-teaming</i> as a method of producing automated oversight. This means <a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/constitutional-ai-rlhf-on-steroids\">having multiple sub-parts with different goals</a>, like having one part plan how to produce text that fits the prompt, training another part to judge text on how harmless it is, and training the first one to get a good score as rated by the second. This can be done when training the AI, in addition to having an ethical model during deployment (as above).&nbsp;</p><h2>Interpretability</h2><p>Our final class of tools is interpretability tools. An AI is interpretable if humans are able to follow its internal logic, how it came to its decisions, what its current plan of action is, and what it expects the consequences of that plan to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Jan suggests two interpretability methods -- imposing strong incentives (in the reward function of the AI) for being highly modular, and having messaging between modules that is human-understandable. Jan also suggests training a separate 'translator' system that produces human-understandable explanations of what the system is doing. One promising direction towards this kind of tool is <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models\">OpenAIs work to automate interpretability by asking GPT-4 to interpret neurons in GPT-2</a>.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Although there's still a lot of technical work to be done on a number of these proposals (i.e. this isn't a complete solution for alignment), it does cut the problem into more manageable pieces, for many of which the groundwork can be (or is being) done today e.g. <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models\">OpenAIs work on interpretability</a>, <a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/constitutional-ai-rlhf-on-steroids\">constitutional AI</a>, etc.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "brook"}}, {"_id": "FfDu8HsNEzabqxKrs", "title": "[Linkpost] My moral view: Reducing suffering, \u2018how to be\u2019 as fundamental to morality, no positive value, cons of grand theory, and more - By Simon Knutsson", "postedAt": "2023-08-25T12:53:43.790Z", "htmlBody": "<p><span>The following are excerpts from a new essay by Simon Knutsson:</span></p><h2>Summary</h2><p>I explain parts of my moral view briefly. I also talk about some arguments for and against my view. The basics of my moral view include that one should focus on reducing severe suffering and behave well, and these basics get us pretty far in terms of how to act and be in real life.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>My moral view is suffering-focused in the sense that it emphasises the reduction of suffering and the like. My view might differ from other suffering-focused views in the following ways:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I do not pick or try to formulate an overarching moral theory. Instead, my moral view is intentionally fairly non-theoretical.</li><li>I think of ideas about how one should be, such as the idea that one should be considerate, as more primitive and fundamental to morality than some others seem to think of them. Many others agree that one should be like that, but perhaps for different reasons, such as that being like that has the best consequences.</li><li>My take on what should be reduced for its own sake is perhaps unusually pluralistic\u2014it is most important to reduce extreme suffering, but it also makes sense to reduce, for example, gruesome violence, ruined lives and life projects, and acts such as ignoring harms.</li><li>My view could be labelled a pitch-black philosophical pessimism located towards the end of a philosophical optimism\u2013pessimism spectrum. In my view, there is no positive value and no positive quality of life, and there are no positive experiences. An empty world is the best possible world, the world is terrible, and the future will almost certainly be appalling. (Of course, we should still try to make the world and the future less awful.)</li><li>I am sceptical of categorical notions such as \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018positive value\u2019, and I instead prefer comparative notions such as \u2018better\u2019 and \u2018worse\u2019.</li><li>I don\u2019t think much in terms of uncertainty about moral principles or evaluative judgments; rather, I tend to think in terms of to what extent I accept or agree with specific ideas about morality and value.</li></ul><p>I think that the following are some of the advantages of my moral view: By being light on theory, it avoids pitfalls that high-level moral theories can have. It also takes suffering seriously, is overall reasonable, and lacks implausible implications such as when a view recommends that a clearly immoral act should be carried out. And my moral view is quite action-guiding in real life. This talk about advantages may sound like academic niceties, but most of the points have great practical importance. For example, it is crucial to direct one\u2019s attention and efforts to those who are or will be extremely badly off.</p><h2>Disadvantages of overarching moral theories</h2><p>I don\u2019t identify as a particularist or antitheorist, but I doubt the importance of overarching moral theories, and at least some of them seem to have drawbacks. That is, it seems we can do without high-level moral theories, and the following are three disadvantages that high-level moral theories can have (a caveat is that some high-level theories might be innocuous, and almost all examples of disadvantages I have observed concern consequentialist moral theories).</p><p>The first disadvantage is when someone accepts a problematic implication of their favourite moral theory with the justification that \u201call moral theories have counterintuitive implications\u201d. The person holds that something is permissible even though one would normally think of it as immoral or even monstrous. But if all existing moral theories are so problematic, we need not choose any of them. Such acceptance of a theory\u2019s problematic implications might be due to mistakenly thinking there is a great need to pick one of the existing moral theories.</p><p>The second disadvantage is that some people seem to internalise the moral theory and come to view the immoral acts as appropriate and desirable, period, and act accordingly. In contrast, one may view the actions as merely undesirable prescriptions of the most promising but still unsatisfactory moral theory.</p><p>The third disadvantage is that some have passive, wavering stances and behaviour on plain moral issues seemingly at least in part because their moral theory does not prescribe the obvious answer. For example, it is very difficult to assess the overall consequences of some behaviour that is usually considered clearly immoral, and the consequentialist remains agnostic and passive.</p>", "user": {"username": "Alistair Webster"}}, {"_id": "pjTQxZL2hMNYo2Anv", "title": "Petition to end Elephant Cruelty", "postedAt": "2023-08-25T12:42:56.643Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi all, can I please kindly ask if you could support our efforts to put an end to the elephant cruelty by signing the below petition?</p><p>https://chng.it/FyDTnrxsRq</p><p>Thank you so much!&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Kesha"}}, {"_id": "ExpBagkng6QSqcN8d", "title": "A model-based approach to AI Existential Risk", "postedAt": "2023-08-25T10:44:14.277Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Polarisation hampers cooperation and progress towards understanding whether future AI poses an existential risk to humanity and how to reduce the risks of catastrophic outcomes.

Impact measurement, funding issues, and lack of diversity are common criticisms and should be taken into consideration as we work with others outside EA spaces towards a more inclusive and impactful community.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>The animal advocacy and EA communities have overlap in goals and values; however, there are still some perceptions and criticisms that create division. This discussion helped surface some of those issues, especially around impact measurement, funding allocation, and diversity issues, in a constructive manner.</li><li>\"Hard to measure\" but potentially high-impact interventions are funding-constrained, in part because their impact doesn\u2019t fit in traditional cost-effectiveness calculations.

Increasing diversity and inclusiveness will help underrepresented individuals feel more welcome. Mental health support and openness about pressures are other opportunities to help the movement\u2019s culture.</li><li>Continued dialogue between EA and animal advocates can strengthen our movements and collective impact.</li></ul><h3>Context</h3><p>On July 28, 2023, <a href=\"https://www.impactfulanimaladvocacy.org/\">Impactful Animal Advocacy</a> helped facilitate an EA meetup at the <a href=\"https://www.avasummit.com/losangeles\">Animal &amp; Vegan Advocacy (AVA) Summit</a>. One group\u2019s discussion topic was \u201ccriticisms of effective altruism.\u201d The conversation was started by first crowdsourcing all criticisms from the group, and then combining them into separate solution-oriented brainstorming discussions. Fundraising and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) became the main focuses of the conversation, and collectively, everyone agreed that I could take notes to share with the community. <strong>We are sharing main points of the external/adjacent views of EA here as feedback to those within the EA community. While we may agree with some points, they are not to be representative of our organisation.</strong></p><p>Criticisms came from people both outside and inside the EA movement. Our goal was to generate constructive ideas and next steps for improving the intersection of the effective altruism movement and animal advocacy space to work towards a more inclusive and impactful community.</p><h3>Criticisms</h3><p>Here are the discussion notes about criticisms and potential solutions by the attendees (please note none of them is attributed to a particular name or organisation):</p><blockquote><p>Fundraising</p><ul><li>It\u2019s very hard to fundraise for projects that can\u2019t be measured using EA cost-effectiveness tools (e.g. some community-building projects, like vegan outreach in the BIPOC community)<ul><li>Donors feel pressure to justify the cost-effectiveness of each project.<ul><li><i>\u201cIt would be great if we could agree on having a reserved % of our funds to go towards initiatives that can\u2019t be measured using normal cost-effectiveness analysis, e.g. 50% to go to normal cost-effective projects, and 50% to go towards \u201cunmeasurable\u201d but valuable projects.\u201d</i></li><li><i>\u201cJust because you can\u2019t measure something, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not effective\u201d.</i></li><li>Solution ideas:<ul><li>Allocating some resources to \u201cnon-measurable\u201d or hard-to-measure projects.</li><li>More research could be done to measure the \u201cimmeasurable.\u201d This is an opportunity for a project/group that can work on creating a way to put a value on these interventions, taking diversity, culture, and worldview differences into account. We recognize this will be challenging when trying to measure long-term timeframes and for future lives.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Organisations also feel it\u2019s very hard to fundraise for these potentially impactful but hard to measure projects. They feel that other projects that are more amenable to cost-effective interventions always get prioritised, and as a result, they are in a \u201cblind spot\u201d for funders and sometimes are forced to close because they are never funded.<ul><li>Solution ideas:<ul><li>More coordination between animal welfare funders to ensure that we don\u2019t neglect some potentially impactful projects because it doesn\u2019t fall into any of the funders\u2019 remit</li><li>Encouraging small and medium private funders to step in for projects that don\u2019t fall into the current funders\u2019 remit.</li><li>Learn from other social movements on how to fund such projects. Given that some EA funders participate in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/hits-based-giving/\">hits-based giving</a>\u201d (long term, high reward events with small probabilities), then there could be a similar approach for small middle-income countries. (e.g. this report from <a href=\"https://ayni.institute/fundingmovements/\">Ayni on Funding Social Movements</a> and also this article <a href=\"https://ssir.org/articles/entry/philanthropists_must_invest_in_an_ecology_of_change\">Philanthropists Must Invest in an Ecology of Change by Chloe Cockburn from Open Philanthropy.</a>)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>There is a lot of pressure for organisations to do what the funders want to fund, rather than the interventions that the advocates think are more impactful or what they have a comparative advantage for. At times, grantees are influenced to change their strategy to align with a funders\u2019 specific focus. Some funders are more involved than others, which makes it hard to run programmes because different funders want different things from interventions.<ul><li>Solution ideas:<ul><li>Separating an organization\u2019s mission from the individual funding opportunities, and intentionally noting situations that carry a risk of mission drift.</li><li>Creating a culture in the movement where we can push back against funder requests to change the mission or change aspects about the programme, especially if the funder doesn\u2019t have the same cultural and practical knowledge/experience as the group.</li><li>Share these notes to funders (aka this post\ud83d\ude09) and invite more funders to participate in open discussions in the future.</li><li>Encourage funders to be more hands-off and trusting that the organisation will deliver on the set goals.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Some animal advocates think that the EA movement has an implicit human focus. Animals as an EA cause area tends to have less interest than other causes, especially in the post-FTX funding situation. Animal charities struggle with fundraising and have limited funding sources.<ul><li>Solution idea: It seems like more work should be done to increase funding in the movement or at least draw attention to the fact that while other cause areas grow, animal advocacy lacks support and talent.</li></ul></li><li>EAs should take seriously the criticisms levied against <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/price-taste-and-convenience-competitive-plant-based-meat-would-not-currently-replace-meat\">alt</a> <a href=\"https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-plant-based-meat\">proteins</a> (as well as corporate commitment campaigns). Before we put a lot of money into alt proteins, we need to take those criticisms seriously and respond to them.</li><li>By focusing so much on specific measures of cost-effectiveness, there is less focus on organisational health.</li></ul><p>DEI in the movement</p><ul><li>People who don\u2019t identify with the EA label don\u2019t always feel welcome at EA-branded events &amp; meetings, like the EA meet-up at AVA and EAG conferences. A couple of people who participated in the group discussion said they almost didn\u2019t attend the meet-up because they don\u2019t identify as EA, but in the end, were glad they attended.<ul><li>Solution ideas: Events could explicitly state that non-EA-identified individuals are welcome. Alternatively, they could avoid using the EA label.</li></ul></li><li>Newbies in EA struggle to adapt because of a high bar for excellence and jargon. The environment isn\u2019t as welcoming of criticism as some advocates would have liked. As a result, some people leave the movement early and don\u2019t even have a chance to criticise us or realize that criticism is healthy and welcomed in EA. As a result of fewer newbies, we are in an echo chamber or a bubble of our own existing beliefs while we really should welcome new people from outside the movement with new fresh perspectives.<ul><li>Solution ideas: when hosting meet-ups, invite non-EAs. When hiring, consider if extensive EA knowledge is required for the specific role.</li></ul></li><li>EA culture focuses on cost-effectiveness, excellence in your job, and being the most productive you can be. While this can be effective, some people find it adds a lot of pressure onto them, and they sometimes feel uncertain about their work and life, leading them to doubt whether their work is valuable (while objectively it is). This is a bit of a taboo conversation, which means many advocates suffer in silence.<ul><li>Solution ideas: while striving to help animals the best we can, we should prioritize our mental health. Burnout and dropout are terrible for helping animals. More mental health support is needed \u2014 perhaps even a cause-area-specific community health team.</li><li>We can also be more open about the pressure to normalise this conversation.</li></ul></li><li>Most EA content is in English only. Still, insufficient effort is being made to translate materials and make participation in EA events of non-English speakers easy.<ul><li>Solution idea: continue funding translations of more materials. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CqYHPLCJaFdLn8gp6/open-phil-is-seeking-bilingual-people-to-help-translate-ea\">Open Philanthropy</a> does it to an extent.</li></ul></li><li>EA is disproportionately white and male, resulting in people from other underrepresented groups feeling less welcome to join.<ul><li>Solution idea: EA groups could consider attending events from outside the movement to attract diverse group members and promote EA ideas outside of the movement</li></ul></li><li>EA programmes in universities can be impactful. However, they also contribute to a culture where people with already a lot of privilege have an even greater advantage getting jobs within the EA movement.<ul><li>Solution idea: Consider outreach outside of universities. Similar programmes, specifically targeting underprivileged people, could help address the knowledge and experience gap.</li></ul></li><li>Human justice isn\u2019t a priority in EA</li><li>Vegan outreach among BIPOC community isn\u2019t deemed as priority. This is because it's seen as not cost-effective, even though it's BIPOC folks who seem to be shifting the needle on veganism at a higher rate than any other community. EAs perhaps need to broaden their definition of \"effectiveness\" and move beyond just cost-effectiveness/ROI calculations.</li></ul></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Special thanks to everyone who reviewed this in advance.

Yet, dietary change can be challenging. Factors such as habit, familiarity, taste preferences, food availability, cooking skills, social context, and cultural traditions can all pull against the adoption of a new diet&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paperpile.com/c/QEKAad/0Ts3+MlH3\">(</a><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iukeBPYNhKcddfFki/price-taste-and-convenience-competitive-plant-based-meat\">Peacock, 2023</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092422441830606X\">Gra\u00e7a et al., 2019</a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M19-1326\">Valli et al., 2019</a>). Determining what methods are most effective for encouraging more plant-based diets may help guide advocates and change minds, ultimately reducing animal suffering and increasing food system sustainability.</p><p>A growing body of literature is examining the question of what works to reduce animal-product consumption. Several systematic reviews (e.g., <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12966-018-0729-6\">Bianchi et al., 2018a</a>; <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30188-8/fulltext\">Bianchi et al., 2018b</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092422441830606X\">Gra\u00e7a et al., 2019</a>) have collated experimental evidence for dietary change interventions. In experimental studies, the experimenters administer an intervention (e.g., education about environmental consequences of meat consumption), and evaluate how this affects a particular outcome (e.g., self-reported meat consumption). Despite generally having high internal validity, these study designs often have limited external validity because they test efficacy under ideal circumstances that are unlikely to be present in real-world situations. Furthermore, such studies often test different interventions in isolation and in different contexts, posing difficulties for the comparison of effects across interventions.&nbsp;</p><p>An alternative approach is to examine what works retrospectively. That is, to ask: why did current vegetarians and vegans make that dietary change? Although previous work has examined this topic, most of it has been through informal surveys hosted on blogs (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304141940/http://thetwovegans.com:80/2016/02/11/vegan-survey-some-statistics-about-our-community/\"><u>The Two Vegans, 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thevegantruth.blogspot.com/2013/09/survey-of-vegans-2013-results_13.html\"><u>The Vegan Truth, 2013</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vomadlife.com/blogs/news/why-people-go-vegan-2019-global-survey-results\"><u>VOMAD, 2018</u></a>). This recruitment method can lead to biased samples (e.g., toward individuals who are particularly engaged in veganism and willing to answer questions about it without reimbursement). Other limitations of the prior surveys include having incomplete response options (e.g., assessing animal welfare motivations for going vegan but not health or environmental reasons:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thevegantruth.blogspot.com/2013/09/survey-of-vegans-2013-results_13.html\"><u>The Vegan Truth, 2013</u></a>), assessing first but not main influences on dietary change, and not asking about the relative importance of different influences. Despite these limitations, this initial research suggests that personal connections and educational films or documentaries are some of the more important influences (<a href=\"https://vomadlife.com/blogs/news/why-people-go-vegan-2019-global-survey-results\"><u>VOMAD,2018</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thevegantruth.blogspot.com/2013/09/survey-of-vegans-2013-results_13.html\"><u>The Vegan Truth, 2013</u></a>).</p><p>The aim of this project was to provide a more comprehensive, systematic survey of what influences people to adopt vegan or vegetarian diets. We will consider both motivating reasons (e.g., health, environmental, animal welfare) and methods/media (e.g., books, documentaries, social media, leafleting).</p><h1>Method</h1><h2>Participants and Procedure</h2><p>We sampled 1028 US respondents from Prolific.co, an online platform where people are recruited and paid to complete surveys. Survey recruitment was limited to those who had selected \u201cVegetarian Diet (you refrain from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, insects and the flesh of any other animal)\u201d or \u201cVegan Diet (you refrain from eating any animal products)\u201d, or selected \u201cVegetarian\u201d or \u201cVegan\u201d on previous Prolific screeners, though respondents would not be aware of these recruitment criteria when entering the survey. Respondents were paid \u00a31.56 for a median hourly rate of \u00a310.80. Our survey was advertised to participants on the platform as \u201cA survey about behaviour and attitudes\u201d, with additional descriptive information: \u201cIn this study you will be asked about which foods you eat, what influences your decisions and demographic information. The average time taken to complete this survey when previously run was approximately 10-12 minutes\u201d. The survey was live on 16/12/2019 between 14:44 PM and 22:48 PM.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Respondents were excluded if they did not currently follow a vegetarian or vegan diet (<i>n&nbsp;</i>= 178). They were also excluded if they reported being vegetarian or vegan for over a year, but ate meat in the past three months (an additional&nbsp;<i>n&nbsp;</i>= 108). Participants indicating that their sex was other or missing were excluded (an additional&nbsp;<i>n</i> = 25), as analyses involving sex could not provide meaningful parameter estimates for such a small cluster of participants.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7se1sy5dy5v\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7se1sy5dy5v\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Participants were also excluded for implausible years of adoption or uninterpretable responses on this question (a final further&nbsp;<i>n</i> = 12), leaving an N of 705.</p><h2>Survey items</h2><p>Survey items were developed to understand what methods influenced participants to go vegetarian or vegan (including the first influence, main influence, and importance of influences), reasons participants went vegetarian or vegan (e.g., health, environmental, animal welfare), and relevant demographics. The full list of survey items can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ef5bkm6k4kSs4WW5y5hBpOYm1hn4-Atv/view?usp=drive_link\"><u>here</u></a>. Key questions for the present analyses were: Reported source that first got respondent interested in a vegetarian or vegan diet, Ratings of the importance of different sources, Reported exposure to different sources, Ratings of importance of reasons for becoming vegetarian or vegan, as well as covariates: Age, Time on diet, Gender, and Type of diet.</p><h1>Results</h1><h2>First influences on becoming vegetarian or vegan</h2><h3>Raw outcomes</h3><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/uytmtxhateftwlvlieia\"></p><p>Personal connections/conversations were overwhelmingly endorsed as a first influence on becoming vegan or vegetarian. Collectively, interactions with animals (whether companion animals, farm animals, or other animal experiences) were also frequently endorsed, summing to approximately 20% of respondents.&nbsp; Documentaries and online videos were the next most frequently noted sources. The respondent-defined \u2018other\u2019 category was also highly rated (numerous respondents noted, for example, simply not liking the taste or texture of meat).</p><h3>Regression model</h3><p>To understand what factors might relate to selecting a source as a first influence, we analyzed respondents\u2019 reports of first influences using multinomial regression, with outcomes predicted by Age, Duration of Diet, Type of Diet (Vegetarian vs. Vegan), and Gender (Women vs. Men).&nbsp; For these analyses, we collapsed the three separate animal interaction categories (\u2018interaction with [<i>companion/farm/non-farm</i>] animals\u2019) into a single animal interaction category, as participants\u2019 descriptions of what they meant by these different categories suggested that they did not entirely differentiate them (e.g., many people noted experiences with both farmed and companion animals when referring to the final \u2018non-farm\u2019 animal category). In addition, to prevent issues with estimating probabilities for very low likelihood sources, we generated an overarching \u2018other\u2019 category to encompass influences that were were reported by less than 2.5% of the respondents overall, yielding a total of six sources of influence: Personal conversation, Animal interaction, Documentary, Online video, Social media, and Other.</p><p>In multinomial regression, direct parameter estimates from the model are not readily interpretable, as they always refer to some outcome or predictor relative to a reference category (e.g., everything relative to the likelihood of \u2018Documentary\u2019 being selected) - which in this case would be arbitrary. Hence, to convey the results of the regression we present expected proportions of people picking each outcome, while varying the predictor of interest. In the plots below, the estimates are generated with one predictor varying, and then the other predictors held at a constant: so, unless explicitly varied, gender would be the average of men and women, diet would be the average of vegetarians and vegans, age would be 30 (approximately the sample median), and years on diet would be 10 years (also approximately the median in the sample).</p><p>Based on the regression analysis, there appear to be several differences in the likelihood of selecting different influences as a function of diet and time on the diet, and some probable associations with gender, relatively little association with age.&nbsp;</p><p>Comparing Vegetarian with Vegan respondents, Vegans were approximately 2.9 times more likely to note social media as a first influence, 2.7 times more likely to note Online videos as a first influence, and 1.6 times more likely to pick Documentary. Vegetarian respondents tended to be more likely to select Animal interactions and Other sources of influence.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/sf4nkeluhysjnt0qwesq\"></figure><p>Comparing across genders, men were 1.5 times more likely to report Personal conversation as a first influence than women. In contrast, women tended to report Animal interactions and Documentaries as more likely sources of influence.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/qzkyydczc1xetrmvucym\"></figure><p>Time on a vegan/vegetarian diet was associated with the likelihood of selecting every separate outcome. Comparing the estimates of those on their diet for 5 vs. 15 years, more recent adopters were 3.5 times more likely to select Social media, 2.5 times more likely to select Online videos, and 1.9 times more likely to select Documentary. Conversely, those adopting their diet 15 years ago were 1.2 times more likely to select Animal interaction, 1.1 times more likely to select Personal conversation, and 1.3 times more likely to select Other. Hence, it would appear that with increasingly recent adoption of vegetarian or vegan diets, different sources of influence are rising to prominence: Documentaries and a range of online sources such as videos and social media are taking up an increasing share of \u2018first influence\u2019 space in more recent years.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/cirdylmjsf0ba1k3kg1k\"></figure><p>For age, estimates for differences tended to be small or did not reliably tend in one direction or another. However, there was a tendency for Social media to be selected less frequently by those of higher ages.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/oshjhh7qpxas3ehypnxc\"></figure><h2>Importance of different sources on becoming vegan or vegetarian</h2><h3>Raw ratings</h3><p>Respondents were also asked to rate how important they thought each influence was on their decision to become vegetarian or vegan, from 1 (not an influence at all) to 5 (extremely important influence). The data presented in this section focuses only on those participants who reported having encountered the respective source.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/bs0sajgvq29xtzjlkeqw\"></p><p>It can be seen that there was substantial variation in the importance attributed to different sources (pairwise comparisons among sources are presented in Appendix section A). Moreover, for three quarters of the different sources, at least half the respondents reported them not being an influence at all. Personal conversation was not only the most likely to be selected as a first influence, but also received the highest average rating of importance if it was encountered. Interactions with animals were also given relatively high ratings, as were documentaries and online videos. The trend of ratings of the most influential sources largely mirrors the chances of items being picked as a first influence, with the correlation between mean rating across the sample and the log10 transformed percentage of respondents picking the item as a first influence at .94.<br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/th9g3whv30tbzbsbx4bt\"></p><h3>Regression model</h3><p>To understand what factors might relate to ratings of importance, we analyzed importance ratings using a multiple regression model, again including gender, diet, age, and time on diet as predictors. The figure below presents parameter estimates for each predictor variable (the Time veg_n<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrdaysjzawb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrdaysjzawb\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;parameter estimate represents a change in duration of 5 years, and the Age parameter represents a change in age of 10 years). Some notable trends stand out: men tended to rate several sources as less influential than did women, including all Animal interaction items, Social media, and vegan websites. There weren\u2019t any sources that men reliably rated as more influential than women (for which the 95% HDI for the item excluded no effect), although men did tend to rate Personal conversations as more influential. Vegans rated Documentaries, Online videos, Social media, and Books are more influential than did Vegetarians. Similarly to trends in the likelihood of reporting them as first influences, those with more time on a vegetarian/vegan diet rated Online videos, Social media, and Documentaries as less influential. Having more time on a vegetarian/vegan diet was also associated with providing higher ratings for the influence of each of the Animal interaction items.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/cp9pktvvejqc3ulxlipn\"></p><h1>Overarching motivations for becoming vegan or vegetarian</h1><h2>Raw ratings</h2><p>Only a minority of respondents indicated that either their upbringing or religious beliefs were at all influential for them in taking up a vegetarian or vegan diet, although 7% still indicated that their upbringing was an extremely strong influence. Still, by far the most endorsed reasons were animal welfare concerns, which 73% indicated were extremely important for them. Though not as highly endorsed as animal welfare reasons, both environmental and health reasons were much more endorsed that upbringing or religious beliefs, which had at least some influence for most respondents.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/easvhbymok4zainhcmli\"></p><h2>Regression model</h2><p>As with previous analysis, we conducted a multiple regression, with gender, diet, age, and time on diet as predictors. Parameter estimates for each predictor variable are shown below (the Time veg_n parameter estimate represents a change in duration of 5 years, and the Age parameter represents a change in age of 10 years).&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oWLT2L2ToxsNtKKnC/ubgeq0rukkeyscrnxap2\"></p><p>Upbringing and religion were reported as being more influential among those who had taken up their diet longer ago - understandable given the typically early influence of religious beliefs, and age requirements for the survey meaning that these respondents would have likely been on their diet for a relatively long time.</p><p>Perhaps of greater interest, we observed that adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet more recently was associated with higher endorsement of environmental and health concerns. Furthermore, relative to vegetarians, vegans reported greater endorsement of animal welfare/moral concerns, environmental, and health concerns. Older respondents also reported higher levels of endorsement of health-related reasons, perhaps reflecting increasing concern over one\u2019s health with age, which can produce lifestyle changes. Finally, relative to women, men reported substantially less agreement with animal welfare related concerns as being a reason for them.</p><h1>Discussion</h1><p>By focusing on a less highly selected population of respondents than has been used in much previous research - those on a recruitment platform who merely happen to be vegetarian or vegan, rather than those affiliated with specific vegan websites/groups - this research aimed to advance our understanding of sources of influence and reasons for adopting vegetarian and vegan diets.</p><p>Similarly to previous research, we found that personal conversations/connections were a particularly important source of influence in adopting vegan or vegetarian diets, as were documentaries, being both the most cited first influence and the most highly rated influence in terms of importance. We also found that documentaries and interactions with animals rank highly among sources. Some sources of influence that have only become possible or prominent over the last decade - such as online videos and social media - were also noted as important sources. Having adopted a vegan/vegetarian diet more recently was associated with greater importance attributed to documentaries, online videos, and social media, as well as a greater likelihood of these being a first influence, indicating the increasing importance of these sources in the contemporary media ecosystem. While this observation may seem obvious, in that people who took up their diet before the prominence of social media and online video sharing simply could not have been influenced by them, the mere existence of these sources of influence does not necessitate that people attribute importance to them. We specifically found that people&nbsp;<i>do</i> ascribe considerable importance to these sources, and to a higher degree than they do to many more traditional sources such as books, TV, and activists.</p><p>Of further interest, we found that there were differences among sources of influence depending on the diet that respondents followed. Vegan respondents reported more importance to these same contemporary sources: social media, online videos, and documentaries than did vegetarians. One possibility is that advocacy via these channels might take on a more all-or-nothing stance with respect to diet than would be possible for a vegetarian advocate, so as to be more engaging and provocative, or simply that those advocates which have such stances are more engaging and generate more virulent content, such that those influenced by these sources tend towards adopting veganism.</p><p>Among reasons for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, concerns over animal welfare were the most highly rated in terms of importance, although environmental and personal health concerns were also received quite high ratings of importance. Environmental and health concerns were found to be of increasing importance among those adopting their diet more recently, which may reflect increasing awareness of and advocacy regarding possible health benefits of plant-based diets, as well as increasing concerns over anthropogenic climate change. While concerns over animal welfare should not be ignored and remained first and foremost among respondents\u2019 reasons, the findings highlight that there may be multiple points of leverage in advocating for the adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet other than direct concern for animals, and it is likely that different arguments will appeal more or less to different audiences. As just two examples, we found that older age was associated with increasing importance being attributed to health-related concerns, whereas being a man was associated with giving lower ratings to the importance of animal welfare concerns.</p><h2>Limitations</h2><p>Although we believe our sample is likely to be less skewed than in research that has specifically recruited via blogs or through advocacy groups, we remain unsure as to the representativeness of the sample with respect to the total population of vegetarians and vegans. The sample was also restricted to US respondents, and so even if representative of vegetarians and vegans in the US, the findings may not generalize to other areas of the world.</p><p>Our conclusions are also limited by the self-report nature of all the outcome variables, which may be susceptible not only to misrepresentation or social desirability effects, but also to lapses of memory and errors of attribution. For example, people may misremember their first influence if the first influence did not stand out as important in their minds, and they may also fail to remember having been exposed to influences that were not important to them. Social psychological research also suggests that people may engage in post-hoc rationalization of their reasons for taking particular ethical stances and are not always aware of the drivers of their behavior (<a href=\"http://www.fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036\"><u>Haidt, 2001</u></a>). Hence, it is possible that a host of reasons and influences besides those we asked about, or which were endorsed, may also play roles in the adoption of vegan and vegetarian diets.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Although there are many barriers to dietary change, people can and do make shifts to adopt vegan and vegetarian diets. Our findings suggest that ethical reasons - mostly animal welfare and secondarily environmental concerns - and health related concerns are prominent reasons that people do so. The greatest sources of influence tend to be personal interactions, as well as interactions with animals, and the importance attributed to social media, online videos, and documentaries is also high, particularly among more recent adopters of vegetarian and vegan diets.</p><p>Drawing insights from empirical research can help generate insights into effective approaches to animal advocacy, and multiple avenues for future research in this domain remain. Surveying a representative sample of the general population regarding their exposure to different sources and its association with dietary choices may help further elucidate the relative reach and influence of different sources. Conceptually replicating and extending the present research with a more recent sample, and possibly focusing more selectively on more recent adopters of vegan and vegetarian diets, may also provide more actionable insights for advocates deciding upon optimal approaches to break through in the contemporary media landscape.</p><h1>Appendix</h1><h2>A.

In other words, that is, we have no affirmative reason to believe that every conceivable amount of suffering or pleasure is ethically congruent to some real finite number, such as -2 for a papercut or -2B for a week of torture.&nbsp;</p><p>While two states of the world must be <i>ordinally</i> comparable, and thus representable by a utility function, to the best of my knowledge there is no logical or mathematical argument that \u201cunits\u201d of utility exist in some meaningful way and thus imply that the <i>ordinal </i>utility function representing total hedonic utilitarianism is just a mathematical rephrasing of <i>cardinal</i>, finite \u201camounts\u201d of utility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mnS2WYLCGJP2kQkRn/absence-of-evidence-is-evidence-of-absence\">Absence of evidence may be evidence of absence</a> in this case, but it certainly isn\u2019t <i>proof. </i>Perhaps hedonic states really <i>are</i> cardinally representable, with each state of the world being placed somewhere on the number line of units of moral value; I wouldn\u2019t be shocked.

He thinks inflicting suffering that wouldn't otherwise exist cannot always be outweighed.</li><li>Aaron argues we should be skeptical of the default view that suffering can always be offset by happiness. In the absence of affirmative arguments for offsetability, we should use the heuristic of asking if a perfectly rational being would choose to undergo the suffering for happiness.

However much pleasure you can create, it's just not going to outweigh the fact that you inflicted that much suffering on some people.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, and I'd highlight the word inflicted. If something's already there and you can't do anything about it, that's kind of neither here nor there as it pertains to your actions. So it's really about you increasing, you creating suffering that wouldn't have otherwise been created. Yeah. It's also been a couple of months since I've thought about this in extreme detail, although I thought about it quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Maybe I should say my contrary view, I guess, when you say that, I don't know, does total utilitarianism imply something or not? I'm like, well, presumably it depends on what we mean by total utilitarianism. Right. So setting that aside, I think that thesis is probably false. I think that yeah. You can offset great amounts of suffering with great amounts of pleasure, even for arbitrary amounts of suffering.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay. I do think that position is like the much more common and even, I'd say default view. Do you agree with that? It's sort of like the implicit position of people who are of self described total utilitarians who haven't thought a ton about this particular question.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, I think it's probably the implicit default. I think it's the implicit default in ethical theory or something. I think that in practice, when you're being a utilitarian, I don't know, normally, if you're trying to be a utilitarian and you see yourself inflicting a large amount of suffering, I don't know. I do think there's some instinct to be like, is there any way we can get around this?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, for sure. And to be clear, I don't think this would look like a thought experiment. I think what it looks like in practice and also I will throw in caveats as I see necessary, but I think what it looks like in practice is like, spreading either wild animals or humans or even sentient digital life through the universe. That's in a non s-risky way, but that's still just maybe like, say, making the earth, making multiple copies of humanity or something like that. That would be an example that's probably not like an example of what an example of creating suffering would be. For example, just creating another duplicate of earth.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Anything that would be like so much suffering that we shouldn't even the pleasures of earth outweighs.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Not necessarily, which is kind of a cop out. But my inclination is that if you include wild animals, the answer is yes. But I'm much more committed to \"some amount.\" It's like some amount than this particular time and place in human history is like that or whatever.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay, can I get a feel of some other concrete cases to see?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>So one example that's on my mind is, like, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, right? So the standard case for this is, like, yeah, what? A hundred thousand people died? Like, quite terrible, quite awful. And a lot of them died, I guess a lot of them were sort of some people were sort of instantly vaporized, but a lot of people died in extremely painful ways. But the countercase is like, well, the alternative to that would have been like, an incredibly grueling land invasion of Japan, where many more people would have died or know regardless of what the actual alternatives were. If you think about the atomic bombings, do you think that's like the kind of infliction of suffering where there's just not an offsetting amount of pleasure that could make that okay?</p><p>AARON</p><p>My intuition is no, that it is offsettable, but I would also emphasize that given the actual historical contingencies, the alternative, the implicit case for the bombing includes reducing suffering elsewhere rather than merely creating happiness. There can definitely be two bad choices that you have to make or something. And my claim doesn't really pertain to that, at least not directly.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Right. Sorry. But when you said you thought your answer was no, you think you can't offset that with pleasure?</p><p>AARON</p><p>My intuition is that you can, but I know very little about how painful those deaths were and how long they lasted.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, so the non offset so it's like, further out than atomic bombing.</p><p>AARON</p><p>That's my guess, but I'm like \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay, sure, that's your guess. You're not super confident. That's fine. I guess another thing would be, like, the animal farming system. So, as you're aware, tons of animals get kept in farms for humans to eat, by many count. Many of them live extremely horrible lives. Is there some amount that humans could enjoy meat such that that would be okay?</p><p>AARON</p><p>No. So the only reason I'm hesitating is, like, what is the actual alternative here? But basically the answer is no. Although, like, what I would actually endorse doing depends on what the alternative is.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay, but you think that factory farming is so bad that it's not offsettable by pleasure.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, that's right. I'm somewhat maybe more confident than the atomic bombing case, but again, I don't know what it's like to be a factory farm pig. I wouldn't say I'm, like, 99% sure. Probably more than 70% or something. Or 70%, like, conditional on me being right about this thesis, I guess something like that, which I'm like. Yeah, okay. I don't know. Some percent, maybe, not probably not 99% sure, but also more than 60. Probably more than 70% sure or something.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>All right. Yeah. So I guess maybe can you tell us a little bit about why you would believe that there's some threshold that you like where you can no longer compensate by permitting pleasure?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yes. Let me run through my argument and sort of a motivation, and the motivation actually is sort of more a direct answer to what you just said. So the actual argument that I have and I have a blog post about this that I'll link, it was part of an EA forum post also that you'll also link in the show description is that the affirmative default case doesn't seem to actually be made anywhere. That's not the complete argument, but it's a core piece of it, which is that it seems to be, like, the default received view, which doesn't mean it's wrong, but does mean that we should be skeptical. If you accept that I'm right, that the affirmative case hasn't been made, we can talk about that. Then you should default to some other heuristic. And the heuristic that I assert and sort of argue, but kind of just assert is a good heuristic is. Okay. Is you do the following thought experiment. If I was a maximally or perfectly rational being, would I personally choose to undergo this amount of suffering in compensation or not compensation, exchange for later undergoing or earlier undergoing some arbitrarily large amount of happiness. And I personally have the intuition that there are events or things that certainly conceivable states and almost certainly possible states that I could be in such that even as a rational being, like as a maximum rational being, I would choose to just disappear and not exist rather than undergo both of these things.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Why do you think that?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, so good question. I think the answer comes at a couple of different levels. So there's a question of why I'm saying it and why I'm saying it is because I'm pretty sure this is the answer I would actually give if actually given if Credibly offered this option. But that just pushes the question back. Okay, why do I feel that.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Even what option are we talking about here? There exists a thing such that for.</p><p>AARON</p><p>All pleasures, basically, for example, let's just run with the fact, the assumption that a genie God descends. And I think it's credible, and he offers that I can live the life of every factory, farmed animal in exchange for whatever I want for any amount of time or something like that. Literally, I don't have to give the answer now. It can just be like an arbitrarily good state for an arbitrarily long period of time.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p>AARON</p><p>And not only would I say the words no, I don't want to do that, I think that the words no, I don't want to do that, are selfishly in a non pejorative sense. Correct. And then there's a question of why do I have that intuition? And now I'm introspecting, which is maybe not super reliable. I think part of my intuition that I can kind of maybe sort of access via introspection just comes from basically, I'm very fortunate to not have had a mostly relatively comfortable life, like as a Westerner with access to painkillers, living in the 21st century. Even still, there have definitely been times when I've been suffered, at least not in a relative sense, but just like, in an absolute sense to me, in a pretty bad way. And one example I can give was just like, I was on a backpacking trip, and this is the example I give in another blog post I can link. I was on a backpacking trip, and we didn't have enough food, and I was basically very hungry for like five days. And I actually think that this is a good and I'm rambling on, but I'll finish up. I think it's illustrative. I think there's some level of suffering where you're still able to do at least for me, I'm still able to do something like reasoning and intentionally storing memories. One of the memories I tried to intentionally codify via language or something was like, yeah, this is really bad, this really sucks, or something like, that what.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Sucked about it, you were just like, really hungry yeah.</p><p>AARON</p><p>For five days.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay. And you codified the thought, like, feeling of this hunger I'm feeling, this really sucks.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Something like that. Right. I could probably explicate it more, but that's basically okay. Actually, hold on. All right. Let me add so not just it really sucks, but it sucks in a way that I can't normally appreciate, so I don't normally have access to how bad it sucks. I don't want to forget about this later or something.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah. The fact that there are pains that are really bad where you don't normally appreciate how bad they are, it's not clear how that implies non offset ability.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Right, I agree. It doesn't.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay.</p><p>AARON</p><p>I do think that's causally responsible for my intuition that I lend link to a heuristic that I then argue does constitute an argument in the absence of other arguments for offset ability.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah. Okay. So that causes this intuition, and then you give some arguments, and the argument is like, you think that if a genie offered you to live liable factory farmed animals in exchange for whatever you wanted, you wouldn't go for that.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yes. And furthermore, I also wouldn't go for it if I was much more rational.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>If you were rational, yeah. Okay. Yeah. What do I think about this? One thing I think is that the I think the case of live experience this suffering and then experience this pleasure, to me, I think that this is kind of the wrong way to go about this. Because the thing about experiencing suffering is that it's not just we don't live in this totally dualistic world where suffering just affects only your immaterial mind or something in a way where afterwards you could just be the same. In the real world, suffering actually affects you. Right. Perhaps indelibly. I think instead, maybe the thing I'd want to say is suppose you're offered a gamble, right, where there's like a 1% chance that you're going to have to undergo excruciating suffering and a 99% chance that you get extremely awesome pleasures or something.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>And this is meant to model a situation in which you do some action in which one person is going to undergo really bad suffering and 99 other people are going to undergo really great pleasure. And to me, I guess my intuition is that for any bad thing, you could make the probability small enough and you can make the rest of the probability mass good enough that I want to do that. I feel like that's worth it for me. And now it feels a little bit unsatisfying that we're just going that we're both drilling down to, like, well, this is the choice I would make, and then maybe you can disagree that it's the choice you would make. But yeah, I guess about the gambling case, what do you think about that? Let's say it's literally a one in a million chance that you would have to undergo, let's say, the life of one factory farmed animal.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Or is that not enough? Do you want it to be like, more?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Well, I guess it would have to be like one of the worst factory farmed animals. Life, I think would make that like.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, okay, let's say it's like, maybe literally one in a billion chance.</p><p>AARON</p><p>First of all, I do agree that these are basically isomorphic or morally equivalent, or if anything, time ordering in my example does mess things up a little bit, I'll be happy to reverse them or say that instead compare one person to 1000 people. So, yeah, you can make the probability small enough that my intuition changes. Yeah. So in fact, 1%, I'm very like, no, definitely not doing that. One in a million. I'm like, I don't know, kind of 50 50. I don't have a strong intuition either way. 100 trillion. I have the intuition. You know what? That's just not going to happen. That's my first order intuition. I do think that considering the case where you live, one being lives both lives, or you have, say, one being undergoing the suffering and then like 100 trillion undergoing the pleasure makes small probabilities more if you agree that they're sort of isomorphic makes them more complete or something like that, or complete more real in some. Not tangible is not the right word, but more right.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>You're less tempted to round it to zero.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah. And so I tend to think that I trust my intuitions more about reasoning. Okay, there's one person undergoing suffering and like 100 trillion undergoing happiness as it pertains to the question of offset ability more than I trust my intuitions about small probabilities.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>I guess that's strange because that strikes me as strange because I feel like you're regularly in situations where you make choices that have some probability of causing you quite bad suffering, but a large probability of being fun. Like going to the beach. There could be a shark there. I guess this is maybe against your will, but you can go to a restaurant, maybe get food poisoning, but how often are you like, oh man, if I flip this switch, one person will be poisoned, but 99 people will?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Well, then you'd have to think that, okay, staying home would actually be safer for some reason, which I don't affirmatively think is true, but this actually does work out for the question of whether you should kill yourself. And there hopefully this doesn't get censored by Apple or whatever, so nobody do that. But there I just think that my lizard brain or there's enough evolutionary pressure to not trust that I would be rational when it comes to the question of whether to avoid a small chance of suffering by unaliving myself, as they say on TikTok.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Hang on, evolution is pressured. So there's some evolutionary pressure to make sure you really don't want to kill yourself, but you think that's like, irrational.</p><p>AARON</p><p>I haven't actually given this a ton of thought. It gets hard when you loop in altruism and yeah, the question also there's like some chance that of sentient's after death, there's not literally zero or something like that. Yeah, I guess those are kind of cop outs. So I don't know, I feel like it certainly could be. And I agree this is sort of like a strike against my argument or something. I can set up a situation you have no potential to improve the lives of others, and you can be absolutely sure that you're not going to experience any sentience after death. And then I feel like my argument does kind of imply that, yeah, that's like the rational thing to do. I wouldn't do it. Right. So I agree. This is like a strike against me.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah. I guess I just want to make two points. So the first point I want to make is just methodologically. If we're talking about which are you likely to be more rational about gambles of small risks, small probabilities of risk versus large rewards as opposed to situations where you can do a thing that affects a large number of people one way and a small number of people another way? I think the gambles are more like decisions that you make a bunch and you should be rational about and then just the second thing in terms of like, I don't know, I took you to be making some sort of argument along the lines of there's evolutionary pressure to want to not kill yourself. Therefore, that's like a debunking explanation. The fact that there was evolutionary pressure to not kill ourselves means that our instinct that we shouldn't kill ourselves is irrational. Whereas I would tend to look at it and say the fact that there was very strong evolutionary pressure to not kill ourselves is an explanation of why I don't want to kill myself. And I see that as affirming the choice to not kill myself, actually.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Well, I just want to say I don't think it's an affirmative argument that it is irrational. I think it opens up the question. I think it means it's more plausible that for other I guess not even necessarily for other reasons, but it just makes it more plausible that it is irrational. Well.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, I take exactly the opposite view. Okay. I think that if I'm thinking about, like, oh, what do I really want? If I consider my true preferences, do I really want to kill myself or something? And then I learn that, oh, evolution has shaped me to not kill myself, I think the inference I should make is like, oh, I guess probably the way evolution did that is that it made it such that my true desires are to not kill myself.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah. So one thing is I just don't think preferences have any intrinsic value. So I don't know, we might just like I guess I should ask, do you agree with that or disagree with.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>That do I think preferences have intrinsic value? No, but so no, but I think like, the whole game here is like, what do I prefer? Or like, what would I prefer if I understood things really clearly?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yes. And this is something I didn't really highlight or maybe I didn't say it at all, is that I forget if I really argue it or kind of just assert it, but I at least assert that the answer to hedonic utilitarian. What you should do under hedonic utilitarianism is maybe not identical to, but exactly the same as what a rational agent would do or what a rational agent would prefer if they were to experience everything that this agent would cause. Or something like that. And so these should give you the exact same answers is something I believe sure. Because I do think preferences are like we're built to understand or sort of intuit and reason about our own preferences.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Kind of, yeah. But broadly, I guess the point I'm making at a high level is just like if we're talking about what's ethical or what's good or whatever, I take this to ultimately be a question about what should I understand myself as preferring? Or to the extent that it's not a question of that, then it's like, I don't know, then I'm a bit less interested in the exercise.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah. It's not ideal that I appeal to this fake and that fake ideally rational being or something. But here's a reason you might think it's more worth thinking about this. Maybe you've heard about I think Tomasik makes an argument about yeah. At least in principle, you can have a pig that's in extreme pain but really doesn't want to be killed still or doesn't want to be taken out of its suffering or whatever, true ultimate preference or whatever. And so at least I think this is pretty convincing evidence that you can have where that's just like, wrong about what would be good for it, you know what I mean?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, sorry, I'm not talking about preference versus hedonic utilitarianism or anything. I'm talking about what do I want or what do I want for living things or something. That's what I'm talking about.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah. That language elicits preferences to me and I guess the analogous but the idea.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Is that the answer to what I want for living things could be like hedonic utilitarianism, if you see what I mean.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Or it could be by that do you mean what hedonic utilitarianism prescribes?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, it could be that what I want is that just whatever maximizes beings pleasure no matter what they want.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so I agree with that.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah. So anyway, heading back just to the suicide case right. If I learn that evolution has shaped me to not want to kill myself, then that makes me think that I'm being rational in my choice to not kill myself.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Why?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Because being rational is something like optimally achieving your goals. And I'm a little bit like I sort of roughly know the results of killing myself, right? There might be some question about like, but what are my goals? And if I learned that evolution has shaped my goals such that I would hate killing myself right, then I'm like, oh, I guess killing myself probably ranks really low on the list of states ordered by how much I like them.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, I guess then it seems like you have two mutually incompatible goals. Like, one is staying alive and one is hedonic utilitarianism and then you have to choose which of these predominates or whatever.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, well, I think that to the extent that evolution is shaping me to not want to commit suicide, it looks like the not killing myself one is winning. I think it's evidence. I don't think it's conclusive. Right. Because there could be multiple things going on. But I take evolutionary explanations for why somebody would want X. I think that's evidence that they are rational in pursuing X rather than evidence that they are irrational in pursuing X.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Sometimes that's true, but not always. Yeah, there's a lot in general it is. Yeah. But I feel like moral anti realistic, we can also get into that. Are going to not think this is like woo or Joe Carlsmith says when he's like making fun of moralists I don't know, in a tongue in cheek way. In one of his posts arguing for explicating his stance on antirealism basically says moral realists want to say that evolution is not sensitive to moral reasons and therefore evolutionary arguments. Actually, I don't want to quote him from memory. I'll just assert that evolution is sensitive to a lot of things, but one of them is not moral reasons and therefore evolutionary arguments are not a good evidence or are not good evidence when it comes to purely, maybe not even purely, but philosophical claims or object level moral claims, I guess, yeah, they can be evidenced by something, but not that.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, I think that's wrong because I think that evolution why do I think it's wrong? I think it's wrong because what are we talking about when we talk about morality? We're talking about some logical object that's like the completion of a bunch of intuitions we have. Right. And those I haven't thought about intuitions are the product of evolution. The reason we care about morality at all is because of evolution under the standard theory that evolution is the reason our brains are the way they are.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, I think this is a very strange coincidence and I am kind of weirded out by this, but yes, I.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Don'T think it's a coincidence or like not a coincidence.</p><p>AARON</p><p>So it's not a coincidence like conditional honor, evolutionary history. It is like no extremely lucky or something that we like, of course we'd find it earthlings wound up with morality and stuff. Well, of course you would.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Wait. Have you read the metafic sequence by Eliezer Yudkowski?</p><p>AARON</p><p>I don't think so. And I respect Eliezer a ton, except I think he's really wrong about ethics and meta ethics in a lot of like I don't even know if I but I have not, so I'm not really giving them full time.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay. I don't know. I basically take this from my understanding of the meta ethics sequence, which I recommend people read, but I don't think it's a coincidence. I don't think we got lucky. I think it's a coincidence. There are some species that get evolved, right, and they end up caring about schmorality, right?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>And there are some species that get evolved, right? And they end up caring about the prime numbers or whatever, and we evolved and we ended up caring about morality. And it's not like a total so, okay, partly I'm just like, yeah, each one of them is really glad they didn't turn out to be the other things. The ones that care about two of.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Them are wrong, but two of them are wrong.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Well, they're morally wrong. Two of them do morally wrong things all the time. Right?</p><p>AARON</p><p>I want to say that I hate when people say that. Sorry. So what I am saying is that you can call those by different names, but if I'm understanding this argument right, they all think that they're getting at the same core concept, which is like, no, what should we do in some okay, so does schmorality have any sort of normativity?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>No, it has schmormativity.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay, well, I don't know what schmormativity is.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>You know how normativity I feel like that's good. Schmormativity is about promoting the schmud.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay, so it sounds like that's just normativity, except it's normativity about different propositions. That's what it sounds like.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Well, basically, I don't know, instead of these schmalians wait, no, they're aliens. They're not shmalians. They're aliens. They just do a bunch of schmud things, right? They engage in projects, they try and figure out what the schmud is. They pursue a schmud and then they look at humans, they're like, oh, these humans are doing morally good things. That's horrible. I'm so glad that we pursue the schmood instead.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, I don't know if it's incoherent. I don't think they're being incoherent. Your description of a hypothetical let's just take for granted whatever in the thought experiment is in fact happening. I think your description is not correct. And the reason it's not correct is because there is like, what's a good analogy? So when it comes to abstract concepts in general, it is very possible for okay, I feel like it's hard to explain directly, but here an analogy, is you can have two different people who have very different conceptions of justice, but fundamentally are earnestly trying to get at the same thing. Maybe justice isn't well defined or isn't like, actually, I should probably have come up with a good example here. But you know what? I'm happy to change the word for what I use as morality or whatever, but it has the same core meaning, which is like, okay, really, what should you do at the end of the day?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>AARON</p><p>What should you do?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Whereas they care about morality, which is what they should do, which is a different thing. They have strong desires to do what they should do.</p><p>AARON</p><p>I don't think it is coherent to say that there are multiple meanings of the word should or multiple kinds. Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>No, there aren't.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Sorry. There aren't multiple meanings of the word should. Fine.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>There's just a different word, which is schmood, which means something different, and that's what their desires are pegged to.</p><p>AARON</p><p>I don't think it's coherent, given what you've already the entire picture, I think, is incoherent. Given everything else besides the word schmoud, it is incoherent to assert that there is something broadly not analogous, like maybe isomorphic to normativity or, like, the word should. Yeah. There is only what's yeah. I feel like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be able to verbalize it super well. I do. Yeah. Can you take something can you pick.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>A sentence that I said that was wrong or that was incoherent?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Well, it's all wrong because these aliens don't exist.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>The aliens existed.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay, well, then we're debating, like, I actually don't know. It depends. You're asserting something about their culture and psychology, and then the question is, like, are you right or wrong about that? If we just take for granted that you're right, then you're right. All right. I'm saying no, you can't be sure. So conditional on being right, you're right. Then there's a question of, like, okay, what is the probability? So, like, conditional on aliens with something broad, are you willing to accept this phrase, like, something broadly analogous to morality? Is that okay?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, sure.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay. So if we accept that there's aliens with something broadly analogous to morality, then you want to say that they can have not only a different word, but truly a pointer to a different concept. And I think that's false.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>So you think that in conceptual space, there's morality and that there's, like, nothing near it for miles.</p><p>AARON</p><p>The study, like yeah, basically. At least when we're talking about, like, the like, at the at the pre conclusion stage. So, like, before you get to the point where you're like, oh, yeah, I'm certain that, like, the answer is just that we need, like, we need to make as many tennis balls as possible or whatever the general thing of, like, okay, broadly, what is the right thing to do? What should I do? Would it be good for me to do this cluster of things yeah. Is, like, miles from everything else.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay. I think there's something true to that. I think I agree with that in some ways and on others, my other response is I think it's not a total coincidence that humans ended up caring about morality. I think if you look at these evolutionary arguments for why humans would be motivated to pursue morality. They rely on very high level facts. Like, there are a bunch of humans around. There's not one human who's, like, a billion times more powerful than everyone else. We have language. We talk through things. We reason. We need to make decisions. We need to cooperate in certain ways to produce stuff. And it's not about the fact that we're bipedal or something. So in that sense, I think it's not a total coincidence that we ended up caring about morality. And so in some sense, I think because that's true, you could maybe say you couldn't slightly tweak our species that it cared about something other than morality, which is kind of like saying that there's nothing that close to morality in concept space.</p><p>AARON</p><p>But I think I misspoke earlier what I should have said is that it's very weird that we care about that most people at least partially care about suffering and happiness. I think that's just a true statement. Sorry, that is the weird thing. Why is it weird? The weird thing is that it happens to be correct, even though I only.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Have what do you mean it's correct?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Now we have to get okay, so this is going into moral realism. I think moral realism is true, at least.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Sorry, what do you mean by moral realism? Wait, different by moral realism?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yes. So I actually have sort of a weak version of moral realism, which is, like, not that normative statements are true, but that there is, like, an objective. So if you can rank hypothetical states of the world in an ordinal way such that one is objectively better than another.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yes. Okay. I agree with that, by the way. I think that's true. Okay.</p><p>AARON</p><p>It sounds like you're a moral realist.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, I am.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay. Oh, really? Okay. I don't know. I thought you weren't. Okay, cool.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Lots of people in my reference class aren't. I think most Bay Area rationalists are not moral realists, but I am.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay. Maybe I was confused. Okay, that's weird. Okay. Sorry about that. Wait, so what do I mean by it happens to be true? It's like it happens to coincide with yeah, sorry, go ahead.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>You said it happens to be correct that we care about morality or that we care about suffering and pleasure and something and stuff.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Maybe that wasn't the ideal terminology it happens to so, like, it's not morally correct? The caring about it isn't the morally correct thing. It seems sort of like the caring is instrumentally useful in promoting what happens to be legitimately good or something. Or, like legitimately good or something like that.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>But but I think, like so the aliens could say a similar thing, right? They could say, like, oh, hey, we've noticed that we all care about schmurality. We all really care about promoting Schmeasure and avoiding Schmuffering. Right? And they'd say, like, they'd say, like, yeah, what's? What's wrong?</p><p>AARON</p><p>I feel like it's not maybe I'm just missing something, but at least to me, it's like, only adding to the confusion to talk about two different concepts of morality rather than just like, okay, this alien thinks that you should tile the universe paperclips, or something like that, or even that more reasonably, more plausibly. Justice is like that. Yeah. I guess this gets back to there's only one concept anywhere near that vicinity in concept space or something. Maybe we disagree about that. Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay. If I said paperclips instead of schmorality, would you be happy?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yes.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>I mean, cool, okay, for doing the.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Morally correct thing and making me happy.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>I strive to. But take the paperclipper species, right? What they do is they notice, like, hey, we really care about making paperclips, right? And, hey, the fact that we care about making paperclips, that's instrumentally useful in making sure that we end up making a bunch of paperclips, right? Isn't that an amazing coincidence that we ended up caring our desires were structured in this correct way that ends up with us making a bunch of paperclips. Is that like, oh, no, total coincidence. That's just what you cared about.</p><p>AARON</p><p>You left at the part where they assert that they're correct about this. That's the weird thing.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>What proposition are they correct about?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Or sorry, I don't think they're correct implicitly.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>What proposition do they claim they're correct about?</p><p>AARON</p><p>They claim that the world in which there is many paperclips is better than the world in which there is fewer paperclips.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Oh, no, they just think it's more paperclipy. They don't think it's better. They don't care about goodness. They care about paperclips.</p><p>AARON</p><p>So it sounds like we're not talking about anything remotely like morality, then, because I could say, yeah, morality, morality. It's pretty airy. It's a lot of air in here. I don't know, maybe I'm just confused.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>No, what I'm saying is, so you're like, oh, it's like this total coincidence that humans we got so lucky. It's so weird that humans ended up caring about morality, and it's like, well, we had to care about something, right? Like anything we don't care about.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Oh, wow, sorry, I misspoke earlier. And I think that's generating some confusion. I think it's a weird coincidence that we care about happiness and suffering.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Happiness and suffering, sorry. Yeah, but mutatus mutantus, I think you want to say that's like a weird coincidence. And I'm like, well, we had to care about something.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, but it could have been like, I don't know, could it have been otherwise, right? At least conceivably it could have been otherwise.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, the paperclip guys, they're like, conceivably, we could have ended up caring about pleasure and suffering. I'm so glad we avoided that.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, but they're wrong and we're right.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Right about what?</p><p>AARON</p><p>And then maybe I don't agree. Maybe this isn't the point you're making. I'm sort of saying that in a blunt way to emphasize it. I feel like people should be skeptical when I say, like okay, I have good reason to think that even though we're in a very similar epistemic position, I have reason to believe that we're right and not the aliens. Right. That's like a hard case to make, but I do think it's true.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>There's no proposition that the aliens and us disagree on yes.</p><p>AARON</p><p>The intrinsic value of pleasure and happiness.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, no, they don't care about value. They care about schmalu, which is just.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Like, how much paperclips there is. I don't think that's coherent. I don't think they can care about value.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay.</p><p>AARON</p><p>They can, but only insofar as it's a pointer to the exact same not exact, but like, basically the same concept as our value.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>So do you reject the orthogonality thesis?</p><p>AARON</p><p>No.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay. I think that is super intelligent.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>So I take the orthogonality thesis to mean that really smart agents can be motivated by approximately any desires. Does that sound right to you?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>So what if the desire is like, produce a ton of paperclips?</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah, it can do that descriptively. It's not morally good.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Oh, no, it's not morally good at all. They're not trying to be morally good. They're just trying to produce a bunch of paperclips.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay, in that case, we don't disagree. Yeah, I agree. This is like a conceivable state of the world.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah. But what I'm trying to say is when you say it's weird that we got lucky the reason you think it's weird is that you're one of the humans who cares about pleasure and suffering. Whereas if you were one of the aliens who cared about paperclips. The analogous shmarin instead of Aaron would be saying, like, oh, it's crazy that we care about paperclips, because that actually causes us to make a ton of paperclips.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Do they intrinsically care about paperclips or is it a means of cement?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Intrinsically, like, same as in the Orphogonality thesis.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Do they experience happiness because of the paperclips or is it more of a functional intrinsic value?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>I think they probably experience happiness when they create paperclips, but they're not motivated by the happiness. They're motivated by like, they're happy because they succeeded at their goal of making tons of paperclips. If they can make tons of paperclips but not be happy about it, they'd be like, yeah, we should do that. Sorry. No, they wouldn't. They'd say, like, we should do that and then they would do it.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Would your case still work if we just pretended that they're not sentient?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, sure.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay. I think this makes it cleaner for both sides. Yeah, in that case, yes. So I think the thing that I reject is that there's an analog term that's anything like morality in their universe. They can use a different word, but it's pointing to the same concept.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>When you say anything like morality. So the shared concepts sorry, the shared properties between morality and paperclip promotion is just that you have a species that is dedicated to promoting it.</p><p>AARON</p><p>I disagree. I think morality is about goodness and badness.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yes, that's right.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Okay. And I think it is totally conceivable. Not even conceivable. So humans wait, what's a good example? In some sense I intrinsically seem to value about regular. I don't know if this is a good example. Let's run with it intrinsically value like regulating my heartbeat. It happens to be true that this is conducive to my happiness and at least local non suffering. But even if it weren't, my brain stem would still try really hard to keep my heart beating or something like that. I reject that there's any way in which promoting heart beatingness is an intrinsic moral or schmoral value or even that could be it could be hypothesized as one but it is not in fact one or something like that.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Okay.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Likewise, these aliens could claim that making paperclips is intrinsically good. They could also just make them and not make that claim. And those are two very different things.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>They don't claim it's good. They don't think it's good.</p><p>AARON</p><p>They think it's claim it schmud.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Which they prefer. Yeah, they prefer.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Don't. I think that is also incoherent. I think there is like one concept in that space because wait, I feel like also this is just like at some point it has to cash out in the real world. Right? Unless we're talking about really speculative not even physics.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>What I mean is they just spend all of their time promoting paperclips and then you send them a copy of Jeremy Bentham's collected writings, they read it and they're like all right, cool. And then they just keep on making paperclips because that's what they want to do.</p><p>AARON</p><p>Yeah. So descriptively.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Sure.</p><p>AARON</p><p>But they never claim that. It's like we haven't even introduced objectivity to this example. So did they ever claim that it's objectively the right thing to do?</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>No, they claim that it's objectively the paperclipy thing to do.</p><p>AARON</p><p>I agree with that. It is the paperclippy thing to do.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, they're right about stuff. Yeah.</p><p>AARON</p><p>So they're right about that. They're just not a right. So I do think this all comes back down to the question of whether there's analogous concepts in near ish morality that an alien species might point at. Because if there's not, then the paperclippiness is just like a totally radically different type of thing.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>But why does it like when did I say that they were closely analogous? This is what I don't understand.</p><p>AARON</p><p>So it seems to be insinuated by the closeness of the word semantic.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Oh yeah, whatever. When I was making it a similar sounding word, all I meant to say is that they talk about it plays a similar role in their culture as morality plays in our culture. Sorry. In terms of their motivations, I should say. Oh, yeah.</p><p>AARON</p><p>I think there's plenty of human cultures that are getting at morality. Yeah. So I think especially historically, plenty of human cultures that are getting at the same core concept of morality but just are wrong about it.</p><p>DANIEL</p><p>Yeah, I think that's right.</p>", "user": {"username": "aaronb50"}}, {"_id": "46XzhPYJQ8wtXiKEW", "title": "Personal Privacy - Workshop", "postedAt": "2023-08-28T20:46:37.594Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>For our monthly workshop in \"August\" (yes, I know it's September), <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/guyp?mention=user\">@GuyP</a> will teach us about digital privacy.</p><p>We'll go over who should and shouldn't care for their digital privacy, the value of personal data, its effects on the people around you and what are the lesser-known low-hanging fruits to improve your standing in the digital age.</p><p>You're very welcome, even if you\u2019ve never been to a meetup, or you feel like you don't fit in.
