I was told that outside EA it is pretty normal for grantmakers to get board seats. If you are going to give a load of money to a project it seems pretty reasonable to have some level of control, as shares would in a business. Likewise a project may want easy access to someone from the grantmaker so they can get future grants.</p><p>Not to say this is always good, but I don't think it requires recusal in many cases (it may be the literal reason for the seat), compared to many other examples.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "nathan"}}, {"_id": "sgrQEX9HvJkpMYupc", "postedAt": "2023-11-10T18:11:30.065Z", "postId": "GCGntqsEHWpGEwrnF", "htmlBody": "<p>It sounds like you're describing a case where a granting organization intentionally has one of their staff on the board of a project?  I agree that's fine, but it's not the only way you could have a board-member related COI.  A classic case would be if a charity applies to a fund (for the first time) and it happens to be a board member at the charity works for the fund.  Another way this could happen is if a trusted advisor of a fund happened to be on the board of a charity the fund was considering granting to.  Personally, I think these should definitely be disclosed, and depending on the nature of the relationship recusal would often be a good idea?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "CQcegnHEufi3v9oXh", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}]
