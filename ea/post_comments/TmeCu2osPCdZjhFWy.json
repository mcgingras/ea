They are similar, but the farrowing crate is where the sows gives birth and is slightly wider. She will be in here for 3-4 weeks usually in the US. The gestation crate is where she is housed for the rest of pregnancy and is narrower. Both types of crate clearly constrain the sow from carrying out natural behavior, even making posture changes difficult.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "JNMarchant"}}]
