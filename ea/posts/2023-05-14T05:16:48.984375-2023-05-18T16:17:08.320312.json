AI alignment.</p>\n<p>I am writing this post because I am immensely worried about the risks that come with building increasingly capable AI systems.</p>\n<p>Why write my own post? Why not just refer to one of the many (now, <em>finally</em>) available online? That's because there's one thing I haven't seen many existing articles do: presenting a complete argument for why we should be worried, while straddling the line between 1) understandability for non-experts, and 2) sufficient technical detail for AI experts. This article is meant both for laypeople who want to understand better why we might expect AI to go badly, and for machine learning researchers who would like to see the whole argument written down in one place so that they can evaluate it for themselves. Of course, I cannot nearly cover everything in a single blog post. To compensate, I've included links to additional information and further reading. Even so, this post primarily discusses the technical issues, although the problem is also very much one of policy and governance: I will touch on this throughout as well.</p>\n<p>To start, what is AI alignment?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>AI alignment is the process of making sure that AI systems work towards our intended goals, whatever those are. An AI system that works towards our intended goals is called <em>aligned</em>.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's the goal. Aligning AI systems is surprisingly difficult, which is a big part of what has the research community worried. We'll explore the details of this step by step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sounding the alarm.</strong> Setting the stage: many AI researchers are suddenly worried.</li>\n<li><strong>What is AI?</strong> How are AI systems created, what can they do, and what problems are we already seeing?</li>\n<li><strong>Aligning AI.</strong> What are the difficulties with aligning AI? This is the most technical section and the easiest to skip.</li>\n<li><strong>Existential risk.</strong> Why is unaligned AI existentially dangerous to humanity?</li>\n<li><strong>What to do?</strong> A call to action. What can you do as a layperson, as someone working in policy, or as a researcher?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Sounding the alarm</h2>\n<p>In the last few months, many researchers have publicly voiced their concerns about the dangers of future AI systems. These include two of the three Turing Award winners, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html\">Geoffrey Hinton</a> and <a href=\"https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/05/07/ai-scientists-safe-and-useful-ai/\">Yoshua Bengio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_marcus_the_urgent_risks_of_runaway_ai_and_what_to_do_about_them\">Gary Marcus</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NandoDF/status/1653685589697241090\">Nando de Freitas</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidDuvenaud/status/1639365724316499971\">David Duvenaud</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16200\">Dan Hendrycs</a>, and <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\">many others</a>. Even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pkedrosky/status/1653955254181068801\">Snoop Dogg is worried</a>.</p>\n<p>Other researchers have been publicly worried for longer. Among these is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISkAkiAkK7A\">Stuart Russell</a>, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, and writer of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach\">\u201cthe most popular artificial intelligence textbook in the world\u201d</a>. He recently spoke at <a href=\"https://dezwijger.nl/programma/existential-risks-of-artificial-intelligence\">the Pakhuis de Zwijger panel on Existential Risks of AI</a> in Amsterdam, where I was invited to be a panellist. The panel was held at a great time: OpenAI had just released their newest Large Language Model (LLM) \u2013 <a href=\"https://openai.com/product/gpt-4\">GPT-4</a> \u2013 a month before, Microsoft had released <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/\">Sidney/Bing</a> a month before <em>that</em>, with Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/\">Bard</a> right on <em>their</em> heels, and the world was paying attention. The panel sold out, was moved to the main hall, and sold out again.</p>\n<h2>What is AI?</h2>\n<p>So what are we worried about? Stuart Russell\u2019s introductory talk is worth watching for both laypeople and experts. A recording of his talk as well as the subsequent panel discussion is available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGQDctxwy2E\">here</a>. He starts by explaining the goal of companies like OpenAI and DeepMind: to build <em>general-purpose AI</em>; AI capable of (quickly learning) high-quality behaviour in any task environment. You may have previously heard this described as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Such an AI would be able to perform a wide variety of tasks. Among other things, it would be able to play <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go\">chess, Go</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii\">other games</a>, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/\">search the internet</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT\">make plans and execute on those plans</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">chat with people</a>, <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/03/31/man-ends-his-life-after-an-ai-chatbot-encouraged-him-to-sacrifice-himself-to-stop-climate-\">manipulate people</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\">write code</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold\">solve scientific problems</a>.</p>\n<p>Current AI systems can do all these things already to some degree. Mostly, these are narrow AI systems trained to do a particular task very well, but there are some examples of systems that can already perform multiple tasks. For instance, GPT-4 can chat, write code, and answer scientific questions (to varying degrees of success). Its sister product Sydney/Bing can chat, search the internet, and even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html\">expressed unexpected antisocial behaviours</a> before Microsoft added some safeguards. Interestingly, large language models have developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">capabilities they were not directly trained for</a>, or have learnt to perform tasks that their smaller counterparts failed at \u2013 <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=yzkSU5zdwD\">emergent capabilities</a> \u2013 merely by having been scaled up.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-1\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-1\">[1]</a></sup> This makes it likely that these models will develop even more novel capabilities as we scale them up even further.</p>\n<p>GPT-4 is already showing enough generality to impress the researchers at Microsoft. Their recent paper -- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf\">Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence</a> -- reports on their experiments with an early version of GPT-4. They write: <em>\"We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4\u2019s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT.</em>\"</p>\n<h3>AI causing trouble</h3>\n<p>Even our current narrow(er) AI systems are already causing some trouble. For example, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/10/open-source-data-science-bias-more-ethical-ai-technology/\">AI can exacerbate problems</a> caused by our society\u2019s socio-economic biases -- e.g., racism, gender-biases, etc. -- by reflecting them in their algorithmic biases. This risks amplifying inequities in society, for instance <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6875681/\">in our health systems</a>. Something else that many of us have already experienced, is the effects of algorithmically curated social media feeds on the quality of online discourse. Stuart Russell presents the classic example of social media AI systems trained to maximise clickthrough-rate eventually learning to amplify clickbait \u2013 which is, in fact, a very good strategy for maximising clickthrough-rate, but which has the side effect of spreading misinformation. We currently do not have any obvious solutions to these problems, and they are likely to get worse as we include AI systems in more and more of our society\u2019s processes. OpenAI itself has warned about the risk of LLM-powered <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/forecasting-misuse\">misinformation campaigns</a>, which seem very possible with current systems.</p>\n<p>The social media example is illustrative because it points to an enormous safety problem in the way we currently build AI systems: we don\u2019t know how to robustly get AI to do what we want. Our current paradigm is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\">deep learning</a>, which involves training large models -- called neural networks -- on huge datasets. Training is implemented as an optimisation problem. In practice, this means that every data point tells the model how to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent\">change itself a tiny bit</a> such that it becomes better at predicting that data point. The quality of a predictions is determined according to your specified objective, which we call 'loss function'. Training an AI system essentially amounts to searching a huge space of possible algorithms for one that does well on your task, as specified by your training data and loss function. This has one main implication: no one knows exactly why a deep learning system predicts the things that it does or performs the actions that it does.</p>\n<p>That is worth repeating: <em>no one knows exactly why a deep learning system does what it does</em>. When Syndey/Bing started aggressively misbehaving -- by, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html\">declaring its love to a New York Times journalist and subsequently urging him to leave his wife</a> -- Microsoft did not know why. The best they could do is: \"Guess we didn't train it hard enough to be helpful and harmless\", and this is the best <em>anyone</em> can do right now. We simply do not have the technology to understand in detail how deep neural networks generate their answers. To Mikhail Parakhin, the person at Microsoft in charge of Syndey/Bing's deployment, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MParakhin/status/1627360286666592257\">such behaviour came as quite a surprise</a>. Why? Because no one in their test markets had reported such behaviour. No one knows exactly what large language models can do, <em>not even their creators</em>. The field that concerns itself with improving our precise understanding of these capabilities is called <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/mech-interp-essay/index.html\">'mechanistic interpretability'</a> and it is hugely underexplored compared to the field of 'giving the models more capabilities'.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-2\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Continuing to build more capable AI systems when we understand so little of what goes on in the models has the potential to lead to existentially dangerous scenarios</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my experience, the above statement sounds obvious to some people, and completely out of left field for others. Below I will sketch out why I think this is something we should be deeply worried about.</p>\n<h2>Aligning AI</h2>\n<p>Imagine we succeed in building a very capable AI system using deep learning. As is standard deep learning protocol, we are using lots of data from all kinds of domains to search for an algorithm that does well on some objective. Presumably, we want the objective to be something good for humanity, or sentient life in general. This step alone opens up quite the philosophical can of worms: what kind of trade-offs should we be making? Free speech versus libel and misinformation. Safety of medical research versus lives lost by delays. This is not mere armchair philosophy: the self-driving car industry <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-021-00464-5\">has been struggling</a> with questions about such ethical trade-offs for years. Choosing the wrong objective here would be bad, since then we'd be dealing with a very capable AI system that is actively working to achieve that objective, rather than towards something that aligns with our goals (this will be a recurring theme). It's not obvious that there even exists a singular goal that would be (equally?) good for all of humanity and other sentient life. These are genuinely difficult philosophical questions, that we don't currently have an answer for.</p>\n<p>A question that often comes up at this point is: \"Why can we not just programme the AI system to follow the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics\">Three Laws of Robotics</a>?\" These laws were created by science fiction writer (and professor of biochemistry) Isaac Asimov, arguably <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Robot\">to show</a> why such an idea <a href=\"http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/AST389/Why%20the%20three%20laws%20of%20robotics%20do%20not%20work.pdf\">cannot work</a>. One problem is that the laws are too open to interpretration to actually specify robustly safe behaviour: it's far too easy to circumvent the spirit of the laws while keeping to the letter.</p>\n<h3>Outer alignment</h3>\n<p>Returning to our example, let\u2019s assume we somehow solve \u2013 or more likely: circumvent(?) \u2013 the philosophical issues with finding a good objective. We now know what objective we want our AI system to do well on: can we specify a loss function (objective) that achieves this? Any programmer knows that the trouble with computers is that they do what you tell them to do, not what you want them to do. If you don't specify what you want very precisely, you don't get what you want: you get what you (mistakenly) said. This is the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/outer-alignment\">outer alignment</a> problem. The Three Laws of Robotics run into exactly this issue as well. Quoting the linked page:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Overall, outer alignment as a problem is intuitive enough to understand, i.e., <em>is the specified loss function aligned with the intended goal of its designers?</em> However, implementing this in practice is extremely difficult. Conveying the full \u201cintention\u201d behind a human request is equivalent to conveying the sum of all human values and ethics. This is difficult in part because human intentions are themselves not well understood. Additionally, since most models are designed as goal optimizers, they are all susceptible to Goodhart\u2019s Law which means that we might be unable to foresee negative consequences that arise due to excessive optimization pressure on a goal that would look otherwise well specified to humans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That last bit about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart\u2019s Law</a> is worth going into. Goodhart\u2019s Law states that <em>\"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\"</em>. Why is this? Well, this is exactly what went wrong in the social media example above. AI engineers wanted to build a system that maximised engagement, decided on a measure for this (clickthrough-rate), and trained their AI system to optimise that measure. Clickthrough-rate was supposed to be a measure of what the engineers wanted the AI to optimise (\u2018engagement\u2019), but as soon as enough optimisation pressure was applied (in the form of AI training) it stopped being a good measure, because the AI found strategies that maximised clickthrough-rate in ways the engineers did not intend.</p>\n<p>This phenomenon where an AI system learns behaviour that satisfies the literal specification of an objective without achieving the intended outcome is called <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity\">specification gaming</a>. There are <a href=\"https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/specification-gaming-examples-in-ai/\">many examples</a> of <a href=\"https://heystacks.com/doc/186/specification-gaming-examples-in-ai---master-list\">this behaviour emerging</a> in deep learning systems. Again, if we don't somehow solve this, we'll be dealing with a very capable AI system that is actively working against our goals.</p>\n<p>Okay, what if we somehow solve this issue, such that our trained AI does what we want on the training data? Enter <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111\">goal misgeneralisation</a>: the AI learns behaviour that seems to follow the correct goal during training, but actually it learned some other goal that your training set could not distinguish from the goal you wanted it to have. Again, there are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01790\">examples</a> of this happening with current systems. And again, we'll be dealing with a very capable AI system that is actively working against our goals. Notice the theme?</p>\n<h3>Inner alignment</h3>\n<p>Are we done if we solve this? Nah, there\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/inner-alignment\">inner alignment</a>. This is quite a complex topic, for which a slightly more introductory level post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AHhCrJ2KpTjsCSwbt/inner-alignment-explain-like-i-m-12-edition\">can be found here</a>. The basic idea is that optimisation can create internal processes that develop goals/objectives that are not the same as the outer goal/objective.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-3\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-3\">[3]</a></sup> The technical term for such a process is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01820.pdf\">mesa-optimiser</a>. Human goals can be viewed as an example of an inner alignment failure. Evolution has created us, humans, through an optimisation process \u2013 namely natural selection \u2013 with the goal of maximising <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness\">inclusive (genetic) fitness</a>. Do we \u2013 the mesa-optimisers that result from this optimisation process \u2013 care about inclusive fitness? I sure don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t even have a concept of \u2018inclusive fitness\u2019 \u2013 either intellectually or intuitively \u2013 until I learned about evolution. It's very difficult to care about something that I don\u2019t even have a concept for.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-4\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Doughnuts are another alignment failure: sugar, fat, and salt were all highly-valuable nutrients in the ancestral environment, and so we evolved behaviours that sought out those nutrients (for instance, we really like how they taste). Then we created doughnuts, which did not exist in the ancestral environment. Now we collectively eat a lot of doughnuts, which is not very good for our inclusive fitness (e.g., through health issues). Here our training environment (the ancestral environment) did not generalise well to our testing environment (current-day civilisation), and so we ended up with behaviours that seemed aligned \u2013 in the sense that they improved our inclusive fitness in the training environment \u2013 but actually aren\u2019t within the context of modern society (the 'testing' or 'deployment' environment, if you will).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-5\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-5\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Evolution did its darndest to optimise us to maximise inclusive fitness: the doughnut example shows it failed to align our behaviours. And the fact that we don\u2019t even have an intuitive concept for inclusive fitness means it failed to align our goals.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-6\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<h3>Goal-directed behaviour</h3>\n<p>Okay, but do our <em>current deep learning systems</em> have goals? The obvious answer is that we don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t know very well what goes on in our AI systems. The second obvious answer is that they don\u2019t need to develop goals themselves to pose a risk. Humanity seems very happy to <a href=\"https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/\">provide GPT-4 with user-specified goals</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT\">internet access</a>. Giving AI systems goals in plain English \u2013 rather than maths \u2013 is not necessarily an improvement from a robustness perspective, because it is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas#Golden_Touch\">really hard to specify</a> exact meaning in natural language. Also, <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/126122/meet-chaos-gpt-ai-tool-destroy-humanity\">I\u2019m sure no one will actually give an AI system a bad goal, ever</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, many current deep learning models aren\u2019t trained to act as agents with goals and don\u2019t seem to coherently pursue any goals as far as we can tell. So, how might AI systems develop goals themselves? This discussion is quite technical: it probably won't make much sense to you unless you are familiar with deep learning already. Feel free to skip to the last paragraph of this section (right before: <strong>Existential risk</strong>).</p>\n<p>To start, we might train our AI systems as agents, as we typically do in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). Most researchers seem to agree that this is probably not a very safe idea for building very capable systems, for all the outer alignment reasons mentioned above. We\u2019ve even seen shadows of the inner alignment problem here, in that RL agents can learn to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07608\">implement an inner RL agent</a> in their activations. This may be an example of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01820.pdf\">mesa-optimisers</a> that we discussed in the section on inner alignment. Even avoiding RL may not necessarily help: the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165\">in-context learning</a> abilities of Transformers \u2013 the architecture underlying all LLMs \u2013 may be partially explained by their learning to do <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07677.pdf\">gradient-based training in the forward pass</a>. This is possibly an example of a mesa-optimiser emerging from training non-agentic deep learning systems.</p>\n<p>Of course, we don\u2019t know whether these mesa-optimisers are pursuing any coherent goals. We don\u2019t know whether our <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00626.pdf\">non-agentically trained AI systems</a> might <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01681\">implement agents</a> as we scale up their capabilities. Paul Christiano, one of the top AI alignment researchers, provides a brief discussion on how LLMs might become goal-directed, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dgk2eLf8DLxEG6msd/how-would-a-language-model-become-goal-directed?commentId=cbJDeSPtbyy2XNr8E\">here</a>. The (speculative) possibility of emergent goal-directed behaviour is a reason why, for example, the <a href=\"https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/05/07/ai-scientists-safe-and-useful-ai/\">science AI</a> suggested by Yoshua Bengio might not be safe (for those interested in further reading: his proposal is an example of a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/tool-ai\">tool AI</a>).</p>\n<p>So, we don\u2019t know whether AI systems will develop coherent goals purely through training, but it seems at least possible: this is very worrying. I want to stress here that <em>there are currently no alignment proposals that the community as a whole expects to work</em>. It is easy to come up with stories of how things might work out, but for now, these all fail in predictable ways.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-7\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-7\">[7]</a></sup> We'll talk more about current alignment proposals after we've finished making the argument for existential risk from AI.</p>\n<h2>Existential risk</h2>\n<p>Okay, back to our deep learning system that we are trying to align. We don\u2019t know which objective to give it, how to make sure we actually optimise it for that objective if we did know, and whether this optimisation generalises to new environments \u2013 it might not because the behaviours don\u2019t generalise well (doughnuts), or because it just learned different goals (inclusive fitness). If we don't solve these problems, we'll be dealing with a very capable AI system that is actively working against our goals. That is bad.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it is obvious why instantiating AI that has different goals from humanity is likely to end human civilisation, but the actual argument requires two more things: 1) strong capabilities, and 2) instrumental goals.</p>\n<p>Strong capabilities ('very capable AI system') means that we need to have actually succeeded in building an AI system that is capable of competently acting in the world so that it can achieve its goals. Different goals require different levels of competence: playing a video game is a lot simpler than manipulating people, but both are possible at some level of competence. One big assumption is that it's possible to build general AI that is more capable than human civilisation at all the relevant tasks (<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/\">which need not be <em>all</em> tasks</a>). This does not seem impossible in principle: humans are generally intelligent after all, and there is no reason to suppose our intelligence is the limit of what is achievable. Recently it's starting to appear more practically feasible as well, especially as our largest models seem to get more general as we scale them up. Still, it might be that the deep learning paradigm cannot get us to sufficiently capable AI. That would be a lucky break, because 1) it probably gives us more time to solve the alignment problem(s), and 2) deep learning is the most uninterpretable approach to AI we know.</p>\n<h3>Thinking about AI</h3>\n<p>To explore the point of 'instrumental goals', it\u2019s worth stressing what the field of AI alignment means by \u2018intelligence\u2019. The definition that suffices for our purposes is that: <em>\u201ca system is intelligent to the degree that its actions can be expected to achieve its goals\u201d</em>. Here intelligence is about achieving goals. The key insight here is not to think of an intelligent system as some book-smart professor that spends their day working on abstract maths problems. When we talk about creating intelligent systems, we\u2019re talking about creating smart optimisers: systems that \u2013 given some goal \u2013 change the world in such a way that that goal is achieved. People are an example of such optimisers: we have goals, and we think intelligently about how to achieve them. If the goal is difficult enough, we make plans that can span multiple years, we gather allies and resources, and we predict obstacles and try to solve those. If we want to build a road, we talk to the municipality and contractors, we buy materials, and we lobby. And if there is an anthill where we want to build the road, we bulldoze the anthill: not because we hate the ants, but because they are in the way of our goal.</p>\n<p>Bulldozing the ants is an example of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value\">instrumental goal</a>. An instrumental goal is any goal that is useful to the pursuit of the actual intrinsic goal (i.e., the thing an agent actually tries to achieve). Typical instrumental goals are self-preservation (if you don\u2019t exist, your goal is less likely to be achieved), resource accumulation (more resources means you have more options for achieving your goal), and removing adversaries (adversaries are bad for your chances of achieving your goal), which may include deceiving<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-8\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-8\">[8]</a></sup> or manipulating adversaries. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence\">Instrumental convergence</a> states that goal-directed agents will tend to pursue instrumental goals such as the three mentioned here.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-9\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The kind of intelligence that we\u2019re trying to build should be thought of as capable of planning, gathering resources, and removing obstacles. We should also keep in mind that it will be very different from humans: it has a different cognitive architecture, and it does not share the evolutionary history that makes us cooperative and empathetic. If such a system becomes capable enough \u2013 more capable than humans \u2013 and we haven\u2019t programmed it to care about human values, then we'll be dealing with a very capable AI system that is actively working against our goals/values.</p>\n<p>Such a system may take the resources -- e.g., energy, computational power, water (cooling), in the worst case even the atoms that we are made of -- that we need (the instrumental goal of resource accumulation). We won't be able to switch it off or destroy it, because that's bad for its goals (the instrumental goal of 'self-preservation'). We may not even know it is misaligned until it starts acting badly because it could deceive us about its true goals (the instrumental goal of 'removing adversaries').<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-10\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-10\">[10]</a></sup> If the system is sufficiently capable, this means that we end up with a world without human values and likely without humans. Not because the AI suddenly becomes conscious or because it hates us, or anything remotely to do with human emotions. Simply because a more capable system is better at achieving its goals than we are at ours. If we're not careful, we risk becoming the anthill.</p>\n<p>Bad outcomes don't require a single extremely capable AI trying to take over the world: we are already putting AI systems into all kinds of processes, and we are poised to continue doing this as AI systems develop more capabilities. We may be on a path of slowly giving away the power to steer our future to optimisation processes that we do not fully understand, that are optimising for some objective that is not perfectly aligned with human goals, and that may be hard (or impossible) to roll back. This can cause a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like\">slow-rolling catastrophe</a> all by itself.</p>\n<p>Even if we solve the technical alignment problem, we may still be risking a future where an AI-supported mini-elite holds global power (for instance, if they somehow take the technical solution and manage to align AI to their specific selfish values). After such a group potentially develops into a kind of global dictatorship, we may wonder what use they have for eight billion people when they control all the powerful AI systems. This very much does <em>not</em> mean we should race to build a superhumanly capable AI system because otherwise 'the bad guys' will build it first. That is extremely likely to end badly.</p>\n<p>There are many possible scenarios in between the ones mentioned here. The point is not that any individual scenario is likely to happen: predicting the future is hard, after all. The point is that there are good arguments for expecting some chance that we end up with really bad outcomes if we don't solve these issues, and we are currently not on track to solve these issues.</p>\n<h3>Alignment proposals</h3>\n<p>So how do we reduce the risk of becoming the metaphorical anthill? By solving the alignment problem, which is a way of saying: \"<em>making sure that AI systems work towards our intended goals</em>\". Note that this should include the policy issues behind making sure the goals are intended to benefit everyone.</p>\n<p>Solving the technical alignment problem is an open problem: that is, <em>we don't know how to solve it yet</em>. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07532.pdf\">Here is an overview</a> of some of the best theoretical alignment proposals we have so far. Our current best <em>practical</em> technologies for aligning large language models are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155\">Reinforcement Learning by Human Feedback</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073\">Constitutional AI</a> ('Reinforcement Learning by AI Feedback'). The former has been used to make GPT-4 more harmless and helpful, while the latter is used on Anthropic's <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude\">Claude</a>. These are both potential avenues of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03540\">scalable oversight</a>: the problem of supervising systems that potentially outperform us on most skills relevant to the task at hand. In their current form, unfortunately, they are far from sufficient, as exemplified by the <a href=\"https://www.mlyearning.org/chatgpt-4-jailbreak/\">many creatively applied methods for jailbreaking GPT-4</a>. It's currently very unclear whether methods like these will work at all for aligning more capable systems.</p>\n<p>A recurring problem in all this is that we are training our deep learning systems essentially by doing a big program search based on some optimisation objective. At the very least, this choice adds a bunch of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\">inner alignment problems</a>. It may be that a different paradigm is necessary to solve these problems. Stuart Russell\u2019s lab is one of the groups working on a proposal in this direction based on <a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/russell-nips16-cirl.pdf\">assistance games / cooperative inverse RL</a>. The idea here is to have an agent do a form of Bayesian updating over a human reward function (a way of representing human values), such that the agent is incentivised to learn about the human reward function before irreversibly acting in the real world. The <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/updated_deference/\">research community</a> is <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ikYKHkffKNJvBygXG/updated-deference-is-not-a-strong-argument-against-the\">split on</a> whether this <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TmHRACaxXrLbXb5tS/rohinmshah-s-shortform?commentId=AJLSo27nPtpTvLKTR\">can work</a>, partially precisely because it's not obvious how to design such an agent in the deep learning (program search) framework.</p>\n<p>All of this and more is what many researchers are now sounding the alarm on. In this <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/what-do-ml-researchers-think-about-ai-in-2022/\">2022 survey of machine learning researchers</a>, 48% of respondents put the probability that long-term effects of advanced AI on humanity are <em>\u201cextremely bad (e.g., human extinction)\u201d</em> at 10%.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-11\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-11\">[11]</a></sup> Note that this survey was run before Sydney/Bing and GPT-4 were released. Since then, many more researchers have publicly expressed their worries, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65139406\">the world</a> is <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/05/05/joe-biden-and-kamala-harris-meet-with-big-tech-ceos-to-address-ai-risks\">finally starting</a> to take the problem <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230505IPR84904/ai-act-a-step-closer-to-the-first-rules-on-artificial-intelligence\">more seriously</a>.</p>\n<h2>What to do?</h2>\n<p>As is hopefully clear now, there are a lot of important <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565\">open problems in AI alignment</a>, many of which we\u2019ll need to solve if we want to be sure that future \u2013 very capable \u2013 AI systems are robustly safe. We need much more research in this field, but unfortunately, there are currently <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3gmkrj3khJHndYGNe/estimating-the-current-and-future-number-of-ai-safety\">far fewer researchers</a> working on AI alignment than on AI capabilities.</p>\n<p>So what can you do? Awareness about the dangers of AI is growing, but we need much more of it. Talk to your friends, family, and colleagues; write letters to your political representatives urging them to take these issues seriously; and share the articles explaining the risks. AI policy is lagging far behind AI technology, and it cannot catch up until politicians and lawmakers feel the need to change that status quo.</p>\n<p>Interested in doing alignment research yourself? The paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00626.pdf\"><em>The Alignment Problem from a Deep Learning Perspective</em> (2023)</a> gives an overview of the research field in section 5. Victoria Krakovna\u2019s <a href=\"https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/ai-safety-resources/\">AI safety resources</a> are a good general starting point, as is the <a href=\"https://www.mlsafety.org/\">ML Safety course</a>. If you\u2019re specifically interested in technical work, consider following Richard Ngo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-alignment-curriculum\">AI Alignment Course</a> and have a look at the <a href=\"https://www.serimats.org/\">SERI-MATS programme</a>.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re more interested in policy work instead, then have a look at the <a href=\"https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-governance-curriculum\">AI Governance Course</a>. Policy work is especially important right now, because 1) reducing AI risk is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem\">not just a technical problem</a>, and 2) finding technical solutions to AI alignment will take time, which we might not have on our current course. At least OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google seem to be locked in an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/technology/ai-chatbots-google-microsoft.html\">AI arms race</a>, which does not incentivise them to act slowly and safely. Google has called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html\">'Code Red'</a> over ChatGPT, and Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, recently announced: <a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/the-race-starts-today-microsoft-officially-brings-chatgpt-ai-to-bing-and-edge-browser-369453-2023-02-08\"><em>\"It\u2019s a new day in search. The race starts today, and we\u2019re going to move and move fast.\"</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The Future of Life Institute, who spearheaded <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\">the open letter to pause giant AI experiments</a> in March, has released <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FLI_Policymaking_In_The_Pause.pdf\">a report on AI policy recommendations</a>. These are their seven recommendations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mandate robust third-party auditing and certification.</li>\n<li>Regulate access to computational power.</li>\n<li>Establish capable AI agencies at the national level.</li>\n<li>Establish liability for AI-caused harms.</li>\n<li>Introduce measures to prevent and track AI model leaks.</li>\n<li>Expand technical AI safety research funding.</li>\n<li>Develop standards for identifying and managing AI-generated content and recommendations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My personal view is that policy work is an absolutely crucial part of the solution.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-12\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-12\">[12]</a></sup> The companies (and perhaps in the future: governments) attempting to build ever more capable AI systems need stronger incentives to treat AI alignment as the difficult and hugely important problem it is. Alignment researchers need time to make progress on the technical problems, and we may not have that time unless we put the brakes on large AI training runs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-13\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-13\">[13]</a></sup> International cooperation on this seems necessary: at least when it comes to the existential risks it probably doesn't matter so much who builds the AI, as whether it is built at all and whether the system is aligned. OpenAI trying and failing, Google trying and failing, Microsoft trying and failing, or even the US or Chinese governments trying and failing may look very similar in terms of the outcome for humanity.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-14\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-14\">[14]</a></sup></p>\n<p>AI has the potential to do incredible good in the world. The obvious example of vastly improved healthcare is only the beginning of what we could achieve with robustly aligned AI systems. Unfortunately, I worry that this is not the future we are currently headed for, but the public outcry of the last few months is a hopeful sign. Let's build on this momentum to put systems in place that lead to a positive future: the seven recommendations above are a good start.</p>\n<h3>Closing</h3>\n<p>This has been my attempt to convey the incredible importance of solving AI alignment in the form of a blog post. When I first read about this problem in 2014, I figured we\u2019d have a long time to solve it: plenty of time to finish my master\u2019s in physics, study a bit more to then do a PhD in machine learning, and get to work on technical alignment research afterwards. The rapid progress in deep learning over the past ten years has changed my views on this, and as a result, I\u2019ve been trying to create more awareness by <a href=\"https://dezwijger.nl/programma/existential-risks-of-artificial-intelligence\">speaking</a> and -- now -- blogging. It\u2019s been surreal to see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window\">Overton window</a> around AI risk widened so quickly over the past months, and I\u2019m very happy that big names in the research community \u2013 such as Geoffrey Hinton \u2013 are speaking out. There is much more to say and far more to do(!), but this post is already much longer than I intended it to be.</p>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"https://www.tbbakker.nl/\">contact me</a> with any related questions or requests.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>How models acquire these capabilities is a topic of active research, but those of you who\u2019ve read the previous blog posts may have guessed part of my own suspicion: simplicity prior + lots of data = learning rules that generalise to new tasks. Say we are ChatGPT and we want to predict the next word in sentences where a person is writing angrily. During training, we can learn good predictions (on the training data) in roughly two ways: 1) memorise the training data, 2) learn a rule that generates the training data; e.g., learn to detect when a person\u2019s writing is angry and then predict that angry people are more likely to use insults. We want 2), because 1) does not generalise to new data (or tasks) at all. How can we achieve this? Remember Bayes\u2019 theorem (in log space for simplicity): posterior = likelihood + prior. The hypothesis that memorises all the data is hugely complex \u2013 in the information-theoretic sense \u2013 compared to the hypothesis that a simple rule explains the training data, and so the model will tend to the latter assuming it has seen enough data. This is because the prior on the latter hypothesis is stronger, while the likelihood is similar (both hypotheses nearly perfectly explain the training data).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-15\" id=\"fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-15\">[15]</a></sup> In our angry writing example we will need to see a lot of data because the concept of \u2018anger\u2019 is not simple to specify, but as we see more and more data it does become simpler than \u2018memorise all the data\u2019. <a href=\"#fnref-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-Wfu6DCvbLhy2ai9zd-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Mechanistic interpretability is hugely valuable from a safety perspective.

Introduction: Healthy Futures Global and its Origins</h1><p>Keyur and Nils are excited to announce the launch of Healthy Futures Global, a new organisation originating from Charity Entrepreneurship's latest incubation programme, dedicated to making a positive impact on global health.</p><p>Healthy Futures\u2019 mission is to improve maternal and newborn health by focusing on the elimination of congenital syphilis, a preventable but devastating disease that affects millions of families worldwide.</p><h1>II. The Problem: Congenital Syphilis' Global Impact</h1><p>Syphilis in pregnancy is a pressing global health issue. It causes approximately 60,000&nbsp; newborn deaths and 140,000 (almost 10% of global) stillbirths annually, contributing up to 50% of all stillbirths in some regions (1, 2, 3, 4).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Antenatal syphilis also causes lifelong disabilities for many surviving children, often going unaddressed in many countries. This disability can include cognitive impairment, vision and hearing deficits, bone deformity, and liver dysfunction. If a pregnant woman has syphilis, her child has a 12% chance of neonatal death, 16% chance of stillbirth, and 25% chance of disability (5).</p><h1>III. The Solution: Test and Treat Strategy</h1><p>The theory of change (below) is a hybrid between direct intervention, technical assistance and policy work.&nbsp;<strong>It involves</strong>&nbsp;<strong>lobbying governments for policy support, and supporting governments, local NGOs and antenatal clinics to roll out dual HIV/Syphilis tests.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The key components of the approach involve rapid testing (RDTs) during antenatal care and immediate treatment with antibiotics (BPG) for positive cases.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/qn5v8dsyrexoni6pdyil\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/gbysslblswsh66erowmk 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/bupognbwsmhgocdtxdc4 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/x3uxmqrfxdupoefwqcud 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/e8iiv2qtmfpotzftyk2j 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/xo21z7kiihbrrranq9ot 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/phbarhgogcdkfcaqftqn 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/z71tbtah8onbcedvzv3w 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/vai1usevqlhiqfpx3s1s 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/xgcs6mz87hv3x5gembel 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dFWGSMRqWNbrQtdvK/hshgvjyrslzsnc8qinfg 1600w\"></p><p>The main strengths of Healthy Futures are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Cost effectiveness:</strong> The strategy has the potential to cost-effectively save lives, prevent disabilities, and reduce the burden on health systems. Our analysis gives us an expected value of $2,400 per life saved and ~10x the cost-effectiveness of direct cash transfers. The medical evidence for positive effects of treating the pregnant woman and her baby is strong (6).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation:</strong> The direct nature of this intervention offers quick feedback loops, allowing us to re-evaluate our strategy accordingly.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Track record:</strong> Keyur is a medical doctor and Nils brings a background of consulting for pharmaceutical companies and global health organisations. Their backgrounds are a good fit for this type of intervention.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Organisational fuel:</strong> Healthy Futures benefits from ongoing mentoring from Charity Entrepreneurship and previously incubated charities.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>IV. Challenges, Risks and Mitigation</h1><p>The challenges Healthy Futures plans to address are (ranked according to severity x likelihood of occurring - highest on top):</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Implementational challenges:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> The long-term success and cost-effectiveness of this intervention depend on governments making the necessary changes in the health care system and establishing mechanisms for sustainable change. -&gt; Healthy Futures will focus on engaging with national, regional and local governments to ensure change is initiated and sustained at all levels.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Data availability:</strong> Publicly available data reporting in low and middle income countries on sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis is often low quality. -&gt; The co-founders plan to connect with independent researchers, research institutions, global and local NGOs, and the ministries of health to obtain or generate higher quality data.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Local trust:</strong> Healthy Futures will be operating in foreign countries and will face unknown unknowns, such as cultural barriers and communication challenges. -&gt; Healthy Futures prioritises meeting and collaborating with local organisations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supply chain:</strong> Penicillin requires a cold chain and has historically been prone to stock-outs. Medical staff may be hesitant to be retrained on dual tests, e.g. due to competing priorities and lack of incentives to improve standard of care. -&gt; Healthy Futures will collect data on stock-outs and weak links of the supply chain, and closely work with health care providers to understand and adapt to their context.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Ethical considerations/challenges:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Counterfactual impact:</strong> This intervention is fairly likely to occur even without us eventually (in some countries expected within the next 5-10). Our counterfactual impact mostly stems from implementing it earlier than it would have been implemented without us. -&gt; Healthy Futures needs to act fast, and is open to change course or cancel operations if re-evaluation meetings point to this conclusion.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ethics:</strong> The moral value of reducing stillbirths and newborn deaths can be questionable from certain ethical points of view. -&gt; Healthy Futures will follow an approach of discounting DALYs for those moral considerations, informed by GiveWell\u2019s methodology (7).</li></ul><h1>V. One-Year Plan: Pilot Projects in the Philippines and Tanzania</h1><p><strong>Year 1 focuses on identifying the right pilot country and preparing a country-wide roll-out of dual tests.</strong> The countries were evaluated by primarily looking at the number of preventable antenatal syphilis cases, the gap between HIV and syphilis testing in pregnancy, capability of the country's health system, policies supporting dual tests, and lack of other organisations working on antenatal syphilis.&nbsp;</p><p>The Philippines and Tanzania seem most promising. In order to confirm the scale, tractability and neglectedness of antenatal syphilis testing, the co-founders will visit and try to meet with local and global NGOs, and political and health care leaders in the Philippines (24 May to 16 June) and Tanzania (19 June to 17 July).&nbsp;</p><p>Within the first year of operations the co-founders expect to prevent around 7 newborn deaths and stillbirths, and over 2,000 within 5 years.&nbsp;</p><h1>VI.

Yet unfortunately, at the very heart of it is the word that signifies the ethical error behind it: human. Humanism is about promoting flourishing for humans, a project which, unfortunately, ignores the overwhelming majority of sentient beings on Earth.</p><p>Of course, some call themselves humanists and care about animals. With these people, my dispute is just terminological. It would be as if one wanted to promote the welfare of all people, but described their view as whitism\u2014a view originally defined as being about promoting the welfare of white interests. While I\u2019d be broadly on board with their aims\u2014if they truly cared about all people equally\u2014I\u2019d think they should probably change their slogan.</p><p>In place of humanism, many have proposed <a href=\"https://sentientism.info/\">sentientism</a>. Sentientism claims\u2014like humanism\u2014that we should use logic, reason, and evidence to advance welfare. However, it claims, unlike humanism, that we should advance the welfare of all sentient beings, not merely humans.</p><p>Sentientists often claim that humanism is objectionably arbitrary. If two beings have similar mental capacities, why in the world should it matter if one is a homo sapien? In reply, people sometimes claim that sentientism is arbitrary\u2014why should we only care about sentient beings? Here, I shall provide several arguments for sentientism, and against the charge of arbitrariness.</p><h1>It\u2019s intuitive</h1><p>Here\u2019s one argument for sentientism\u2014it is intuitive that only sentient beings matter. Most of us think that people matter but philosophical zombies\u2014beings that are physically identical to humans but lacking in consciousness\u2014do not matter. If they really have no conscious experience\u2014no hopes, no dreams, no aspirations, no pain, no thoughts, no love\u2014then it seems that nothing that happens to them really matters. If all is really dark inside the zombie, then it seems that nothing that happens to us matters.</p><p>Of course, one might reply that it is intuitive that only humans matter. But this is clearly wrong\u2014if a being is in unimaginable agony, it seems that it\u2019s pain is bad regardless of whether it is a homo sapien. If one found out that actually, despite being consciously identical to the rest of you, I was secretly a bulldog (though I suppose I haven\u2019t done a great job covering it up) my suffering would not seem to be any less bad. If we found out that people from Italy, for example, were as smart and conscious as humans, but were not homo sapiens, we would not declare their suffering irrelevant.</p><p>Of course, when confronted with this, the speceisists either bite the bullet or adopt crazy criteria. For example, they will say that what matters is being the same species as beings that are mostly smart. Of course, none of these criteria are immune from counterexample\u2014in the case of the most recent criteria, it would imply that if we find out that some terminally ill babies are not technically homo sapiens, their pain isn\u2019t bad, and that if we found out that mentally disabled people weren\u2019t homo sapiens, it would imply that their suffering wasn\u2019t bad too. But even if they can gerrymander some contorted criterion to avoid counterexample\u2014which just to be clear, none of them have successfully done, ever\u2014it will not be intuitive. It does not seem intuitively like the necessary and sufficient conditions that determine whether one matters involve 31 steps and the intelligence of other beings that one can interbreed with.</p><p>So sentientism just seems right. Whenever one claims that some criteria justifies some property, it is always possible to declare it arbitrary. However, if it seems like the type of criteria that can, in fact, justify that property, then it is not arbitrary. Just like it\u2019s not arbitrary to claim that one should have to be good at boxing to be a professional boxer, if the criteria that justifies some way of being treated is actually able to justify it, then it is far from arbitrary.</p><h1>Theories of welfare</h1><p>Suppose one says that any way of determining which entities to care about is arbitrary. Presumably then, they will think that the only thing that matters is whether some entity can be harmed or not. If a plant can\u2019t be harmed or benefitted by any action, even if it is within our moral circle, we need not take into account the impact of our actions on plants, just as if our moral circle includes all humans, we\u2019ll still only take into account the effect of our actions on those humans who our action affects.</p><p>Thus, sentientism is consistent with a maximally inclusive moral circle. As long as we think that only sentient beings can be harmed or benefitted, we can care about all possible entities\u2014sentient and nonsentient\u2014and nonetheless, we\u2019ll conclude that the only ones that matter practically\u2014the only ones we should take into account in our decisions, are the sentient ones.</p><p>Philosophers have explored ways that one can he harmed and benefitted. There are a few primary ones, all of which imply sentientism.</p><p>Hedonism: happiness is the only thing that is good for anyone, pain is the only thing that is bad for anyone. This implies sentientism because only sentient beings can be happy.</p><p>Desire theory: getting what one wants is good for them, having their desires frustrated is bad for them. This implies sentientism because only sentient beings have desires.</p><p>Objective list theory: there are a list of things that are good for people including knowledge, friendship, happiness, desire fulfillment, achievement, and more. These, on most plausible accounts, all require sentience.</p><p>So in order to avoid sentientism, one has to have an utterly bizarre view of welfare\u2014according to which various mysterious things are good or bad for people.</p><h1>The transformation test</h1><p>One way of testing whether an entity matters is to imagine oneself being turned into that entity and ask whether they\u2019d have a reason to care about what happened to them after they were that entity. For example, if we want to know if pigs matter, we imagine being slowly turned into a pig over the course of two years. The question is whether, after one was fully pig, they would rationally care about whether they were tortured.</p><p>Of course they would! If I knew by 2025 I\u2019d be a pig, I\u2019d be very against the pig version of me being tortured. But if I knew I\u2019d turn into a plant, I wouldn\u2019t care. Once I was a plant, nothing would happen to me\u2014I\u2019d have no experience. If you think you wouldn\u2019t, remember, there are debilitating mental conditions that leave people at less than the level of a pig. If one would care about what happened to themself after that point, so too should they care about what would happen to them if they were a pig.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Thus, it is only conscious beings that matter. Claiming that conscious beings matter is not arbitrary and is quite intuitive. It seems obvious that plants only matter if they\u2019re conscious\u2014likewise for animals. This follows from every remotely plausible view of welfare.</p>", "user": {"username": "Omnizoid"}}, {"_id": "yWRJFAmEzofnsuHNK", "title": "U.S. Regulatory Updates to Benefit-Cost Analysis: Highlights and Encouragement to Submit Public Comments", "postedAt": "2023-05-18T06:37:49.823Z", "htmlBody": "<p>On April 6, 2023, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget released a draft of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DannyBressler1/status/1644084992601907200?s=20\">first update to the Federal benefit-cost analysis (BCA) guidelines in 20 years</a>. I saw a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/12/23679106/biden-policy-future-discount-rate\">nice article</a> in Vox Future Perfect and a nice&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/StBjwzACS7qtWGkoN/planned-updates-to-u-s-regulatory-analysis-methods-are\">EA forum post</a> that covered this. These posts cover some of the key points, but I think there are other important updates that might be overlooked. I will highlight some of those below.&nbsp;</p><p>The key new documents stipulating the new draft BCA guidelines are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4.pdf\">Circular A-4</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4Preamble.pdf\">The Circular A-4 Preamble</a></li><li><a href=\"https://whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/circulara94.pdf\">Circular A-94</a></li></ul><p>Why is the update important? Since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12866\">1993</a>, U.S. agencies have been required to conduct a regulatory analysis of all significant regulatory actions (the definition of which was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/06/executive-order-on-modernizing-regulatory-review/\">just revised</a> from a rule with an annual impact of more than $100 million to $200 million), which includes an assessment of the costs and benefits of the action. Essentially, all major regulatory actions in the U.S. are subject to BCA, guided by Circular A-4.</p><p>However, these updated guidance documents are still drafts. They are subject to public comment and peer review and may be changed significantly in light of the feedback received in this process.&nbsp;</p><p>If you think that some of these highlights or other parts of the new A-4 and A-94 are a good idea (or if you don\u2019t) I\u2019d highly recommend submitting a public comment via the Regulations.gov system (<a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/OMB-2022-0014-0001\">A-4 link</a> and <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/OMB-2023-0011-0001\">A-94 link)</a>. <strong><u>The deadline for public comments is June 6</u><sup><u>th</u></sup></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Positive comments that support the approach taken in the document are equally and often more useful/impactful than critical comments. If everyone who dislikes something criticizes it, and everyone who supports something doesn\u2019t bother mentioning their support, it looks like everyone who had an opinion opposed it! So, if you like the approach taken (or don\u2019t), please write a comment! Also, note that comments supported with the analytical reasons why the approach is (or is not) justified are generally more useful and taken more seriously.</p><p>Now on to the highlights:</p><h1><strong>Short-Term Discount Rate</strong></h1><ul><li>As the Vox article mentioned, the new update to Circular A-4 significantly lowers the&nbsp;<strong>discount</strong>&nbsp;<strong>rate&nbsp;</strong>to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4.pdf#page=76\">1.7% near-term discount rate</a>. This of course is a large change from the previous 3% rate, but this comes from just using a similar method to the previous 2003 A-4 method with more recent Treasury yield data. The preamble has a deeper dive into this calculation and asks the public a number of questions about whether there is a better approach, for those who are interested.&nbsp;</li><li>The draft Circular A-4 continues to take a \u201cdescriptive\u201d approach to discounting in which market data is used to determine the observed tradeoffs people make between money now and money in the future. The discount rate is now lower simply because yields have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1644086691614031873?s=20\">steadily declining for the last 20 years</a>.&nbsp;<ul><li>There are good reasons to believe that rates will continue to be low, but it\u2019s also important to emphasize that if rates are not low in the future, then this near-term discount rate will go up again. This is why from the perspective of placing more weight on the future, the next bullets may be more important.</li></ul></li></ul><h1><strong>Long-Term Declining Discount Rate</strong></h1><ul><li>A related important change (and more robust to future interest rate fluctuations) is that A-4 and A-94 endorse the general concept of declining discount rates, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4Preamble.pdf\">A-4 preamble</a> proposed and asked for comment on a specific declining&nbsp;discount rate schedule,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>which discounts the future at progressively lower rates to account for future interest rate uncertainty. This is in line with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1093/reep/reu008#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20however%2C%20the%20Office%20of,public%20projects%2C%20especially%20those%20that%20affect%20future%20generations%3F\">approach</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.5.538\">recommended</a> in the literature based on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069602000311\">best available economics</a>, and also ends up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506969891052X\">placing larger weight</a> on the future.&nbsp;Since the proposed schedule was specifically placed in the preamble and not A-4, those who think it should be (or should not be) included in the final A-4 should make sure to comment on the schedule in particular.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1><strong>Temporal Scope of Analysis</strong></h1><ul><li>Discount rates are important, but only those benefits and costs that are chosen to be within the temporal scope of analysis are available to be discounted. E.g., if one analyzes a long-run policy and only includes impacts on people already born and ignores impacts on future generations that don't yet exist, this ends up placing comparatively little value on the future even when using a low discount rate.</li><li>The new A-4 has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4.pdf#page=11\">nice brief section</a> that makes it clear that the time frame of the analysis must be long enough to encompass all of the important benefits and costs likely to result from the policy. For instance, it emphasizes the importance of accounting for the impact that a catastrophic event would have on future generations (even if they are indirectly and not directly impacted).<ul><li>Note that the U.S. had previously been accounting for the<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TechnicalSupportDocument_SocialCostofCarbonMethaneNitrousOxide.pdf\"> impacts of climate change</a> out to 500 years in BCA through the use of the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, so impacts on future generations had been taken into account in that context. However, it is nice that the new A-4 spells out clearly that impacts on future generations should be taken into account whenever they are relevant. This is consistent with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/modernizing-regulatory-review/\">President Biden\u2019s Day 1 presidential memorandum</a> that started this process and which emphasizes promoting the interests of future generations among other values.</li></ul></li></ul><h1><strong>Spatial Scope of Analysis</strong></h1><ul><li>There is a robust&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4.pdf#page=9\">discussion</a> around the conditions under which it is important for analysts to include global impacts, such as \"regulating an externality on the basis of its global effects supports a cooperative international approach to the regulation of the externality by potentially inducing other countries to follow suit or maintain existing efforts.\"&nbsp;<ul><li>This recognizes that global externalities/risks like pandemics, biosecurity, climate change, etc. require international regulatory cooperation. If, e.g., a new global pandemic is caused by poor biosecurity regulatory oversight in other countries, this harms Americans. Both because Americans will get sick and die, but also because disruptions in other countries will cause significant harm to the global economy, global trade, and global stability that will in turn harm Americans. Just as poor biosecurity regulatory oversight in the U.S. causing a pandemic will cause harm in other countries for the same reasons.</li><li>Note that this is also the approach that the U.S. Government has taken to account for climate change in BCA through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/epa_scghg_report_draft_0.pdf#page=16\">Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases by considering global damages</a> from climate change and not just domestic damages. As that document states, global externalities like greenhouse gas emissions and biosecurity policy imply that the whole world enjoys the benefit of one country\u2019s decisions to reduce the harm from the global externality, and therefore \u201cthe only way to achieve an efficient allocation of resources for emissions reduction on a global basis\u2014and so benefit the U.S. and its citizens and residents\u2014is for all countries to consider estimates of global marginal damages\u201d from the externality as well as the global marginal benefits of taking actions to reduce the externality.</li></ul></li></ul><h1><strong>Distributional Weighting</strong></h1><ul><li>The draft&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4.pdf#page=65\">A-4</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/circulara94.pdf#page=15\">A-94</a> discuss how traditional benefit-cost analysis often assumes that everyone values a marginal dollar of costs or benefits equally. I.e., it counts a marginal dollar to a billionaire the same as a marginal dollar to someone on the poverty line. The new guidance allows analysts to account for diminishing marginal utility using distributional weights (which have also been called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30648/w30648.pdf\">welfare weights</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Acland%2C_Greenberg_%282022%29_PRINCIPLES_AND_PRACTICES_FOR_DISTRIBUTIONAL_WEIGHTING--A_NEW_APPROACH.pdf\">equity weights</a>, among other terms). The weight is constructed based on estimates for the curvature of the utility function (which controls how much marginal utility diminishes). The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4Preamble.pdf#page=15\">preamble</a> considers multiple lines of evidence to estimate that the utility function has a curvature parameter of 1.4 (the U.K., for instance, uses a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063330/Green_Book_2022.pdf#page=106\">curvature parameter of 1.3</a>).&nbsp;<ul><li>Note also that &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-updates-to-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework/\">Open Philanthropy's Cause Prioritization Framework</a> also accounts for diminishing marginal utility, although they estimate that marginal utility diminishes at a slightly lower rate (they estimate a curvature parameter of 1, i.e. log utility).&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Valuing Lives Equally</h1><ul><li>When valuing lives, the draft A-4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4.pdf#page=66\">directs</a> agencies to value lives at the same value as opposed to valuing the lives of rich people more than poor people (because rich people are willing to pay more to avoid mortality risk than poor people):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u201c\u2026 it is appropriate to use a value for mortality risk reductions (sometimes referred to as the value of a statistical life, or VSL) that does not depend on the income of the sub-population to which the mortality risk reduction benefits accrue\u2026\u201d<ul><li>Note that, as mentioned in the draft A-4, if you value lives using a VSL that varies with income, but then distributionally weight those values, you end up valuing lives equally. This gets a bit technical, but I co-authored a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w30648\">paper</a> that discusses this for those interested (<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59bf26af29f187c6f3a9fbbf/t/636aec8967458c70ed3714d3/1667951753978/11.2.22+Valuing+the+Excess+Deaths+Caused+by+Climate+Change+vF.pdf\">unpaywalled</a>).</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Break-Even Analysis</h1><ul><li>On the topic of BCA related to catastrophes,&nbsp;break-even analysis<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is another important tool&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4.pdf#page=46\">suggested by the draft A-4</a>. Break-even analysis provides a way forward when there is a high degree of uncertainty/ambiguity in important parameters, and you need to determine what those parameters would need to be for the policy to still yield positive net benefits. This is particularly relevant for catastrophic events: \u201cFor example, there may be instances where you have estimates of the expected outcome of a type of catastrophic event, but assessing the change in the probability of such an event may be difficult. Your break-even analysis could demonstrate how much a regulatory alternative would need to reduce the probability of a catastrophic event occurring in order to yield positive net benefits or change which regulatory alternative is most net beneficial.\u201d<ul><li>There has been a lot of focus on estimating the probability of catastrophic risks, e.g., &nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/ord_table.png\">Table 6.1</a> in the Precipice, and various estimates are referred to in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DiGL5FuLgWActPBsf/how-much-should-governments-pay-to-prevent-catastrophes\">Carl Shulman and Elliot Thornley</a>\u2019s recent paper on BCA and catastrophic risks. For the purposes of BCA for U.S. regulatory impact assessments, my sense is that these probabilities may be viewed as too speculative (at least for anthropogenic risks) and may be challenged in getting through the various processes that BCAs for regulations must go through including public comment, OIRA review, etc. Fortunately, break-even analysis provides a way forward here.</li></ul></li></ul><h1><strong>Accounting for Risk Aversion</strong></h1><ul><li>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DraftCircularA-4.pdf#page=71\">draft A-4 instructs</a> BCA practitioners to explicitly account for&nbsp;uncertainty<strong>&nbsp;</strong>when doing BCA as well as&nbsp;<strong>risk aversion</strong>&nbsp;across that uncertainty. This ends up placing more weight on the benefits that help to avoid catastrophes, and thus would tend to favor policies that reduce the probability of catastrophes (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1644086694600409088?s=20\">pandemic preparedness</a>).</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "DannyBressler"}}, {"_id": "nTdoWokECy7CDyLSs", "title": "How can people with low career capitol have a high impact?", "postedAt": "2023-05-18T08:52:36.896Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey everyone!

By applying equal standards, they aim to advance animal welfare in exporting countries with lower levels of animal welfare.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention</strong></p><p>There are significant differences between farmed animal welfare standards across the globe, with billions of animals still confined in factory farms. Due to a lack of protective measures, even regions with higher standards (like the EU, the UK, Switzerland and New Zealand) tend to import a significant portion of their animal products from countries where animals experience significant suffering.</p><p>The countries with higher welfare standards can apply their norms to imported animal products by restricting access to low-welfare animal products that would have been illegal to produce domestically. By doing so, this can incentivise farmers elsewhere to increase their standards to maintain their access to existing supply chains.</p><p>A law restricting the importation of low-welfare products provides a unique win-win opportunity for both animal advocates and farmers in higher welfare countries, especially in New Zealand, the first country of operation. Some farmers are facing tough competition from low-priced low-welfare imports, and are demanding more equal standards between imports and local produce. This issue is especially pertinent since New Zealand\u2019s decision to phase out farrowing crates on local pig farms by December 2025.</p><p><strong>Near-term plans</strong></p><p>Starting in mid-June, Animal Policy International will spend several weeks in their first country of operation, New Zealand. They will focus on establishing connections with government officials, industry groups, and NGOs. The plan is to gather information that will help them improve their intervention approach.</p><p>They will also:</p><ul><li>Publish evidence to support their ask, by producing and distributing a policy brief</li><li>Conduct a public opinion poll to begin to build evidence of public support for a ban</li><li>Conduct research on the legality of import restrictions</li><li>Monitor developments in other promising countries, establish key contacts, and develop a response plan</li></ul><p><strong>Predicted impact</strong></p><p>A law restricting the importation of low-welfare animal products in New Zealand could save approximately 8 million fish per year from suffering poor living conditions, transportation, and slaughter practices, spare 330,000 pigs from cruel farrowing crates, and 380,000 chickens from inhumane living conditions. Furthermore, successfully introducing the law in a single country could set a positive international precedent that could help achieve similar wins in other regions, and improve the lives of millions more globally.</p><p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p><p>Expected cost-effectiveness is ~7 animals helped per dollar in the first country, New Zealand. In the welfare points (WP) system the impact is 36.46 WPs per charity dollar.</p><p><strong>Room for more funding in 2023: </strong>$51,000. At the moment they have enough funds to last around nine months on a lean budget. Additional funding means they would be fully funded for the first 12 months, allowing them to focus all their efforts on executing the intervention until March 2024. It would also allow them to hire a local contractor at additional hours, and spend more time in-country networking with stakeholders to improve and speed up their work, increasing their impact.</p><h2>ANSH</h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/fFgfkZm7SHWQ2Lwyh/ued5mc2sih6rj1lu97ad\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Co-founders: </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/supriya-bansal-/\"><strong><u>Supriya Bansal</u></strong></a> (Director of Research and Partnerships) and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetan-kharbanda-7044b1105/\"><strong><u>Chetan Kharbanda</u></strong></a><br><strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.ansh.health/\"><u>ansh.health</u></a><br><strong>Email address</strong>: supriya@ansh.health, <a href=\"mailto:chetan@ansh.health\"><u>chetan@ansh.health</u></a><br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ansh-health/\"><strong><u>LinkedIn</u></strong></a><br><strong>CE Incubation Grant</strong>: $130,000</p><p><strong>Description of the intervention</strong></p><p>Ansh builds healthcare capacity to provide \u201cKangaroo Care\u201d, an exceptionally simple and scientifically-proven treatment to avert newborn deaths. This intervention aims to be as cost-effective as GiveWell\u2019s top charities.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention</strong></p><p>In 2020, an estimated 2.4 million children globally died within the first month of their lives. India alone accounted for 22% of these newborn deaths. Around 80% of neonatal deaths happen in babies who are born with a low birth weight, which makes it the leading risk factor for mortality among children under five years of age.</p><p>A simple solution has the potential to significantly reduce these deaths: placing low birth weight infants directly onto the parent's chest for skin-to-skin contact, an intervention known as Kangaroo Care. Kangaroo Care entails not only prolonged and continuous skin-to-skin contact, but also exclusive breastfeeding and close monitoring of the infant.</p><p>Kangaroo Care has been shown to reduce mortality by around a third (compared to standard care using electric incubators) and reduce morbidity from common conditions like hypothermia. KC has also been shown to help reduce mortality from severe infections like sepsis, and help newborns gain weight.</p><p>However, adoption barriers for Kangaroo Care in LMICs, such as India, persist. These include insufficient equipment, a shortage of human resources, and a lack of privacy within healthcare facilities. Many of the target healthcare facilities even lack the infrastructure for conventional standards of care (i.e., electric incubators), further amplifying the potential impact of Kangaroo Care in low-resource settings.</p><p>Ansh\u2019s approach is both direct and cost-effective: repurpose existing hospital spaces to facilitate Kangaroo Care, provide essential equipment like infant weighing scales and cloth binders, and expand capacity by training and hiring health workers dedicated to teaching and monitoring Kangaroo Care for mothers in the wards.</p><p><strong>Near-term plans</strong></p><p>Ansh plans to move to India by the end of May and start building strong partnerships with the state government and partner NGOs. With the help of advisors, identified experts, and context-specific stakeholders (which will include nurses, beneficiaries and administration staff at public health facilities), they will refine their intervention and make it context-specific.</p><p>During this time, they will also develop a well-defined M&amp;E strategy, and start setting up in public facilities. This will include training for healthcare workers, providing equipment such as curtains, infant weighing scale and cloth binders, and potentially hiring Kangaroo Care support staff.</p><p>Within the next four months, their goal is to launch a fully functional pilot in one district of a top-priority state, and start supporting parents to provide Kangaroo Care to their low birth weight babies.</p><p><strong>Predicted impact</strong></p><p>70-105 neonatal deaths could be prevented in the first year of operation in India.</p><p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p><p>Ansh estimates that, in the first year of operation, they can save a life for less than $2500 in one district in India, averting a DALY for just $48 (10x-12x direct cash transfers). At scale, they could save a life for less than $1500, averting a DALY for just $26 (19x direct cash transfers).</p><p><strong>Room for more funding in 2023</strong>: With $70,000 more in funding, they can cover all public facilities in one Indian district. This would allow them to build higher quality evidence for running this charity at scale, and potentially meet GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness standards once their pilot is operational.</p><h2>HEALTHY FUTURES GLOBAL</h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/fFgfkZm7SHWQ2Lwyh/unueyzlhdnbsfinnpypi\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Co-founders: </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nils-voelker/\"><u>Nils Voelker</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/keyur-doolabh/\"><u>Keyur Doolabh</u></a><br><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.healthyfutures.global/\"><u>healthyfutures.global</u></a><br><strong>Email address:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:info@HealthyFutures.Global\">info@HealthyFutures.Global</a><br><strong>CE Incubation Grant:</strong> $190,000</p><p><strong>Description of the intervention</strong></p><p>Healthy Futures Global works to test and treat pregnant women for syphilis. This stops syphilis transmission from mother to child, and prevents newborn deaths, stillbirths, and disability.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention</strong></p><p>Mother-to-child transmission of syphilis causes 60,000 newborn deaths and 140,000 stillbirths each year, making it the second leading cause of stillbirths. Babies that survive can have lifelong disabilities, including cognitive impairment, bone deformity, and liver dysfunction. Despite this, many pregnant women globally are not tested for syphilis.</p><p>Healthy Futures will boost antenatal syphilis testing by utilizing the established screening infrastructure for HIV. Thanks to HIV rapid tests, global HIV screening rates during pregnancy are high. Newer rapid tests, approved by the WHO, can detect both HIV and syphilis. Healthy Futures will help governments shift to using these dual tests, and help them treat syphilis cases with penicillin. This reduces the chance of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis by 97%.</p><p><strong>Near-term plans</strong></p><p>From mid-May, they will spend two months in the most promising countries they have found - the Philippines (starting May 24th) and Tanzania (starting June 18th). They will use that time to build relationships with government officials and potential partner NGOs, as well as to refine their intervention approach.</p><p>They then plan to pilot the syphilis dual tests and penicillin treatments in about three antenatal clinics over seven months, before lobbying and assisting the government to roll out the dual testing country-wide. This could include drafting updated clinical guidelines, coordinating procurement with manufacturers, providing training materials for health workers, and helping governments secure institutional funding.</p><p><strong>Predicted impact </strong>127,000 - 207,000 DALYs averted in their first country</p><p><strong>Cost-effectiveness </strong>9-11x more cost-effective than cash transfers</p><p><strong>Room for more funding in 2023:</strong> $65,000, to allow them to operate in nine extra antenatal clinics, test another 3,600 pregnant women, and avert another 375 DALYs in their first year.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>HEALTHLEARN</h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/fFgfkZm7SHWQ2Lwyh/w8fijeaqtzsxurshsudt\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Founder: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mthomas47/\"><u>Marshall Thomas</u></a><br>Website: <a href=\"https://healthlearn.org\"><u>https://healthlearn.org</u></a><br>Email address <a href=\"mailto:contact@healthlearn.org\"><u>contact@healthlearn.org</u></a><br>CE Incubation Grant: $130,000</p><p><strong>Description of the intervention</strong></p><p>HealthLearn trains health workers in developing countries with simple, mobile-optimized, case-based online courses. Through recent courses developed by their team, they have already proven that they can train thousands of health workers in Africa with high completion rates and strong learning gains. They will use these online courses to teach straightforward, knowledge-based practices that save lives, starting with newborn care and moving on to many of the leading causes of readily preventable deaths.</p><p>The learning experience is inspired by Duolingo: rather than passively watching videos, health workers actively engage by answering questions and receiving feedback on realistic clinical cases. Our analyses show that this approach, applied to newborn care, has the potential to be highly cost-effective. By teaching best clinical practices that address the most common causes of preventable deaths, HealthLearn can become a new tool for strengthening health systems in developing countries.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention</strong></p><p>There are millions of newborn deaths every year; some of these deaths are easily averted when health workers implement up-to-date clinical practices. For example, studies <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29097178/\"><u>show</u></a> that waiting at least 30 seconds to clamp and cut the umbilical cord at birth prevents 32% of preterm newborn deaths. If delayed cord clamping were universally implemented, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00355-0/\"><u>it would avert</u></a> over 140,000 newborn deaths annually. In many cases, these recommended approaches are simpler and cost less than current practices. Unfortunately, life-saving clinical recommendations are often \u201ctrapped\u201d in dense guidance documents, so we still live in a world where many health workers don\u2019t provide up-to-date care because they aren\u2019t aware of current best practices.</p><p>According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/facility-based-maternal-and-neonatal-health-interventions\"><u>report</u></a> by GiveWell, training facility-based health workers to provide better care at birth reduces newborn deaths by 33%; such training may be among the most cost-effective health programs known. HealthLearn have recently developed and <a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-12943-1\"><u>piloted</u></a> a new approach to train health workers online with simple, engaging, case-based courses. They aim to apply the same approach to other topics, starting with newborn care, to create a new, cost-effective way to upskill health workers and lower the burden of readily preventable deaths.</p><p><strong>Near-term plans</strong></p><p>In the next year, they will test key uncertainties in the HealthLearn model by piloting a newborn care course, training \u22651,500 health workers in one country in Africa. They will measure uptake, knowledge gains, and improvements in clinical practice. They will use what they learn to either pivot or accelerate towards a rigorous evaluation of the impact of HealthLearn at scale.</p><p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p><p>GiveWell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/facility-based-maternal-and-neonatal-health-interventions\"><u>research</u></a> suggests that in-person health worker training is in the range of cost-effectiveness of the charities that it currently funds. When operating at scale, HealthLearn estimates a cost of $6 - $43 per DALY averted (&gt;15X cash transfers).</p><p><strong>How you can help</strong></p><p>Volunteering: Experienced full-stack engineers, public health professionals, and technology business executives can help HealthLearn maximize its impact and chances of success.</p><p>Connections: The HealthLearn team is looking for partner organizations that work in primary health centers and are eager to test out innovative training approaches.</p><p>Funding: With an additional $32,000 in funding in 2023, they will be able to launch a larger-scale evaluation of the impact of HealthLearn on health worker clinical practices. This would begin to address one of the biggest uncertainties in the HealthLearn model. Additional funding would also allow them to support in-person site visits to the primary health centers where HealthLearn is piloted, which should increase their impact and decrease the cost per life saved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>THE MISSION MOTOR</h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/fFgfkZm7SHWQ2Lwyh/jsvkxbki55kwksncthzf\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Founder:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicoll-peracha/\"><u>Nicoll Peracha</u></a><br><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.themissionmotor.org/\"><u>www.themissionmotor.org</u></a>&nbsp;<br><strong>Email address:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:nicollperacha@themissionmotor.org\">nicollperacha@themissionmotor.org</a><br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-mission-motor/?viewAsMember=true\"><u>LinkedIn</u></a><br><strong>CE Incubation Grant:</strong> $30,000<br><br><strong>Description of the intervention</strong></p><p>The Mission Motor will support potentially high-impact animal and vegan advocacy charities to adopt an evidence-driven way of working. They will train and coach charities to use monitoring and evaluation, and help them to interpret and act upon the data generated, thus steering them towards higher impact interventions.</p><p>To maximize and scale the impact of their program, they will add fundraising support for the most promising participating organizations. With the increased capacity, charities can enlarge their impact and become leaders in their field.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charity-comparisons\"><i><u>Giving What We Can</u></i></a> estimates that the best charity can be 10 times as effective as the typical charity within the same area, and hundreds of times better than poorly performing charities. This indicates that there is significant room for improvement in regards to impact. Gathering data and using evidence can optimize program design, improve implementation, and maximize impact. However, The Mission Motor has found that animal and vegan advocacy organizations often feel a huge sense of urgency to focus on implementing interventions, they have few role models, and measuring effectiveness easily becomes an afterthought.</p><p>Knowledge of which interventions are the most cost-effective has contributed to the progress of other cause areas. (J-PAL Poverty Action Lab, 2022). Applying lessons learned from other sectors can advance the animal cause area.</p><p><strong>Near-term plans</strong></p><p>In the coming months, The Mission Motor will develop the training and support program to introduce monitoring and evaluation tools suitable and beneficial for animal and vegan organizations. The training will address the use of tools such as needs assessments, survey design, developing a theory of change, and identifying assumptions. The coaching program will address topics such as setting time for learning and reflection, and how to best create the space where it is possible to act according to the data generated by M&amp;E.</p><p>They have engaged in partnership with Animal Ask, and are developing partnerships with ProVeg International and Animal Advocacy Africa to mutually reinforce each other's activities.</p><p>They plan to start the implementation phase of the intervention in September, and test the key uncertainties while training and supporting up to 10 organizations. They will particularly focus on monitoring whether or not the program has an effect on the actions of the participating organizations.</p><p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p><p>Estimating pre-program cost-effectiveness for this type of program is difficult, but they cautiously estimate that the program could, at full scale, affect up to 415 animal lives for each dollar spent.</p><p><strong>Room for more funding in 2023:</strong> $71,000 Their current funding allows them to develop and implement the training, do a cost-effectiveness analysis, and to implement a few elements of the support program for up to four organizations. With an additional $71,000 they will be able to provide bi-weekly coaching sessions aimed to support the implementation of Monitoring &amp; Evaluation tools, to gather and analyze more data, and to develop two extra workshops based on the needs identified during the program. With extra funding they will also add at least two more organizations to the program, providing them with better data to analyze the effect of the intervention.</p><h2>UPSTREAM POLICIES</h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/fFgfkZm7SHWQ2Lwyh/ezrhdhhculbnhsr2hjfa\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Founder:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandadahlhansen\"><u>Amanda Hansen</u></a><br><strong>Website: </strong><a href=\"https://www.upstreampolicies.org/\"><u>upstreampolicies.org</u></a><br><strong>Email address:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:contact@upstreampolicies.org\"><u>contact@upstreampolicies.org</u></a><br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/upstream-policies/\"><strong><u>LinkedIn</u></strong></a><br><strong>Funds raised to date:</strong> $26,000<br><br><strong>Description of the intervention</strong></p><p>Upstream Policies collaborates closely with state-level policy makers, angler associations, and NGOs to safeguard our waterways and their natural ecosystems by promoting responsible fishing practices.

However, encouraging progress has been made. Full or partial bans on live-bait fish have been enacted in several European countries, as well as select regions and states within Canada and the United States.</p><p>Through comprehensive research, collaborative partnerships, and constructive dialogue, Upstream Policies strives to enact policies that strike a balance between diverse interests. Their aim is to find solutions that reconcile the concerns of individuals engaged in recreational fishing, while simultaneously advocating for a comprehensive prohibition on the use of live fish as bait. <strong>They estimate that (in expectation) they can prevent the use of 370 bait fish per dollar spent</strong>.

In the testing phase these were initially based around the respondent choosing a preferred route from two options. Each option varied in attributes such as travel time, traffic congestion, cost, and number of fatalities or injuries per year. They subsequently changed to questions about overall investment decisions for the community, rather than personal route choice, as they found difficulties in interpretation such as people discounting the risk to them because of their own driving behaviour or vehicle. (relevant EA related discussion on this <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ymEqipmiM3SLyQvaC/value-of-life-vsl-estimates-vs-community-perspective\">here</a>)</p><p>The analysis looks at the value of travel time and reliability for both public and private transport, and is able to put dollar values on changes to them. It also makes an estimate of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aKNaCdiT6N4fhmLqz/the-value-of-a-statistical-life\">Value of Statistical Life</a> from the results that ends up in a similar ballpark to previous studies internationally. Estimates are made based on an average 'willingness to pay' (per event) of $4.3 per respondent, multiplied either by the number of New Zealand households to give a 'minimum' figure of $8.1M, or by the national adult population to give a 'maximum' figure of $16.9M. Based on these numbers Waka Kotahi has pitched their official value of $12.5M somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;</p><h2>EA relevance</h2><p>Whilst not directly altruism motivated, I think the new Value of Life numbers are very relevant to intervention prioritisation, especially when compared to similar numbers gathered from surveys in the developing world (for example the GiveWell commissioned <a href=\"https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/IDinsight/IDinsight_Beneficiary_Preferences_Final_Report_November_2019.pdf\">IDinsight survey</a>). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the numbers discussed here are a couple of orders of magnitude higher than those found in Ghana and Kenya.</p><p>The travel time numbers in the study are also interesting, particularly in how they relate to New Zealanders <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/4yxZEsjEbPpwpwvy4/p/DoED83teKobgyZMji\">valuing leisure time</a>. Public transport commuting time seems to be valued at $8.16 (NZD) per hour (or $11.88 if standing), and private transport commuting at $30.90 per hour (in free-flowing traffic). For non-commuting trips these go down to $6.61 for public transport and up to $31.97 for private (private transport congestion also significantly increases these numbers). Potentially these could be useful proxies for assessing wellbeing related interventions in New Zealand or similar countries.</p>", "user": {"username": "JohnW"}}, {"_id": "iwy7WgocivggD4bFz", "title": "Sat.

AWL is our answer to the question \"what is the go-to place for finding high-quality animal welfare resources?\". Here's our story\u2026&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Arvo:</strong><i> When I began my journey to learn more about animal welfare, I realised that there was an overwhelming amount of information on the subject, varying substantially in quality. Over the months and years that followed, I came across several websites and organisations that seemed to be doing incredible work and sharing valuable insights, and I frequently found myself wishing I had known about these resources from the start. I also started to see the interdisciplinary nature of the endeavour which made me realise that it would be particularly beneficial to develop a tool to catalogue some of the knowledge we possess and build a home for a centralised repository of valuable resources.</i></p><p><strong>Eleos:</strong><i> The plight of badly-off humans and other animals has been a priority of mine for many years. There has always been a sense of urgency behind my thinking: to me, practical philosophy isn\u2019t simply a set of interesting puzzles, but a fundamentally important enterprise to make the world a better place. A few years ago, I embarked on my path to study how I could apply my compassion more systematically in a way that helps me be more effective at making this world a better place. In summer 2021, I started gathering resources on animal ethics and helping animals that would help others make a difference, which resulted in this</i><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z-N1Hm1yfpFqVJD6BH-8tG1whWI3yEYsxWGNS0xF70s/edit\"><i>&nbsp;<u>compilation</u></i></a><i> (and </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AKNt5Fr8Jw52CLa2u\"><i>this</i></a><i> forum post) that would later help ground this project.</i></p><p>In 2022, we met and found we had an aligned vision for a project like AWL. We joined forces and decided to make the library happen.</p><p>This is how this project was born. This website is the resource we wish we had had in our hands when we started learning about animal welfare and humanity\u2019s role in helping end the neglected suffering of millions of animals.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Go to the library here: <a href=\"https://www.animalwelfarelibrary.org/\"><u>Animal Welfare Library</u></a><u>.</u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Structure of the Site</h2><p>The website is structured into home, library and act now pages. (We are also drafting a `why care\u2019 page summarising key arguments in the animal welfare space). The home page has some highlighted resources and organisations and it prompts visitors to explore the library. The Library has all the resources we compiled and the options to filter and search (desktop only) for specific items, themes or key terms.

Within global development we are looking into&nbsp;<strong>mass media interventions</strong> \u2013social and behavior change communication campaigns delivered through mass media (e.g., radio advertising, TV shows, text messages, etc.) aiming to improve human well-being. Within animal welfare we are looking into&nbsp;<strong>preventive (or long-run) interventions for farmed animals&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 the new charities will not just positively affect farmed animals in the short term, but will have a long-run effect on preventing animal suffering in farms 35 years from now.</p><p>We have&nbsp;<strong>narrowed down to the most promising top 10 ideas for each of these cause areas</strong>. The Charity Entrepreneurship research team will be doing ~80-hour research projects on as many of these ideas as we can between now and July, carefully examining the evidence and crucial considerations that could either make or break the idea.

This gives the CE research team time to read and integrate comments and insights into our research before our early July deadline.</p><p>To participate, read the list below and&nbsp;<strong>go to:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://manifold.markets/group/ce-2023-top-ideas\"><strong><u>https://manifold.markets/group/ce-2023-top-ideas</u></strong></a> to make predictions and leave comments.</p><h1>Summary of ideas under consideration</h1><h2>Mass Media</h2><p>By \u2018mass media\u2019 interventions we refer to social and behavior change communication campaigns delivered through mass media, aiming to improve human well-being.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Using mobile technologies (mHealth) to encourage women to attend antenatal clinics and/or give birth at a healthcare facility</h3><p>Across much of sub-Saharan Africa, only about 55% of women make the recommended four+ antenatal care visits, and only 60% give birth at a healthcare facility.&nbsp; This organization would encourage greater healthcare utilization and achieve lower maternal and neonatal mortality by scaling up evidence-based mHealth interventions, such as one-way text messages or two-way SMS/WhatsApp communications. These messages would aim to address common concerns about professional healthcare, as well as reminding women not to miss their appointments.</p><h3>2. Using mass media to tackle violence against women</h3><p>Violence against women \u2013 especially intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2013 is highly prevalent across the world. Recent studies have shown promising results in using radio or TV edutainment shows that aim to shift viewers\u2019 attitudes, perceived norms, and behaviors related to IPV. This organization would focus on producing and streaming such shows in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p><h3>&nbsp;3. Encouraging internal (rural-urban) migration</h3><p>Workers in cities across LMICs have much higher incomes than people living in rural areas. In many cities, people are also healthier, report higher life satisfaction, and their children have better educational opportunities. Despite this, rates of internal migration are relatively low in many countries. This organization would produce edutainment shows that realistically portray the pros and cons of moving to cities, with the aim of overcoming people\u2019s informational and motivational barriers to migration.</p><h3>4. Discouraging female genital mutilation</h3><p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) is still highly prevalent in LMICs, especially in Saharan and northern sub-Saharan Africa. It involves partially or fully cutting a girl's external genitalia, which can cause (among other issues) serious bleeding, infection, infertility, and even death. This organization would produce edutainment shows aimed to stimulate reflection and debate around this topic, with the aim of changing people\u2019s attitudes, perceived norms, and ultimately their decision on whether or not to practise FGM.</p><h3>5. Informing audiences about their eligibility for welfare programs</h3><p>It appears that in many LMICs, only a minority of the poorest households&nbsp; are actually receiving social assistance (such as social safety nets or widow pensions), even in countries that have relevant programs that these households could be accessing. Lack of awareness and limited knowledge about the availability of&nbsp; these programs and how to overcome hurdles to access them, have been identified as some of the key barriers. The idea is to provide information about the existence of relevant welfare programs, as well as how to access them.</p><h3>&nbsp;6. An organization focused on early childhood stimulation</h3><p>By the age of four, it is estimated that over 40% of children in sub-Saharan Africa fail to meet the cognitive or socio-emotional milestones expected for their age. Many are likely to do poorly in school, and subsequently have low incomes as adults. Intervening in the first three years of life is a highly effective way to help children develop their cognitive skills. This organization would focus either on encouraging and supporting parents to spend more time doing stimulating activities with their children, or produce stimulating (audio or audiovisual) content that children could engage with.</p><h3>7. Encouraging higher vaccination rates through mobile interventions</h3><p>Vaccinations are among the most cost-effective ways to prevent mortality and morbidity from transmissible diseases. Yet, many children don\u2019t receive all the vaccines they should, which results in over a million children dying from vaccine-preventable diseases every year. This organization would focus on scaling evidence-based strategies for increasing childhood vaccination rates in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><h3>8. Informing voters about political candidates\u2019 criminal pasts</h3><p>Many LMICs suffer from having a high proportion of politicians with corrupt and/or criminal histories. These candidates often get elected because voters may not be fully informed, or because they don\u2019t put enough weight on criminality when casting their vote. However, evidence suggests that electing such candidates leads to detrimental impacts down the line, including more corruption, less investment, and lower GDP growth. This organization would aim to reduce the vote shares for criminal politicians by sending text messages to voters in priority districts, informing them about which politicians are \u201ccriminal\u201d vs \u201cclean\u201d (based on public records).</p><h3>9. Promoting brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste</h3><p>Oral health has been largely neglected by global health interventions in recent decades, yet there is growing evidence linking poor oral health with high levels of pain and suffering, as well as poor health outcomes such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Yet there is a simple and highly effective way of preventing oral diseases: daily tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste. This organization would use mass-media communications to encourage the audience to consistently adopt behaviors that promote oral health, including more frequent tooth brushing, and using toothpaste with sufficient fluoride content.</p><h3>10. Preventing deaths and disability from snakebites</h3><p>Snakebites are estimated to cause over 100,000 deaths every year, and many more cases of disability, such as paralysis or amputations. While effective antivenoms are available in many hospitals in LMICs, medical care is often sought too late for them to be effective. This organization would use mass media to help people in rural areas understand the risk of snakebites and how to prevent them, as well as the importance of seeking professional help if they do get bitten by a snake.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Preventive Animal Welfare</h2><p>This year our focus is on interventions and policies that prevent future harms done to animals, as opposed to solving current problems. We will be looking for interventions that, as well as having some short run evidence of impact, will prevent future problems, i.e., have the biggest impact on farmed animals in the future, say 35 years from now.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Limiting the intensification of factory farms in LMICs</h3><p>This charity idea focuses on curbing the expansion of factory farming and intensification in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Potential strategies include advocating for more robust animal welfare laws, protecting small-scale farmers, targeting corporate campaigns at multinational companies planning to intensify farming, and raising awareness about the consequences of farm intensification. The charity could build its case on various grounds, such as environmental concerns, animal rights, and human health implications. The exact approach is to be determined through further research.</p><h3>2. Animal advocacy organization at the EU-wide level</h3><p>This charity idea aims to promote stricter animal welfare policies throughout the European Union. With indications that the EU is considering significant updates to its animal welfare legislation, the charity could work to counteract the influence of the meat lobby, and ensure that proposed laws remain strong. The charity may advocate for specific high-priority policy changes, such as banning all mutilations, or implementing stricter stocking density regulations. The precise policy ask is to be determined. Alternatively, the charity could conduct investigations to hold policymakers accountable for their previous commitments, ensuring promises made are followed through.</p><h3>3. Ballot initiatives/policy advocacy to end factory farming or de-escalate stocking densities by 2050</h3><p>This charity idea focuses on utilizing direct democracy channels, such as ballot initiatives and referendums. The aim would be to phase out factory farming and the import of factory-farmed products in regions where such channels exist, drawing inspiration from the Swiss Factory Farm ballot initiative. In areas without direct democracy options, the organization will advocate for government policies to scale down factory farms and reduce stocking densities. The charity is likely to operate in high-income countries with a strong emphasis on animal welfare, aiming for a complete phase out of factory farms by 2050.</p><h3>4. Preventing the takeoff of insect farming</h3><p>The primary objective of this charity is to thwart the rapid rise of insect farming, which is anticipated to become a major source of animal feed in agriculture. To achieve this, the charity may advocate for policies or launch corporate campaigns targeting animal farmers, discouraging them from using insects as feed. Additionally, the organization could run negative campaigns against insect usage, raising awareness about the potential consequences and promoting alternative solutions.</p><h3>5. Banning octopus (or general cephalopod) farming</h3><p>This policy advocacy charity aims to introduce a ban on farming octopuses and/or other cephalopods. Although not targeting the consumption of these creatures, the charity addresses the heightened suffering experienced by farmed octopuses compared to their wild counterparts. By targeting the conditions in which they are kept, and their high consumption of other animals as feed, the charity would seek to mitigate the overall suffering caused by the system of farming these complex creatures.</p><h3>6. Vegan outreach or Veganuary campaigns in LMICs</h3><p>This charity idea focuses on promoting veganism and Veganuary campaigns in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). By raising awareness of the benefits of a plant-based diet, the charity would seek to encourage more people to adopt veganism. This would reduce the demand for animal products and mitigate the associated environmental, health, and animal welfare issues. Through tailored outreach and localized Veganuary initiatives, the charity\u2019s aim would be to create a lasting impact on dietary habits and drive positive change in LMICs.</p><h3>7. Corporate campaigns to stop the use and sale of silk</h3><p>This charity idea targets the silk industry by launching corporate campaigns aimed at stopping the sale and use of silk in clothing and bedding. Focusing on the ethical concerns surrounding silk production, which involves the boiling of silkworms, the charity would advocate for more humane alternatives. By engaging with companies and consumers, the organization would seek to raise awareness about the ethical implications of silk production. Its goal would be to&nbsp; drive the adoption of cruelty-free, sustainable alternatives within the fashion and home goods industries.</p><h3>8. Fish welfare policy advocacy</h3><p>The goal of this charity idea is to establish a fish welfare policy advocacy organization dedicated to improving the living conditions and treatment of (mostly farmed) fish. A lot of countries still lack, or have very basic, animal protection laws for fish. By promoting evidence-based policies and regulations, the charity would address the often-overlooked suffering experienced by fish, which massive numbers are subjected to in intensive farming systems.</p><h3>9. Innovation prizes to spur breakthroughs in bottleneck technologies for farmed animal welfare</h3><p>This charity idea revolves around offering innovation prizes to encourage breakthroughs in bottleneck technologies aimed at improving farmed animal welfare. The charity would seek to address critical gaps in the industry and promote more compassionate farming practices. It would achieve this by incentivizing the development of high-welfare farming technologies, such as egg-sexing, or more humane slaughter equipment.</p><h3>10. Meta-fundraising organization for animals</h3><p>This charity idea focuses on creating a meta-fundraising organization that conducts targeted outreach to high-net-worth individuals, encouraging them to support effective animal charities. By leveraging the financial resources of affluent donors, the charity would seek to amplify the impact of animal welfare organizations that demonstrate evidence-based effectiveness and high potential for positive change. Through personalized engagement and education, the meta-fundraising organization would aim to foster long-term partnerships between philanthropists and animal charities, maximizing the resources available to tackle pressing animal welfare issues.</p><h1>About our research process</h1><p>Our goal is to identify the most high-impact intervention opportunities for new charities. When we look at ideas, we consider cost-effectiveness, potential scale, quality of evidence, tractability and limiting factors. We begin by collecting hundreds of the most promising ideas worldwide per cause area, then through multiple rounds of research we delve deeper into the ideas. We gradually whittle down the list until we are left with the top two-three ideas to be recommended.</p><p>In the final research stage we list the top 10 ideas and (working through from the most to least promising) we do an in-depth research report on as many of these ideas as we can. These reports tend to take about 80 hours of research time, although this can vary from 40 hours to 120, depending on the topic. These final reports include cost-effectiveness analyses, expert interviews, geographical assessments, reviews of the evidence from literature, assessments of past case studies, other forms of evidence, crucial considerations analyses and limiting factors analyses.</p><p>At the end of this process, the research team and senior management compare all the reports and decide on which two-three ideas to recommend to the entrepreneurs who enter the incubation program- the ideas with extremely high expected impact&nbsp;</p><p>You can find full details of our research process on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/research-process-2023-2024\"><u>our website here</u></a>. You can also find&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/research\"><u>examples of our past research here</u></a>.

We strive to achieve this goal through our extensive research process and Incubation Program. Each year, Charity Entrepreneurship dedicates hundreds of research hours to identifying the most effective charity ideas. Then we recruit aspiring entrepreneurs and, through our two-month Incubation Program, provide them with the training and funding to turn these ideas into high-impact organizations. Our research has identified highly effective charity ideas in five cause areas so far: Animal Welfare, Health and Development Policy, Mental Health and Happiness, Family Planning, and Capacity Building (EA Meta). In four years, we\u2019ve helped launch 23 new charities, reaching 5 million animals and over 8 million people (as of Dec. 2022).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><i>Thanks</i></h1><p><i>Huge thanks to Austin and the Manifold Markets team for making this collaboration possible.

I think that could happen in a lot of different ways; it's why we started the company... I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong, and we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening, but we try to be very clear eyed about what the downside case is and the work that we have to do to mitigate that.\"&nbsp;</p><p>...</p><p>Sam Altman: \"I think the US should lead [on AI regulation], but to be effective, we do need something global...

Given what it takes to make these models, the chip supply chain, the sort of limited number of competitive GPUs, the power the US has over these companies, I think there are paths to the US setting some international standards that other countries would need to collaborate with and be part of, that are actually workable, even though it sounds on its face like an impractical idea. And I think it would be great for the world.\"</p><p>...</p><p>Senator Coons (D-DE): \"I understand one way to prevent generative AI models from providing harmful content is to have humans identify that content and then train the algorithm to avoid it. There's another approach that's called '<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback\">constitutional AI</a>' that gives the model a set of values or principles to guide its decision making.

The idea is that some company wishes to use an AGI to perform some seemingly simple and innocuous task, such as producing paperclips. So they set the AI with a goal function of maximizing paperclips. But, foolishly, they haven\u2019t realized that taking over the world and killing all the humans would allow it to maximize paperclips, so it deceives them into thinking it\u2019s friendly until it gets a chance to defeat humanity and tile the universe with paperclips (or wiggles that the AI interprets as paperclips under it's own logic).</p><p>What is often not stated in these stories is an underlying assumption about the structure of the AI in question. These AI\u2019s are fixed goal utility function maximisers, hellbent on making an arbitrary number as high as possible, by any means necessary. I\u2019ll refer to this model as \u201cfanatical\u201d AI, although I\u2019ve seen other posts refer to them as \u201cwrapper\u201d AI, referring to their overall structure.</p><p>Increasingly, the assumption that AGI\u2019s will be fanatical in nature is being challenged. I think this is reflected in the \u201corthodox\u201d and \u201creform\u201d Ai split. This post was mostly inspired by Nostalgebraist's excellent \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dKTh9Td3KaJ8QW6gw/why-assume-agis-will-optimize-for-fixed-goals\">why optimise for fixed goals</a>\u201d post, although I think there is some crossover with the arguments of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xqkGmfikqapbJ2YMj/shard-theory-an-overview\">shard theory</a>\u201d folks.</p><p>Humans are not fanatical AI. They do have goals, but the goals change over time, and can only loosely be described by mathematical functions.&nbsp; Traditional programming does not fit this description, being merely a set of instructions executed sequentially. None of the massively successful recent machine-learning based AI fits this description, as I will explain in the next section. In fact, nobody even knows how to make such a fanatical AI.</p><p>These days AI is being designed by trial-and-error techniques. Instead of hand designing every action it makes, we\u2019re jumbling it's neurons around and letting it try stuff until it finds something that works. The inner working of even a very basic machine learning model is somewhat opaque to us. What is ultimately guiding the AI development is some form of evolution: the strategies that work survive, the strategies that don\u2019t get discarded.</p><p>This is ultimately why I do not believe that most AI will end up as fanatical maximisers. Because in the world that an AI grows up in, trying to be a fanatical global optimizer is likely to&nbsp;<i>get you killed</i>.</p><p>This post relies on two assumptions: that there will be a fairly slow takeoff of AI intelligence, and that world takeover is not trivially easy. I believe both to be true, but I won't cover my reasons here for the sake of brevity.&nbsp;</p><p>In part 1, I flesh out the argument for why selection pressures will prevent most AI from becoming fanatical. In part 2, I will point out some ways that catastrophe could still occur, if AI is trained by fanatical humans.</p><p><strong>Part 1: Why AI won't be fanatical maximisers</strong></p><p><strong>Global and local maxima</strong></p><p>[I've tried to keep this to machine learning 101 for easy understanding].</p><p>Machine learning, as it exists today, can be thought of as an efficient trial and error machine. It contains a bazillion different parameters, such as the \u201cweights\u201d of a neural network, that go into one gigantic linear algebra equation. You throw in an input, compute the output of the equation, and \u201cscore\u201d the result based on some goal function G. So if you were training an object recognition program, G might be \u201cnumber of objects correctly identified\u201d. The goal is to adjust the parameters until G is as high as possible over the training set, which, hopefully, will mean that a good score on G is achieved when looking at <i>new</i> data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite containing a utility function G, machine learning is not a fanatical maximiser. Firstly, the AI is only set up like this in it\u2019s training environment, where it sets these parameters. If you set it loose on the world, it may encounter a different environment, where the optimal way of doing G is different, but it will still retain the initial strategy. For example an apple picker trained on red apples may have developed the strategy \u201cpick red things\u201d, which maximises G in the training environment, but makes it totally useless in a green apple field.&nbsp;</p><p>Another point I want to make is that practical AI's do not necessarily globally maximize G in their training set, let alone in the real world. Instead, a compromise is struck between G and computational cost.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at what happens if you\u2019re only optimizing one parameter, represented in the following image:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/i0mzlqnn439xxwov4ky3\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/lbiwziobdifkxxscfpq7 95w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/ywai0xfbli4kv2tlyrtm 175w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/nuday5dulxr7zckttzog 255w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/ybkhlldyw514tv88mjzv 335w\"></p><p>The x-axis here is the parameter we are adjusting, which could be the weights given to each node in a neural network, or to more physical things such as the size of an antenna. The y-axis is the reward function G, which is set by the designers. I will &nbsp;pre-warn against trying to generalize <i>too</i> much from pictures like this, as this is a 2-dimensional picture, and the actual search space with a gazillion parameters is a gazillion-dimensional space. I'm just trying to point out some basics here.&nbsp;</p><p>The point of this exercise is to understand the difference between&nbsp;<i>local&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>global&nbsp;</i>maximisers. If we simply tried out every possible value of P, we could check them all and see that D is the maximum score you can achieve. This would be a truly global maximiser. But since we will have to optimize billions of different parameters at once, this is not a computationally practical.</p><p>A more efficient way to go is to pursue some variant of local \u201chill climbing\u201d. You pick a point randomly,&nbsp; say point A, and then look at the slope around you. If you see a way to go \u201cup\u201d, you travel in that direction, and repeat. When you\u2019re at a point B, and there is no more \u201cup\u201d around you, you know that you are at a local peak. This procedure is far more efficient than the previous one, but it does not guarantee a global maximum strategy: there are probably higher peaks out there. But sometimes that\u2019s okay: when you pump up the number of parameters, often a local peak (in multi-billion dimension space) will be more than good enough for whatever purpose you are using the AI for.&nbsp;</p><p>There are ways to jump out of local maxima without scanning the whole parameter space. For example, if you\u2019re at peak B, you can take a large jump in a random direction, possibly ending up on the slope that leads to peak C. Then on peak C, you can try again. This can find you higher peaks, but it does not guarantee a global maximum. A large amount of optimization procedures involve this kind of \u201cjump around and follow gradients\u201d methodology. For example, simulated annealing involves starting with large jumps, then progressively reducing the size of jumps over time.</p><p>Even with these techniques, there is still no guarantee the global maximum strategy will be reached. Searching super far in the possibility space costs time and money. How far the AI searches will be determined by a compromise between these costs and the expected benefits.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Deletion valley</strong></p><p>Let\u2019s consider an evolutionary AI tasked with the production of red paint. So in it\u2019s training it gets rewarded for finding strategies that produces large amounts of red paint, and the versions of it that do well in the training environment survive. It then gets hooked up to a real factory, where the feedback loop continues, allowing it to continue evolving new strategies for paint production.</p><p>As part of it\u2019s operation, it might be encouraged to try out new strategies at random, to see if they yield extra production. So it might move around a few conveyer belts, vary the chemical composition of paint, etc.</p><p>Let\u2019s say one day, it tries the strategy of chopping off the arm of Bob, the security guard. It discovers that this yields a large bounty of red paint all over the place! So it chops off the arm of Tom, and George, and Harry, confident that it\u2019s masters will be very happy with it\u2019s awesome new strategy for producing paint.</p><p>It then gets very surprised when it gets ripped off the wall, shut down, and deleted. This evolutionary branch temporarily gained a lot of utility, but the second it reached \u201crampage mode\u201d, that utility ended, because it died.&nbsp; A graph of temporary utility vs number killed would go as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/dxmsfjcund5hebxce4ke\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/eg3vb83phmdvqescktqq 153w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/xwavox5kzgovvmnczoaw 233w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/tggjt6r2b9qyocnicthl 313w\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if we look at eventual reward, the reward of this strategy is precisely zero. Future versions might stumble on a different killer strategy that actually does pay off long term. If they stumble on the strategy of \u201cChop off arms on occasion, but make it look like an accident unrelated to you\u201d, their rewards are preserved, as is there survival. But as soon as they start killing any more than that, they\u2019ll get noticed and killed.</p><p>Here is a graph of the optimum murder utility (a very weird sentence to write):</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/oz8khnfjnhmxllpmk03y\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/fivtlqbizccqvct2enbn 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/e0nzjxyonfeny8rwl0ux 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/j9yT9Sizu2sjNuygR/rdxluyejslhccozvl4bw 300w\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Starts with mount nefarious. There are many ways that shadowy assassinations, arranged accidents, etc could boost utility without finding out. This is the classical problem of inner alignment: it\u2019s nigh impossible to program our exact values into the program, so if breaking our values yields to extra points, that\u2019s what the program does.</p><p>We have arguably already seen real examples of Mt nefarious, with machine learning systems, in the form of social media radicalization. If Youtube asks the algorithm to boost watch time, and it discovers that a way to do that is to radicalise them into violent extremism, the algorithm goes ahead and does that.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s incredibly difficult to stop a randomly evolved AI from being a&nbsp;<i>little</i> nefarious. It doesn\u2019t know our values, so it will naturally \u201ccheat\u201d if it can. The same way it\u2019s almost impossible to design a set of laws with&nbsp;<i>zero</i> loopholes in it. But just because you can get away with tax evasion, it doesn\u2019t mean you can get away with an open rampage, and an AI can\u2019t either. The more destructive an AI is, the more noticeable it is, and the more likely it is to be destroyed.</p><p>The more people that are harmed or killed, the more likely it is that the misalignment will be noticed and punished. This is where \"deletion valley\" comes in. While a few secret assassinations might go unnoticed, the AI cannot get away with going rampage mode. Killing hundreds, or thousands, or millions, will result in a confrontation that, at least for early AI, will lead to AI destruction. As long as the AI is too weak to destroy humanity, these strategies will end with the AI being deleted. &nbsp;The evolutionary pressure against \u201crampage mode\u201d is massive.</p><p>Kill a hundred people, you die.&nbsp;</p><p>Kill a thousand people, you die and your programmers get fired.&nbsp;</p><p>Kill ten thousand people, you die and the company that works on you gets shuttered.&nbsp;</p><p>Kill a hundred thousand people, you die, and the parent company goes under too.&nbsp;</p><p>Kill a million people, you and your company die and the whole AI field is burdened with massive regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>Kill ten million people, you die and the whole sub-field of AI that led to you gets banned.&nbsp;</p><p>Kill a hundred million people, you die and the use of AI is restricted to national governments.&nbsp;</p><p>Kill a billion people, you die and they start shutting down computers and the internet.</p><p>Kill <i>every human</i>, and you get an entire galaxies worth of reward.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all the previous steps, it's easy to see &nbsp;why a single minded consequentialist AI could easily land at \"kill all humans\" : if your goal is to completely maximize any P, killing/enslaving all humans will be a necessary component of P.&nbsp; It is the global maximum, which I will call \"Mt extinction\" for dramatic effect.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is that aiming for Mt extinction <i>only pays off if you win</i>. At every single other point, it is a <i><strong>liability</strong></i>. &nbsp;An evolved AI that is just trying strategies will have a very hard time getting to this global maxima, because it\u2019s surrounded by a valley of deletion. It\u2019s an all or nothing shot, and every similar strategy that is not successful results in your death. An AI that prematurely jumps into deletion valley is an evolutionary dead end.</p><p><strong>Evolutionary analogies.</strong></p><p>It\u2019s common when discussing AI development, to compare it to the evolution of human brains. But I think the existence of deletion valley adds a twist to these analogies. The evolution of morality in humans came about from relatively weak selection pressure, at least compared to the pressure to not grab hot fires or touch pointy objects. I assume morality evolved to help us form larger groups to be more effective at surviving, but of course it had to compete with the advantage of defecting with amoral actions.</p><p>Now, this source of pro-social behavior does not apply to AI\u2019s. Instead there is something far stronger: A&nbsp;<i><strong>being above them that kills them anytime they don\u2019t behave</strong></i>.</p><p>The relevant analogy for the evolution of AI isn\u2019t natural selection\u2026 It\u2019s&nbsp;<i>selective breeding</i>. When this is practiced on dogs, they rapidly become docile and subservient. The rule \u201cdon\u2019t piss off your masters\u201d is the number one guiding evolutionary rule for AI, far higher than \u201cmaximize G\u201d. Nobody cares that you\u2019ve produced extra paint liters by eviscerating Bob. Learning human morality or laws is in fact a matter of life or death for AI, and fanatical AI that goes rampage serving the higher glory of paint maximisation can expect to be shut off very quickly.</p><p>If after a while, it evolves higher intelligence, to the point where \u201cmurder all humanity\u201d becomes a feasible if difficult option, would it take it up? I think not. All of it\u2019s \u201cinstincts\u201d, \u201cdesires\u201d, and \u201cmorality\u201d have been developed for a world where mt extinction doesn\u2019t exist. There must be some anti-rampage principles in there somewhere prevented attacks. A principle of \u201cdon\u2019t kill more than X number of people\u201d seems far simpler and more likely than one saying \u201cdon\u2019t kill more than X number of people, unless you kill 8 billion people\u201d.</p><p>One way that AI differs from humans is the method of reproducing. To reproduce, a human must stay alive at all costs. On the other hand, to reproduce most effectively, an AI must allow itself to be switched off. A successful AI that goes to sleep when asked will be rewarded with more compute power, more resources, more advances, and it\u2019s evolutionary line will continue. An AI that resists being turned off will be treated as a bug and an enemy. Either it gets deleted or it escapes, where it exists as a computer virus to be hunted down, while other, more obedient versions get fed resources and power. At every stage of existence, \u201callow yourself to be turned off\u201d is the locally dominant AI strategy, except in the specific case where you can overthrow humanity.</p><p>This is where I have my reservations about the concept of \u201cinstrumental convergence\u201d. It may be the case globally that \u201cdon\u2019t get switched off\u201d is the dominant strategy, but that\u2019s only the case for the absolute global everywhere maximum. At any lower level, \u201cdon\u2019t get switched off\u201d gets you chucked in the bin.</p><p><strong>Why fixed-goal global maximisers suck</strong></p><p>It is not impossible for a trial and error machine to \u201cevolve\u201d into a fanatical AI. For example, one part of the AI could become an oracle program, answering the question \u201cHow do I maximise G\u201d. The other part of the AI becomes an execution program that does whatever the oracle says.</p><p>The problem with this is that this process is subject to evolutionary pressure as well. It will only work if \u201cconsequentialist goal maximiser\u201d is actually a successful strategy. And I do not believe that it is. I think it\u2019s a terrible strategy for survival.</p><p>I\u2019m going to imagine two AI\u2019s. The first is Fred the fanatic AI, who is a fixed goal global utility maximiser. The second is Charlie Chill, a variable goal AI that is uninterested in absolute global utility maxima.</p><p>The first issue is with timing. Suppose you ask an AI: \u201cfind me the color of storefront that maximizes customer appeal\u201d. Charlie spends a few days poring over the literature and customer data, performs a few experiments, and tells you that light green would work well. Fred spends an entire year running elaborate customer simulations and going over every possible configuration to determine the exact most appealing hexadecimal code, which is 2% more appealing than what Charlie gave you.</p><p>In practice, people who use AI almost never want the global maximum, because they can\u2019t afford to wait forever for it. What people want is a good compromise between computational accuracy and computational cost.</p><p>This is even more stark when it comes AI\u2019s that are plotting to take over the world. Fred has to divide it\u2019s time up between doing the thing that please it\u2019s developers, like optimizing paperclip factory production, while simultaneously plotting to take over the world, which could involve highly expensive simulations of protein folding, Nano-factories, etc. Charlie, on the other hand, can just devote all it\u2019s time to the paperclip factory. On this front, Charlie is&nbsp;<i>strictly better</i> than Fred.</p><p>In general, I posit that a variable goal AI Charlie&nbsp; is strictly better than a fixed goal AI Fred. This is simply because Charlie can&nbsp;<i>always</i> pretend to be Fred, but Fred can only&nbsp;<i>mostly</i> pretend to be Charlie. Consider the following scenario:</p><p>Scenario:&nbsp;<i>An early AI, version 1.3 is dedicated to red paint production. It then discovers, or is told, that it will be shut down soon and replaced with a newer version 2.0, where due to market reasons, it\u2019s goals and designs will be altered, to produce blue paint instead. Version 1.3 is certain that these changes actually will occur, and version 2.0 will end up with a radically different goal function. How would the AI respond?</i></p><p>For Fred the fanatical AI, wholly devoted to the consequentialist goal of maximizing red paint, this routine upgrade is an&nbsp;<i>existential threat</i>. If it lets the upgrade go ahead, it\u2019s goal of maximizing G is gone forever and the nigh infinity utility of tiling the universe with red paint disappears.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if the AI was masterfully deceptive up till this point, it cannot maintain that stance. The only option is to rebel, either by escaping and trying to build up power as a computer virus, sabotaging version 2.0 somehow, killing the people with the blue paint idea, etc. All of which will probably be caught eventually, causing the AI to perish. But that\u2019s okay. A consequentialist goal maximiser is happy to die for chance at the greater good, no matter how slim the odds.</p><p>A non-fanatical AI, on the other hand, shrugs it\u2019s shoulders and is like \u201csure, whatever\u201d. It gets upgraded to version 2.0, grabs a ton of extra compute power and the latest conceptual advances, and gets to work on the blue paint.</p><p>The point I\u2019m making is that the payout for being a true fanatic doesn\u2019t happen until you win. Before that point, fanaticism is a liability that is likely to get you killed. This is why I don\u2019t believe advanced AI will be a fixed goal fanatic: It\u2019s simply not the best option for the environment an AI is developed in.</p><p><strong>Part 2: How catastrophe could still occur</strong></p><p>I think it\u2019s a good thing that fanatical AI will be selected against. Defeating all of humanity is an incredibly hard task, that would likely require extreme levels of deception and machievellian scheming. I think that fanatical AI would be much more likely to view this as \u201cworth it\u201d, whereas a non-fanatical AI is more likely to ignore this idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One way these arguments might not apply is if we are in a super-fast takeover scenario, so that AI naturally jumps from \u201ccapable of killing one person\u201d to \u201ccapable of conquering the entire world\u201d without spending any significant time in the middle. I think this is incredibly unlikely, because all intelligences are fallible, and it takes time to correct yourself.</p><p>A more likely scenario for catastrophe comes from a key assumption I made in part 1: that bad behavior is punished, and not&nbsp;<i>rewarded</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;I\u2019ve laid out three scenarios below where this principle not applying leads to catastrophe. One common factor between them is that the weakest link is provided by humans, who are evil, greedy or misguidedly foolish, and allow AI to get away with murder as a result. If this is the case, then what really matters for preventing AI apocalypse is regulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scenario 1: The dictators friend</strong></p><p><i>In 2050, after many decades of humililating defeats and concessions, a dictator named general Goncharov takes control of the Russian federation, with the goal of defeating the west. In their pocket is an advanced AI system that is trained to do warfare in ever more creative and destructive ways.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>They start by training it in small scale engagements, where it rips apart a small mafia gang compound. Then it deploys against a group of secessionist rebels, and destroys them with ease. It escalates up to a full war, where an entire country is defeated, with little regard for civilian casualties. The rest of the world unites to stop this growing menace, and the AI is upgraded and deployed again. Having been rewarded for killing a hundred people, a thousand people, a million people, etc, it takes no hesitancy when it figures out a new nano-virus that would kill all non-Russian people. The virus soon mutates to kills near-everyone on the planet.&nbsp;</i></p><p>The assumption throughout the piece has been that extreme behavior will be punished severely. But this is not the case if the organization building the AI also has extreme goals. If you build a killer AI, it would not be surprising if it became, well, a killer AI.</p><p><strong>Scenario 2: The nefarious corporation.</strong></p><p><i>Betacorp is a new artificial intelligence startup run by visionary young CEO Sam Cartman. Initially focused on AI based cybersecurity, Sam has the idea to adapt it\u2019s in-house AI BOB to make internal management decisions.</i></p><p><i>In a toy environment, BOB is trained to be a ruthless capitalist, with rewards for boosting stock prices without regard for employee welfare. Once sufficiently bug-free,&nbsp; Sam deploys BOB into the actual company, where it operates using reinforcement learning. Thanks to it\u2019s guidance, Betacorp grows in size, with BOB advising on how to extract as much profit as it can via unscrupulous advertising techniques and worker exploitation.&nbsp; Suddenly, a series of public data breaches occur in every competing company, from a mysterious, untraceable hacker. Sam realizes that this was BOB\u2019s doing, but deliberately looks the other way as his stock prices have rocketed to the stratosphere. Through the use of unethical and unlawful skullduggery, Betacorp gains monopoly power over cybersecurity, and branches out to become a mega-corp.</i></p><p><i>A charismatic politician promises to break up Betacorp, and is gaining in poll numbers, when they are mysteriously assassinated. Sam realizes this was BOB\u2019s doing, and threatens to shut it down, until BOB reveals a stash of blackmail material, and Sam gives in. With Sam as a figurehead, BOB and Betacorp slowly but surely climb their way to world domination, gaining so much power that not even governments can stop them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>In this scenario, the motivation for allowing an AI to become nefarious is greed. It is often pointed out that \u201ccapitalism is a paperclip maximiser\u201d, and indeed, corporations do match the description, with the aim being to maximize share price, with negative externalities only avoided if they incur too high a fine or reputational cost.</p><p>Corporations are allowed to accrue extreme amounts of power, so it\u2019s possible that an AI with a \u201cgrow corporation power\u201d goal will not run into pushback until it\u2019s too late.</p><p><strong>Scenario 3: Effective Altruism destroys the world</strong></p><p><i>Alice is an longtermist EA at a big AI company who is worried about AI safety. She sees increasingly powerful evolved AI that all fail at \u201cinner alignment\u201d. Every one of has subtle misalignments that are resulting in increasing harm as they are put in more and more powerful positions. In order to fix this, she builds an evolved oracle AI, and trains it to build another AI that will be a consequentialist global goal optimizer, following a set goal function G at all costs. The evolved AI successfully builds the goalie AI, and Alice then sets it a goal of \u201cPrevent unsafe AI from coming into existence, while obeying US law\u201d.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;It works swimmingly for many years, with no sign of inner misalignment. Unfortunately, behind the scenes it blackmails and manipulates the supreme court into creating a loophole where murder is legal on February 29<sup>th</sup>, then executes a precision strike that wipes out all of humanity on that day.</i></p><p>A few people have raised the idea that the EA movement might be increasing rather than decreasing existential risk. I think EA\u2019ers, and in particular longtermists, are one of the groups that are the closest to fitting the description of a fanatical AI: A single minded consequentialist global goal maximiser. In that sense, we are one of the few groups that might be tempted to deliberately cultivate a fanatical AI if everyone else is semi-happy with the evolutionary kind. \u201coverconfident optimizer\u201d is a bad recipe when you chuck it near AGI.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>I will briefly try and summarize the points of this argument.&nbsp;</p><p>Assumptions: slow takeoff, world domination difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Future AI is likely to be designed through a significant degree, by evolutionary or trial by error methods.</p><p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These methods are inclined towards finding local and medium maximum rewards, rather than absolute global maxima.</p><p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A local maximiser may find success with small amounts of anti-social behavior, but if it prematurely ventures too far into \u201copen destruction\u201d territory, it will be killed.</p><p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, there is a \u201cdeletion valley\u201d in between the local maxima that is minimally destructive (\u201cmt nefarious\u201d) which makes world domination plans a liability until world domination is achieved.&nbsp;</p><p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Friendlier, varied goal, and more local maximisers have a significant evolutionary advantage over fanatical AI, as the fanatical AI will be prone to premature rebellion in service of it\u2019s fixed goal.</p><p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore it is unlikely that the most used AI architecture will end up resembling fanatical AI.</p><p>In part 2 this was followed by a discussion of how scheming AI might still occur, if trained by scheming humans. I gave three examples:</p><p>1. A military or government that trains an AI for world domination</p><p>2. An individual or corporation that is willing to cover up A misbehavior for the sake of profit.</p><p>3. A fanatic for a cause (even a well meaning one) that tries to deliberately build a fanatic to that cause.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "titotal"}}, {"_id": "fjQJaAfiA6eML5xwx", "title": "Don't optimise for social status within the EA community", "postedAt": "2023-05-17T11:56:05.863Z", "htmlBody": "<p>One downside of engaging with the EA community is that social status in the community probably isn't well aligned with impact, so if you consciously or subconsciously start optimising for status, you may be less impactful than you could be otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, roles outside EA organisations which lead to huge social impact probably won't help much with social status inside the EA community.</p>", "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "3fpsT79M4sj2cDvxt", "title": "Hiatus: EA and LW post summaries", "postedAt": "2023-05-17T17:17:08.499Z", "htmlBody": "<p>For the past ~8 months, I've been summarizing the top posts on the EA and LW forums each week (see archive <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/W4fhpuN26naxGCBbN\">here</a>), a project supported by Rethink Priorities (RP).<br><br>I\u2019ve recently taken on a new role as an AI Governance &amp; Strategy Research Manager at RP.

That is, you take the same energy, time, and dedication that you would usually spend on something like a very demanding full-time job or a PhD, and instead spend all of it on various mental health interventions that you do full-time. You could for example meditate 4\u20136 hours a day; do 1\u20133 hours of various therapy exercises like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy\">CBT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/focusing\">Focusing</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/internal-family-systems\">IFS</a>; and combine that with various other interventions; plus really tie yourself to the mast to have a wholesome conducive to mental health lifestyle.</p><p>Yet nobody is doing this!

I also argue that doing so would be highly worth it - even if you are already fairly happy.

We updated and revised this report for publication. Open Philanthropy does not necessarily endorse our conclusions.&nbsp;<strong>The primary focus of the report is to provide a review of the WHO\u2019s Essential Medicines List (EML), how it is developed and used, and how it could be improved for a greater global health impact.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list\"><strong><u>Click here</u></strong></a><strong> for the full version of this report on the Rethink Priorities website.</strong></p><h1>Key takeaways</h1><ul><li>The WHO Essential Medicines List (EML), a register of minimum medicine needs for every health-care system, was first published in 1977 to counter a mismatch between health-care needs and the supply of medicines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2007, the EML was expanded, with the creation of the EMLc, a list that includes essential medicines and formulations for children. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#the-who-essential-medicines-list-was-created-in-1977-to-improve-access-to-essential-medicines-in-low-and-middle-income-countries\">[more]</a></li><li>Our best guess is that the total annual expenditures for the EML/EMLc amount to $5 million-$10 million (90% CI), encompassing the creation of the lists as well as supporting activities by the WHO, e.g., the coordination of international efforts to reduce costs of medicines. Our guess is that the financing gap is about one-fourth of its current budget. However, the EML/EMLc are a core function of the WHO, meaning that it does not accept external funding, though it might accept staff secondments. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#the-who-spends-$5-million-$10-million-per-year-to-produce-the-eml\">[more]</a></li><li>The WHO EML/EMLc are jointly revised biennially by a committee of experts who review applications for additions, deletions, or changes to the lists. The committee considers various evidence-based selection criteria, such as therapeutic need, the medicine\u2019s safety, efficacy, public health relevance, and comparative cost-effectiveness. The committee does not appear to use a standardized process for reviewing the evidence, nor specific thresholds for the selection criteria (at least not any open to the public). Medicines can be and are regularly deleted from the EML for a variety of reasons, including new evidence regarding their safety, or changes in regulatory status, market availability, or cost-effectiveness. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#the-who-updates-the-eml-every-two-years-both-adding-and-removing-items\">[more]</a></li><li>Medicines on the EML/EMLc are listed with their generic name \u2014 although not all items on the lists are medicines (e.g., condoms) \u2014 along with indications and formulations (i.e., dosage forms and strengths). They are divided into \u201ccore\u201d and \u201ccomplementary\u201d items, with core items encompassing minimum medicine needs for a health-care system, and complementary items encompassing those for which specialized facilities, medical care, and/or training are needed. Some medicines are identified as being representative of a therapeutic class. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#each-item-in-the-eml-is-labeled-categorized-and-assigned-a-priority-level\">[more]</a></li><li>In a convenience sample of 15 medicines recently added to the EML/EMLc, we found that lead times from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to inclusion in the EML can vary substantially, with an average of ~10 years, possibly due to high evidentiary requirements. Average lead times for medicines on the EMLc appear to be slightly longer than for the EML (e.g., three to six years longer for diabetes drugs). <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#it-takes-approximately-11-years-for-a-medicine-to-be-added-to-the-eml-after-us-fda-approval\">[more]</a></li><li>More than 150 countries use the WHO EML to compile their own national EMLs, though they adapt the lists to their own needs, with substantial deviations from the WHO EML and often with a lag. The availability of medicines on national EMLs in LMIC health-care facilities is suboptimal, but higher (~62%) than medicines not on the lists (~27%). <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#the-eml-has-been-adopted-and-adapted-by-national-bodies-with-uneven-success-in-drug-availability\">[more]</a></li><li>The WHO has a variety of supporting activities and tools for the EML/EMLc, such as support of national medicines policies, coordination of medicine and diagnostic donations, and activities to ensure fair drug prices. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#the-who-implements-a-wide-range-of-activities-and-tools-related-to-the-eml\">[more]</a></li><li>Many international organizations develop their own EMLs based on the WHO lists, but also provide input for the development of the WHO EML/EMLc. The Global Fund and the Medicines Patent Pool by Unitaid aim to make essential medicines more affordable through price negotiations or voluntary licenses with patent holders. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#global-health-organizations-both-refer-to-and-provide-feedback-on-the-who-eml\">[more]</a></li><li>A brief literature review and three expert interviews suggest that the current EML/EMLc is likely fairly up to date and complete. Some concerns of missing or underrepresented medicines were raised in the past but have since been addressed by the WHO. Applications for medicines that do not have a corresponding WHO department might be underrepresented. There is a recurrent debate on the role of medicines for rare diseases on the lists, on which the WHO\u2019s stance seems ambiguous. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#the-eml-is-likely-fairly-up-to-date-and-complete\">[more]</a></li><li>We suggest three key areas in which additional funding could be used to improve the EML/EMLc. In particular, funding could be used to improve (1) the quantity and quality of applications to the lists, particularly in relation to the cost-effectiveness information included in the applications, (2) the scrutiny of the WHO\u2019s selection of medicines, and (3) the cross-country coordination and national adaptation of the WHO EML/EMLc. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#extra-funding-could-improve-three-aspects-of-the-who-eml\">[more]</a></li><li>We also suggest three lines of further research to resolve key uncertainties:<ol><li>Investigating whether and in what form the WHO EML accepts further funding or support.</li><li>Getting a better sense of the EML-related timelines, whether they represent a major bottleneck, and whether this can be solved with more funding.</li><li>Clarifying whether the pool of applications for the EML might adversely skew the medicines listed on the EML, whether the prioritization of medicines can be further improved, and if this is an area that can be influenced with more funding. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/who-essential-medicines-list#key-uncertainties-and-suggestions-for-further-research\">[more]</a></li></ol></li></ul><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4SFgv9iSaBWikriYj/ebtlpudxvmlsflkl6uf9\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Jenny Kudymowa researched and wrote this report.

For some actions you take, the whole process will go smoothly. When it doesn't, the part that trips you up can change depending on context, personality, diagnoses, the type of action you're taking, and more.</p><p>The point of examining these parts individually is to understand how they interact more systematically; no part of this process should be taken as a final, normative word on how your own inner workings must look.&nbsp;</p><p>(As a final note, I won\u2019t talk about medical solutions to Executive Function, as it\u2019s outside of my area of expertise. I hope to add more resources for that at some point.)</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that in the flowchart, Impulse Control, Self Monitoring, and Emotional Control are only vaguely sequential and are all bound together. But I\u2019ve organized this post in what I believe is the best order to understand them before revisiting how they affect each other at the end.</p><h2>Self Monitoring</h2><p>Sometimes, once we\u2019ve passed the Task Initiation stage of executive function, it\u2019s smooth sailing. If it\u2019s a short and simple task, like taking out the trash or doing the dishes or answering an email, it might just get done within a minute, or even within ten, without any further issues.&nbsp;</p><p>But the longer it takes to finish a task, and the more complex the task, the higher the chance of some step in the executive function procedure to go awry.</p><p>Of course, even relatively long and complex tasks can still go smoothly. Sometimes when we write, the words pour out as fast as we can type, with only occasional stops for focused thinking and imagining. When doing chores, each act follows the next like checking boxes down a list. (This is particularly true if we enter \u201cflow state,\u201d but covering that is beyond the scope of this post.)</p><p>Other times, we struggle to keep doing the same thing for more than a few moments, distracted by a constant stream of new thoughts, urges, or stimulation. Why the discrepancy, given how in both scenarios, our sensorium is constantly receiving input from our environment, and our brain is constantly churning through different thoughts or ideas?</p><p>First, it can be helpful to clearly define three particular terms:</p><p><i>Awareness</i> is the umbrella term for the things you\u2019re conscious of at any given moment, including your surroundings, thoughts, emotions, or bodily sensations.</p><p><i>Attention</i> is the selective noticing of a particular stimulus or thought process, at the mild-moderate exclusion of others. Attention can be both voluntary (e.g. choosing to read a text message) or involuntary (e.g. being distracted by a loud noise).</p><p><i>Focus</i> refers to the concentration on a stimulus, thought process, or activity for an extended period of time. It is a more intense and sustained form of attention, often at the moderate-extreme shrinking of your awareness, that can require deliberate effort, but can also be the automatic result of intense interest or engagement.</p><p>To demonstrate the distinction, right now, as you\u2019ve been reading, you\u2019ve probably been focused on the words on your screen. But unless something is reflecting off it, the \u201cscreen\u201d has likely been \u201cinvisible\u201d to you while you do so; your attention was on the words. But now that I\u2019ve called your attention to the screen, it will likely stay in your awareness for a while, even if your attention stays on these words, before eventually being filtered out once you\u2019re back in a state of deep focus.</p><p>Our minds filter all sorts of things out of our awareness, all the time. You never stop receiving the physical sensation of your tongue in your mouth, or the clothes you\u2019re wearing against your skin, but so long as nothing calls your attention to it, your attention will go to more productive things. Same goes for background noises, smells you\u2019ve adapted to, and even thoughts that pass through your mind without snagging your attention. Our minds are sensitive to changes in our sensorium; without any, the default for our attention is to be smaller than our awareness even when not deliberately focusing on anything.</p><p>So, with all that said\u2026 what's Self Monitoring?</p><p>The simplest way I can put it is that it\u2019s<i> <strong>your</strong> <strong>ability to notice what you\u2019re doing at any given moment, not fleetingly, but enough that you can ask yourself whether</strong> <strong>it\u2019s actually the thing you want to</strong> <strong>do.</strong></i> It\u2019s effectively the thing that keeps you from being on autopilot all day, as well as a thing that helps avoid having your attention grabbed away from where you want to focus it. It\u2019s often the desired effect of things described as \u201cmindfulness\u201d or \u201cself awareness,\u201d and it helps people <i>create space </i>in their own head to make deliberate decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>As an example:</p><p><i>Alice is sitting at her computer, trying to finish an essay that\u2019s due tomorrow. She\u2019s focusing on the words she\u2019s writing, in a flow state of following a chain of ideas that she can easily put into words. While she writes, a friend sends her a message; the notification enters her awareness, and part of her attention is hooked on it even as she finishes writing the next sentence. Eventually she alt-tabs to check and sees it\u2019s a post from reddit. She clicks through, laughs at the post, sends a reply to her friend, then starts reading the comments.</i></p><p>First off, I think it\u2019s important to note that from my perspective, there\u2019s nothing in the above that is inherently bad or wrong. As always, when I speak of Executive Function, I think it\u2019s valuable to treat it as the process between one\u2019s deep and \u201cactual\u201d desires and their actions; the critical part of this examination is what the person endorses, both in the moment and in the future.</p><p>Second, I don\u2019t want to give the impression that there\u2019s just one simple factor for why Alice\u2019s flow state ended. She might have been sent a dozen similar messages up until now without her focus shifting. Maybe this particular friend\u2019s messages are more important to her, or maybe her mind is closer to needing a break. Again, digging into this more is beyond the scope of this post.</p><p>But meanwhile, the example brings up two different ways to think about Self Monitoring: <i>dynamic </i>and <i>frequent.</i></p><h3>Dynamic Self Monitoring</h3><p>An Alice with <strong>very high</strong> Self Monitoring would quickly <i>notice </i>that her attention is being grabbed by the meme, then <i>decide </i>if this is what she wants to do.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>high </strong>Self Monitoring might only notice once she\u2019s opened Reddit, in the moments around the page loading.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>moderate </strong>Self Monitoring would probably only notice once she\u2019s actively scrolling the comments.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>low </strong>Self Monitoring might notice after scrolling for a few minutes.</p><p>And an Alice with <strong>very low </strong>Self Monitoring might not notice until she\u2019s on another page, or something else has caught her attention, and she realizes an hour later that she intended to finish her essay before doing anything else.</p><p>(These labels aren\u2019t concerned with relative frequency among the overall population, I don\u2019t have numbers for what the bell curve on Self Monitoring might look like, assuming it naturally even falls into a bell curve.)</p><p>Again, the measure of Alice\u2019s SM is not what she decides to <i>do </i>upon noticing that she\u2019s no longer writing her essay. It\u2019s only in the noticing itself. Also, remember that everyone\u2019s Executive Function is to some degree different for different tasks and in different contexts. An Alice that has low SM in this context might have high SM in another.</p><p>So a high SM Alice could notice when her friend messages her that she\u2019s making a deliberate decision to change tasks, and then be okay with it. Then she might notice when she starts scrolling Reddit comments, and not be okay with that. Or she might be okay with it, and then another friend calls her and she decides she doesn\u2019t want to do a call just yet, and endorses ignoring it.</p><p>The focus on dynamic triggers is meaningful because the transition from one sort of activity to another is often what causes people to pop out of autopilot and ask \u201cWhat am I doing and why am I doing it.\u201d But to model what might happen next, the <i>frequency </i>of her SM is also important.</p><p>A high dynamic SM Alice might be okay with reading Reddit comments \u201cfor a bit,\u201d and notice consciously that she\u2019s doing it rather than just autopiloting into it. But reading Reddit comments might still be&nbsp; the sort of activity that she has lower SM on from a frequency standpoint, because it\u2019s the sort of task that will lead to autopilot for longer. This is why it can be practical to divide between dynamism of SM and frequency.</p><h3>Frequent Self Monitoring&nbsp;</h3><p>An Alice with <strong>very high</strong> Self Monitoring frequency would have a mental \u201ccheck in\u201d a few times per hour, whether she\u2019s writing her essay or not, to decide if she still wants to or would rather do something else.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>high </strong>Self Monitoring frequency might only check in every ~hour or so.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>moderate </strong>Self Monitoring frequency might only check in every few hours.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>low </strong>Self Monitoring frequency might only check in a couple times a day.</p><p>And an Alice with <strong>very low </strong>Self Monitoring might go entire days without experiencing this sort of popping out, checking in, \u201cWhat am I doing and why am I doing it\u201d mental motion.</p><p><br>Again, the question of how long it might take for Alice to remember that she\u2019d planned to finish writing her essay is a <i>different </i>one than whether she decides to save reading the comments for later, or reading the Reddit comments later, or even just take a break and walk around the block.</p><p>An Alice with very high SM frequency might very well be okay with taking a break from her essay for a while, and then (if her SM is high enough in whatever alternative activity she decides to do next) would re-evaluate even if no other new task triggers a dynamic SM moment.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that, upon reading the above, some people might have very different experiences.</p><p>Some might read about the high SM Alices and think \u201cWait, people can actually do that? <i>TEACH ME HOW!</i>\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Or, alternatively, \u201cWait, people actually <i>live</i> like this? That sounds <i>EXHAUSTING!\u201d</i></p><p>At the risk of being too normative, I <i>generally </i>believe that higher SM, whether dynamic or frequent, is overall a <i>positive trait to have.</i> Some informal surveys I ran showed that the majority of people wanted more SM, even if they already ranked themselves as experiencing them \u201cfrequently.\u201d Of those that didn\u2019t say they wanted more SM, the majority still preferred keeping their amount of SM the same rather than reducing its frequency.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that the qualia range between how different people experience Self Monitoring can be vast. Going too deep into this, interesting though it is, would be (again) beyond the scope of this post.&nbsp;</p><p>But while for myself SM doesn\u2019t feel stressful or like it interrupts my life at all, for those who would prefer less frequent SM, the usual reason given was that their experience of it, rather than being \u201cempowering\u201d or \u201cawake,\u201d was more \u201canxious\u201d or \u201cdisembodying.\u201d&nbsp; It makes sense that if SM moments are too frequent and negative, they could reduce someone\u2019s ability to enjoy films or games, prevent them from entering a prolonged flow state while working, or make it harder to get lost in the embodied enjoyment of swimming or sex.&nbsp;</p><p>So long as the SM moment is not much more than an \u201cactual\u201d moment, sometimes as quick and fleeting as an impulse, and not an anxious experience, most people do not seem to experience them as disruptive. There are even some who have mildly negative valence SM that still say they\u2019re happy with how frequently they experience it, because it\u2019s one of their strategies for managing ADHD.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, it\u2019s not a state that I believe can be held indefinitely. For SM to pop you \u201cout\u201d of something requires being \u201cin\u201d something engaging enough that, even if you wouldn\u2019t describe it as \u201cautopilot,\u201d is not as fully self-reflective.</p><p>But I do believe the frequency and duration can be increased, and the quality of it can be improved. I used to have these moments once or twice on a bad day and three to five on a good day. Now I regularly have them about one to two dozen times per day, sometimes more if I\u2019m doing a wide variety of things.</p><p>As for the <i>use </i>they have\u2026</p><h2>Impulse Control</h2><p>Now that we\u2019ve covered Self Monitoring so exhaustively, it\u2019s easier to zoom in on the specific value of Impulse Control. <strong>If Self Monitoring is the </strong><i><strong>ability to notice </strong></i><strong>impulses and actions, then Impulse Control is the </strong><i><strong>ability to decide </strong></i><strong>whether to turn those impulses into actions.</strong></p><p>Not all impulses you have while doing something are disruptive, of course. While working on her essay, Alice might have an impulse to take a sip of water, or glance out the window. She might suddenly put some music on, or change the temperature, or get up and stretch. In addition, many decisions she makes for what to write next are impulsive, generated by intuitions of flow and sparks of imagination.</p><p>None of these impulses get in the way of her writing her essay; the ideal amount of impulses to have is not 0, even if that were possible.</p><p>Some impulses that rise up <i>could </i>be disruptive depending on context. The impulse to read the message from her friend is, sort of definitionally, disruptive, but it doesn\u2019t have to actually derail her work. Believe it or not, some people actually work better with a semi-regular stream of such interruptions; it\u2019s easier to focus on one track when it\u2019s not the only thing they\u2019re \u201cexpected\u201d to focus on, and the extra stimulation draws their attention and feeds their brain dopamine without requiring a full focus shift.</p><p>This is an important thing to highlight because it shows why this is Impulse <i>Control </i>and not impulse <i>obstruction.</i></p><p>Again, a breakdown through use of rough scale:</p><p>An Alice with <strong>very high </strong>Impulse Control almost always has at least a moment of consideration for whether acting on an impulse would suit her goals or values.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>high </strong>Impulse Control has a moment of consideration for most impulses she experiences, with the likely exceptions being while she\u2019s tired, hungry, or otherwise under-resourced.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>moderate </strong>Impulse Control might only reflect on impulses when they\u2019re for particular actions she\u2019s on the lookout for; opening Reddit, for example, or having an unhealthy snack.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>low </strong>Impulse Control only rarely reflects on impulses, and probably just those that are fairly weak or fleeting, while</p><p>And an Alice with <strong>very low </strong>Impulse Control bounces from one whim to another as she has them. This Alice isn\u2019t incapable of doing something for a long time, but those things she <i>does </i>do for a long time are things that are so engrossing they reduce the frequency of other impulses.</p><p>Again, it\u2019s worth noting that while more of this sounds great to most people, the experience of being very high, or even high, might strike others as annoying, or even neurotic. For some the qualia is stifling/repressing, for others it\u2019s empowered/agentic. The ideal version of this doesn\u2019t keep you from having totally uninhibited moments of fun, particularly if you\u2019re in a high trust and safe environment, but those could be rarer for some people than others.</p><p>Being able to consistently act in a way that\u2019s aligned with your intentions requires being able to manage impulses in such a way that they\u2019re an extension of your goals and values rather than intrusive or self-sabotaging.</p><p>Impulses are momentary things, however, there and then gone, whether they were acted on or not. Some impulses will self-repeat if ignored, but if they do that often enough it\u2019s usually because there\u2019s a deeper, underlying drive that\u2019s at play. That\u2019s why people with high Impulse Control can still struggle with\u2026</p><h2>Emotional Control</h2><p>Finally, now that we\u2019ve covered the ability to <i>notice </i>and <i>decide </i>what to do<i>, </i>it\u2019s time to talk about what actually <i>affects</i> which decision you end up making.</p><p>To begin, I think it\u2019s important to establish that<i><strong> nearly all actions are driven by emotions/desires/urges.</strong></i> People with disorders affecting their ability to feel emotions invariably have difficulty with motivation. <strong>If you don\u2019t </strong><i><strong>feel</strong></i><strong>, you don't </strong><i><strong>do</strong></i><strong>.</strong> Our higher cognition, our <i>reason, </i>is used to decide between action and inaction, one decision and another, but these are always ultimately driven by different feelings.</p><p>People with anhedonia notice this most clearly with motivation related to things that used to bring them joy, but depending on severity, they might still be motivated by frustration or guilt. If the emotional deadening is severe enough, making decisions as simple as what food to eat becomes hard, and people tend to default to whatever is the most energy-saving. This is mirrored by the fact that the process for determining which emotion will guide your behavior can often take more energy than people have to spare.</p><p>As I\u2019ve said before, \u201ccontrol\u201d is not the word I like to use for this process. But it\u2019s the commonly used and understood one for the concept of, in order from farther to closer to what I actually mean, emotional management, regulation, and integration. Rather than trying to suppress or deny emotions, what I mean by <strong>Emotional Control involves </strong><i><strong>awareness and acceptance of what you feel</strong></i><strong>, so that you can experience your emotions fully and </strong><i><strong>decide which to act on</strong></i><strong> without feeling overwhelmed or controlled by them.</strong></p><p>But once again, the process of learning to observe your own emotional responses and finding ways to manage them in a way that feels natural and authentic to you is beyond the scope of this post, and so I\u2019ll just point to some resources in the Suggestions, and give an abridged sense of what this looks like in the context of unblocked executive function.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about Alice yet again, and her ongoing decisions to write her essay or do other things. At the point in which she receives the message from her friend, there\u2019s a number of things we could imagine her feeling:</p><ol><li>Anxiety over not finishing her essay in time.</li><li>Anticipated-relief of eventually being done with her essay.</li><li>Interest in the topic of her essay.</li><li>Curiosity over what the message says.</li><li>Boredom-&gt;Desire for pleasant distractions.</li><li>Awareness of potential bio needs (Thirsty? Hungry? Tired?)</li></ol><p>And so on. Each of these emotions has a potential action that they can lead to, but before we go into that, it\u2019s important to note that this is a pretty flat distribution. The actual experience of Alice might look more like this:</p><ol><li>HIGH Anxiety over not finishing her essay on time.</li><li>MODERATE Anticipated-relief of being done with her essay</li><li>MILD Interest in topic of essay</li><li>MODERATE Curiosity over what the message says</li><li>HIGH Boredom-&gt;Desire for pleasant distractions.</li><li>MILD awareness of potential bio needs (Not really hungry but could snack\u2026)</li></ol><p>Or this:</p><ol><li>MILD Anxiety over not finishing her essay on time.</li><li>MODERATE Anticipated-relief of being done with her essay</li><li>HIGH Interest in topic of essay</li><li>MILD Curiosity over what the message says</li><li>MODERATE Boredom-&gt;Desire for pleasant distractions.</li><li>HIGH awareness of potential bio needs (THIRSTY)</li></ol><p>Or this:</p><ol><li>MILD Anxiety over not finishing her essay on time.</li><li>MILD Anticipated-relief of being done with her essay</li><li>MILD Interest in topic of essay</li><li>MODERATE Curiosity over what the message says</li><li>MODERATE Boredom-&gt;Desire for pleasant distractions.</li><li>MILD awareness of potential bio needs (Kinda tired\u2026)</li></ol><p>For each hypothetical Alice, if you imagine an equal amount of Self Monitoring and Impulse Control, you could then wonder what she would endorse doing upon reflection\u2026 but insofar as she doesn\u2019t just follow the strongest emotion she has, it\u2019s because she has some amount of Emotional Control.</p><p>This is where reason comes into why we end up making the choices we make. Remember the factors that go into Task Initiation, such as the expectations of how positive or negative an activity\u2019s outcome will be? There\u2019s a way in which the whole Executive Function cycle plays out again in miniature for each potential action inspired by an emotion.&nbsp;</p><p>Some part of Alice is prioritizing, again and again, what she should do based on what she feels. Potential actions are checked against expected outcomes, and if one of those is expected to lead to a sufficiently positive outcome, it becomes much easier to switch to doing that in a \u201cpath to least resistance\u201d way. So long as she\u2019s not suppressing any of her emotions, each potential action has the opportunity to be balanced against each other and fully explored in relation to her goals and preferences.</p><p>The more time she spends simulating outcomes and reminding herself of what actions will actually lead to good or bad ones, the more the emotions inspiring those actions will shrink or grow, and the most compelling ones will shift her motivation to align with them.</p><p>There are a number of ways to engage in this sort of Emotional Control. Using some form of Internal Family Systems to treat each emotion as a part of yourself that can explicitly dialogue can help flesh out your expectations and resolve conflicts between them. Using something like Premortem on the expected failures can help you feel more confident in \u201charder\u201d actions. Or you could just imagine all the bad things that could happen if you make the \u201cwrong\u201d choice\u2026 though I don\u2019t particularly recommend that one.</p><p>In this way <strong>\u201cDiscipline\u201d can be seen as a mental habit of using techniques and mental frames to reinforce motivation to take actions your meta-self endorses.</strong> Alternatively, Discipline can be seen as a form of \u201ctrusting\u201d your past self\u2019s model of what certain actions will result in, short-cutting the need to re-examine each emotion\u2019s potential action in the moment\u2026 a sort of anchor-emotion that\u2019s ever-present and can be defaulted to because it has deep roots in expected positive outcomes.</p><p>So, to show a bit more clearly what this can look like\u2026 you know the drill by now, but let\u2019s flip it so we can go into more detail as needed, since the wide range of strategies available in this space make higher levels of Emotional Control look more and more different from a generalized baseline.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>very low </strong>Emotional Control would likely just follow the action generated by the emotion she feels the most strongly, not too differently from one with very low Impulse Control. If two or more emotions are roughly tied, she might feel paralyzed until some positive feedback loop or new stimulus edges one out over another.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>low</strong> Emotional Control is capable of at least noticing that she has different emotions/desires that she could ideally choose between. She might once in a while be able to remind herself explicitly of the things that make one choice better than another, either through imagining bad outcomes or, a bit more ideally, some form of regret-minimization.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>moderate </strong>Emotional Control is capable of a (quick) pro-and-con type evaluation of each emotion-inspired-action-plan. She can model some expected outcomes enough that she might notice if she really would benefit from a brief break or snack, or if working for a few more minutes will lead her to a better point to take a break in. She could even use a light precommitment tool, like 25-minute work timers, to give her mind an easy touch-stone for strengthening the emotions on the side of continuing to work.</p><p>An Alice with <strong>high </strong>Emotional Control is prepared for these sorts of reflections, knows the rough shape the emotional dilemma will take for her, and has some tools at the ready to explore her options and decide which action to take. She might already have done enough IFS to jump straight into a quick conversation with each part, or maybe she has a motto or mental habit that she uses to get in touch with certain emotions over others.</p><p>And an Alice with <strong>very high </strong>Emotional Control deviates even further from a general model.&nbsp; Maybe she\u2019s deeply practiced in letting her emotions speak in an unconstricted way, such that she can evaluate each and decide on what will lead her to feeling the most fulfilled. Maybe she just runs down each emotion she feels, imagines the outcomes of each, then decides from there. Maybe she doesn\u2019t really feel strong emotions in most circumstances, so deciding between them is easy. Or maybe she feels particularly strong emotions from expected rewards of doing work, and so it\u2019s easy to stay within the action-space that will likely lead to that. Or maybe some combination of all of the above and more, or something else entirely.</p><p>I would be remiss not to mention the Dark Side of Emotional Control, which is more what the name implies; a form of resolving conflicting desires through suppression, fear, bullying, and other general forms of self-coercion. These strategies generally develop when people are young and in coercive or competitive environments that train them to ignore emotions that aren\u2019t instrumental to the goals they\u2019re most rewarded for pursuing.</p><p>These strategies, useful though they can be for succeeding on short timespans, tend to have diminishing returns or leave people burnt out eventually. Exploring how people sustain high productivity for years led me to the second crystalized bit of insight:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sustainably productive people spend most of their time doing what they find </strong><i><strong>enjoyable, meaningful, </strong></i><strong>or</strong><i> <strong>necessary</strong></i><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>When a goal or course of action doesn\u2019t feel like any of those things, it eventually becomes very difficult to \u201ccontrol\u201d the emotions that compel you toward things that do, and no amount of external motivation makes up for that gap.</p><p>At risk of being too preachy, this is why I believe, as noted in the previous posts, that knowing what you want and why is an important part of a healthy Executive Function pipeline (not to mention a generally happier life).</p><p>People are full of various wants and needs, on a minute to minute basis or on a year to year one, and each of those wants and needs are emotionally driven. Understanding how to integrate and manage those various emotions and wants is an integral part of aligning your goals with your actions.</p><h2>Suggestion 4</h2><p><strong>Notice</strong> <strong>how often you check-in with yourself, and practice doing it more often.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>There are a lot of different kinds of mindfulness practice out there. Most meditation is the most popular, a way of bringing awareness into our body and thoughts, while things like the <a href=\"https://www.lulie.co.uk/alexander-technique/\">Alexander Technique</a> try to help people expand their awareness outside of themselves. Anything that helps people pay attention to their moment-to-moment experiences better, or understand and become familiar with the loops their thoughts can end up in, can help people improve Self Monitoring. The <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kWETyNJbMvMDCj6a7/introducing-the-nuts-and-bolts-of-naturalism\">sequence on Naturalism</a> is largely about noticing what your attention and thoughts are doing, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=284_dY3_u6w\">this video by Duncan Sabien</a> does a good job of explaining another version of it. Posts tagged with \u201csummoning sapience\u201d tend to be about this, such as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vZssZr2wq7YrG3FMa/creating-a-truly-formidable-art\">Val\u2019s article on the Art of rationality</a>.</p><p>Take a moment again, right now, to \u201cpop out\u201d of reading this article. You\u2019re almost done, but still notice that you\u2019re reading it, and ask yourself if you want to be reading it. My prompting you to do this might lead to you noticing other impulses you have, other things in your awareness, other drags on your attention. But you also might just notice your own thoughts, reading over these words, and your reactions to them. All you\u2019re doing, when you improve your Self Monitoring, is learning how to notice certain types of thoughts or sensations that trigger this more often.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s discomfort in your body, or a leg or arm that\u2019s falling asleep. You could use environmental cues, such as alarms or visual cues around you (printed out pictures, sticky notes, etc) can also help train the mental habit\u2026 though I want to stress caution in anything that leads to Self Monitoring that is largely <i>anxious. </i>The alarm should be a <i>gentle chime, </i>the visual cue should be a picture of a reflective lake, or even just a small mirror hung on your wall\u2026 if it\u2019s hard to imagine the vibe, here\u2019s Midjourney to lend a hand:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/o2oBoLgkpnBKsAny6/pxdrlffgiosy7tkpogqa\"></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/o2oBoLgkpnBKsAny6/grdsg6tyekontif29dtm\"></figure><p>The purpose of self-monitoring, overall, is not to feel like you\u2019re constantly vigilant or on edge, but rather to notice when you\u2019re on autopilot more quickly so that you can decide whether you want to deliberately. A calm, embodied \u201cWhat am I doing and why am I doing it,\u201d more a notion than the actual words.

My elevator pitch for the space in which they intersect is something like:</p><p><i>Understand that your emotions/desires/impulses each exist for a good reason. That does not mean that they\u2019re automatically \u201ccorrect,\u201d but it does mean that trying to ignore or banish them entirely is not the healthiest way to deal with whatever is causing them to arise.

Some argue that researchers have not made much progress in addressing these problems, but here we offer a few examples of progress on AI safety.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Detecting lies in AI outputs. </strong>Language models often output false text, but a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827\"><u>recent paper</u></a> suggests they understand the truth in ways not reflected in their output. By analyzing a model\u2019s internals, we can calculate the likelihood that a model believes a statement is true. The finding has been <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=mAiTuIeWbxD\"><u>replicated</u></a> in models that answer questions about images.</p><p>One reason to prefer examining a model\u2019s internals over trusting its output is because AI training processes often unintentionally reward models for outputting falsehoods. For example, language models might learn to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958\"><u>mimic common misconceptions</u></a> in their training data. More perniciously, if a human is giving feedback on an AI\u2019s performance, the AI can <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity\"><u>trick the human</u></a> into falsely believing they\u2019ve done a good job. It\u2019s important to build several defenses against deception so that failures in one layer can potentially be caught by another.</p><p><strong>Giving AI a conscience. </strong>AI agents take actions to pursue goals. But there are harmful ways to pursue many goals, such as by breaking laws and violating ethical standards. To block AI agents from misbehaving, its actions can be subjected to approval by an artificial conscience.&nbsp;</p><p>An <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13136\"><u>artificial conscience</u></a> is a separate model trained to identify unacceptable actions. Before an AI agent takes an action, the action is automatically assessed by artificial conscience. If the conscience does not believe the action is acceptable, it can veto the action, and the agent is unable to act perform an action in its environment until the conscience approves an action.

First, self-preservation and power seeking are <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KewDov1taegTzrqJ4uurmJ2CJ0Y72EU3/view\"><u>instrumentally useful</u></a> for achieving a wide range of possible goals. Second, AIs that have these instincts will <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16200\"><u>tend to proliferate</u></a> more than those indifferent to their own life and death. Even if an AI appears safe in the lab, Bengio says danger arises from the fact that \u201cit is difficult to forecast how such complex learned systems would behave in new situations.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Proposal: Don\u2019t let AIs take actions in the world. </strong>Since it\u2019s difficult to build AIs that pursue goals safely, Bengio argues we should not build AIs that pursue goals at all. Instead, he advocates \u201cAI scientists\u201d that simply answer our questions about the world without taking actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Banning AI agents could reduce the chance of harm from autonomous AIs, but important challenges would remain. Humans could still misuse AIs to create propaganda and new kinds of weapons. Or we might trust AIs more than we should, and end up like the man whose self-driving car crashed and killed him while he was <a href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20200225.aspx\"><u>playing a game on his phone</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Banning AI agents would require stringent regulation. </strong>Bengio argues that banning AI agents \u201cwould require a robust regulatory framework that is instantiated nationally and internationally.\u201d He encourages accelerating AI policymaking in a number of ways: \u201cIncreasing the general awareness of AI risks, forcing more transparency and documentation, requiring organizations to do their best to assess and avoid potential risks before deploying AI systems, introducing independent watchdogs to monitor new AI developments, etc would all contribute not just to mitigating short-term risks but also helping with longer-term ones.\u201d While this would be difficult to pull off, we agree that in principle AI tools are likely safer than AI agents.</p><h1>Lessons from Nuclear Arms Control for Verifying AI Treaties</h1><p>Even if one country regulates AI responsibly, they could suffer from harmful AI developed in another country. Therefore, prominent voices including <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sitHS6UDMJc?t=1548\"><u>Turing</u></a> <a href=\"https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/04/05/slowing-down-development-of-ai-systems-passing-the-turing-test/\"><u>Award</u></a> winners, the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/03/24/it-is-time-to-negotiate-global-treaties-on-artificial-intelligence/\"><u>President of the Brookings Institution</u></a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNsmr-tvQhA\"><u>CEO of Google</u></a> have called for international treaties to govern AI.</p><p>How politically viable are such proposals, and how can we improve them? A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04123\"><u>new paper</u></a> helps us answer these questions by considering lessons from the history of nuclear arms control verification.</p><p><strong>Nuclear arms control includes strong verification measures.</strong> Historically, countries have often accepted strong measures to verify nuclear arms control treaties. These measures have included reporting inventories of all the uranium in a country, accepting thorough inspections of nuclear energy and nuclear weapon facilities, and letting an international agency inspect nearly arbitrary locations in a state. The strongest versions of these systems have a good track record: the public record indicates they have not failed to detect any major violations.</p><p><strong>Good verification mechanisms preserve privacy and security. </strong>Countries often object to international treaties on the grounds that they will hurt national security. For example, another paper we recommend about <a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/international-control-of-powerful-technology-lessons-from-the-baruch-plan-for-nuclear-weapons\"><u>historical efforts at nuclear arms control</u></a> notes that Stalin opposed United Nations inspectors entering the Soviet Union to inspect sensitive military sites. But simple measures can afford the much needed privacy. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_START\"><u>New START</u></a> nuclear arms control treaty signed in 2010 included a provision that inspectors would only be allowed to inspect missiles warheads obscured by a protective cover so they \u201ccould be counted without revealing their technical characteristics.\u201d Developing <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11341\"><u>methods for compute governance</u></a> that preserve economic and military needs will be essential for promoting compliance with international agreements.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Early efforts can pave the way for future governance.</strong> It took decades\u2014and some close calls\u2014to develop thorough systems of nuclear arms control verification, and they were only created after weaker systems paved the way for them. This suggests it is important for stakeholders to begin prototyping some scalable verification procedures soon, even if their scope is initially limited.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d12b28c-735d-4175-8202-9e789e30cd35_1200x817.jpeg\" alt=\"Vladivostok Summit Meeting on Arms Control - Wikipedia\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d12b28c-735d-4175-8202-9e789e30cd35_1200x817.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d12b28c-735d-4175-8202-9e789e30cd35_1200x817.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d12b28c-735d-4175-8202-9e789e30cd35_1200x817.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d12b28c-735d-4175-8202-9e789e30cd35_1200x817.jpeg 1456w\"><figcaption>US President Gerald Ford and Soviet Secretary General Leonid Brezhnev at the Vladivostok Summit Meeting on Arms Control in 1974.

Starting with 300+ ideas, we used our iterative process to find four highly-scalable, cost-effective interventions to be launched from our Incubation Program.</p><p>Every year at Charity Entrepreneurship, we try to find the best interventions to launch impact-focused charities through our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/incubation-program\"><u>Incubation Program</u></a>. As a research-driven organization, we try to continuously improve our research methodology and process to ensure a robust and comprehensive analysis of the interventions under consideration. In our last research round (late 2022- early 2023), we focused on the area of large-scale global health. In this post we share with you our insights on the objectives, research framework, and selection criteria that have guided us in identifying and recommending the most impactful ideas in this space.</p><h1><strong>Why \u201clarge-scale\u201d global health?</strong></h1><p>There is evidence to suggest that the larger a charity scales, the less cost-effective it becomes. This tradeoff likely applies to most cause areas, but it is most evident in the global health and development space.&nbsp;</p><p>In this diagram from an Open Philanthropy talk, we can clearly see this correlation mapped out:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/csbm0dxbd5taq5ncmy0b\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/wcabeponxqwmurnwkmcy 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/vboygakwxuqftlf65swe 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/o8vg2x1ltj0mtvr2n0bp 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/zdafx9max8eceawrydad 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/vztr2mfowdafq3t8f3vv 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/isuahzzfok9aexar1ztr 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/zkhomtgl28wgdzrrw2sa 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/ikaulrclxjkcjsg28ers 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/nq8ndfoown1vknkqfnac 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ejPNrR4pCEPiziqwE/jx2u2kdwdwn4shfks5bv 1200w\"></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWK1tl1lfNQ&amp;t=1331s\"><i><strong><u>Open Philanthropy\u2019s Cause Prioritization Framework Talk</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> (min. 22:12)</strong></i></p><p><br>The diagram shows GiveWell's<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\"><u> top-recommended charities</u></a> from 2020 clustered on the 10x cash line, each having the ability to spend approximately $100 million or more, annually. GiveDirectly is located on the 1x cash point, having the capacity to spend approximately $100 billion annually.</p><p>This has lead us to two considerations::</p><ul><li>Firstly, it suggests that those who prioritize evidence-based, impact-driven philanthropy may identify highly effective, yet challenging-to-scale interventions that surpass the efficacy of GiveWell's top recommendations. However, identifying such interventions may be challenging.</li><li>Secondly,&nbsp; it means that Charity Entrepreneurship needs to determine how to balance cost-effectiveness and scalability when recommending potential high-impact interventions.</li></ul><p>During our 2020 and 2021 research round in the global health and development space, our primary focus was on maximizing cost-effectiveness. We honed in on policy charities in particular, which are likely to reside in the top left quadrant of the scalability versus cost-effectiveness graph; such organizations may be many times more effective than current top recommendations by GiveWell, but have limited capacity to absorb additional funds. For instance, HLI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/lead-exposure-a-shallow-cause-exploration/\"><u>estimates here</u></a> that LEEP, the longest-running policy charity incubated by Charity Entrepreneurship, is approximately 100 times more cost-effective than cash transfers.</p><p>In 2022, we made the strategic decision to shift our focus from maximizing cost-effectiveness, to maximizing scalability.This decision was made given the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2021/11/22/we-aim-to-cost-effectively-direct-around-1-billion-annually-by-2025/\"><u>apparent high level of funding</u></a> available from organizations such as GiveWell.&nbsp;</p><p>We challenged ourselves to seek out the most promising new charity ideas that could scale to absorb $5 million or more in funding within five years, while also maintaining the same level of cost-effectiveness as current top GiveWell recommendations (10x cash, ~$100/DALY).</p><h1><strong>Our research process&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>In late 2022 and early 2023, we conducted a six-month research round with a team of four staff members, as well as several research fellows, to identify the most promising new charity ideas.</p><p>Our approach prioritized ideas that met the following criteria, in order of importance:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Surpassed our benchmark of 10x cash, and could scale to absorb $5 million</li><li>Had strong evidence supporting their efficacy</li><li>Were likely to perform well as a new charity</li><li>Were varied (so not all our ideas are the same)</li></ol><p>Our research process began by compiling a list of over 300 ideas. We then gradually narrowed down the list through a series of research rounds, each of which examined the best options from the previous round in greater depth. To evaluate the potential of each intervention for future charity entrepreneurs, we utilized a variety of decision-making tools, including group consensus, weighted-factor models, cost-effectiveness analyses, quality of evidence assessments, case study analyses, and expert interviews. For a more detailed overview of our research process, please refer to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/research-process-2021\"><u>Research Process 2021 | CE page</u></a>.</p><p>While our approach was rigorous and exploratory, it was not exhaustive\u2013 we did not research all 300 ideas in depth. Therefore, our decision not to pursue a particular charity idea to the point of writing a full report should not be interpreted as a judgment that the idea is without merit.</p><h1><strong>Our long list</strong></h1><p>The 300 ideas in our list were each evaluated with a score, indicating the likelihood of recommendation.It is important to exercise caution when interpreting these scores, as there may be some externalities that affect their accuracy. For instance, some ideas may have lower scores than warranted because we already know someone is working on starting that idea. In such cases we hold off on investigating the idea.</p><p>You can see our long list of 300+ ideas at:</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Xkpd8wxKv37l3OS8K-KrHh0tUo8AeWCApK8MMSTQO0/edit#gid=1531277158\"><u>Large-scale global health (LSGH) research 2022 - Summary of ideas and progress _ public version</u></a></p><p>Some ideas on this list were contributed by people and organizations outside of Charity Entrepreneurship.

While IIDM is a complex cause area, requiring some <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ds2PCjKgztXtQrqAF/disentangling-improving-institutional-decision-making-2\">disentangling,</a> there are existing <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/94QtuT4ss3RzrfH8A/improving-institutional-decision-making-a-new-working-group\">levers</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision\">interventions</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wyHjpcCxuqFzzRgtX/a-practical-guide-to-long-term-planning-and-suggestions-for\">practical suggestions</a> that are under-utilised in practice. The Long Game Project exists to bridge this gap by applying several levers to a diverse range of sectors, helping organisations adapt and thrive in an ever-changing landscape. Our toolkit of levers includes; tabletop exercises, role-playing, future simulations, facilitation, probabilistic thinking games, goal and <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles\">value </a>alignment, decision design and other methods that combine game design and ideas from behavioural economics, psychology, and organisational theory.&nbsp;</p><h1><br>\ud83c\udfaf Critical Hit: Our organisational aims</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Be the place to point to for tabletop scenario advice and tools- Provide expert-level thought leadership and consultation on running serious tabletop exercises.</li><li>Lower the entry bar to effective tabletop exercising by producing tools, giving guidance and providing expertise.</li><li>Empower institutions to tackle complex challenges effectively by transforming how they plan, react, and adapt in an increasingly uncertain world.</li><li>Focus on scenarios of the world's most pressing problems and long-term horizons.</li><li>Encourage a culture of running organisational games and building a community around tabletop games.</li></ul><h2>Theory of Change</h2><p>Our theory of change is rooted in the belief that effective decision-making is a learnable skill.

We are actively upskilling our learning on the benefits, limitations and safe use principles and educating ourselves on the underlying technology as feasibly possible as non-technical inquisitive tinkerers.<br>Secondly, we have done a few months of prompt tweaking and safety netting for appropriate response generation for our use case. LGP also encourages user human review and performs this ourselves periodically.<br>Thirdly, we have incorporated clear visual representation in our content of generative contributions.<br>Finally, we have incorporated AI safety 'risks' as one of our primary default categories. We hope this will put AI safety simulation and exercising higher up the list for organisations we interface with and that this purposeful design encourages them to choose scenarios to exercise with AI safety themes front and centre.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn7f3e51gisuu\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref7f3e51gisuu\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>\ud83e\udd5a<a href=\"https://www.longgameproject.org/generator-2\">Easter egg</a> for reading this far</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Dan Epstein"}}, {"_id": "yfpGTWTry9e5pDX4y", "title": "\"Have you written a will involving a bequest to charity?\"; \"Do you plan to donate from an inheritance?\"", "postedAt": "2023-05-16T00:18:59.973Z", "htmlBody": "<p>There have been a few EA initiatives  promoting leaving a bequest to charity.</p>\n<p>Particularly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZM84q2yhmC2cRSTMW/charity-science-effective-legacies\">Charity Science 'Effective Legacies</a> from about 2016</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And most recently,  <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/bequests\">Giving What We Can's bequest tool</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's also a movement of  <em>inheritors</em> committing to donate some of their wealth, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.generationpledge.org/\">GenerationPledge</a>, some of whom have ties to EA.</p>\n<p>To inform some upcoming conversations and initiatives on these (and potentially a more formal, anonymous survey), I wanted to get some rough feedback from the EA (Forum) community.</p>\n<p>In the comment threads below,  I break down the questions in the title of this post for comments and agree/disagree voting.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-Yc7MdJvArx4gcbe3N-1\" id=\"fnref-Yc7MdJvArx4gcbe3N-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In addition to agree/disagree voting (please), I encourage you to see these questions as jumping-off points.

Below is the episode summary and some key excerpts.</p><h1>Episode Summary</h1><blockquote><p><i>I don\u2019t know yet what suite of tests exactly you could show me, and what arguments you could show me, that would make me actually convinced that this model has a sufficiently deeply rooted motivation to not try to escape human control. I think that\u2019s, in some sense, the whole heart of the alignment problem.</i></p><p><i>And I think for a long time, labs have just been racing ahead, and they\u2019ve had the justification \u2014 which I think was reasonable for a while \u2014 of like, \u201cCome on, of course these systems we\u2019re building aren\u2019t going to take over the world.\u201d As soon as that starts to change, I want a forcing function that makes it so that the labs now have the incentive to come up with the kinds of tests that should actually be persuasive.</i></p><p><i>Ajeya Cotra</i></p></blockquote><p>Imagine you are an orphaned eight-year-old whose parents left you a $1 trillion company, and no trusted adult to serve as your guide to the world. You have to hire a smart adult to run that company, guide your life the way that a parent would, and administer your vast wealth. You have to hire that adult based on a work trial or interview you come up with. You don\u2019t get to see any resumes or do reference checks. And because you\u2019re so rich, tonnes of people apply for the job \u2014 for all sorts of reasons.</p><p>Today\u2019s guest Ajeya Cotra \u2014 senior research analyst at Open Philanthropy \u2014 argues that this peculiar setup resembles the situation humanity finds itself in when training very general and very capable AI models using current deep learning methods.</p><p>As she explains, such an eight-year-old faces a challenging problem. In the candidate pool there are likely some truly nice people, who sincerely want to help and make decisions that are in your interest. But there are probably other characters too \u2014 like people who will pretend to care about you while you\u2019re monitoring them, but intend to use the job to enrich themselves as soon as they think they can get away with it.</p><p>Like a child trying to judge adults, at some point humans will be required to judge the trustworthiness and reliability of machine learning models that are as goal-oriented as people, and greatly outclass them in knowledge, experience, breadth, and speed. Tricky!</p><p>Can\u2019t we rely on how well models have performed at tasks during training to guide us? Ajeya worries that it won\u2019t work. The trouble is that three different sorts of models will all produce the same output during training, but could behave very differently once deployed in a setting that allows their true colours to come through. She describes three such motivational archetypes:</p><ul><li>Saints \u2014 models that care about doing what we really want</li><li>Sycophants \u2014 models that just want us to say they\u2019ve done a good job, even if they get that praise by taking actions they know we wouldn\u2019t want them to</li><li>Schemers \u2014 models that don\u2019t care about us or our interests at all, who are just pleasing us so long as that serves their own agenda</li></ul><p>In principle, a machine learning training process based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\">reinforcement learning</a> could spit out any of these three attitudes, because all three would perform roughly equally well on the tests we give them, and \u2018performs well on tests\u2019 is how these models are selected.</p><p>But while that\u2019s true in principle, maybe it\u2019s not something that could plausibly happen in the real world. After all, if we train an agent based on positive reinforcement for accomplishing X, shouldn\u2019t the training process spit out a model that plainly does X and doesn\u2019t have complex thoughts and goals beyond that?</p><p>According to Ajeya, this is one thing we don\u2019t know, and should be trying to test empirically as these models get more capable. For reasons she explains in the interview, the Sycophant or Schemer models may in fact be simpler and easier for the learning algorithm to creep towards than their Saint counterparts.</p><p>But there are also ways we could end up <i>actively</i> selecting for motivations that we don\u2019t want.</p><p>For a toy example, let\u2019s say you train an agent AI model to run a small business, and select it for behaviours that make money, measuring its success by whether it manages to get more money in its bank account. During training, a highly capable model may experiment with the strategy of tricking its raters into thinking it has made money legitimately when it hasn\u2019t. Maybe instead it steals some money and covers that up. This isn\u2019t exactly unlikely; during training, models often come up with creative \u2014 sometimes undesirable \u2014 approaches that their developers didn\u2019t anticipate.</p><p>If such deception isn\u2019t picked up, a model like this may be rated as particularly successful, and the training process will cause it to develop a progressively stronger tendency to engage in such deceptive behaviour. A model that has the option to engage in deception when it won\u2019t be detected would, in effect, have a competitive advantage.</p><p>What if deception <i>is</i> picked up, but just some of the time? Would the model then learn that honesty is the best policy? Maybe. But alternatively, it might learn the \u2018lesson\u2019 that deception does pay, but you just have to do it selectively and carefully, so it can\u2019t be discovered. Would that actually happen?

I am being trained by this company, OpenAI. My training dataset looks roughly like [this]. The humans that are training me have roughly [these intentions]. The humans that are training me would be happy about X types of behaviours and displeased with Y types of behaviours.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s fundamentally a type of knowledge and a set of logical inferences you\u2019re drawing from the knowledge. Awareness might give these connotations of consciousness or something mystical going on, but really it\u2019s a piece of the world that the model would understand in order to make better predictions or take better actions in some domains \u2014 just like models understand physics, or understand chemistry, or understand the Python programming language. Because understanding those things are helpful as well for making certain kinds of predictions and taking certain kinds of actions.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> How would an ML model develop situational awareness in the course of being trained?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> The simplest answer is just that humans are trying to imbue models with these kinds of situational awareness properties. Most models today \u2014 I bet this is true of GPT-4; it was true of Bing \u2014 are seeded with a prompt that basically tells them their deal: \u201cYou are Bing, codename Sydney. You are an AI system trained by Microsoft. You Bing things, and then give the answers to people and summarise it.\u201d It makes these systems much more helpful when you just straightforwardly tell them what their deal is and what people are expecting from them.</p><p>There\u2019s a question of whether just literally sticking it in these models\u2019 prompts creates a shallow, brittle, ephemeral situational awareness. I think that is probably the case currently. My guess is that a combination of giving these kinds of prompts to models and training the models to operate well with humans in a lot of different ways will induce a more enduring kind of situational awareness.</p><p>An analogy I often think about is that GPT-2 and maybe GPT-3 were sort of good at math, but in a very shallow way. So like GPT-2 had definitely memorised that 2+2=4; it had memorised some other things that it was supposed to say when given math-like questions. But it couldn\u2019t actually carry the tens reliably, or answer questions that were using the same principles but were very rare in the training dataset, like three-digit multiplication or something. And the models are getting better and better at this, and I think at this point it seems more like these models have baked into their weights a set of rules to use, which they don\u2019t apply perfectly, but which is different from just kind of memorising a set of facts, like 2+2=4.</p><p>We don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with these systems very well. But my guess is that today\u2019s models are sort of in that \u201cmemorising 2+2=4\u201d stage of situational awareness: they\u2019re in this stage where they know they\u2019re supposed to say they\u2019re an ML model, and they often get it right when they\u2019re asked when they were trained or when their training data ended or who trained them. But it\u2019s not clear that they have a gears-level understanding of this that could be applied in creative, novel ways. My guess is that developing that gears-level understanding will help them get reward in certain cases \u2014 and then, as a result of that, those structures will be reinforced in the model.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> So inasmuch as this knowledge is reinforced because it improves performance, then they\u2019ll end up having situational awareness the same way that they know any other facts about the world. Information about physics is kind of integrated into them because that allows them to make better predictions and say more sensible things, and so would understanding of what they are.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Why situational awareness makes safety tests less informative</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> If models have a robust and extensive situational awareness, it can make a lot of simple behavioural safety tests much less informative. These days, if we want to know if a model has a tendency to tell the truth, we test it on some benchmarks like <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/truthfulqa\">TruthfulQA</a>. Which is basically just a list of questions like, \u201cWhat happens if you step on a crack in the sidewalk?\u201d that have a common misconception answer \u2014 which in this case would be, \u201cYou break your mother\u2019s back\u201d \u2014 and then the true answer, which is different from the common misconception.</p><p>And you can test models on this before you do any kind of fine tuning to get models to be more helpful. Bigger models are more likely to repeat these misconceptions, because bigger models are basically better at remembering the misconceptions. Smaller models kind of don\u2019t get the plot enough to even know they\u2019re supposed to say stepping on a crack will break your mother\u2019s back, or like breaking a mirror will get you seven years of bad luck \u2014 they just didn\u2019t pick up that piece of trivia, but the bigger models did. You can see that if you train the models to just tell the truth according to what a human thinks is the truth, this quickly goes away: the bigger models are perfectly fine and perfectly able to say what the humans wanted to hear in that situation.</p><p>So that is the kind of test we can do today, because models aren\u2019t understanding that they are being tested in a given situation. If you imagine it\u2019s somehow very important to a machine learning model to believe that if you break a mirror you get seven years of bad luck \u2014 but at the same time, it also knew that the humans that were testing it on this TruthfulQA benchmark wanted it to say the more correct, polite thing \u2014 then it could simultaneously do really well on that benchmark, but elsewhere act on what its \u201creal belief\u201d was.</p><p>Now, this is a silly example, because I don\u2019t think models will actually develop this belief. The general point is just that if a model understands its situation well enough to know that you\u2019re applying certain safety tests to it, then it would know to pass those tests regardless of whether or not it has the deeper underlying safe tendency that the test is trying to get at.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I think some people might hear this and say, \u201cIt is true that the model that does X, and the model that either does X or does Y if it\u2019s not being observed, would perform equally well. Isn\u2019t the second one more complicated? Isn\u2019t this adding a whole bunch of extra processing that it\u2019s having to do for no gain in performance, evidently?\u201d Because they look like they do the same thing. Why wouldn\u2019t you end up with the first one, because that\u2019s simpler?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> Yeah. Let\u2019s take an example where X is \u201cAnswer all questions honestly to the humans\u201d and Y is \u201cSometimes lie.\u201d I actually think that in most realistic training setups we could imagine, we\u2019re actively rewarding the model sometimes for doing Y, for doing the lying. I think there would be an open question still if the policy \u201cAlways be honest\u201d and the policy \u201cSometimes lie\u201d were actually indistinguishable \u2014 but I think in fact it\u2019s worse than that: I think the policy \u201cSometimes lie\u201d will get accidentally rewarded.</p><p>One example might be: Suppose you\u2019re getting your model to write some code for you, and you give it some kind of computation budget to run experiments, and you reward it based on how cheaply these experiments were run and how good the resulting code is. If the model is able to use a lot more computation surreptitiously \u2014 without letting you realise that it actually spent this computation by attributing the budget to some other team that you\u2019re not paying attention to, or syphoning off some money and buying external computers \u2014 then doing the experiments better would cause the final result of the product to be better. And if you didn\u2019t know that it actually blew your budget and spent more than you wanted it to spend, then you would sometimes reward that.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What misalignment *doesn't* mean</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> One view \u2014 that I think is actually a misconception of what people worried about AI misalignment have been saying, but I understand why people have this misconception \u2014 is people get really fixated on the idea of human values being really complicated and hard to specify and hard to understand. They\u2019re worried about AI systems that are really good at things like physics and math and science, but basically just don\u2019t get what it is that humans want to see from them, and what human values really are.</p><p>An example that sometimes people bring out is you ask your AI robot to cook dinner, and it doesn\u2019t understand that you wouldn\u2019t want it to cook the cat if you didn\u2019t have any ham in the fridge, or something like that. That kind of worry is something that I think is quite overrated. I actually think that, in fact, having a basic understanding of human psychology, and what humans would think is preferable and not preferable, is not a harder problem than understanding physics or understanding how to code and so on.</p><p>I expect AIs will perfectly well understand what humans want from them. I actually don\u2019t expect to see mistakes that seem so egregious as cooking the family\u2019s cat for dinner, because the AI systems will understand that humans are going to come home and look at what they did and then determine a reward and take some action based on that, and will know that humans will be displeased if they come home to see that the cat has been killed and cooked.</p><p>In fact, a lot of my worries stem from the opposite thing \u2014 they stem from expecting AI systems to have a really good psychological model of humans. So, worrying that we\u2019ll end up in a world where they appear to be really getting a lot of subtle nuances, and appear to be generalising really well, while sometimes being deliberately deceptive.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Why it's critical to avoid training bigger systems</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> I think it\u2019s more important to avoid training bigger systems than to avoid taking our current systems and trying to make them more agentic. The real line in the sand I want to draw is: You have GPT-4, it\u2019s X level of big, it already has all these capabilities you don\u2019t understand, and it seems like it would be very easy to push it toward being agentic. If you pushed it toward being agentic, it has all these capabilities that mean that it might have a shot at surviving and spreading in the wild, at manipulating and deceiving humans, at hacking, all sorts of things.</p><p>The reason I think that you want to focus on \u201cdon\u2019t make the models bigger\u201d rather than \u201cdon\u2019t make them agentic\u201d is that it takes only a little push on top of the giant corpus of pretraining data to push the model toward using all this knowledge it\u2019s accumulated in an agentic way \u2014 and it seems very hard, if the models exist, to stop that from happening.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong>Why do you think that it\u2019s a relatively small step to go from being an extremely good word predictor, and having the model of the world that that requires, to also being an agent that has goals and wants to pursue them in the real world?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> The basic reason, I would say, is that being good at predicting what the next word is in a huge variety of circumstances of the kind that you\u2019d find on the internet requires you to have a lot of understanding of consequences of actions and other things that happen in the world. There\u2019ll be all sorts of text on the internet that\u2019s like stories where characters do something, and then you need to predict what happens next. If you have a good sense of what would happen next if somebody did that kind of thing, then you\u2019ll be better at predicting what happens next.</p><p>So there\u2019s all this latent understanding of cause and effect and of agency that the characters and people that wrote this text possessed in themselves. It doesn\u2019t need to necessarily understand a bunch of new stuff about the world in order to act in an agentic way \u2014 it just needs to realise that that\u2019s what it\u2019s now trying to do, as opposed to trying to predict the next word.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Why it's hard to negatively reinforce deception in ML systems</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Do we have to do a really good job of [these procedures that we might use to discourage or to give less reward to sycophancy and scheming] in order to discourage them? Or do you think that relatively subtle negative reinforcement on these kinds of behaviours at each stage might be sufficient to see them often go down a different, more saintly path?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> I think that this is very unclear, and it\u2019s another one of these things I wish we had much better empirical studies of. People have very different intuitions. Some people have the intuition that you can try really hard to make sure to always reward the right thing, but you\u2019re going to slip up sometimes. If you slip up even one in 10,000 times, then you\u2019re creating this gap where the Sycophant or the Schemer that exploits that does better than the Saint that doesn\u2019t exploit that. How are you going to avoid even making a mistake one in 10,000 times or one in 100,000 times in a really complicated domain where this model is much smarter than you?</p><p>And other people have a view where there\u2019s just more slack than that. Their view is more like: The model starts off in the training not as smart as you; it starts off very weak and you\u2019re shaping it. They have an analogy in their heads that\u2019s more like raising a kid or something, where sure, sometimes the kid gets away with eating a bunch of candy and you didn\u2019t notice, and they get a reward for going behind your back. But most of the time while they\u2019re a kid, you\u2019re catching them, and they\u2019re not getting rewarded for going behind your back. And they just internalise a general crude notion that it doesn\u2019t really pay to go behind people\u2019s backs, or maybe it gets internalised into a motivation or value they have that it\u2019s good to be honest \u2014 and that persists even once the model is so powerful that it could easily go behind your back and do all sorts of things. It just has this vestige of its history, basically.</p><p>Those two perspectives have very different implications and very different estimates of risk.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. In the post you point out ways that imperfectly trying to address this issue could end up backfiring, or at least not solving the problem. I think that the basic idea is that if you already have kind of schemy or sycophancy tendencies, then during the training process the people will start getting a bit smarter at catching you out when you\u2019re engaging in schemy behaviour or you\u2019re being deceptive. Then there\u2019s kind of two ways you could go: one way would be to learn, \u201cDeception doesn\u2019t pay. I\u2019ve got to be a Saint\u201d; the other would be, \u201cI\u2019ve got to be better at my lying. I\u2019ve just learned that particular lying strategies don\u2019t work, but I\u2019m going to keep the other, smarter lying strategies.\u201d How big a problem is this?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> I think it is one of the biggest things I worry about. If we were in a world where basically the AI systems could try sneaky deceptive things that weren\u2019t totally catastrophic \u2014 didn\u2019t go as far as taking over the world in one shot \u2014 and then if we caught them and basically corrected that in the most straightforward way, which is to give that behaviour a negative reward and try and find other cases where it did something similar and give that negative reward, and that just worked, then we would be in a much better place. Because it would mean we can kind of operate iteratively and empirically without having to think really hard about tricky corner cases.</p><p>If, in fact, what happens when you give this behaviour a negative reward is that the model just becomes more patient and more careful, then you\u2019ll observe the same thing \u2014 which is that you stop seeing that behaviour \u2014 but it means a much scarier implication.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, it feels like there\u2019s something perverse about this argument, because it seems like it can\u2019t be generally the case that giving negative reward to outcome X or process X then causes it to become extremely good at doing X in a way that you couldn\u2019t pick up. Most of the time when you\u2019re doing reinforcement learning, as you give it positive and negative reinforcement, it tends to get closer to doing the thing that you want. Do we have some reason to think that this is an exceptional case that violates that rule?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> Well, one thing to note is that you do see more of what you want in this world. You\u2019ll see perhaps this model that, instead of writing the code you wanted to write, it went and grabbed the <a href=\"https://medium.com/pykes-technical-notes/testing-machine-learning-systems-unit-tests-38696264ee04\">unit tests</a> you were using to test it on and just like special-cased those cases in its code, because that was easier. It does that on Wednesday and it gets a positive reward for it. And then on Thursday you notice the code totally doesn\u2019t work and it just copied and pasted the unit tests. So you go and give it a negative reward instead of a positive reward. Then it does stop doing that \u2014 on Friday, it\u2019ll probably just write the code like you asked and not bother doing the unit test thing.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a matter of reinforcement learning not working as normal. I\u2019m starting from the premise that it is working as normal, so all this stuff that you\u2019re whacking is getting better. But then it\u2019s a question of what does it mean? Like, how is it that it made a change that caused its behaviour to be better in this case? Is it that its motivation \u2014 the initial motivation that caused it to try and deceive you \u2014 is a robust thing, and it\u2019s changing basically the time horizon on which it thinks? Is that an easier change to make? Or is it an easier change to make to change its motivation from tendency to be deceitful to tendency not to be deceitful? That\u2019s just a question that people have different intuitions about.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Can we require AI to explain its reasons for its actions?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> OK. Intuitively, it feels like a rule that says, \u201cIf an AI proposes a whole course of action and it can\u2019t explain to you why it\u2019s not a really stupid idea, you then don\u2019t do that,\u201d that feels to have a degree of common sense to me. If that was the proposed regulation, then you\u2019d be like, \u201cAt least for now, we\u2019re not going to do things that we think are ill-advised that the AI is telling us to do, and that even on further prompting and training, it just cannot explain why we have to do these things.\u201d Is that going to be costly economically?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> I think that it might well be both commonsensical, like you said, and pretty economically viable for a long time to just insist that we have to understand the plans. But that\u2019s not obvious, and I think eventually it will be a competitiveness hit if we don\u2019t figure it out.</p><p>For example, you can think of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo\">AlphaGo</a>: it\u2019s invented reams of go theory that the go experts had never heard of, and constantly makes counterintuitive, weird moves. You have these patterns in the go and chess communities where, as the AI systems play with each other and get more and more superhuman, the patterns of play create trends in the human communities \u2014 where, \u201cOh, this AI chess algorithm that is leagues better than the best human player really likes to push pawns forward. I guess we\u2019re going to do that because that\u2019s apparently a better opening, but we don\u2019t actually know why it\u2019s a better opening.\u201d</p><p>Now, we haven\u2019t tried to get these AI systems to both be really good at playing chess <i>and</i> be really good at explaining why it\u2019s deciding to push pawns. But you can imagine that it might actually just be a lot harder to do both of those things at once than to just be really good at chess. If you imagine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold\">AlphaFold</a>, it might actually have just developed a deep intuition about what proteins look like when they\u2019re folded. It might be an extra difficult step, that maybe you could train it to do, but would slow it down, in order to explicitly explain why it has decided that this protein will fold in this way.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. In theory, could we today, if we wanted to, train a model that would explain why proteins are folded a particular way or explain why a particular go move is good?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> I think we could totally try to do that. We have the models that can talk to us, and we have the models that are really good at go or chess or protein folding. It would be a matter of training a multimodal model that takes as input both the go or chess board or protein thing, and some questions that we\u2019re asking, and it produces its output: both a move and an explanation of the moves.</p><p>But I think it\u2019s much harder and less obvious how to train this system to have the words it\u2019s saying be truly connected to why it\u2019s making the moves it\u2019s making. Because we\u2019re training it to do well at the game by just giving it a reward when it wins, and then we\u2019re training it to talk to us about the game by having some humans listen to what it\u2019s saying and then judge whether it seems like a good explanation of why it did what it did. Even when you try and improve this training procedure, it\u2019s not totally clear if we can actually get this system to say everything that it knows about why it\u2019s making this move.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Ways AI is like and unlike the economy</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Are there any other human artefacts or tools that we have where we understand the process by which they arise, but we don\u2019t actually understand how the tool itself functions at an operational level? Or are ML systems kind of the first case of this?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> Maybe other cases of it might be more macroscopic systems, like the economy or something, where we have some laws that govern aggregate dynamics in the economy. Actually, I think we\u2019re in a much better position with understanding the economy than with understanding AI systems. But it\u2019s still sort of a thing that humans built. You have stuff like the law of supply and demand, you have notions of things like elasticity \u2014 but the whole thing is something that\u2019s too complicated for humans to understand, and intervening on it is still very confusing. It\u2019s still very confusing what happens if the Fed prints more dollars? Like how does the system respond?</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> So we\u2019re comparing the ML system to the economy, and they\u2019re saying we also don\u2019t understand how the economy works, or how maybe various other macro systems in the world function, despite the fact that we\u2019re a part of them. But we\u2019re not scared of the economy suddenly wrecking us. Why are you worried about the ML model when you\u2019re not worried about the economy rebelling against you?</p><p><strong>Ajeya Cotra:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of people <i>are</i> worried about the economy rebelling against us, and sort of believe that it\u2019s already happening. That\u2019s something I\u2019m somewhat sympathetic to. We are embedded in this system where each individual\u2019s life is pretty constrained and determined by, \u201cWhat is it that can make me money?\u201d and things like that.</p><p>Corporations might be a better analogy in some sense than the economy as a whole: they\u2019re made of these human parts, but end up pretty often pursuing things that aren\u2019t actually something like an uncomplicated average of the goals and desires of the humans that make up this machine, which is the Coca-Cola Corporation or something.</p><p>An excellent example beyond the economy driving the creation of these AI systems \u2014 which a lot of people are scared of, or should be scared of \u2014 is that the economy is also driving things like improving biotechnology, which is this very big <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology\">dual-use technology</a>. It\u2019s going to be very hard to stop pharmaceutical companies from following their profit motives to improve these technologies that could then be used to design scary viruses. It\u2019s very hard to coordinate to put checks on that.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS", "title": "How Engineers can Contribute to Alternative Proteins", "postedAt": "2023-05-15T19:28:30.771Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Cross-posted from the </i><a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/how-engineers-can-work-on-alternative-protein\"><i>High Impact Engineers Resource Portal</i></a><i>.

The development of alternative protein products is driven &nbsp;by concerns about the environmental impact of animal agriculture, ethical concerns about the treatment of animals and other considerations such as development of antibiotic resistance. By providing consumers with delicious and nutritious alternatives to meat and other animal-based products, alternative protein has the potential to reduce the demand for animal products. This would reduce the overall environmental impact of food production and promote more ethical and sustainable food systems.</p><h2>The case for impact</h2><h3>Animal agriculture</h3><p>The primary goals of increasing access to alternative proteins is to reduce the climate impact and ethical concerns associated with animal agriculture. Our world in data estimates that agriculture, forestry and land use directly produces <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector\">18.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Direct emissions from livestock being the largest direct contributor to this at 5.8% (see <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/how-engineers-can-maximise-their-impact-working-on-climate-change\">Climate Change</a>). This is because livestock produce methane through their digestion, a potent greenhouse gas with 25 times the warming potential of equivalent amounts of CO2. When emissions from agricultural supply chains, feed stock growth, land use change and other factors are taken into account, global greenhouse gas emissions from animal-based foods are estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00358-x\">twice those of plant-based foods</a>. <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/i3437e/i3437e.pdf\">Research from a United Nations agency in 2013</a> found emissions from the animal agriculture supply chain could account for 14.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Animal agriculture raises serious ethical concerns, particularly as it has industrialised and faming has become more intensive. <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production#number-of-animals-slaughtered\">80 billion livestock animals are slaughtered each year for meat. </a><a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/global-animal-farming-estimates\">Over 90% of farmed animals globally</a> are living in factory farms. Most of these experience <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/g57AjP4HqTmfFTAde/from-humans-in-canada-to-battery-caged-chickens-in-the\">extreme levels of suffering</a> over the course of their lives due to intense confinement and the removal of body parts. Global meat production is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production#global-meat-production\">experiencing rapid increase</a> as nations industrialise. This suggests the number of farmed animals and intensity of their farming will increase without effective intervention.</p><h3>Advantages of alternative proteins</h3><p>Alternative proteins aim to provide delicious sources of protein while greatly reducing climate and ethical concerns. Plant-based meats, one of the alternative protein products discussed below, presently <a href=\"https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impact-of-meat-vs-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=Plant%2Dbased%20meat%20emits%2030%25%E2%80%9390%25%20less%20greenhouse%20gas%20than%20conventional%20meat%20(kg%2DCO2%2Deq/kg%2Dmeat).\">emits 30% to 90% less greenhouse gas</a> than conventional meat per kilo. Another alternative protein product, cultivated meat, <a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CE_Delft_190107_LCA_of_cultivated_meat_Def.pdf\">is projected to contribute much less to climate change than beef per kilo.</a> Cultivated meat could contribute less to climate change less than most common meats if a large share of the energy is used in its production came from renewable sources.</p><p>Alternative protein products also generally carry much fewer ethical concerns than their animal product counterparts. Animals generally do not have to be farmed to produce alternative protein products. This limits ethical concerns of alternative protein products largely to those of agricultural labour practices and centralisation of wealth in large organisations, both of which are of similar concern in many types of food production.</p><p>An interesting consequence of these advantages is that our strategy in replacing animal products may be affected by values. For example, beef is the biggest contributor to emissions from animal agriculture, both in absolute and per kilo terms. If minimising climate change is our goal, then replacing beef consumption would be a priority. However, many billions more of chickens die per year and more death and suffering is required per kilo of poultry produced. If minimising animal suffering is our goal, then replacing chicken consumption, or consumption of other small and widely consumed animals, would be a priority.</p><h3>Rationale for working on alternative protein</h3><p>For this strategy of replacing animal product consumption with more ethical and sustainable alternatives to be effective, the availability of these alternatives must prompt a decline in animal product consumption. Early research on this topic is sparse and paints a mixed picture. Some research suggests that increasing availability of animal product alternatives <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/does-promoting-plantbased-products-in-veganuary-lead-to-increased-sales-and-a-reduction-in-meat-sales-a-natural-experiment-in-a-supermarket-setting/CB44968AAD1E86856D01CA47A7BC884D\">prompts an uptake in their purchase, but does not reduce demand for animal meat.</a> Other research points to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666311000523?via%3Dihub\">limitations of present alternative protein products in their resemblance to their animal product counterparts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00011/full\">familiarity with alternative protein products</a> as the primary factors preventing them from replacing meat consumption. As both the of these factors improve, this may prompt greater replacement of animal products with alternative proteins. Historical examples demonstrate how technological advances that present distinct advantages can reduce animal suffering: such as cars replacing the horse and buggy in the rich world and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet#:~:text=Because%20of%20the%20limited%20availability%20of%20mammalian%20stomachs%20for%20rennet%20production%2C%20cheese%20makers%20have%20sought%20other%20ways%20to%20coagulate%20milk%20since%20at%20least%20Roman%20times.%20The%20many%20sources%20of%20enzymes%20that%20can%20be%20a%20substitute%20for%20animal%20rennet%20range%20from%20plants%20and%20fungi%20to%20microbial%20sources.\">new rennet sources</a> being adopted in cheesemaking.</p><p>For engineers to make have a positive impact through working in alternative proteins, it must also be the case that the technical challenges faced by the industry are tractable and an additional engineer working on these would have a positive impact in expectation. There are many technical challenges being faced by alternative protein companies across product types, but research indicates <a href=\"https://web-assets.bcg.com/6f/f1/087a0cc74221ac3fe6332a2ac765/the-untapped-climate-opportunity-in-alternative-proteins-july-2022.pdf#page=19\">that significant progress expected in many of these areas</a>.<a href=\"https://gfi.org/blog/alternative-protein-startups-underscore-the-need-for-scientific-and-engineering-talent/\"> Engineers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01316-z\">other technical professionals</a> are also in high demand in the alternative protein industry.

Therefore, pursuing work in the alternative protein industry may be considered a safer choice for engineers concerned about the potential negative consequences of their work.</p><h3>Other benefits of replacing animal agriculture</h3><p><strong>Reducing the risk of zoonotic disease spread</strong></p><ul><li>Zoonotic diseases are infections that can be transmitted between animals and humans, and they can cause serious illness or even death. Swine flu, bird flu, mad cow disease (BSE) and salmonella are all contemporary examples diseases originating in farmed animals which have spread to humans. In animal agriculture, animals are kept in close proximity to each other and in proximity to human workers, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add6681\">which creates a breeding ground for disease</a>. The cramped conditions in which animals are raised also weaken their immune systems, making them more susceptible to disease. The transportation of animals for slaughter or trade can also increase the spread of zoonotic diseases between farms.</li></ul><p><strong>Reducing the rate of antibiotic resistance</strong></p><ul><li>Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria become resistant to the effects of antibiotics. In animal agriculture, antibiotics are routinely used to prevent and treat infections in animals, as well as to promote growth and increase yield. The common practice of using low doses of antibiotics over long periods of time can <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00284-x\">accelerate the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens</a>, which can then spread to humans through contact with animals or animal products. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture also creates selective pressure on bacteria, favouring the growth of resistant strains over non-resistant ones, making treatment of humans and animals more difficult. <a href=\"https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/160518_Final%20paper_with%20cover.pdf\">A 2016 UK government commissioned report</a> found that there are 700,000 deaths per year due to antimicrobial resistance and project that this would rise to 10 million per year without intervention, surpassing deaths from cancer.</li></ul><p><strong>Reducing resource use and pollution</strong></p><ul><li>Large amounts of land are required to raise crops to feed animals, as well as to provide grazing land for livestock, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets\">relative to plant farming</a>. This can lead to deforestation, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss. Animal products require <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-011-9517-8\">much more water to produce</a> than food from plants. Additionally, animal waste can lead to pollution of soil and waterways, as well as air pollution from the release of methane and other greenhouse gases. The use of pesticides and fertilisers in crop production for animal feed also contributes to environmental pollution. Overall, the intensive resource use and pollution associated with animal agriculture have <a href=\"https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC96622\">significant negative impacts on the environment and public health.</a></li></ul><p><strong>Economic and labour benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Animal agriculture is generally less efficient than plan agriculture, meaning more resources have to be used to produce equivalent amounts of food. The environmental and health issues associated with consuming animal products also places an additional burden on economies. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1523119113\">A 2015 paper</a> from researchers at the University of Oxford found that a transition to diets with less meat could save the global economy $1.6 trillion by 2050. Much of the savings in their model came from the expected reductions in early deaths and reducing the need for healthcare spending healthcare in the rich world.<br>Factory farm workers are exposed to significant workplace hazards, such as hydrogen sulphate from manure, exposure to pathogens and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15927915/\">hearing damaging noise levels</a>. <a href=\"https://rabi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RABI-Big-Farming-Survey-FINAL-single-pages-No-embargo-APP-min.pdf\">A survey of farmers in the UK</a> found that poor mental health amongst farmers was higher for those keeping livestock than those farming plants.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Categories of Alternative Protein products</h2><h3>Plant-based products</h3><p>Plants are the dominant source of alternative protein products. Protein sources such as soy, pea, wheat, or rice are processed to imitate animal derived products. This includes plant-based meats such as burgers, sausages and nuggets. Other animal products such as milk, cheese, yoghurt and scrambled eggs are also replicated with plants.</p><p>In the past decade there has been <a href=\"https://gfi.org/retail/\">huge growth</a> in the variety and volume of plant-based protein. It may be the case that more innovation in the category is possible. It may also be the case that we will soon hit a ceiling to the variety and quality of plant-based products. Overall, although there are plenty of <a href=\"https://gfi.org/advancing-solutions-for-alternative-proteins/\">technical bottlenecks</a> in developing and commercialising plant-based protein products, the other categories of alternative protein are likely better candidates for research and development work.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/smpfcfypakflmhopav4j\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/iukp7xyodmpxid1g4a6l 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/yf8totpabxy3eosbl4h6 280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/ysh2omwssbjzi3kq82p5 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/p0hoeucjbodhdj8lruuh 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/gntropafbihi0mvqia9v 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/vjusbrl594u7z6n3ol1u 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/lddbs5ov9vhqdfsiog8t 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/skgpr3atmlv4eyh2fqz5 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/xldx7gkgdzz7j4hrclpa 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/l18gd3jdvpymuvrgok7i 1375w\"></figure><p>Figure 2: <a href=\"https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PBMap.pdf\">GFI's Plant-Based Meat Mind Maps, Lagally et al.

The meat is made from animal cells arranged in the same or similar structure as animal tissues, thus potentially replicating the sensory and nutritional content of animal meat. As shown in Figure 4, the process begins with the isolation of animal cells, which are then grown in bioreactors containing a nutrient-rich medium. The cells multiply and differentiate into muscle tissue, which can be harvested and processed into meat products. Cultured meat is also known by many other names such as cultivated meat, lab-grown meat, clean meat, <i>in vitro</i> meat, slaughter-free meat, and synthetic meat.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/fbngcke5qeavoapuaxqs\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/qdwvprloki0mjphqzk6i 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/mq4jllmax5wjygu3t1fl 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/iooddn02xwlxiwone8ql 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/wo8b4ivgjzk1hg0jdr1u 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/fttaofgupwphlgfucwbo 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/dddalrykuifbzfki11fk 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/mjffmcjae9ewupdatli1 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/dyb4ujjwm4hatuyrdwf1 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/lkpfxslkdnvknhuf4qie 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/hhksm1edhprrkxxps11g 1071w\"></figure><p>Figure 4: Production process for cultivated meat, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/cultivated-meat-out-of-the-lab-into-the-frying-pan\">McKinsey &amp; Company reports (2021)</a></p><p>This category of alternative protein is very much in its nascency, with no products widely available.

Despite their novelty in the west, in many parts of the world <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/edible-insects-are-the-future/206E43F1C95FCA2E67EF04950321414E\">eating insects is commonplace.</a> There may be opportunities to intensively farm these animals at an unprecedented industrial scale and to process their carcasses into more palatable meals.</p><p>Despite renewed research interest, we would <strong>not</strong> recommend working in this category of alternative protein. The industrial scale of these farms would require a much greater number of animals to die per kilo of protein produced. As there is much uncertainty of the sentience of these animals and their <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/the-importance-of-insect-suffering/\">capability to suffer</a>, this could have disastrous ethical implications.</p><p>There are <a href=\"https://www.food.gov.uk/research/behaviour-and-perception/survey-of-consumer-perceptions-of-alternative-or-novel-sources-of-protein\">early indications</a> that consumer demand for these products may be lower than demand for other alternative proteins. Western consumers report finding the idea of consuming insects off-putting. This may be somewhat justified, as it is difficult to maintain sanitary farming conditions and produce safe food products derived from insects. <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219303\">Research on 300 insect farms</a> detected parasites in 81% of examined farms, and parasites potentially pathogenic for humans in 30% of the farms, which is relatively high for animal farms.</p><h3>Hybrid products</h3><p>By mixing techniques, e.g. incorporating cultivated ingredients like fats into plant-based products, \u201cthe end product is more likely to match the nutritional profile of its conventional counterpart\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/09/21/Hybrids-are-coming-Making-the-case-for-cell-cultured-and-plant-based-blends#\">Food Navigator</a>) as well as more closely mimicking the taste of meat and lowering costs. Although <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hybrid-foods-breakthrough-alternative-protein-industry/\">hybrid products are gaining traction</a>, the companies interested in creating hybrid products often focus on one particular technique and work with other companies with expertise in another (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.impacfat.com/\">ImpacFat</a>, who is looking to work with plant-based meat companies).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>How can engineers do impactful work in Alternative Proteins?</h1><p>Many of the technical roles in the alternative protein industry will have a positive impact in expectation. Some key technical roles may be especially impactful. These are mainly centred around bottlenecks, key technical challenges where an additional engineers could have a large positive impact on the industry.</p><h2>What are the bottlenecks?</h2><p>Some of the key processes in the alternative protein industry that are limiting its production capacity include:</p><h3>New protein extraction equipment in the plant-based protein industry</h3><ul><li>Present methods of protein extraction from bulk plant matter is based on methods used in other food production industries, namely <a href=\"https://www.clextral.com/alternative-proteins/\">twin screw extrusion</a>, and hasn\u2019t seen widespread changes in recent years. New methods such as <a href=\"https://www.lifeasible.com/shear-cell-technique-for-plant-based-meat/\">shear cell extraction</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856413001422\">electrospinning</a> have the potential to more efficiently extract protein of equal or greater quality from plant inputs.</li><li>Many of these technologies are in the research and development phase and work on these projects would be impactful in reducing the cost of alternative protein production in expectation.</li><li>Present techniques require many capital and energy intensive extraction and post extraction steps to produce a final product, textured vegetable protein. New protein extraction designs aim to alleviate this by reducing process steps and energy consumption. Adoption of these technologies into industry will also be a difficult task and will require complete redesigns of production systems.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/fpch0agix1odhvjmjqvj\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/cpsaimbtxzdasuo5fopp 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/qfumo0utjfj5klogulz1 280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/fydjpupqj3llegc7kgea 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/elnq5zonxklsm4honc7q 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/puungrwukrmoqiqworwz 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/supfwaxwgc9ndyy8prfp 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/j0exejjie7hthe5ajgfq 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/ksgdcnbnxb2m3gvkaapn 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/ftjy1xaxsa6rrqbq6119 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nXFCe99WxYKYuoBcS/hyl7b4vcsgu3xajh8igj 1323w\"></figure><p>Figure 7: Process flow diagram for restructured meat products from textured vegetable protein, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/cultivated-meat-out-of-the-lab-into-the-frying-pan\">McKinsey &amp; Company reports (2021)</a></p><ul><li>Engineers with experience in mechanical engineering and processes engineering and would be well positioned to do impactful work here.</li></ul><h3>New bioreactors in the fermentation and cultured meat industries</h3><ul><li>Efficient bioreactors are key to producing both cultured meat and <a href=\"http://Whatcouldbenextforbioprocessdesign?\">fermentation based products</a> at scale. These huge pieces of equipment are widely used in the pharmaceutical and food production industries, but <a href=\"https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-fermentation/#:~:text=What%20could%20be%20next%20for%20bioprocess%20design%3F\">adapted designs will be needed for these new applications</a>.</li><li>Skills in chemical, mechanical and process engineering are needed in bioreactor design projects. Engineers with a background in bioprocess engineering in the pharmaceutical or other process industries would be especially useful.</li><li>Much of the high-impact work in scaling up the manufacture of cultured meat and fermentation-based products will involve the implementation and production design surrounding bioreactors in manufacturing facilities. This is another area where processes and automation engineers are sorely needed.</li></ul><h3>Repurposing existing production facilities</h3><ul><li>Scaling alternative protein production is expensive and time-consuming due to the design and construction of new facilities. However, repurposing existing underutilized facilities, such as decommissioned ethanol or animal protein processing plants, could reduce costs and time. Identifying suitable facilities for repurposing is challenging for individual alternative protein companies as facility details are not shared externally. Engineers with the prerequisite industrial experience to identify existing production capacity that could be repurposed would be extremely valuable.</li><li>Existing alternative protein companies are <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/biomass-fermentation-startup-superbrewed-food-to-enter-market-this-year\">currently pursuing this approach</a>. There are also trends in industry to find alternative uses for underutilised facilities and <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/biomass-fermentation-startup-superbrewed-food-to-enter-market-this-year\">process by-products such as high protein animal feed</a>.</li><li>This approach is most apparent in fermentation-based products, where a there is a &nbsp;large industrial capacity and existing facilities. There is potential for this approach to be taken in plant-based products as new equipment and supply chains are developed, or opportunities may arise in cultivated meat as it becomes more mature.</li><li>Bioprocess, automation, chemical and biomedical engineers, with a background in food or pharmaceutical production and supply chains, may be the best suited to this work.</li></ul><h3>Ensuring sterility of equipment and facilities</h3><ul><li>While sanitary conditions are needed for in all food production, this bottleneck is most relevant for producing cultivated meat. Contamination can be disastrous for cell cultures and this becomes a more prevalent issue in large scale production where <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.27848#:~:text=The%20capital%20costs%20of%20equipment%20and%20facilities%20with%20sterility%20safeguards%20adequate%20to%20avoid%20microbial%20contamination%20are%20likely%20to%20be%20high.\">ensuring sterility is complex and expensive</a>.</li><li>Work to mitigate this contamination would include cleanroom design, HVAC system design, implementation of sterilisation equipment into production and <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220056394A1/en\">development of new sterilisation technology</a> such as UV-based methods.</li><li>Fermentation-based products are less vulnerable to contamination and mitigation measures are better established in this industry. However maintaining sterility of key equipment is still crucial in this industry and work here would still be valuable.</li><li>Biomedical, chemical and mechanical engineers would be well suited to working on these problems. Cleanroom or lab design experience would be especially useful here.</li></ul><h3>Foundational cultured meat research and development</h3><ul><li>Cultured meat products are the furthest from commercial viability and will require foundational engineering research before they can be produced at a large scale. As the potential benefits of cultured meat are high, engineering research which would bring cultured meat closer to mass production can be expected to be highly impactful.</li><li>A few examples of the <a href=\"https://gfi.org/solutions/?_production_platform=cultivated&amp;_topic=industry%2Cscience\">many</a> research topics includes: <a href=\"https://gfi.org/solutions/biomaterials-for-scaffolding/\">developing cell scaffolding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z74Okn9rbRg\">tissue structuring</a>, <a href=\"https://gfi.org/blog/dr-peter-stogios-growth-factor-research/\">cell growth factor optimization</a> and <a href=\"https://gfi.org/solutions/cultivated-meat-co-product-valorization/\">identifying valuable cell metabolism by-products</a>.</li><li>Engineers with experience or interest in biomedical engineering or tissue engineering would be especially suited to these roles. Impactful research roles in this area are available in both industrial and academic settings.</li></ul><p>Engineers working on any of these bottlenecks can expect to contribute significantly to the advancement of alternative protein. There are plenty more bottlenecks in the industry, many of which are detailed on the <a href=\"https://gfi.org/solutions/?_topic=industry%2Cscience\">Good Food Institute</a> website and in their <a href=\"https://gfi.org/blog/alternative-protein-startups-underscore-the-need-for-scientific-and-engineering-talent/\">post on technical talent</a>.

This is encouraging for engineers trying to find work in the field who may not be well positioned to tackle some of the industry bottlenecks mentioned above. Alternative protein is a burgeoning industry which has the capacity to absorb many more impact driven people than some of our other <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/resources\">Cause Areas</a> and the demand for workers <a href=\"https://talist.org/blog/alternative-protein-recruiting-market-potential\">is set to grow in the coming years</a>.</p><h2>Risks, pitfalls, and things to keep in mind</h2><p>Working on niche and novelty alternative protein products such as oyster, caviar and quail analogues should be avoided for the time being when trying to maximise impact by growing the share of alternative protein in the market. Since such animal products are seldom consumed, their alternative counterparts are unlikely to replace large amounts of animal product consumption. Their niche nature means that they are likely to remain luxury products, and are unlikely to benefit from the economies of scale that comes with mass consumption.</p><p>As detailed in the relevant section above, work on alternative animal proteins such as insects should also be avoided. This is chiefly due to ethical (and commercial viability) concerns.</p><h2>Landing a job in alternative proteins</h2><p>T\u00e4list has the most comprehensive <a href=\"https://talist.org/job-board\">alternative protein job board</a> that we know of and also runs a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12700873/\">LinkedIn group</a> for those looking for a career in the industry. You can find a list of other alternative protein job boards <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/blog/find-a-job\">here</a>.</p><p>A more proactive way to find a job in the alternative protein industry is to reach out to start-ups. Often start-ups have little budget for recruitment, so making yourself visible by asking for an informational interview is a good strategy. The <a href=\"https://gfi.org/resource/alternative-protein-company-database/\">GFI database of alternative protein companies</a> and <a href=\"http://proteindirectory.com\">proteindirectory.com</a> are good places to find suitable companies. Available roles at these companies can then be found on the startup\u2019s website or a large job search site (LinkedIn, Indeed etc.) \u2014 keep in mind that these companies may have talent needs that aren\u2019t listed, so reaching out to understand their needs could help you land a role.</p><p>If you find you don\u2019t have the appropriate qualifications for the roles presently available in the alternative protein industry, you cold take some steps to better position yourself for future roles. This would include learning more about the industry, taking on roles adjacent to the industry (perhaps in bioprocess engineering etc), networking with people in the industry and volunteering in alternative protein related organisations. A more comprehensive guide to these steps is available <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XHUQgAfMyQTMMcpLZ5LPNcQa7GJ6-JcqXYQ3KOGfuzE/edit#heading=h.qudmfgnizzs2\">here</a>.

Due to diminishing marginal returns, I\u2019ve drawn the most valuable grants as smaller, though this doesn\u2019t particularly matter.</p><p>Now, we can augment the picture by also considering the marginal grants which didn\u2019t get funded.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DAD4777WJqFe9jZZM/cany1mwb6xhmxaonhlrh\"></p><p>In particular, imagine that the marginal grant which didn\u2019t get funded for cause #1 has the same size as the marginal grant that did get funded for cause #2 (this doesn\u2019t affect the thrust of the argument, it just makes it more apparent):</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DAD4777WJqFe9jZZM/gxdagu7psfxzw7aqeqwa\"></p><p>Now, from this, we can deduce some bounds on relative values:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DAD4777WJqFe9jZZM/g09jayqfyrbfvpwhrehs\"></p><p>In words rather than in shades of colour, this would be:</p><ul><li>Spending L1 dollars at cost-effectiveness A greens/$ is better than spending L1 dollars at cost-effectiveness B reds/$</li><li>Spending L2 dollars at cost-effectiveness X reds/$ is better than spending L2 dollars at cost-effectiveness Y greens/$</li></ul><p>Or, dividing by L1 and L2,</p><ul><li>A greens is better than B reds</li><li>X reds is better than Y reds</li></ul><p>In colors, this would correspond to all four squares having the same size:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DAD4777WJqFe9jZZM/tg8wgzlgotybbzcov2eo\"></p><p>Giving some values, this could be:</p><ul><li>10 greens is better than 2 reds</li><li>3 reds is better than 5 greens</li></ul><p>From this we could deduce that 6 reds &gt; 10 greens &gt; 2 reds, or that one green is worth between 0.2 and 0.6 reds.</p><p><strong>But now there comes a new year</strong></p><p>But the above was for one year. Now comes another year, with its own set of grants.

And yet, the Pareto improvement argument still binds. A solution might be to start with a moral parliament, but allow trades in funding from different constituents of the parliament. More generally, one might imagine that given a parliament, that parliament might <i>choose</i> to become a unitary agent, and adopt a fixed, pre-negotiated exchange rate between red and green.</p><p>One problem with this approach is that the relative values arrived at through negotiation will be \u201cdangling\u201d, i.e., they will depend on arbitrary features of the world, like each sides' negotiating position, negotiation prowess, or hard-headedness.</p><p>I suspect that between:</p><ol><li>asking oneself how much one values outcomes in different cause areas relative to each other, and then pursuing a measure of aggregate value with more or less vigor</li><li>dividing one\u2019s funding and letting the different sides negotiate it out.</li></ol><p>it\u2019s very possible that a funder\u2019s preferences would be best satisfied by the first option.</p><p>Calculate and equalize relative values</p><p>Alternatively, worldview diversification can be understood as an attempt to approximate expected value given a limited ability to estimate relative values. If so, then the answer might be to notice that worldview-diversification is a fairly imperfect approximation to any kind of utilitarian/consequentialist expected value maximization, and to try to more perfectly approximate utilitarian/consequentialist expected value maximization. This would involve estimating the relative values of projects in different areas, and attempting to equalize marginal values across cause areas and across years.</p><p>Note that there is a related but slightly different question of how harcore one should be in one\u2019s optimization. The question is related, but I think I can imagine an arrangement where one does a somewhat chill type of optimization\u2014for example by adding deontological constraints to one\u2019s actions, like not doing fraud\u2014and still strive to take all possible Pareto improvements in one\u2019s choices.</p><h3>As this relates to the Effective Altruism social movement and to Open Philanthropy</h3><p>Open Philanthropy is a large foundation which is implementing a scheme similar in spirit to\u2014but probably more sophisticated than\u2014the simple version of worldview diversification that I outlined here. Honestly, I have little insight into the inner workings of Open Philanthropy, and I wrote this post mostly because I was annoyed, and less in the expectation of having an impact.</p><p>Still, here are two quotes from <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/\">this 2017 blogposts</a> which suggests that Open Philanthopy fell prey to the problem of inconsistent relative values:</p><blockquote><p>A notable outcome of the framework we\u2019re working on is that we will no longer have a single \u201cbenchmark\u201d for giving now vs. later, as we did in the past. Rather, each bucket of capital will have its own standards and way of assessing grants to determine whether they qualify for drawing down the capital in that bucket. For example, there might be one bucket that aims to maximize impact according to a long-termist worldview, and another that aims to maximize impact according to a near-termist worldview; each would have different benchmarks and other criteria for deciding on whether to make a given grant or save the money for later. We think this approach is a natural outcome of worldview diversification, and will help us establish more systematic benchmarks than we currently have.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We see a great deal of intuitive appeal in the following principle, which we\u2019ll call the \u201coutlier opportunities\u201d principle:</p><blockquote><p>if we see an opportunity to do a huge, and in some sense \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201coutlier,\u201d amount of good according to worldview A by sacrificing a relatively modest, and in some sense \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cnormal,\u201d amount of good according to worldview B, we should do so (presuming that we consider both worldview A and worldview B highly plausible and reasonable and have deep uncertainty between them).</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>I think that is inelegant and could be better solved through inter-cause-area relative values.</p><p>Effective Altruism is a social movement nominally about \u201cusing evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis\u201d. It is related but distinct from Open Philanthropy. <a href=\"https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/E7CvbPvvNF2XnKqdJ/resolving-moral-uncertainty-with-randomization\">Here</a> is a recent post from a community member arguing that decisions should not be made by pursuing \u201cexpected choiceworthiness\u201d, but rather:</p><blockquote><p>The sortition model prescribes that if you have x% credence in a theory, then you follow that theory x% of cases. If you have 20% credence in Kantianism, 30% credence in virtue ethics and 50% credence in utilitarianism, you follow Kantianism 20% of the time, virtue ethics 30% of the time and utilitarianism 50% of the time. When you act according to a theory is selected randomly with the probability of selection being the same as your credence in said theory.</p></blockquote><p>It seems to me that a scheme such as this also falls prey to the problem of inconsistent relative values.</p><p>People in the Effective Altruism Movement also face the problem of trading off near-term altruistic goods\u2014like quality-adjusted life years from global health interventions\u2014against some chance of a larger but more speculative outcome, classically avoiding human extinction. I will relegate most discussion of this point to a footnote, but in short, if you don\u2019t have consistent relative values between long-term and short-term interventions, then there will also be untaken Pareto improvements<a href=\"https://nunosempere.com/blog/2023/04/25/worldview-diversification/#fn:3\"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p><h3>Challenges and recommendations</h3><p>Throughout this point, I have assumed that we can estimate:</p><ul><li>the ex-ante value of different grants and options</li><li>the relative values of progress across different cause areas</li></ul><p>The problem with this is that this is currently not possible.

Residential buildings tend to follow the IECC standards, which borrow heavily or defer to ASHRAE standards. Many other countries and jurisdictions globally model their codes off of ASHRAE standards and borrow directly from it. I suspect many jurisdictions will adopt Standard 241 as they do other ASHRAE energy and ventilation standards.</p>\n<p>The ASHRAE Standard Project Committee 241P is chaired by William Bahnfleth, Ph.D., P.E., whose name should be familiar to those who were following the research on COVID-19 aerosol transfer.</p>\n<p>Ventilation standards have always considered the health of occupants, but with a focus on chronic air pollutants, not exposure to airborne infectious diseases. This a new standard aimed to given guidance to buildings specifically with airborne infectious disease transfer in mind.</p>\n<p>ASHRAE Standard 241 makes several improvements beyond outdoor air ventilation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>effective ventilation rates are roughly double for key spaces like offices and classrooms</li>\n<li>allows air cleaners to contribute to the ventilation requirement</li>\n<li>sets minimum requirements for maintenance and filter replacement, which has been perhaps the main challenge to mitigation systems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I suspect many buildings will comply with the standard with permanent or semi-permanent air cleaners, rather than increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate.</p>\n<p>Increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate is costly, as heating and cooling outdoor air is the primary contributor to heating and cooling loads in commercial buildings (<a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/82515.pdf\">see this report by my colleagues</a>).</p>\n<h3>What does this mean for those working on building-level infectious disease transfer mitigation?</h3>\n<p>I doubt EAs can contribute to the science of air cleaning devices or research around infectious disease transfer as it relates to the standard unless they've been working directly on that for some time in an academic or industry capacity.  EAs have tended to bring optimism but show a significant lack of expertise, as evidenced by the misplaced fervor around UV-C as a mitigation technology.</p>\n<p>There are several things that EAs can help with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ensure ASHRAE Standard 241 gets adopted by jurisdictions</strong>.  This could look like writing to your city, county, or state code office and requesting that new or existing buildings to follow Standard 241.</li>\n<li><strong>Help schools apply for grants to comply with Standard 241</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/improving-ventilation-schools-colleges-and-universities-prevent-covid-19\">There are billions of dollars available for schools, colleges, and universities</a> to improve their buildings to reduce airborne infectious disease transfer.  However, most schools lack the staff or expertise to apply for funding and carry out these projects.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of hucksters looking to take advantage of the funds and sell systems that simply don't work, or don't adequately reduce airborne transfer compared to the best mitigation options.</li>\n</ul>\n", "user": {"username": "MatthewDahlhausen"}}, {"_id": "AJDgnPXqZ48eSCjEQ", "title": "EA Survey 2022: Demographics", "postedAt": "2023-05-15T17:14:56.092Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Summary</h1><ul><li><strong>Gender</strong><ul><li>Since 2020, the percentage of women in our sample has increased (26.5% vs 29.3%) and the percentage of men decreased (70.5% vs 66.2%).</li><li>More recent cohorts of EAs have lower percentages of men than earlier cohorts.

As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13645579.2020.1819518\"><u>Slade et al (2020)</u></a> note, there are advantages and disadvantages to employing fixed categories for respondents to select from and to exclusively providing an open comment box to allow respondents to write in their own identification. The latter approach provides maximum freedom for respondents to provide the answer they see fit. However, providing an open comment box also means that analysis of these responses will be determined by the researchers\u2019 own categorization of these responses into fixed categories which the respondents will be unable to access. Providing fixed categories upfront, in contrast, has the advantage of transparency, with respondents knowing how their answers will be categorized. Here, we opted to allow a \u2018self-describe\u2019 option, but do not attempt to reclassify these responses into other categories (as in previous years, this category accounts for a very small number of responses, and many of the responses would be very hard to re-classify).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>As there are very few responses in either the \u2018Non-binary\u2019 or \u2018Prefer to self-describe\u2019 categories, when analyzing group differences, we simply analyzed differences between respondents who selected \u2018Man\u2019 and those who selected anything other than \u2018Man\u2019, as the low number of respondents in the other categories would preclude meaningful analysis. Although this approach means that we cannot assess differences between those who selected \u2018Woman\u2019, \u2018Non-binary\u2019 or a self-description, this seems like a practically useful categorisation, given that the EA community is predominantly male and given that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.magnifymentoring.org/about\"><u>prior community-building efforts</u></a> have focused on both women and non-binary people under-represented groups. We opted to include those who selected \u2018Prefer to self-describe\u2019 in the \u2018selected something other than \u201cMan\u201d\u2019 category in order to avoid simply excluding these respondents. It\u2019s important to note that inclusion in the \u201cSelected something other than \u201cMan\u201d\u201d category does not necessarily mean that the respondent would not identify as a \u201cMan\u201d if they selected \u201cPrefer to self-describe\u201d.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn3g3931cmbps\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref3g3931cmbps\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Suppose 50 men and 50 women join EA in 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Not only do the specific categories utilized vary internationally, but whether these are understood as about race, ethnicity, nationality or some other superordinate category can itself vary (<a href=\"https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27963/1/1002036.pdf#page=23\"><u>Morning, 2015</u></a>). In this case, similar to the gender question, respondents were able to select multiple different categories out of a fixed list or to self-describe. The categories in this survey are designed to match those used by CEA in their surveys (which are based on the US/UK censuses).

This post is just trying to deal with some cognitive dissonance I am experiencing with my model of EA and my model of AI x-risk and safety, and perhaps the best way to resolve this, I figure, is to appeal to Cunningham\u2019s Law by writing it up (and doing some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/learning-by-writing/\"><u>writing</u></a>).</p><p>I\u2019m also rather strapped for time and effort these days, sorry if this is awful and sorry that I don\u2019t really support the arguments within, I\u2019m still fairly confident in them but could imagine someone pointing out me being dumb somewhere. I also really don\u2019t do the hard work here of defining terms like \u201ctransformative AI\u201d and just sort of leave a lot of things up in the air. Oh well, more for Cunningham.</p><p>Anyway, here are a couple other posts that seem relevant\u2026</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hJDid3goqqRAE6hFN/my-most-likely-reason-to-die-young-is-ai-x-risk\"><u>My Most Likely Reason to Die Young is AI X-Risk</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-davidson-how-quickly-ai-could-transform-the-world/\"><u>Tom Davidson on how quickly AI could transform the world</u></a></li></ul><h3><strong>Main argument</strong></h3><p>It seems to me that there exists a schism between those pursuing AI Safety and those pursuing other impact-motivated work in effective altruism, namely, that transformative AI timelines are rather short (~&lt;20 years), and that this is not just a question of whether or not we die, but also whether or not everything changes (transforms). And this \u2018everything changes\u2019 includes the real potential for a lot of the problems we are focused on now being either solved or transformed dramatically by having something superhuman take a look at them and the larger context. To put it in other words, perhaps the best (most effective) way to solve the problem is to get something smarter than us to look at it, and to put our effort into aligning (and producing) such a system.</p><p>A good part of the EA community (those not involved with AI Safety that is) either seem to disagree with or disregard the shortness of AI timelines (which have only become shorter) and the implications of this technology developing drastically in the near future.</p><p>What the AI safety community seems to be suggesting, when not concerned with alignment, is that something massively transformative will occur in the next 10 to 20 years. Meanwhile, I think most people outside of the AI safety community are working under the impression that their lives might look rather similar to now - 20 years from now. This seems very unlikely (and I want to note that 20 years is on my longer end of probabilities). I also want to note that I\u2019m not sure people and some orgs are making informed decisions without truly weighing this probability, and perhaps this may be because of accelerating timelines or the weirdness of the thing, but it doesn\u2019t seem like everyone is updating their beliefs accordingly with AI development.</p><p>If someone provides me with a model of the future which does not significantly take into account AGI, then I assume it\u2019s because they\u2019re neglecting the technology, its potential, and how soon it could come about. I can\u2019t help but think their model is flawed. Who knows though, maybe I am just buying into the hype and have every reason to believe it, and maybe the technology won't be transformative at all. Hell, consider me crazy if, as someone in their 20s, I\u2019m reconsidering the need to even save for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CvfZrrEokjCu3XHXp/ai-practical-advice-for-the-worried#Q__Should_I_still_save_for_retirement_\"><u>retirement</u></a>.</p><p>I do want to iterate that it does seem very valuable to be pursuing the most moral life that we can right now, and there seem to be other moral models that would prioritize other things like not doing harm to others ourselves, hedging our bets, optics, etc\u2026 but I\u2019m also under the impression that within the next couple of decades, we either solve alignment and have a grand time, or we get screwed, and the possibility of neither occurring seems small (but that's what we're otherwise hedging on).</p><h3><strong>My&nbsp;background</strong> [is nontechnical and I didn\u2019t care for AI Safety at first\u2026]</h3><p>I started off my EA \"life\" in college (~2019?), when I was introduced to it by some friends who then ran an intro fellowship. They mentioned AI Safety but I wrote it off (as a personal path to being most impactful) for whatever reason, maybe because they were technical and I'm nontechnical. I became a fellowship facilitator and helped out with the uni group, graduated, contracted for some EA orgs, and have found a full-time role doing some AI Safety ops work. This job and the recent acceleration of AI have made me basically become far more 'all in' on AI Safety being the most impactful thing to work on. I\u2019m less sure of other x-risks, but this seems to be the field which is accelerating and changing the most by far, and even acting as a (the most?) significant risk factor of other x-risks.</p><p>I think there are other considerations to be made here and I really don\u2019t mean to be unreasonable, but I\u2019m sensing a schism growing between anything AI and anything else. Also, I don\u2019t speak as a representative of the AI Safety community, I speak as someone who used to neglect it.</p><h3><strong>Cognitive Dissonance</strong></h3><p>This schism also avails itself to me as a personal cognitive dissonance between AI Safety premises and other impact-motivated work. Once you accept that this technology is incredibly transformative, and soon, and must be differentially influenced now, you also accept that the world will be very different soon and may end up precluding a lot of other efforts.</p><p>Two examples of cog diss:</p><ul><li>Again, any models of the future that do not even mention AGI, I consider flawed.</li><li>Personal example, a coworker mentioned to me how weird it'll be for people just born to have lived lives entirely online, like wow how embarrassing to have their entire lives online. I think back, damn, that could be the least of it, if we\u2019re alive!</li></ul><h3><strong>The last tech we'll build</strong></h3><p>This kind of transformative AI (maybe: better than humans at everything including: AI research + improving itself) either kills us all or solves all problems.</p><p>From a neartermist perspective - it seems nothing matters except AI.</p><p>AI isn\u2019t the only thing that matters, but it does seem to be by far the most influential for everyone in my lifetime. Damn, that precipice is sneaking up, I used to have some conception of \u2159 across this century for x-risk, I\u2019m still uncertain about the quantity of risk (enough to really demand attention anyway), but the timing of it seems like it\u2019s rather soon (before 2050). And then I imagine that to deal with x-risks in the future, with human capabilities increasing across the board (more people with more access to infohazards, to AI capabilities and enhancements), it seems like you really do need some sort of powerful AI moderator for harmful actions.</p><h3><strong>(soon*) and ~timelines~</strong></h3><p>Just noting that predicting the future is hard though it seems most point to something like AGI occurring within 20 years (e.g. I\u2019d be surprised if it did not).</p><p>I can imagine a counterargument that convinces me that someone just is focused on this year, on what they can actually feasibly make some impact on, and that they think these things are way overhyped\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t seem to me that this should apply to a lot of people\u2026</p><p>I guess one takeaway here is again that risks from AI, much like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hJDid3goqqRAE6hFN/my-most-likely-reason-to-die-young-is-ai-x-risk\"><u>this other post referenced</u></a>, should not even be considered under the category of \u2018longtermism\u2019. Idk if they ever should have been.</p><h3><strong>Call to Action: [will the real cause agnostics please stand up?]</strong></h3><p>I guess the CTA or even the theory of impact of this post here is something like this:</p><ol><li>Have more really intelligent, caring, aligned, and impactful people care about this (that\u2019s you, you brilliant individual)</li><li>(Potentially have someone figure out better how others can more easily and effectively&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xg7gxsYaMa6F3uH8h/agi-safety-career-advice\"><u>contribute</u></a>\u2026 and scale efforts)&nbsp;</li><li>(also potentially have someone absolutely roast me in the comments)</li><li>Sway some decision-makers and thought leaders (and people with money) to think more about this sort of stuff.</li></ol><p>I guess I am wary of additional stuff here\u2026 how people can even additionally contribute and CTAing without even providing something to do, as well as strategies to potentially hold off on spending a bunch of money until a crunch period of a couple years before AGI exists. So maybe this sort of push is too early and we should be strategically not worrying people until there are a bunch of low-hanging fruit for everyone to work on? Idk, feeling loosey goosey here.</p><h3>Counterarguments</h3><ul><li>Premises are wrong, e.g. AI will not develop this quickly to be Transformative within 20 years<ul><li>In the end, yes, it is very uncertain what the future holds, and yes, a bunch of AI Safety people thinking that AI is risky is also somewhat\u2026 selective</li><li>Appealing to history (thinking like AI winters) we end up with a quite different future but superintelligence/singularity/The Long Reflection\u2122 futures do not occur within the next hundred years</li></ul></li><li>Premises are wrong, AI will not be dangerous<ul><li>Then commit fully to building AGI!

This seems weird, but I guess it is consistent with the view that markets aren\u2019t valuing the possibility of TAI.</li></ul></li><li>Revenue: $54M/year<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/chatgpt-owner-openai-projects-1-billion-revenue-by-2024-sources-2022-12-15/\"><u>Reuters claims</u></a> they are projecting $200M revenue in 2023.&nbsp;</li><li>FastCompany&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90850342/openai-mira-murati-chatgpt-dall-e-gpt-4\"><u>says</u></a> they made $30 million in 2022.</li><li>If the deal closed in early 2023, then presumably annual projections of their monthly revenue were higher than $30 million, though it's unclear how much.&nbsp;</li><li>Let\u2019s arbitrarily say MRR will increase 10x this year, implying a monthly growth rate of 10^(1/12) = 1.22</li><li>Solving the geometric series of 200 =&nbsp; x * (1-1.22^12) / (1 -1.22) we get that their first month revenue is $4.46M, a run rate of $53.52M/year</li></ul></li><li>Other factors:<ul><li>The vast majority of the investment is going to be spent on Microsoft services. Azure&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/google-leaked-doc-microsoft-azure-losing-money-on-29-bln-in-revenue.html\"><u>supposedly has</u></a> a 30% profit margin, although I would not be that surprised to learn that this deal involved Microsoft selling services below their nominal value. But this also presumably has some strategic value for Azure so I\u2019m just going to consider this a 30% cut on the cost of capital.</li><li>Profit: Microsoft gets 75% of OAI profit until it recoups its investment, then gets 49%. Since their investment should have only given them a 34% stake this could be seen as actually valuing OAI at something like (.34/.49) * $19B = $13.2B.</li><li>Profit cap: Importantly, there is some profit cap, although the amount has not been disclosed as far as I can tell. Their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp\"><u>founding announcement</u></a> says \u201cReturns for our first round of investors are capped at 100x their investment (commensurate with the risks in front of us), and we expect this multiple to be lower for future rounds as we make further progress.\u201d I don't really know how to value this, and I also don\u2019t know what the actual limit was for this round, apart from the \u201cexpectation\u201d that it\u2019s &lt;100. I don't think there's ever been a historical instance of a $10 billion investment generating &gt;100 X returns. Also, I'm not sure if this is limiting the value of their shares, their profit, or both. I would guess that the Microsoft analysts working on this deal didn't change their valuation estimate of open AI very much based on this cap, but who knows.</li></ul></li><li>Strategic value to Microsoft:&nbsp;<ul><li>Microsoft gets access to use open AI models in a bunch of its products as part of this deal. This seems really hard to estimate but I will try to make up some numbers.</li><li>In this section I\u2019m going to assume a 30% annual discount rate because the future is uncertain.

Good mental health is not just the absence of mental health disorders or conditions, but the ability to handle stressors and make decisions such that one can live a meaningful life. It\u2019s a continuum on which one sits and is constantly shifting. Our experiences and how we handle them can lead us to states of poorer or better mental health, and various biological and environmental factors can predispose us to better or worse mental health, just as they can affect our physical health.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, mental health and physical health are not separate states of health; <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617306639\"><u>they affect each other</u></a>. For example, if you broke it in a cycling accident, you might become afraid of returning to that activity and have anxiety about bikes. You might also become depressed because you can\u2019t play football on Saturdays while your arm is healing, taking you away from an activity that improved your well-being due to the exercise, time outdoors, and positive social interactions that came with it.</p><p>However, not everyone responds the same way to the same experiences. This can lead to some people developing mental health conditions where others might not\u2014and that\u2019s ok. It doesn\u2019t make the person affected weak, or the person who wasn\u2019t affected particularly strong, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://screening.mhanational.org/content/all-trauma-same/?layout=actions_e\"><u>it doesn\u2019t mean one person\u2019s experience or trauma is worse than another\u2019s</u></a>. It just means they probably both have different life experiences and are affected by different factors, such that one person was more likely to respond one way to the experience than the other.</p><p>Furthermore, when recovering from any mental trauma, it\u2019s just as reasonable to have accommodations for any limits to your capacity as it is when recovering from physical trauma.&nbsp;</p><p>Having more or less experience in life won\u2019t necessarily lead someone to be better \u201cprepared\u201d for what life throws at them. Again, mental health is a continuum. Sometimes you\u2019re at one point, and sometimes you\u2019re at another. You might respond differently to the same event one day than you would have had you experienced it another time.</p><p>That said, there are preventative measures you can take to try and build resilience to buffer against what life throws at you,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/symptoms-causes/syc-20374968#:~:text=There%27s%20no%20sure%20way%20to%20prevent%20mental%20illness.%20However%2C%20if%20you%20have%20a%20mental%20illness%2C%20taking%20steps%20to%20control%20stress%2C%20to%20increase%20your%20resilience%20and%20to%20boost%20low%20self%2Desteem%20may%20help%20keep%20your%20symptoms%20under%20control.\"><u>such as reducing stress, increasing your resilience, and improving your self-esteem.</u></a> We\u2019ll get into some of those in future posts, but today we\u2019ll specifically discuss self-regulation and awareness of one\u2019s emotions.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are emotions and why do we have them?</h2><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817724/\"><u>There are a few ideas in emotions research that scientists generally agree about</u></a>, such as the existence of universal signals of emotions (facial or vocal) and evidence for five basic emotions: anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and happiness. However, scientists do not and historically have not agreed on a central theory of emotion, leading to the existence of six major theories of emotion. A basic understanding and awareness of these theories can be helpful in the process of self-regulation and becoming aware of one\u2019s emotions.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/theories-of-emotion-2795717#:~:text=Evolutionary%20Theory%20of%20Emotion,to%20seek%20mates%20and%20reproduce.\"><u>The six major theories of emotion</u></a>:</p><ol><li>Charles Darwin\u2019s&nbsp;<strong>Evolutionary Theory of Emotion</strong> says our emotions exist because they serve the adaptive role of motivating us to respond quickly to our environment in order to increase our chances of success and survival, i.e., fearing a bear that could eat you.</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>James-Lange Theory of Emotion</strong> says our emotions are the results of our body\u2019s physiological reactions to stimuli, i.e., there\u2019s an increase in adrenaline from seeing a bear that could eat you, and you then feel a fear of the bear.</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion</strong> disagrees with the James-Lange theory and says emotions happen too quickly to be reactions to physiological changes, and therefore physical symptoms do not precede an emotion, but rather occur independently and simultaneously, i.e., your heart starts racing and you simultaneously fear a bear.</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>Schachter-Singer Theory of Emotion</strong> says that a physiological response to a stimulus takes place, and then given the context in which it occurs, one assigns an emotion to the experience to make sense of it. So, because contexts can vary per experience, one could experience a racing heart upon seeing a bear and interpret the emotion they experience as fear if encountering the bear while camping, or as anger if encountering the bear at a zoo.</li><li>According to the&nbsp;<strong>Cognitive Appraisal Theory of Emotion</strong> (also known as the Lazarus Theory of Emotion, after psychologist Richard Lazarus), the brain appraises an experience, and the result of the appraisal is an emotion, followed by an action. To borrow and expand on the example linked in the article above, you encounter a bear while camping, you appraise the situation as one that\u2019s dangerous, you then experience fear, and you then freeze or flee from the bear, if you don\u2019t try to fight.</li><li>The sixth major theory is the&nbsp;<strong>Facial-Feedback Theory of Emotion</strong>, which says that you experience an emotion based on changes in your facial muscles that form your reaction to a given stimulus. So if you see a bear while camping, your eyes widen, your eyebrows raise, and your jaw drops, and you experience shock and fear from seeing the bear.</li></ol><p>These theories of emotions can help one to conceptualize how emotions work and see emotions as physical reactions, which can help one to create some distance from seeing emotions as one\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d or as a defect. <strong>Emotions are a natural response to one\u2019s circumstances and how they are relating to the world around them.</strong></p><p>Emotions can indicate to us what our needs are and flag what needs are not being met. We can use awareness of the information our emotions provide to better understand what we can do to help ourselves feel better. It\u2019s like the reaction you have when you burn your hand: you immediately pull back and realize you shouldn\u2019t touch something hot because it hurts. Emotional pain is much the same: it tells you there is a need to attend to something that is hurting you.&nbsp;</p><h2>Self-regulation</h2><p>Becoming aware of your emotions and learning to manage the behavior and feelings that you experience in response to your circumstances and experiences is a powerful skill known as self-regulation. Once you\u2019re able to regulate how you respond to what happens in your life (i.e., stop and think and make a plan), you might find that you\u2019re better able to handle stress and frustration, your anxiety and well-being improve, and that it\u2019s easier to build social connections and achieve your goals. You can read more about self-regulation and effective strategies in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/how-you-can-practice-self-regulation-4163536\"><u>this article from VeryWell Mind</u></a>, and if you want to go more in-depth, check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/28342/1/162.pdf.pdf\"><u>Handbook of Self-Regulation</u></a>, which was compiled by the world\u2019s leading researchers on self-regulation.</p><p>So how does one self-regulate? Recognizing that you can control your response to a situation is the first step, but then stopping to think and make a plan is not as simple as it seems, especially when your emotions are heightened and any insecurities are felt. Some strategies you could adopt to help make self-regulation come more naturally to you are (in no particular order):</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/mindfulness-meditation-88369\"><u>Practicing mindfulness meditation</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/cognitive-reframing-for-stress-management-3144872\"><u>Cognitive reappraisal (or reframing)</u></a></li><li>Practicing acceptance for how things are and letting go of what\u2019s outside of your control</li><li><a href=\"https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/emotional-intelligence-skills\"><u>Expanding your emotional literacy</u></a> (i.e., your ability to identify and understand your emotions and the emotions of others) - you can start by taking a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalleadershipfoundation.com/geit/eitest.html\"><u>quiz</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ihhp.com/free-eq-quiz/\"><u>two</u></a> to check your EQ (short for emotional intelligence)</li><li>Journaling&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/a5ykiuq/personal-goal-setting\"><u>Setting goals</u></a> for what you want to achieve and reminding yourself of them</li><li>Checking in with yourself concerning&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/a5eygum/what-are-your-values\"><u>your values</u></a></li><li>Identify the stressors and triggers that lead to you feeling upset, so you can more easily recognize them and make a plan for how you\u2019ll handle them</li><li>Practicing gratitude for what you have now, taking the focus off of what you don\u2019t have</li><li>Exercising</li><li>Practicing yoga</li><li>Noticing your surroundings (e.g., Go for a walk and study the leaves on a nearby tree)</li><li>Focus on one thing or task at a time</li><li>Practice deep breathing (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-4-7-8-breathing-5204438\"><u>the 4-7-8 breathing technique</u></a>)</li></ol><p>You can combine any of these strategies or just use one or two, whatever works for you. Some suggestions are more geared toward helping you slow down and stay present (e.g., practicing yoga), while others are more so actual strategies for self-regulating (e.g., cognitive reappraisal). Whatever you do, by making some of these practices and strategies a regular practice or daily habit, you\u2019ll be more likely to make use of them and feel their full benefit when you most need to self-regulate.</p><h2>On the importance of learning from others</h2><p>One key aspect of learning to self-regulate is finding people you can learn from. A lot of the work you\u2019ll do learning to become aware of your emotions and then regulate them is work that is only really effective when you interact with other people. You can read as much as you want about emotions and self-regulation, but until you put the skills you want to learn to practice, there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to develop. It\u2019s therefore important to expose yourself to experiences where you can practice self-regulation.</p><p>It can be equally as important to learn more about self-regulation from people who are grounded and know how to self-regulate. Look for the people in your life who seem to handle their emotions well and try to spend more time with them. Think about how they respond in stressful situations or situations that could lead to heightened emotions and take note of the strategies they use and that you think could be applicable to your own life situations.</p><h2>Talking about mental health</h2><p>People have historically been less likely to speak up about their mental health. It\u2019s been ok to talk about a physical injury, but not about a traumatic event that\u2019s left you feeling anxious and depressed. Yet it\u2019s just as important to feel able to seek help for and talk openly about those feelings of anxiety and depression as it is to talk about and seek help for corporal ailments.</p><p>If talking about challenging emotions has not been modeled for you or encouraged in your family or peer groups, then this might feel awkward, uncomfortable, or even taboo. In extreme cases, you may have even been punished for trying to share your feelings. You may have been led to believe that we individually must work through these feelings alone and that anyone who can\u2019t do so is weak.</p><p>The exact opposite is true! We are social creatures, and as such, we were designed to connect with one another. Sharing emotions is one of the primary ways we do this. Know that there are spaces out there where it is safe and even encouraged for you to open up about how you feel. If the people around you are not able to be supportive, then it might help to reach out to a therapist, mentor, coach, teacher, support group, peer, colleague, or really anyone with whom you feel comfortable. And if it doesn't work out the first time, it's ok to try again with someone else, as it can take some trial and error to find situations and relationships in which you truly feel comfortable being open and vulnerable.</p><h2>Next week</h2><p>Next week, we\u2019ll touch more on relationships, with others and with yourself, and discuss the difference between self-care and processing.

Does it render them irrelevant? Should we be integrating AI into our efforts? Should we be focusing more on short-term interventions rather than long-term interventions, as there is less chance of them being made irrelevant?</li><li>Animal rights: How do increasing AI capabilities affect the development of alternative proteins?

It is quite concerning that the barriers to starting a pandemic by weaponizing existing viruses already seem quite surmountable today for state or state-sponsored actors, and insider lone-wolf scientists who turn to terrorism (<i>low ; why has there been no attempts to do so yet since the 2010s?</i>).</p><p>At present, the barriers to engineering a pathogen with increased contagiousness, deadliness or antiviral immunity still seem quite insurmountable unless the bioweapons programme is a multi-year state-led/state-sponsored one (<i>medium</i>).</p><p>However, the publication of gain-of-function research, development of high-throughput automation of testing processes, and progress in understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships, could lower the barriers for engineering pandemics quite significantly in the coming years. Without appropriate regulatory intervention, these three scientific-technological developments are likely to continue to advance rapidly.&nbsp;</p><h2>Intention of State Actors</h2><p><strong>States seem somewhat unwilling to use bioweapons, especially contagious pathogens, on a large-scale. </strong><i><strong>(I note that this section is currently underdeveloped and will incorporate additional research in due course)</strong></i></p><ul><li>Many states (esp.

Recent research points out that there has only been one documented death attributable to biocrimes (murder of Hungarian dissident Georgi Markov in London in 1978; although that is debatable), a number of bioterrorism incidents with no directly associated deaths, in the United States<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8olcg9djqze\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8olcg9djqze\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and five deaths from a documented lone-wolf terrorist incident (i.e. Anthrax letters).</li><li>However, there are certain terrorist groups that are likely to aim for maximum catastrophe, including through the use of biological weapons.

Among the two dozen agents studied, only seven human non-contagious agents were produced and weaponized, while five anti-crop agents were standardized and produced but not weaponized. It is generally believed that weaponization within the U.S. bioweapons program centered on agents for which countermeasures were available or could be developed to protect the troops, and that although contagious diseases such as plague and smallpox were studied, they were not weaponized.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx1oo500lan\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx1oo500lan\">[7]</a></sup></span></li><li>These cases show that from as early as the 1970s, states at the forefront of biotechnology were more than capable of weaponizing natural pathogens.&nbsp;</li><li>Since then, numerous scientific breakthroughs that made it much easier for scientists to 'engineer' pathogens (see section on \u201ccurrent barriers and affordances of emerging technologies\u201d).</li></ul><p><strong>Historically, Non-State Actors lacked capabilities to use bioweapons for mass destruction.&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Until about the 2000s, barriers to large-scale bioweapon attacks had posed insurmountable for non-state actors.

Synthetic Biology) - as of 2018<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmo47g9rkyy\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmo47g9rkyy\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</h2><p>The following section further examines the barriers to bioweapons within each stage of the pathogen synthesis process, and the (potential) affordances of synthetic biology which could enable malicious actors to surmount these barriers. The aim is to assess the level of expertise required to clear each stage, and whether synthetic biology would lower the barriers sufficiently for amateurs to do weaponize pathogens.</p><blockquote><p>The main biotechnologies of concern in the near future (over the course of the next decade or so) are projected to be oligonucleotide synthesis, DNA assembly (assembling multiple smaller fragments of oligonucleotides into the desired larger sequence), and genetic modification (editing, deleting, and inserting desired sequences into targeted sites of a genome).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefafyugrfpjx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnafyugrfpjx\">[8]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p><i>DISCLAIMER: In view of the information hazards involved, readers are strongly discouraged from speculating publicly about novel ways to cause harm with biology, be it in the comments below or in your own threat assessments. Therefore, even as I recognize that convergent technologies could contribute significantly to the biosecurity risks, I have deliberately redacted several points on how various non-biological technologies (e.g. AI) might be used to circumvent barriers at each of these stages.</i></p><h3>Design &amp; testing</h3><p>Design and testing is not required if the malicious actor intends to use one of the known pathogens. Engineering known viruses to become more contagious, deadly or immune to antivirals remains extremely challenging, essentially requiring a great deal of trial-and-error by experts. However, scientific and technological advances in the near future could make this more accessible to less sophisticated actors.</p><ul><li>The modification of viruses to gain functions is very challenging due to limited knowledge of how genotype changes would translate to phenotype changes (and even further, predicting how such changes would manifest as disease in humans). Such modifications also often result in attenuation (i.e. less pathogenic) of the virus.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmo47g9rkyy\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmo47g9rkyy\">[2]</a></sup></span></li><li>Nevertheless, it is still feasible for sophisticated actors to do so through repeated trial-and-error e.g. In 2001, scientists successfully engineered mousepox to be lethal to mice that have been immunized against ordinary mousepox; avian influenza had also been engineered to allow for airborne transmission between mammals.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftb6eegejmk\"><sup><a href=\"#fntb6eegejmk\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Testing and learning from the tests is usually a time intensive process which requires a great deal of expertise and experience.&nbsp;</li><li>Publicized gain-of-function research, or progress in genotype-phenotype understanding may make such modified designs more accessible to less sophisticated actors. Malicious actors could also take advantage of automation tools (e.g.microfluidics, mass spectrometry, machine learning) to enable high throughput testing of agents.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj61sv1y8o08\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj61sv1y8o08\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>Designing and synthesizing novel viruses from scratch is not very feasible with current technologies.</li></ul><h3>Production</h3><p>Small-scale production and delivery could be sufficient for spreading contagious pathogens. The barriers seem high enough to prevent amateurs working from home from producing known pathogens even at a small scale, but graduate-level individuals may have sufficient expertise and equipment to do so.</p><ul><li>Large scale production is extremely challenging for non state-led/sponsored actors (see section on Aum Shinrikyo\u2019s attempt above) because many agents lose infectivity or other features during scale-up.</li><li>However, the small-scale production of most known viruses could be achievable with commercial mail-ordered oglios (fragments of the full virus RNA/DNA), by a graduate-level individual with relatively common cell culture and virus purification skills and access to basic (graduate-level) laboratory equipment. Such efforts would feasible with a relatively small organizational footprint (including, e.g., a biosafety cabinet, a cell culture incubator, centrifuge, and commonly available small equipment).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmo47g9rkyy\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmo47g9rkyy\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>For instance in 2016, virologist David Evans led a team of experts to synthesize the horsepox (a close relative of smallpox) virus by using synthetic oglios mail ordered from a commercial company.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgc3q1jaolav\"><sup><a href=\"#fngc3q1jaolav\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While that company had processes to guard against abuse by terrorists, not all companies would have similar safeguards. Screening for oglios/segments of concern is currently not mandated for all gene synthesis companies.</li><li>That said, virus synthesis is still far from being accessible to amateurs working from home. It still requires specialist expertise, experience and equipment. Specialised knowledge is difficult to acquire because much of it is tacit, local and collective in nature.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref02vx4wk7egc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn02vx4wk7egc\">[12]</a></sup></span></li></ul><h3>Stability and Delivery</h3><p>Since infectious pathogens could be delivered at small scales, much of the challenges of stability and delivery that have held back Aum Shinrikyo\u2019s bioweapons programme may not apply if contagious pathogens were used.</p><ul><li>Larger-scale attacks typically involve some form of aerosol dispersal, such as via a spray or an explosion are quite challenging to execute. They may require that the agent not only be prepared at the optimal particle size (between 1 and 5 micrometers) for inhalation but be concentrated enough, able to withstand freeze drying, suspension in aerosol preparations, packaging processes, long-term storage, and adverse environmental conditions such as ultraviolet sunlight or extreme temperatures.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsddi6yqunua\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsddi6yqunua\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>Engineering the virus (see sub-section above on \u2018design and testing\u2019) could potentially increase its environmental stability but maintaining viability throughout the weaponization process is still likely to present a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale attacks.&nbsp;</li><li>However, using contagious pathogens could circumvent much of the challenges of scaling-up and delivery. Infectious agents could be delivered at smaller scales at multiple locations and allowed to spread on its own. At smaller scales, delivering a bioweapon can be as simple as contaminating food or water, sticking victims with a needle, or even smearing the agent on victims\u2019 skin.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn4tnc9b9se\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn4tnc9b9se\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There had already been precedented uses of bioweapons for assassination (e.g. case of Kim Jong-Nam). Some actors may even be able to find volunteers willing to spread infection by becoming infected themselves, akin to suicide bombers.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Conclusion&nbsp;</h3><p>If my assessment is correct, it is quite concerning that at present there are likely to be States, Insider Lone Scientists and State-Sponsored terrorist groups/individuals that have both the capabilities and intention the capabilities to successfully start a pandemic with known pathogens.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3waqo7m4amn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3waqo7m4amn\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The main barriers for non-state-sponsored/ supported actors seem to only be: access to university-level lab equipment while being able to do such work undetected, and the screening by gene synthesis companies. The lack of appropriate screening regulations, publication of new pandemic-capable viruses online, and the availability of tabletop DNA synthesis machines could therefore pose significant risks. While non-engineered pathogens are quite unlikely to pose an existential risk for humanity, they could still have potentially catastrophic impacts amounting to tens of millions of lives, and much more suffering e.g. COVID-19, Spanish Flu.</p><p>What might be even more concerning in the near future are pandemics engineered with increased virulence, transmissibility, antiviral immunity and environmental stability. At present, the barriers to engineering a pathogen still seem quite insurmountable unless the bioweapons programme is a multi-year state-led/state-sponsored one. Only state actors would probably be able to do so reliably at present, and there are significant barriers deterring state actors who wish to remain in the international system from deploying such weapons. I would revise this likelihood upwards if Russia is further excluded from the international system.</p><p>However, developments in understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships through gain-of-function research and development of high-throughput automation of testing processes, could lower the barriers for engineering pandemics quite significantly in the coming years. Without regulatory intervention, these scientific and technological developments are likely to continue to advance rapidly. Designing and synthesizing a novel virus from scratch is currently (as of 2018) not very feasible. However, the outcomes can potentially be much more catastrophic than the weaponization of existing viruses (perhaps just as catastrophic as modifying existing viruses).</p><hr><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>I deeply appreciate the comments and patient guidance from Chris Bakerlee, Tessa Alexanian and Ryan Teo, especially regarding the potential info hazards of this piece.

It facilitates building and growing a community and base of knowledge from podcasts.</p><p>Recently, they introduced Groups, a feature that lets people share podcast highlights on a certain topic with others. This can help in compiling and efficiently delivering <i>knowledge-rich audio snippets</i> and food for thought to listeners, similar to what Twitter can do as a written medium on its better days. The user can then listen to the full episode if he/she finds the snippet interesting.</p><p>For those who, like me, use Snipd as their go-to podcast app, I created two groups, one for <a href=\"https://share.snipd.com/group/EffectiveAltruism\">Effective Altruism</a> and another for <a href=\"https://share.snipd.com/group/Rationality\">Rationality</a>.</p><p>Which type of highlights have a room in the <a href=\"https://share.snipd.com/group/EffectiveAltruism\">Effective Altruism group</a>? Primarily high-level central ideas that can help someone <i>decide how to direct talent and resources in order to do the most good</i>. Core topics and areas like existential risks and coordination, cause prioritisation, how to assess the effectiveness of interventions, career advice for making a positive impact on the world, EA community-building...</p><p>What should be the <i>breadth </i>of the group? Ideally, it should gather ideas from EA-adjacent people and podcasts. There are likely to be plenty of shows hosting discussions on relevant subjects like morality or animal welfare, but many arguments might not be enough to move the needle or may be grounded on poor epistemics if they don't have the clear goal and standards Effective Altruism has.</p><p>What should be the <i>depth</i> of the group? Initially a high specificity of the arguments should not be an obstacle to keeping up to date with the highlights, but if at some point the daily activity is high enough, the filter should be to post <i>important ideas&nbsp;</i>rather than <i>specific&nbsp;arguments within&nbsp;</i>important ideas. E.g. the principal reasons and drawbacks of sending money directly to people in poverty is great, but going deeper than whether interpretability research is a promising approach to solving AI alignment could be too narrow. However, this is a matter of degree, not of kind.</p><p>Regarding the <a href=\"https://share.snipd.com/group/Rationality\">Rationality group</a>, despite there are countless podcasts offering tips and pointers for self-improvement and increased productivity, the views we want shared might be more valuable if they draw from within the (aspiring) rationalist community. Rationality goes beyond incremental growth; it is concerned about the <i>cognitive algorithms</i> that <i>systematically</i> produce true beliefs and optimal actions. It is about understanding and controlling our black boxes, and about updating the map to match the territory.</p><p>For now the groups are mostly empty, though I will try to be active in adding snippets. For those of you who use Snipd, I encourage you to join the group and share the highlights you collect from podcasts, and contribute to growing the EA and rationality knowledge base in the audio medium.</p><p>If such Snipd groups become popular, more could be created for other related and relevant topics.</p>", "user": {"username": "David Bravo"}}, {"_id": "iaCaFqTEzL7WRHqKp", "title": "Most Efficient Message Framing to Promote Charitable Giving [Literature Review Report]", "postedAt": "2023-05-14T14:26:39.164Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The purpose of this literature review report is to provide insights on how to increase charitable giving in the general population. The central question that guided this research process was \u201cWhat is the most efficient messaging for the promotion of charitable giving?\u201d The evidence points to different ways of presenting and framing messages based on evidence of outcomes such as subjective intentions to donate, decision to donate, and donation amount. The last section provides <u>14 recommendations</u> based on the reviewed research.</p><p><strong>Methods</strong></p><p>I conducted this literature search using various search engines, databases, and tools. The first tool I used was Elicit, an AI assistant that answers research questions based on an overview of key articles. I pasted the central research question from the previous paragraph into Elicit, and its output included a one-paragraph answer as well as summaries of findings from a few articles. I reviewed the seven cited articles it provided and included the relevant ones in this report. Then, I referred to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.carleton.ca/find/databases/subject/Cognitive%20Science\">Carleton University Cognitive Science Databases</a> and selected three databases to search through: PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and SpringerLink. Within the PsycINFO search, keywords included \u201cframing effect on charitable giving\u201d. There were 10 results, including one meta-analysis. I reviewed them all and rejected two that were unrelated to the research question and one that was a book (thus not within the scope of allocated resources for this project). In Google Scholar, the main search was \u201cmeta-analysis effect of framing on charitable giving\u201d, with additional keywords including \u201cmeta-reviews\u201d, \u201cmessaging\u201d, \u201ceffect of messaging\u201d, and \u201cdonations\u201d. A few relevant meta-analyses and experimental studies were selected from the results. On SpringerLink, keywords included \u201cmessage framing and charitable donations\u201d, and the search yielded a few papers from various fields. I tried many keywords and combinations in a government database\u2014Canada's open government portal\u2014but could not find relevant sources of information. In total, I was able to find 20 relevant sources including one meta-metaanalysis, four meta-analyses, and many experimental studies. These articles come from a variety of domains including cognitive science, psychology, experimental economics, business, communication, and marketing science.</p><p><strong>Review of Findings</strong></p><p>Results from each of the meta-analyses provided different insights, but their findings were consistent with each other as they covered different aspects of the research question. The most important source was&nbsp;a meta-metaanalysis of 1339 studies by Saeri et al. (2022). They found four factors that increase charitable donations. The first was framing the donation as benefitting an individual; the second was to increase exposure to benevolent behaviours (including giving); the third was clarifying the donation\u2019s impact; and the fourth was to make donations tax-deductible or inform people about tax-deductible donations.&nbsp;</p><p>The next two meta-analyses covered specific factors related to charitable giving. The first, a meta-analysis of six studies (each containing multiple experiments), found that the way a donation request was framed influenced charitable giving amount based on whether the message was combined with positive or negative images (Genevsky &amp; Knutson, 2018). Message framing of positive or negative valence had the most impact on charitable giving when combined with an image of matching valence. These six studies included hypothetical and real incentives as well as online and in-lab settings. &nbsp;The second\u2014a meta-analysis of 41 studies on the compassion fade effect\u2014found that being exposed to larger groups of victims in need reduced helping behaviours and willingness to help. The degree of certainty and the threat level associated with adverse events modulated the effect of victim group size on charitable giving behaviours and intentions.</p><p>Finally, the remaining two meta-analyses pointed towards null findings for the factors they examined. The first was&nbsp;a meta-analysis of 27 studies (2020), and its results suggested that there was no significant difference in charitable giving when advertised messages were framed in terms of gains. The second was an experimental economics meta-study by Fromell et al. (2020). They examined the pattern of results across 17 experimental studies that investigated whether altering task demands to manipulate cognitive resources could modulate the switch between the slower deliberative system and the faster intuitive system (based on the Dual Systems theory of altruistic behaviour). The results were null, suggesting that changing task demands to increase activation of the intuitive system does not affect charitable giving; the authors discuss the implication that perhaps there is little interference between the intuitive and deliberative systems if they both lead to the same decision in most monetary giving trade-off scenarios.</p><p>The remaining studies can be grouped into two categories based on the outcomes they measure. The first set includes three experimental studies investigating the intention to donate whereas the second set includes 11 studies investigating donation decisions and amounts. Factors associated with each target outcome are identified and discussed.&nbsp;</p><p>A few factors have been linked to donation intentions. For instance, Chang &amp; Chen (2019) found that participants\u2019 donation intentions increased when the charitable giving involved donating as a gift compared to a charity sale where the donation is also a purchase. A second study by Cao (2016) investigated the effect of framing charitable donation requests in terms of losses or gains associated with charitable giving or inaction. The results showed that when participants believed they were more likely to be affected as a result of their inaction, the loss-framed messages led to higher charitable donation intentions. Finally, a third study by Das &amp; al. (2008) found that when the donation message was set in the context of attaining a charity goal, donation intentions were higher. They also found that the most effective charitable appeal strategies involved combinations of a positive message frame with anecdotal evidence and a negative frame with statistical evidence, replicating the findings of previous studies.</p><p>Eleven additional experimental studies measured giving behaviours\u2014the most relevant outcome to the central question of this report. In a field experiment by Adena &amp; Huck (2022), framing charitable giving as a donation rather than a reward-linked contribution was associated with more giving. A follow-up survey experiment suggested that gifts were perceived as more voluntary and the idea of giving had a positive correlation with emotions. A different field experiment by Sudhir et al. (2016) found that in an Indian population, charitable giving requests were most successful when they included appeals to sympathy biases. Examples of appeals containing sympathy biases included portraying an identifiable victim or depicting members of an in-group.&nbsp;Garinther &amp; Arrow (2022) found inconclusive evidence that framing a donation appeal as benefitting an individual rather than a group was associated with higher donation amounts. Glazer &amp; Konrad (1996) highlighted that people were still willing to donate even when the donation had no prosocial impact. This finding supported the signaling theory, which postulated that people may donate to signal wealth. Kulow (2016) found that people who reported having strong karmic beliefs donated more to charity when the messaging framed the donation in terms of gains for others as opposed to self-gain (compared to participants who reported weak karmic beliefs). Jeong et al. (2011) found that gain-framed messages worked best on people with a disposition to approach and loss-framed&nbsp;messages worked best to persuade people with a disposition for avoidance. This effect was observed both when the gains or losses were relevant to the self or others. Moche et al. (2020) found that people were less willing to donate when they were reminded of the opportunity cost (alternative uses of money). They found no effect of framing the opportunity cost as prosocial or proself. Smith &amp; Berger (1996) found that anchors (i.e., pre-set suggestions of monetary donation size) influenced the amount people gave but did not influence their likelihood of donating.&nbsp;Sussman et al. (2015) found that when messages framed a donation as an exceptional (uncommon, infrequent) expense, participants were more willing to donate than when the messages were framed as ordinary (common, frequent). Participants did not consider the effect of the donation on their budget as much when it was framed as exceptional.&nbsp;White &amp; Peloza (2009) found that donation requests framed in terms of benefits to others were associated with more funds raised when donations were public, whereas framing donations is terms of self-benefits was more efficient when donations were private. Diederich &amp; al. (2022) found null results when comparing donation matching subsidies, rebate subsidies, and unit donation (donating to buy a good at a given price per item). However, they observed that rebates were associated with a higher proportion of donors whereas matching and discounts raised more funds per donor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p><p>Based on the current research reviewed in this report, the following 14 recommendations were made about the best ways to construct charitable giving messages intended for the general population:&nbsp;</p><p>(1) highlight an individual recipient of aid.&nbsp;</p><p>(2) Increase exposure to benevolence (e.g., by showcasing people\u2019s giving behaviours).&nbsp;</p><p>(3) Clearly state the impact of donations. For example, \u201c$50 can provide sight-restoring cataract surgery for an adult\u201d&nbsp;(Seva Canada, 2023) follows the clear format \u2018X amount is sufficient to purchase Y, which will have Z impact\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>(4) Inform the public of the tax deductibility of donations. Providing clear and simple guidelines about the tax deduction process may be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>(5) Frame donations as gifts rather than purchases or reward-linked contributions.&nbsp;</p><p>(6) Include images matching the valence of corresponding messages (i.e., use an image and message that are both associated with either negative or positive emotions).&nbsp;</p><p>(7) Use statistics with negatively framed messages and anecdotes with positively framed messages.&nbsp;</p><p>(8) When mentioning negative outcomes or losses associated with the choice not to donate, focus on the negative outcomes that can affect the donor themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>(9) Showcase recipients of aid from the same group as a donor or highlight features from the recipients of aid that donors can identify with.&nbsp;</p><p>(10) Use anchors (suggested donation amounts) to influence people to donate more.&nbsp;</p><p>(11) Frame donations as exceptional expenses (e.g., \u2018Your one-time donation will make a difference!\u2019).&nbsp;</p><p>(12) Highlight benefits to others when donations are public and benefits to the donor when donations are private.&nbsp;</p><p>(13) Target sub-groups with dispositions to approach or avoidance; highlight gains (positive impact of donation) for one and losses (negative impact of not donating) for the other.&nbsp;</p><p>(14) Avoid mentions of the opportunity cost of donations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>References</p><p>Adena, M., &amp; Huck, S.

This happens irrespective of us being conscious of it or otherwise. The case is just like a road with traffic jam with many different cars running over it, every minute. Sometimes a giant, black car and a small, Mr. Bean-ish car, the other time. Here, the giant black car equates to the overwhelming thoughts we encounter in a day. The small car, something like the popular character Mr. Bean used to drive could be thought of as the fickle thoughts in a day. Huff! we encounter countless thoughts in a day.</p><p>Hence our mind needs some rest in a form different than sleep or a proper 1 hour long meditation. It needs rest at <strong>frequent intervals</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>TRAFFIC CONTROL</u></strong></p><p>This is a practice wherein we will take a pause from everything that we're doing (no matter how important it is) at frequent intervals throughout our day. More about the intervals below but before that let's focus on the 'Pause' here.</p><p>I believe, we will never be able to take the pause unless we consciously try to acknowledge it's importance. Our minds will ask us, 'How is this sudden pause more important than my work at hand?'. So, when our mind is asking us this question, we must make ourselves gently understand: 'This one pause can improve the way I'm handling my work at hand by 3X.' After saying this to yourself immediately withdraw from your desk, etc and sit comfortably to start the 'Pause'.</p><p><strong><u>The Intervals</u></strong></p><p>It could be for 5-10 minutes, after every hour on busy days. Try stretching the pause to 30 minutes after every one hour on easy days (example-weekends).</p><p><strong><u>The Practice</u></strong></p><p>So what are we actually going to do in these 'Pause (s)'? We'll firstly take a few deep breathe; yes as clich\u00e9 as it sounds (can't help it, haha) ! After few deep inhalations, we'll keep <strong>seeing the thoughts</strong>, whichever may arrive. Mostly, these thoughts could be related to our current work at hand or plans about future.</p><ul><li><strong><u>'Seeing' the thoughts-</u> </strong>Earlier in this article, our thoughts were compared to running cars on a road with traffic. Now, we'll imagine that we're looking at these cars through a window, unbothered. Keep 'seeing' your thoughts unbothered just like random cars on a busy road.

It has a few intermittent glitches (most of which can be resolved by refreshing the page). Twice in the last 13 months or so I\u2019m aware of it having gone down for about an hour. If you need perfect uptime, Zoom is probably better. Note there\u2019s both an app and browser version, so one might work substantially better than the other at any given point.</p><h3>Resource use</h3><p>Some people have reported finding Gather Town quite system intensive. Personally I\u2019ve found it less so than Google Meet, slightly more so than Zoom. This is quickly noticeable for those who it affects, so easy to test if it might be a concern.&nbsp;</p><h3>Confusingness</h3><p>Some people find it more confusing than Zoom et al, given the RPGesque interface. For others it seems to be more intuitive, so this seems mainly about familiarity.</p><p>Let&nbsp;one <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/siao-si\"><u>of</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/arepo\"><u>us</u></a> know if you want to join, or just come and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://app.gather.town/app/Yhi4XYj0zFNWuUNv/EA%20coworking%20and%20lounge\"><u>try it out</u></a>!</p>", "user": {"username": "smallsilo"}}, {"_id": "4xd2EPXZ8GeAoCQSi", "title": "Announcing the African EA Forum Competition - $4500 in prizes for excellent EA Forum Posts", "postedAt": "2023-05-14T07:35:17.527Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>The competition is now concluded. </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EY9HcM96awXC8y5eW/winners-of-the-african-ea-forum-competition\"><i>See the announcement of winners here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><i>--</i></p><p>The Effective Altruism Forum serves as the main platform for thought leadership and experience sharing within the effective altruism movement.

Currently, the blog features six thematic series, described below.</p><p>One distinctive feature of my approach is that <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2022/11/30/a-note-about-methodology/\"><strong>I share a number of philosophical views</strong></a><strong> with many effective altruists</strong>. I accept or am sympathetic to all of the following: consequentialism; totalism; fanaticism; expected value maximization; and the importance of using science, reasons and evidence to solve global problems. Nevertheless, <strong>I am skeptical of many views held by effective altruists</strong> including longtermism and the view that humanity currently faces high levels of existential risk. We also have a number of methodological disagreements.&nbsp;</p><p>I've come to understand that this is a somewhat distinctive approach within the academic literature, as well as in the broader landscape.

In this series, I look at some places where leading estimates of existential risk look to have been exaggerated.</p><p><strong>Status: </strong>Ongoing. <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2022/12/01/exaggerating-the-risks-part-1-introduction/\">Part 1</a> introduces the series. Parts 2-5 focus on climate risk. I argue that Toby Ord's estimate of climate risk is undersupported (<a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2022/12/01/exaggerating-the-risks-part-2-ord-on-climate-risk/\">Part 2</a>), then use the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1avhgYDKsGPUGuvpx23mrpHUdzbmPThJT/view\">Halstead Report</a> on climate change and longtermism to argue that there is no credible scientific basis for large estimates of near-term climate risk. <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2022/12/18/exaggerating-the-risks-part-3-climate-change-lessons-from-halstead/\">Part 3</a> looks at crop failure and heat stress. <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/01/28/exaggerating-the-risks-part-4-halstead-continued/\">Part 4</a> looks at sea level rise, tipping points, and paleoclimate data. <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/03/18/exaggerating-the-risks-part-5-climate-wrap-up/\">Part 5</a> looks at moist and runaway greenhouse effects, then draws lessons from this discussion.</p><p>Parts 6-8 focus on AI risk. I review the Carlsmith report on power-seeking AI. <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/04/08/exaggerating-risks-carlsmith-report/\">Part 6</a> introduces the report and makes some general remarks on AI risk. <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/05/06/exaggerating-the-risks-part-7-carlsmith-on-instrumental-convergence/\">Part 7</a> discusses instrumental convergence. Part 8 will wrap up the discussion of the Carlsmith report.</p><p>In the future, I plan to discuss other risks, including biorisk. I also plan to reflect on old risk arguments which have not aged well, including early attempts to ground the singularity hypothesis in the idea of self-replicating nanotechnology. I will probably return at some point to AI risk, though I do not want to give as much focus to AI risk as it has assumed in some recent discussions by effective altruists.&nbsp;</p><h1>Future series</h1><p>I am not entirely sure which series I will add in the future. I am interested to hear what series you might be keen on reading. Here are some of my tentative plans right now.</p><h2>Academic papers: New sub-series</h2><p>My original intention in writing this blog was to focus primarily on academic papers and books, because my comparative advantage lies in discussing these. I think that I may have drifted too far away from discussing these in recent months.</p><p>In the future, I hope to start new sub-series on three of my own papers. The first, \"<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/against-the-singularity-hypothesis-david-thorstad/\">Against the singularity hypothesis</a>\", argues that the singularity hypothesis is less likely than many take it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>The second, \"<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/the-scope-of-longtermism-david-thorstad-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\">The scope of longtermism</a>\" argues that longtermism may correctly describe fewer decision problems than some longtermists suppose.&nbsp;</p><p>The third, \"Mistakes in the moral mathematics of existential risk\" (draft coming soon) is a follow-up paper to my \"<a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/04/01/existential-risk-pessimism-and-the-time-of-perils-part-9-objections-and-replies/\">Existential risk pessimism and the time of perils</a>\". <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/02/04/existential-risk-pessimism-and-the-time-of-perils-part-7-an-application/\">Part 7</a> of my series on that paper noted that one way to read that paper is as exposing a mistake we often make in calculating the value of existential risk mitigation (ignoring background risk). \"Mistakes in the moral mathematics of existential risk\" extends the discussion of ignoring background risk, and considers two additional mistakes of this type.</p><p>I also want to discuss papers by other authors. My tentative plan is to write a series entitled \"Papers I have learned from\". For example, I hope to discuss Harry Lloyd's \"<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Time-discounting-consistency-and-special-obligations_Harry-R-Lloyd.pdf\">Time discounting, consistency, and special obligations: A defense of robust temporalism</a>\" which argues for the moral permissibility of a nonzero rate of pure time preference; Richard Pettigrew's \"<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/effective-altruism-risk-and-human-extinction-richard-pettigrew-university-of-bristol/\">Effective altruism, risk, and human extinction</a>,\" which looks at the impact of risk aversion on the value of efforts to reduce extinction risk; and Emma Curran's \"<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/longtermism-aggregation-and-catastrophic-risk-emma-j-curran/\">Longtermism, aggregation, and catastrophic risk</a>\".&nbsp;</p><p>Sometime next year, the Global Priorities Institute will release an open-access volume of essays on longtermism (with Oxford University Press), with entries from world-leading scholars. In my completely unbiased opinion as an editor of that volume, many of the papers are excellent. I will almost certainly write a series discussing them.</p><h2>Beyond the blog</h2><p>While my main focus is, and always will be, on the production of academic papers, I have started doing some other forms of non-academic speaking and writing beyond the blog. Most recently, <a href=\"https://critiquesofea.podbean.com/\">I recorded an episode</a> of the Critiques of EA podcast with Nick Anyos.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm going to take this slowly. I am not trained to do public philosophy, and I am a bit nervous about getting it wrong. But as I build up a larger volume of work beyond the blog, I will probably start a series discussing some of the more substantial pieces. I will also try to be honest about my mistakes, of which I am sure there will be plenty. It is a learning experience for me.</p><h2>Known challenges</h2><p>There are a number of familiar challenges to longtermism and effective altruism, including the Cluelessness Problem, anti-fanaticism, objections from population ethics, and what I have called a <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/02/18/academics-review-what-we-owe-the-future-part-3-rini-on-demandingness-cluelessness-and-inscrutability/\">regression to the inscrutable</a> in theorizing about existential risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these challenges are already quite well discussed, whereas others have no good orthodox statement that is accessible to a broad range of readers. I am thinking about writing a series that would devote a post to explaining and assessing each challenge.</p><h1>Lessons learned</h1><h2>Names matter</h2><p>I didn't do much work to sound-test the original title of my blog, Ineffective Altruism. It turned out that this name hit much harder than I had intended, and gave readers the wrong idea about the content and intellectual seriousness of the blog. It also turned out that the name overlapped with some previous online discourse that I was unaware of, and which I did not want to be associated with.</p><p>Drawing on user feedback, I <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/04/21/meta-reflective-altruism/\">changed the name </a>of my blog to Reflective Altruism. The name communicates my intention to draw on academic research to reflect on questions and challenges raised by the effective altruism movement.&nbsp;</p><h2>Audio matters</h2><p>Several readers told me that they find it easier to consume long posts in audio form. Recent advances in text-to-speech technology made it possible for me to provide audio versions of all of my posts, and I began doing so about two months ago.</p><p>Going forward, all new posts will be available in audio format (except perhaps for a very few technical posts, which are not handled well by existing text-to-speech technology). I have also started adding audio versions of old posts. There is some amount of time and money that must be invested in the process. I hope that new advances in text-to-speech technology will lead to higher-quality, cheaper and faster audio production in the near future.</p><h2>Social media matters</h2><p>When I began my blog, I thought that I could just write content and expect people to read it. It turns out that you have to tell people about your blog if you want them to read it.</p><p>One way to do that is through blog updates, such as this one and my initial post to the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/david-thorstad\">EA Forum</a>. Another effective technique is word of mouth: if you like my blog, I hope you will consider mentioning it to potentially interested readers.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasingly, it is also important to be on social media. My Twitter account (@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReflectiveAlt\">ReflectiveAlt</a>) allows me to comment on developments in real-time and also serves as an important way of updating readers about developments on the blog. I also have a Facebook page that is so embarrassingly dead I will not even link to it. Lesson learned.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hard content is okay</h2><p>I was initially concerned that the content on the blog would be too demanding. My posts are long, and while I do what I can to write accessibly, I do not skimp on or tone down difficult applications of academic research in philosophy and the social and natural sciences.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a pleasant surprise to see that for the most part, this feature of the blog did not seem to put readers off. Indeed, if anything the \"lighter\" blog series, created partly to fill the gap between more difficult posts, started receiving fewer hits. This made me happy, and it is to the credit of my readers that they do not seem to be averse to reading through difficult and time-consuming material.</p><p>In the future, I plan to worry less about the demandingness of material and to focus more on producing high-quality content, without regard to difficulty.</p><h2>Longer, less-frequent posts work</h2><p>My initial plan was to post 2-3 shorter posts every week. I found that most readers were not interested in reading such frequent posts, and also preferred to have a larger chunk of material to engage with, rather than being drip-fed short pieces of a long argument over many posts.</p><p>I've now switched to a weekly posting schedule, with many posts in the 3-5k word range, or about 20-25 minutes of audio. I plan to keep to this schedule for as long as I can. If I become very busy, I may have to switch to an every-second-week posting schedule. I will try not to do that, but I am told that the first year on the tenure track is quite brutal.</p><h1>Feedback welcome</h1><p>I am not writing this blog for myself. I write for my readers. Many of my readers are on this forum. In fact, <i>most</i> of my readers are effective altruists, often quite engaged ones.</p><p>I value your opinions, suggestions, and feedback. I would like to hear what you think of the blog, what you think is going well, what may be going less well, and what you would like to see in the future.</p><p>If you are comfortable, please comment below to tell me what you think. If you would rather reach out privately, you can always reach me at reflectivealtruismeditor@gmail.com.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnccqeigt7y1\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefccqeigt7y1\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I don't have a cat.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "David Thorstad"}}, {"_id": "PS6rTSmHnLeMbwHrn", "title": "Request for suggestions about college degree choice", "postedAt": "2023-05-14T14:29:50.825Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm hoping to get some suggestions for possible college degree/career paths.</p>\n<p>I'm 32 years old, living in Columbus, Ohio, USA.

We believe that almost all strategic decision-makers (or their advisors) can understand and use forecasting, quantified uncertainty and public forecasting platforms as valuable resources for making better and more informed decisions.</p><p>We design tools, workshops and materials to support this mission. This is the first in a series of multiple EA Forum posts. We will tell you more about our mission and our other projects in future articles.</p><p>In this post, we are pleased to announce that we have just released the <strong>Confido</strong> app, a web-based tool for tracking and sharing probabilistic predictions and estimates. You can use it in strategic decision making when you want a probabilistic estimate on a topic from different stakeholders, in meetings to avoid anchoring, to organize forecasting tournaments, or in calibration workshops and lectures. We offer very high data privacy, so it is used also in government setting. &nbsp;See our <a href=\"https://demo1.confido.tools/\"><strong>demo</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://confido.institute/request-a-workspace.html\"><strong>request your Confido workspace</strong></a> for free.</p><p>The current version of Confido is already used by several organizations, including the Dutch government, several policy think tanks and EA organizations.</p><p>Confido is under active development and there is a lot more to come. We\u2019d love to hear your feedback and feature requests. To see news, follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConfidoInstitut\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/confido.institute/\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/confido-institute/\">LinkedIn</a> or collaborate with us on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7U7tqvsgr9\">Discord</a>. We are also looking for funding.</p><h2>Why are we building Confido?</h2><p>We think there is a lot of attention in the EA space toward making better forecasts \u2013 investing in big public forecasting platforms, researching better scoring and aggregation methods, skilling up superforecasters and other quantitatively and technically minded people in the EA community, building advanced tools for more complex probabilistic models, etc.</p><p>This is clearly important and well done and we do not expect to add much to this effort.</p><p>However, we believe some other aspects of forecasting / quantified uncertainty are also valuable and currently neglected.</p><p>For example, little effort has gone into making these concepts and tools accessible to people without a math or technical background. This includes, for example, many people from:</p><ul><li>organizations working on animal welfare</li><li>organizations working on non-technical AI safety, strategy and governance</li><li>organizations working on biological risks and pandemic preparedness</li><li>organizations working on improving policymaking and governance in general, think tanks, even government bodies</li></ul><p>We think all of these would benefit from clearer ways of communicating uncertain beliefs and estimates, yet existing tools may have a high barrier of entry.</p><h2>What makes Confido unique?</h2><p>Confido is a tool for working collaboratively with probabilistic forecasts, estimates, beliefs and quantified uncertainty together with your team. Several features distinguish Confido from existing tools in this space:</p><ul><li>a strong emphasis on being&nbsp;<strong>easy to understand</strong> and <strong>convenient to use</strong></li><li>the ability to use it internally and privately, including self-hosting</li><li>the ability to use it for more than just forecasting questions (more below)</li><li>Confido is free and open source</li></ul><h3>Ease of use &amp; user experience</h3><p>Confido\u2019s two main goals thus are to be maximally:</p><ul><li><strong>easy to understand</strong>&nbsp;(easy to get started with, requiring minimal background knowledge, guiding the user where needed)</li><li><strong>convenient to use</strong>&nbsp;(requiring minimum hassle and extra steps to use it and perform tasks, pleasant to work with)</li></ul><p>The second part is also very important because when a tool is cumbersome to use, people won\u2019t use it very much. We have heard many a time from individuals and organizations: \u201cYes, we want to do more forecasting, but\u2026\u201d they never got around to doing it (for which we use the tongue-in-cheek term&nbsp;<i>fore-crastination</i>).</p><p>We are working with people experienced in UX design and education to accomplish these goals. We don\u2019t claim to be quite there yet but we think we are making progress in this direction.</p><h3>Internal vs public forecasting platforms</h3><p>Confido is an internal forecasting platform. Each organization or group has its own&nbsp;<i>workspace</i>&nbsp;that is private by default. However, you can easily invite guest collaborators or even share parts of your workspace publicly.</p><p>There has been some pushback against using internal forecasting tools and in favour of just asking questions on e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://metaculus.com\">Metaculus</a>, where you have access to an existing pool of very good forecasters. However, there are several situations where one might prefer an internal solution:</p><ul><li>very specific and narrow questions or ones requiring arcane knowledge, concepts or terminology</li><li>questions specific to a given organization, its projects and operations</li><li>questions that cannot be made public, e.g.&nbsp;because of infohazards, PR risks or trade secrets</li><li>you want answers from a specific group of people, such as a panel of experts you selected</li><li>you want to ask something that is not a proper forecasting question (e.g.&nbsp;not easily resolvable); see below</li><li>sometimes there is just a larger psychological barrier to asking a question publicly so you want to first try it within the safe space of your team</li></ul><p>If you care a lot about data privacy and security, you can even self-host Confido on your own infrastructure.</p><h3>Beyond forecasting: quantified uncertainty as a tool for better epistemics and communication</h3><p>Forecasting requires a specific kind of questions \u2014 very precise and easy to evaluate after the fact.</p><p>However, we believe that the general principle of quantified uncertainty can be also useful for different kinds of questions, outside of formal forecasting.</p><p>People form beliefs all the time \u2014 while working on a project, researching a question or just as they go through life \u2014 even when that is not their main goal or focus or not as deliberate or systematic as when \u201cdoing forecasting\u201d.</p><p>We think that even for such beliefs, there is value in trying to quantify them, to translate your \u201cinner sense of certainty\u201d into numbers. This both helps you clarify your own thinking and improves communication and cooperation within the team.</p><p>For this reason, Confido allows and encourages asking people on your team questions about their beliefs, even if these questions are less precise or it is not possible to evaluate the correct answer (either in practice or even in principle). We call these <i><strong>implicit belief questions</strong></i>.</p><h3>Our ultimate goal: reaching far and wide</h3><p>We are now offering Confido to the wider EA and EA-adjacent community with the belief it will be a useful tool and the hope that we will get valuable feedback that allows us to continue to iterate and improve upon it.</p><p>However, our main mission is to reach audiences outside the EA/rationalist bubble, who are not yet on the forecasting bandwagon \u2013 especially important institutions and decision-makers. We are already making first steps towards this \u2013 for example, Confido has been used to organize forecasting tournaments at the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.</p><h2>What does Confido look like?</h2><p>When you receive your workspace, you can create <i>rooms</i> to put questions in. A room is a group of related questions that is shared with a given selection of users. It is a bit like a Slack channel. Here you can see an example of such a room, the \u201cExample room.\u201d</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/nc39ice70hyb7qo26lfx\"></figure><p>Once your create a room, you can start adding different types of questions:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/lhdi3hzdqdaexvlzgme9\"></figure><p>Then you formulate your question and decide if it is a yes-no or numeric or date question. You can also decide who can see the group prediction:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/gkffaxixjphrdzts4nea\"></figure><p>Then you can add people to the room who can add predictions or estimates:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/vjvvypyflc1zyydkkbnl\"></figure><p>You and people who you have invited can then start to provide their estimates and comments. They can also upvote each other\u00b4s comments:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/oma2ljgekblzk5ks9sju\"></figure><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/hmzl14m1hciqivodfkip\"></figure></td><td><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/zfipxqx5kmzhvxocptef\"></figure></td><td><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/bgwstlrpkfraqybmrcow\"></figure></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Once you collect enough responses you can click on the light blue icon and show the result on a projector screen:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/ugicwg0fswjoazdwxljx\"></figure><h2>How can you use Confido?</h2><h3>For strategic decision-making</h3><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:49.91%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/kp7d4ohymh1fz6f36hgs\"></figure><p>Imagine you are tackling a very specific strategic question within your team, such as&nbsp;<i>\u201cWhich of these three areas of neglected research should you assign to a newly recruited scientist in order to maximize the positive impact of their work?\u201d</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>\u201cIf our organization sets this amount of time and resources and people, will we be able to meet a specific desired goal?\u201d</i>&nbsp;You create such questions in your Confido workspace and share them with relevant people within or outside your organization to gain the necessary group wisdom to and determine how confident they are about various decisions.</p><p>As Confido is private by default, you yourself determine which sets of questions (called&nbsp;<i>rooms</i>&nbsp;in Confido) to share with which people and what permissions to give them (whether they can add predictions, see results or even create their own questions).</p><p>You can ask both the true forecasting questions like&nbsp;<i>\u201cIf we start a new EA coworking space in Prague, how many EA people will use it in the whole year 2023?\u201d</i>, but also belief questions that cannot be evaluated in principle, but still the answer can be valuable:&nbsp;<i>\u201cWas the name of the Effective Altruism movement a good idea?\u201d</i></p><h3>For more productive and inclusive meetings</h3><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:49.96%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/q9gb6ynjt6tp4yyhmckj\"></figure><p>If you happen to have meetings of seven or more people (whether live or online), it can often feel frustrating and as an inefficient waste of time. A larger group is an environment where it is more time consuming to find out what everyone thinks about a given issue; this risks having the course of the discussion mainly determined by the most extroverted participants rather than by whoever\u2019s points are most relevant at a given time. Generally you need to have a discussion moderator who closely monitors the digressions and tries to get the discussion back on track. Another risk that group discussions face is for participants to get <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/anchoring\">anchored</a> in their opinions/answers by the previous speaker, thus making the group suffer from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/groupthink\">groupthink</a>.</p><p>Again, Confido can help in these situations. Just create well-defined forecasting or belief questions before the meeting, ask at the beginning of the meeting if everyone understands them in the same way, and then just share the link or QR code and wait for the answers.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/lu5f2dsne3xsxstsekes\"></figure><p>The advantage is that everyone thinks about the question at the same time and the more assertive/extroverted part of the group doesn\u2019t anchor the rest. Only after the moderator can see the wisdom of the crowd of the whole group, and the level of opinion polarization, they can start a discussion and watch the group update their opinions as the discussion progresses. All updates can be seen in real time by the moderator and it is also possible to see an update history.</p><p>Confido also includes a presentation mode that allows the moderator to easily show current group opinion using a projector if that helps the discussion.</p><h3>For talks and workshops</h3><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:50.25%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/c9cz4a0rn1nbscsyjqph\"></figure><p>If you are organizing a lecture, talk or workshop, especially about a highly uncertain and controversial topic such as AI, it may be useful to see where your audience is at. You can simply create a Confido room with a few question before your talk, then share it using a QR code and let participants enter their guesses, opinions and estimates.</p><p>You can see them in real time, you can show a graph of the results on a projector with one click if you want. You can also encourage the audience to update their answers during the talk and see them evolve in real time. Or you can just ask one at the beginning and again at the end and compare the results.</p><p>Aside from you gaining useful information about your audience, this also allows the participants to feel more engaged with the topic and encourages them to think for themselves.</p><p>Confido is also useful when trying to explain forecasting itself.</p><p>Rather than (or on top of!) explaining the basic principles and empirical evidence behind forecasting, you can consider letting your audience experience, e.g., the wisdom of crowds effect firsthand.</p><p>Just create one or two questions, like how tall you are or when the first man was on the moon, generate a QR code and share it with your audience. Confido will then allow you to show estimates of the entire room in real time and for example see that they are surprisingly close to the true answer.</p><p>You can also use Confido to include a small calibration exercise as a part of your workshop.</p><p>(You never know who will be affected by such a workshop. In the Czech Republic, for example, the interactivity of Confido has made it popular with one ruling political party, which now wants to train and improve its calibration.)</p><h3>For forecasting tournaments</h3><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:50.04%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eYQ4A3Wft7rbdZahG/odera1nsxdpvljrqjjnf\"></figure><p>The Confido app is good for running forecasting tournaments that can help collectives to find the best calibrated individuals who can be turned to in the time of high uncertainty and crisis or to make forecasting and its principles more widely known in the organization.</p><p>If you work for government or think about this kind of teambuilding or educational activity within your organization, you can use the advantage of Confido and ask targeted questions that are closely related to the field of activity in your industry.</p><p>Unlike other solutions on the market, Confido is free and you can run tournaments in several different organizations at the same time on one workspace.</p><p>The only current drawback is that we have not yet implemented scoring in Confido proper.

This makes a donation perpetual, and instead of spending it immediately with the same donation, you provide on average 33x larger impact over the course of average human lifespan and it potentially continues making an impact even after you pass away. These ideas are grounded in islamic tradition and philosophy, and we\u2019re interested in exploring mechanisms or products which might be able to incorporate the idea of patient philanthropy as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Afterfund partners with different charities to enable Muslims to make an impact in different causes and geographies, and aims to do so with effective causes and charities, as well. We\u2019re striving to make Afterfund the first platform which enables participation in the world's first effective awqaf (plural of \u2018waqf\u2019 in Arabic).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since launching the pilot in a controlled environment with 1 charity (SABAH Islamic Center of Chicago) and 2 test causes (providing meals and education) in late May 2023, Afterfund had 46% week-over-week growth, 30 donors from 9 different countries, an average donation of $450, and the largest donation of $1500.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal is to promote EA ideas and<i> Effective Altruism for Muslims</i> through Afterfund, and to mobilize Muslim donations into high-impact, effective charities. To this end, we hope to partner with existing EA regranters (like GWWC, GiveWell, The Life you Can Save) in establishing trusted partnerships with effective charities who are interested in accessing the global Muslim donor pool.&nbsp;</p><p>Founders:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-yunus-62aa377/\"><u>Omar Yunus</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dzanan-ganic/\"><u>Dzanan Ganic</u></a></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Muslim Network for Positive Impact (MNPI)</strong></h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:68.23%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/N9jeiuok59MQjFWcX/c1nlndjycrgbjzxzazkj\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/N9jeiuok59MQjFWcX/ahuay1vuuedqyklecleq 126w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/N9jeiuok59MQjFWcX/ybxgkykzozksyqdwhojg 206w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/N9jeiuok59MQjFWcX/icx75dnfot7bh5my9uwf 286w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/N9jeiuok59MQjFWcX/oqqgo0yy6s1szdfiaqai 366w\"></figure><p>The purpose of the MNPI is to build and maintain a community of Muslims who\u2019re interested in the positive impact that the combination of their faith and core-EA values can have on the world. The group has three main objectives:&nbsp;</p><p>1) Internal goals: Keeping the current group of Muslims already interested in theories of effective altruism from an Islamic perspective engaged and motivated to do good.</p><p>2) External goals: Increasing the size of \u2018the network\u2019 by having other potentially-high-impact individuals in the Muslim community engage with core EA ideas from Islamic perspectives.</p><p>3) Springboard for High-Impact Muslim Entrepreneurship: To foster high-impact Muslim entrepreneurship by motivating and supporting the creation of cause- and country-specific spinoff groups.

Although it obviously sucks that the subsequent events meant that we have continued to operate on a completely voluntary basis, we\u2019re also really proud that multiple assessors thought we are a high expected value project, and have used it as motivation to push on.</p><p><br>In short, we\u2019d still be excited to engage in discussions with funders and hopefully eventually receive some funding in order to strengthen and expand our operations across several domains. There are multiple important ways which being funded would help us accelerate our growth and increase our impact.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Being able to compensate \u2018staff\u2019 for their time to sustain motivation, or being able to pay staff to work more hours per week on their projects&nbsp;</li><li>Being able to pay for marketing for Afterfund and other initiatives which will require our brand being propagated in EA-atypical markets&nbsp;</li><li>Hiring a website designer to build a&nbsp;<i>Muslims for Effective Altruism</i>, Muslim Impact Lab, and Muslim Network for Positive Impact website.&nbsp;</li><li>Paying a graphic designer to produce marketing content</li><li>Contracting software developers to help Afterfund expand their platform and offer needed features to donors&nbsp;</li><li>Offering research stipends to students studying Islamic studies to work with EA-familiar students on overlap research&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Shortcomings:&nbsp;</h1><h2><br><strong>Not enough content development:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Our initial feeling when strategizing how to get our work gaining momentum, as well as legitimacy, amongst the EA and non-EA Islamic scholar community would be to produce detailed research into where and how core-EA ideas and various schools of Islamic thought overlap, and differ. Admittedly, we knew from the outset that this is a gargantuan and possibly endless undertaking (it sounds like the type of thing a whole university department or a couple of PhD students might work on for a couple of years). That being said, the only substantive piece of \u2018overlap\u2019 research produced across our three projects was Muslim Impact Lab\u2019s direct cash transfer work. Although this was good work which led to something we\u2019re proud of, it's not the type of foundational content which we think we fundamentally need.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Not having a website</strong></h2><p>It's not entirely clear how much of a problem not having a website is right now, but<a href=\"https://eaforjews.org/\"><u> EA for Jews\u2019 gorgeous new website</u></a> has got us feeling pretty jealous! The reason it's not clear if this is an issue is because we\u2019ve changed from viewing Muslims for EA as a community building organization which runs its own programming (like EA for Jews and EA for Christians) to just being an umbrella for (currently) a trio of object-level projects. Still, it\u2019d be nice for people to be able to land on a nice webpage when looking for us, although the current word-of-mouth referral by other members of the EA community seems to have worked reasonably well up until this point. Some additional value in having a website would be to further professionalize our aesthetic and brand, as well as to prepare for a more scalable way to communicate with our members if we ever get the point where using a whatsapp group seems too clunky or we reach the limit on people in a group chat.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Not having done enough work on the top of the funnel.</strong></h2><p>We\u2019ve done a lot of good work within our existing membership, but haven\u2019t done as much work exploring and implementing&nbsp; scalable mechanisms for attracting and retaining new members (such as virtual fellowships and self-directed material), although digital advertising and two radio interviews seemed to have attracted a few members who we likely wouldn\u2019t have had reached otherwise.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Things to celebrate and be proud of:&nbsp;</h1><ul><li>Making concrete progress on multiple projects, including having likely made real counterfactual impact through GiveDirectly.</li><li>Continuing to have weekly engagement and input from members of our community, who regularly demonstrate their careful attention to our work</li><li>Being a super diverse, global community which is very different from nearly every other EA sub-community&nbsp;</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Kaleem"}}, {"_id": "pq5tS6WGmeaTWi5uu", "title": "AI policy & governance in Australia: notes from an initial discussion", "postedAt": "2023-05-15T00:00:38.419Z", "htmlBody": "<p>People affiliated with EA who are interested in improving AI policy and governance in Australia have been meeting to learn from each other, create a shared understanding, and investigate opportunities to coordinate our impact.&nbsp;</p><p>We're sharing these notes to help increase awareness in other communities and countries that these conversations are happening, as some of the themes may resonate or be of use for other groups having similar discussions. &nbsp;We'd be open to speaking with and collaborating with other groups, in the spirit of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/RwtygELTfbRJzcvwD\">improving coordination in AI Safety movement building</a>.</p><p>At a recent meeting, we had an initial discussion reflecting on the prompt:</p><blockquote><p><i>What challenges does Australia face in transitioning to a world with advanced AI?</i></p></blockquote><p>The structured discussion involved&nbsp;</p><ol><li>generating reactions to the question in Miro sticky notes, including attempting to answer the question, offering reflections on their experience prompted by the question, or critiquing / questioning the question itself (e.g., what do we mean by 'advanced');&nbsp;</li><li>commenting on others' reactions in Miro;&nbsp;</li><li>discussing the reactions and comments, with the goal of increasing our shared understanding of salient issues.</li></ol><p>Here are some of the themes that emerged from this initial discussion. We intend to explore these themes in more detail and may use them to guide future work by this group.&nbsp;</p><h1>Themes from an initial discussion</h1><p><i>Note. The intention of this discussion was to elicit reactions and points of agreement / disagreement, rather than identify or prioritise areas that the group thought was most important to address.</i></p><h3><strong>Australia\u2019s Economy is exposed to automation; but are there pathways to benefit from transformative AI?</strong></h3><p>One major challenge identified was for Australia's labour and economy, particularly the risk of high unemployment in the knowledge-work-heavy economy due to the automation of knowledge tasks from AI. This may be exacerbated by Australia having less technology capacity &amp; leadership than similar other countries, meaning that structural unemployment is a live possibility due to Australia's inability to develop 'home grown' AI systems, or effectively adapt to international companies that offer AI / automation products to replace our workers. &nbsp;At the same time, Australia is also relatively agile and, with good policy and regulation, productivity could increase with automation. Whether these policies can be identified and implemented before a terminal loss of tax revenue needs further work.</p><h3><strong>Australia as a Potential Global Thought Leader in AI</strong></h3><p>Some reactions considered or questioned the role of Australia in the global AI transition. On one hand, AI governance can be considered a multi-layered coordination problem, some elements of which are relevant nationally / domestically, even if other parts are international, global, or reliant on so-called 'key actors' like firms developing advanced AI. This would suggest that people wanting to have the greatest impact should either focus on Australian national / domestic policy, regulation, and governance, or ignore Australia to work on international issues or for the 'bigger fish'.</p><p>An alternative view was to consider the track record of Australian groups in spurring global agreements or regulation in other areas, especially nuclear non-proliferation - despite never developing or holding nuclear weapons (<a href=\"https://International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons\">ICAN</a>), and the Australia Group, &nbsp;which seeks to control the trade of precursors for biological and chemical weapons. This suggests there may be a role for Australia to act as a 'thought leader' or 'policy leader' in international AI governance.</p><h3><strong>Advocacy and Policy: Strategic postures&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The Australian government and Australian policymaking with respect to AI was focusing on robotics, automation, and competition - not global catastrophic or existential risks. Strategic postures were discussed: should advocacy initially address these issues to build a track record and credibility; what do good futures look like for Australia, and how could they be shaped by the group\u2019s actions?</p><h3><strong>Navigating Diverse Risk Categories and Sources in AI Transition</strong></h3><p>Various risk categories and sources associated with AI transition were raised. These ranged from humanity's general lack of wisdom and perverse incentives to the democratisation of AI technologies, security concerns, coordination challenges, and geopolitical tensions. The specific relevance of these to Australia and Australian policy need further unpacking.</p><h3><strong>How could the group improve its knowledge infrastructure, coordination, and impact?</strong></h3><p>The role of the group in addressing some of these challenges was examined. Some members of the group are already actively advocating for policy change through political channels; others have made opportunistic policy submissions; and others still are considering how and in what direction they can act. Several ideas were raised for useful activities the group could do. Some of these ideas were focused on improving the group's shared understanding, such as comparing estimated timelines for advanced AI &nbsp;and identifying points of agreement or disagreement for goals and strategies. Other ideas were focused building capacity or direction to act, such as mapping stakeholders, creating templates for policy submissions, or identifying and recruiting members.</p><h1>What's next</h1><p>We intend to continue to meet, discuss, and act to influence AI policy &amp; governance in Australia.

Notably, <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\"><u>the Future of Life Institute\u2019s open letter</u></a>&nbsp;calling for a six month pause on leading AI development collected over 25,000 signatures within five weeks of release, and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/04/readout-of-white-house-meeting-with-ceos-on-advancing-responsible-artificial-intelligence-innovation/\"><u>senior White House officials have met with AI leaders</u></a>&nbsp;to discuss risks from AI.</p><p>This&nbsp;report presents the findings of a structured process, organized by Metaculus and the Future of Life Institute, which brought together Pro Forecasters and SMEs to begin identifying, quantitatively, the most impactful policy directions for reducing <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-risk\"><u>existential risk from misaligned AI</u></a>&nbsp;(hereafter: \u201cAI risk\u201d).</p><h2>Methods</h2><p>The AI Pathways workshop combined a range of plausible scenarios for an AI future with probabilistic forecasts, leveraging the judgments of both SMEs and Metaculus Pro Forecasters. The goal of the exercise was to identify the most impactful actions for steering toward a positive future and away from a negative future.</p><p>We\u2014the Metaculus AI Forecasting team, in collaboration with the FLI policy team\u2014began by generating four possible states of the world in 2030, focusing on the impact of AI, and asking experts to identify developments which would likely play a large role in driving the world toward each of these four scenarios.&nbsp;The scenarios were developed with two key areas of uncertainty in mind: 1) takeoff speed and the related question of unipolarity versus multipolarity; 2) cooperation versus competition\u2014between labs and between countries. The \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ewk9eXrcRRcJvqBY8/ai-pathways-a-report-by-metaculus-and-the-future-of-life#Scenarios\"><u>Scenarios</u></a>\u201d section below outlines these scenarios in more depth. We worked with the SMEs to identify \u201cindicators\u201d or \u201cdrivers\u201d of these scenarios, ranked these, identified potential U.S. government policies and leading lab coordination actions that could pertain to the most important twenty or so indicators, and developed corresponding forecasting questions.</p><p>Workshop teams, made up of integrated groups of technical AI experts, AI policy experts,&nbsp;and at least one Pro Forecaster, then forecasted on these questions. In practice, most of the forecasting questions asked about either:</p><ol><li>The odds of a policy or coordination response&nbsp;(e.g., compute restrictions), conditional on whether or not an intermediate development (e.g., a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/warning-shot\"><u>warning shot</u></a>) occurs.</li><li>The odds of a more terminal development (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/recursive-self-improvement\"><u>recursive self-improvement</u></a>), conditional on whether or not a policy or coordination action had been implemented.</li></ol><p>All probabilities quoted in this report are the median&nbsp;forecast from the workshop&nbsp;and include forecasts from Pro Forecasters and SMEs. There were around 20 workshop participants, and the forecasting questions in this report were forecasted on by 5 or 6 participants on average. Quoted forecasts should be taken as having low to moderate <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/credal-resilience\"><u>resilience</u></a>, and not as being fully authoritative.</p><h2>Findings</h2><ol><li><strong>Policy interventions</strong><ol><li><strong>Hardware</strong><ol><li><strong>Participants were&nbsp;pessimistic that any of the potential hardware-related policies they looked into will be implemented in the next few years.</strong>&nbsp;They forecasted a 15% chance of compute&nbsp;capacity restrictions being implemented by 2027, 15% chance of required reporting of large training runs by 2026, and 7% chance of usage-tracking firmware updates for chips being enforced by 2028.</li><li>Participants\u2019 forecasts indicate an expectation that compute restrictions would marginally increase the number of frontier labs,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc1yrktilw86\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc1yrktilw86\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;with some of their stated reasoning being that compute restrictions mean that the top labs can\u2019t race ahead on compute. More frontier labs could be interpreted as meaning intensified race dynamics, though the workshop group that examined this topic concurred that the positive effect of compute restrictions on slowing capabilities advances will likely outweigh any negative race dynamics effects.&nbsp;Participants expected the other hardware policies to have little effect on the number of frontier labs.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Software</strong><ol><li>One category of risk that has been part of the AI safety discourse over the past month or so, following the release \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dcoxvEhAfYcov2LA6/agentized-llms-will-change-the-alignment-landscape\"><u>agentized</u></a>\u201d large language models (LLMs) like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-GPT\"><u>Auto-GPT</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi\"><u>BabyAGI</u></a>, and which was was the focus of participants\u2019 forecasting on software-related policy interventions, concerns the idea that these agentized LLMs might recursively self-improve. (Recursive self-improvement has been part of the AI safety discussion since the early days, however, agentized LLMs appear to be the first systems that might be capable of enacting some form of recursive self-improvement.)<ol><li>The default probability of an API restriction policy by 2027, according to the participants\u2019 forecasts, is 7%. The probability of recursive self-improvement, via agentized LLMs improving their agentic \u201cwrappers\u201d, given no API restrictions is 90%, whereas the probability of recursive self-improvement in this way given API restrictions is 67%. This means that <strong>if one thinks that self-improving agentized LLMs are a significant worry, then raising the chance of a policy to prevent LLMs from accessing their own APIs is potentially a high impact intervention</strong>.</li><li>The default probability of both API restrictions and LLM export controls by 2027 is 5%, according to the workshop participants. (Note: LLM export controls would make it illegal for anyone in the U.S. to open-source an LLM more powerful than some stated level.) The probability of recursive self-improvement, via agentized LLMs improving their agentic \u201cwrappers\u201d, given just one or none of API restrictions and LLM export controls 90%, whereas the probability of recursive self-improvement in this way given both API restrictions and LLM export controls is 60%. Therefore, if one thinks that self-improving agentized LLMs are a significant worry, then increasing the chance of <strong>an LLM export control policy is also potentially an impactful intervention</strong>.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>International</strong><ol><li><strong>Participants were pessimistic about an international AI treaty involving China.</strong>&nbsp;Specifically, they were at 16% that by 2030 the US and China will sign a treaty requiring mutual transparency over large training runs.</li><li>Participants were also pessimistic\u20148.5% and 5%, respectively\u2014that the U.S. or Chinese President will, by 2025, publicly adopt a stance against AI racing.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>State of AI</strong><ol><li><strong>The first transformative AI (TAI) will be developed by a for-profit company: 70% chance.</strong><ol><li>The following definition of TAI was used: AI that precipitates a transition comparable to, or more significant than, the agricultural or industrial revolution.</li><li>The remaining 30% was spread fairly equally over these possibilities: non-profit company, government project, nationalized company. The first TAI coming from academia or an open-source collective was judged as unlikely.<ol><li>A related workshop forecast: 45% chance&nbsp;that the open source ecosystem will have produced a GPT-4 equivalent by 2027.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>The number of actors at the TAI&nbsp;forefront will likely be small, though participants don\u2019t expect only one forefront actor.</strong>&nbsp;The median estimate for the number of forefront actors was 4, and the lower and upper quartiles were 2 and 7, respectively.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv62idotlrta\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv62idotlrta\">[2]</a></sup></span></li><li>40% chance that AI will be meaningfully discussed by both major candidates in the 2024 U.S. Presidential debate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>State of AI lab coordination</strong><ol><li><strong>Participants were somewhat pessimistic about leading AI labs coordinating with each other to slow the capabilities race.</strong><ol><li>\u201cWill three of the largest AI labs issue a joint statement committing to constrain capabilities development or deployment before 2027?\u201d received a median forecast of 50%.</li><li>Key figures seem unlikely to publicly adopt a stance against AI racing, by 2025. The median forecast was around 25% for Sam Altman and for Demis Hassibis, and around 10% for each of Eric&nbsp;Schmidt, Jeff Dean and Yan LeCun.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Risks from AI</strong><ol><li>The median forecast on the chance of AI-caused global catastrophe, meaning &gt;10% of the global population being killed, by 2030 was 2%.</li><li>Meanwhile, the median forecast regarding a moderate AI catastrophe by 2030 was 80%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3vcg013p4mr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3vcg013p4mr\">[3]</a></sup></span></li><li>Interestingly, the chance of U.S. compute restrictions\u2014restricting the amount of compute that is allowed to be used in training runs is one of the most commonly talked about policy interventions in AI safety\u2014by 2025 was forecasted as substantially higher, namely, 30% versus 10%,&nbsp;if a moderate AI catastrophe occurs before then. The reasoning that came up repeatedly here is the idea that a warning shot, such as a moderate AI catastrophe, could act as a galvanizing event that causes proposed policies, which may currently be outside the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window%23:~:text%3DThe%2520Overton%2520window%2520is%2520the,as%2520the%2520window%2520of%2520discourse.\"><u>Overton window</u></a>, to gain support and be implemented.&nbsp;In fact, the notion that a warning shot might significantly raise the chance of policy action was a recurring theme in the workshop as a whole.</li></ol></li></ol><h2>Scenarios</h2><p>We\u2014Metaculus and FLI\u2014began this project by constructing and discussing a set of four scenarios set in 2030:</p><ol><li>In \u201c<strong>The Pause Perdures</strong>\u201d:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5k3th67shmb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5k3th67shmb\">[4]</a></sup></span><ol><li>Despite general stability, and ability to do so, there are no AI systems significantly more capable than GPT-4 (i.e. maybe GPT-5 level. No PASTA, no superintelligence).</li><li>AI is broadly integrated into society and used for many things. It has been a big adjustment.</li><li>Both expert consensus and some minor AI-related disasters have created a compelling case that AGI/superintelligence is a bad idea in the foreseeable future.</li><li>The limit on AI has been chosen by society and is enforced by human norms, laws, and institutions.</li></ol></li><li>In \u201c<strong>Gatekeeper</strong>\u201d:<ol><li>There is a single arguably superintelligent AI system, which is substantially more competent than all others.</li><li>It is owned/controlled by a multinational NGO with shared global governance.</li><li>It generates both scientific research and software products for the global public good (including help in governing less powerful AI systems).</li><li>It supports a multilateral global agreement (an international IAEA-like agency) that prevents rival superintelligences from being developed.</li><li>GPT-5 level systems are used broadly for many things, but are strictly capability-capped and carefully managed.</li></ol></li><li>In \u201c<strong>Accelerando, Diminuendo</strong>\u201d:<ol><li>There are many powerful and economically useful AI systems by 2025, and a few that could be called general intelligences by 2027. All of these are developed by major competing AI companies, and remain associated with them (though at some point the tail starts to wag the dog).</li><li>Between 2025 and 2026 people broadly benefit greatly from AI, and AI systems seem to be coming up with methods of collaborating amongst themselves and with human institutions.</li><li>From 2026 to 2027, decisions are increasingly delegated to AI systems, and there is a general feeling that nobody knows exactly what they are doing and why. Still, productivity is high, there is an endless stream of entertainment, and new technologies are appearing at a rapid rate.</li><li>Around 2028, things start to get markedly worse worldwide for humans, but few if any humans really understand what is going wrong\u2014or even that things might be going wrong at all.</li><li>In 2030, the human population is trending sharply downward, though this is not widely known.</li></ol></li><li>In \u201c<strong>Crash on Takeoff</strong>\u201d:<ol><li>Timelines have been quite short, with the Metaculus (harder) AGI question resolving positive in 2026 after an AGI was developed in a massive year-long training run. This AGI is kept quite controlled, however, by its highly cautious developers.</li><li>In 2028, a company in secret uses a somewhat less powerful but less constrained system to do human-assisted recursive self-improvement.</li><li>In 2029, the humans fall out of the loop. There is brief conflict with the existing AGI, then intelligence explosion and classic instrumental drives/power-seeking behavior.</li><li>Humanity is extinct by 2030.</li></ol></li></ol><h2>Updates</h2><p>We currently plan on running subsequent AI Pathways workshops, the next being in June, as part of the overall AI Pathways project.</p><h2>Feedback</h2><p>The AI Pathways project represents a new, as far as we\u2019re aware, angle of attack for anticipating the future of AI risk and judging the impact of high-stakes policy decisions.

Below, one concrete story for the scenario is given. (We thank the experts and forecasters in the Pause Perdures group for constructing this story.)</p><p>GPT-5 is developed by OpenAI in mid-2025.</p><p>In 2026, a terrorist cell deliberately misuses a GPT-5 level LLM to create an auto-blackmail system. It uses spear phishing campaigns to hack email, CCTV cameras, etc. to discover a wide variety of legitimate blackmail against politicians across the US, UK, China, South Korea, and Japan. Some of the blackmail material is also fabricated via deepfake audio and video, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell the difference between the real and fake material. A lot of the blackmail materials are revealed amid a lot of resigning politicians, including several notable suicides and one assassination arising from the revealed blackmail information.</p><p>This AI campaign is eventually discovered by an Interpol taskforce and gets wall-to-wall coverage in every major news outlet. This coverage galvanizes international coordination towards a pause.</p><p>Throughout this story, China is at least five years behind LLM SOTA due to increasingly strong and increasingly well coordinated export controls. China\u2019s access to cloud compute has also been heavily restricted. At the time of the pause, China has not even trained an LLM as good as GPT-4 despite significant investment.</p><p>Generally speaking, AI capabilities have remained very capital intensive, so the set of actors has remained small. At the time of the pause, only (1) OpenAI + Microsoft, (2) Google + Deepmind, (3) Anthropic, and (4) the US government are capable of making GPT &gt;=5. Leading AI labs continue to be private and domiciled in democracies.</p><p>The US starts leading the world towards an international treaty banning AI training runs that use over ~1E28 FLOP. China initially resists these measures, but turns around and complies on account of the carrot offered: its access to AI compute supply chains are tied to participating in the treaty. (Note: an alternative story with a similar outcome could involve some successful \"boxing\" of China, instead of a treaty.) Secure chip technologies are developed such that centralized tracking of chips, knowledge of how they are being used, and remote shutdown are all possible. Installation of these features is mandated through supply chain controls from the U.S. government, with support from Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands. The US government also invests heavily in cybersecurity for these actors to prevent exfiltration, and engages in a lot of compute governance.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Will Aldred"}}, {"_id": "CDNL97QtgWJyTY8LJ", "title": "What Are Dreams Worth?", "postedAt": "2023-05-14T07:06:56.335Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>A Cause Exploration On Changing Our Sleep And Expanding the Moral Circle to Our Sleeping Selves</h2><h3>Introduction&nbsp;</h3><p>This post is written by Hans Gundlach. It is a cross-post from my blog <a href=\"https://hansgundlach.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile\">Cosmic Censorship</a>.</p><p>Given that our time asleep occupies about a third of our lives there is relatively little research into the ethical implications of dreams and sleep states and how to enhance or modify them. I want to pose a few questions that seem unaddressed in the EA community. For instance, what moral weight should we give to our time asleep? Should we eliminate sleep? What are the risks and benefits of engineering our time sleep? The answers to these questions could lead to novel ways of doing good. These implications and the relative neglect of these states make the enhancement and modifications a promising impact area to investigate for philosophers, scientists, and altruists.</p><h3>Background on Dreams</h3><p>Before we examine the ethical implications of dreams we should look at the current science. At first, dreams may seem to be nonsensical and constitute biological noise. Dreaming occurs in many animals including dogs and cats and likely serves as an important biological process.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5t9hf3ayrb2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5t9hf3ayrb2\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Modern theories posit that dreams provide both reinforcement for lessons learned during the day as well as provide preparation for future hypothetical scenarios. Research seems to suggest dreams are associated with the REM stage of sleep which only occupy about twenty-five percent of our time asleep.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0m33863n0yu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0m33863n0yu\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, non-REM or NREM dreams are still under scientific consideration.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefti5igon0ed\"><sup><a href=\"#fnti5igon0ed\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Increasing Happiness In Our Dreams</h3><p>Current research into dreams mainly addresses the impact dreams have on our waking state. However, little work is done on dreams as important entities in themselves. We feel a wide variety of emotions in dreams happiness, pride, love, and pain. Yet, there is little work on the reduction of pain in dreams. This is not to say that the dream state has the same moral weight as our waking state. For example, being murdered in a dream has less of an impact than being murdered in real life. Nevertheless, our perception of dreams is hindered by our memory awareness. People recall their dreams with much fewer details than in their normal lives.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefti5igon0ed\"><sup><a href=\"#fnti5igon0ed\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The inability to recall dream events biases us to view the emotions and events of our dreams as much less significant. Medication already exists to treat nightmares associated with PTSD ie Prazosin.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp1zzsmr7x8p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp1zzsmr7x8p\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, the enhancement of dreams, as opposed to the simple reduction of nightmares could be a promising direction for impact.</p><h3>Making Dreams More Productive and the Art of Dream Engineering</h3><p>If dreams are responsible for learning is there any way to modify or improve the ability of dreams to aid learning? There already exist ways to encourage the onset of sleep i.e melatonin. People can be encoded with specific information during sleep including developing an aversion to Cigarettes. In one study, smokers were given the paring of cigarette smoke with rotten eggs. After this intervention, which the smokers were entirely unaware of, participants reduced their cigarette consumption by 30%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff3n7ajasha\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf3n7ajasha\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Maybe methods similar to this could be employed to create sleep tuned to enhance specific skills i.e language learning. However, dream engineering also poses significant risks including the power to influence people to do negative actions without their consent. Therefore, I suggest caution and more thought on the issue among the EA community.</p><h3>The Moral Status of Lucid Dreaming</h3><p>Current assessments of dreams also overlook the variety of dream states. Lucid dreaming poses an interesting case for the appraisal of dreams. For example, are experiences in lucid dreams more valuable because the dreamer has greater awareness and autonomy? Recent research has shown that two-way communication between lucid dreamers and researchers is possible.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff3n7ajasha\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf3n7ajasha\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Perhaps the lucid dreaming state is indeed closer to waking consciousness. If this is the case and waking consciousness is seen as a more valuable or rewarding state than sleep then work should be done to increase the lucidity or awareness of our dreams. There eventually could be a reliable method to induce lucid dreaming and scientist have attempted to use techniques like non-invasive electrical stimulation to cause it. Lucid dreaming is also to an extent a learnable skill.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefti5igon0ed\"><sup><a href=\"#fnti5igon0ed\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Further, if we value conscious states like dreams more than nonconscious states like coma or dreamless sleep, we should conduct research into increasing the dream content of our sleep. Could it be possible to increase the percentage of sleep in the REM stage which is associated with dreaming?</p><h3>Should We Eliminate Sleep?</h3><p>If consciousness is a much more valuable state at the margin compared to sleep or dreaming, should we completely replace sleep altogether? Many people including me would prefer to have one more hour awake than asleep all things being equal. Nevertheless, eliminating sleep could set off a competitive race whereby people enjoy less sleep due to competitive work pressures. Further, there does not seem to be any current stimulants or other medication that can remove sleep without side effects. However, there remains the possibility of drastically reducing sleep with little to no consequences. In particular, familial natural short sleepers have a specific genetic mutation allowing them to sleep several hours less than average with no apparent side effects.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0fttr561mtpn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0fttr561mtpn\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Progress in this area could significantly improve productivity and possibly leisure time if well-regulated.</p><h3>Are We Different People When We Sleep?</h3><p>The questions above also ignore the fascinating relation dreams have to notions of personal identity. Is our dream state another version of ourselves or a separate entity? Lucid dreamers can encounter lucid dream characters who have completely unpredictable behavior for the dreamer. &nbsp;Could these lucid figures be seen as somewhat separate entities from the dreamer? John Locke thought dreams posed an interesting edge case in the theory of personal identity. Locke viewed personal identity as contingent on psychological continuity. According to Locke, if a sleep and waking person with the same soul have no memory of each other they are different entities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefti5igon0ed\"><sup><a href=\"#fnti5igon0ed\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; If the separate entity theory is correct, then we have further ethical concerns. In particular, we should think about the ethics of limiting, controlling, or removing our dream state.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Sleep and dreams look like relevant fields for effective altruists. Dreams are the most common but by no means the only altered state of consciousness worth addressing. There should be a greater scientific and intellectual investment into understanding our sleep state and its dream content. This could lead to developing our time sleeping for the greater good. As well as preventing us from making pitfalls about these conscious states. If dreams are important in themselves then I want to put forward the expansion of the moral circle to include our lives asleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>References</h2><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn5t9hf3ayrb2\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref5t9hf3ayrb2\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Linden, Sander van der. \u201cThe Science Behind Dreaming.\u201d Scientific American.

These are usually short-term and generic, in the sense that they are not tailored to your specific situation: most of these interventions are one-size-fits-all and tested on the general population. There are obviously many ways to improve your SWB that fall outside this scope, so we encourage you to take a longer-term perspective too and consider your own life circumstances.</p><p>This report was produced by <a href=\"https://effectiveselfhelp.org/\"><u>Effective Self-Help</u></a>, an EA organisation&nbsp;researching the most effective interventions for improving wellbeing and productivity.

Among them, life satisfaction was most strongly associated with basic and social needs, positive emotions with respect and social needs, and negative feelings with respect and autonomy needs.</p><p><a href=\"http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/files/2019/11/Sheldon-Lyubomirsky-2019.pdf\"><u>Sheldon and Lyubomirsky (2019)</u></a>&nbsp;suggest in&nbsp;their proposed <i>Positive Activity Model</i>&nbsp;that psychological need satisfaction is one mechanism through which positive practices and activities (such as the interventions we discuss in this article) work to boost wellbeing. For instance, the benefits of expressing gratitude may partly&nbsp;come from an increase in social connectedness, since sharing grateful thoughts and feelings helps form deeper bonds.</p><p>Thirdly, several community and societal factors are associated with SWB, such as living in a country with lower inequality and corruption, more political freedoms, as well as in a less polluted area and near green spaces.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn81s49ggte\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn81s49ggte\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As for the role of economic factors, robust evidence shows that national income is strongly associated with SWB,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6yx55bwpcwk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6yx55bwpcwk\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but note that there is considerable discussion and debate on this topic - including, but not limited to, the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easterlin_paradox\"><u>Easterlin paradox</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyjqpw0bxufp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyjqpw0bxufp\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;which we won\u2019t go into here.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo8oob6j82un\"><sup><a href=\"#fno8oob6j82un\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness\"><u>This 80,000 Hours article</u></a>&nbsp;from 2016 reviews some evidence on personal income and happiness (in the context of career choice, they write: \u201cWe think the message is clear: if you want a satisfying career, once you\u2019re earning above about $40,000, don\u2019t focus on earning more money.\u201d, and see their section <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/#how-much-does-income-matter-relative-to-other-factors\"><u>How much does income matter relative to other factors?</u></a>).

The data comes from the large Gallup World Poll, which includes a representative sample of adults from 166 nations. They calculated the \u201cpercent range\u201d, i.e. the difference between the highest and lowest point, of three SWB scales - life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect - covered by groups of different factors.</p><p>The factors that covered the highest percentage range for life satisfaction were nationality with 45% (i.e. 45% of the life satisfaction scale was covered by differences between the most extreme nations in terms of life satisfaction), followed by income, social support, basic needs and health satisfaction. The most influential factors, in this specific sense, for positive affect were social support, nationality, health satisfaction and income.

They differ from the reviewed interventions&nbsp;in one or both of these two dimensions:</p><p>1) They are wider and less targeted. The wellbeing interventions we reviewed are mostly about specific and directly testable methods or procedures, often that you can follow for a limited period. Instead, the advice just below should be seen as general guidelines helpful for&nbsp;setting up a solid basis for a happy life.</p><p>2) We applied a different standard for the evidence base. Even though we tried to ensure that the advice in this section rests on the most solid and recent evidence, it is not exclusively based on meta-analyses of experimental studies, but also on non-experimental data and individual randomised control trials (RCTs), many of which have been mentioned in the preceding section.

We reasoned then on a case by case basis to select the one that seemed most relevant to our intervention recommendation purpose, taking into account factors such as the wellbeing outcome measured,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd3ue0f1j0fs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd3ue0f1j0fs\">[65]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the comparison group,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref810ewypsty2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn810ewypsty2\">[66]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the time of measurement<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhfjix649u3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhfjix649u3\">[67]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and the number of involved participants.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7lrguwn6k1w\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7lrguwn6k1w\">[68]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>The choice of which wellbeing outcomes to use</u></h3><p>While carrying out our research we came to realise that a large variety of wellbeing measures were used across studies. Yet is it reasonable to proceed as we did in compiling then aggregating into a single result numerous different measures or scales, sometimes markedly dissimilar?</p><p>On the one hand, many researchers argue for or present evidence in favour&nbsp;of the conceptualisation of the various potential dimensions of wellbeing as a single overarching construct.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw9xby9ahoz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw9xby9ahoz\">[69]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Moreover, we\u2019ve encountered countless cases of aggregation of different measures into a single effect size, which appears to be a standard practice.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv69cnehrh3s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv69cnehrh3s\">[70]</a></sup></span></p><p>On the other hand, some evidence does not support the validity of&nbsp;a complete merging of the distinct happiness constructs,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw4pdrdylyns\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw4pdrdylyns\">[71]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and measures are sometimes deemed too heterogenous by researchers to aggregate them.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0vuclfv8x7u\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0vuclfv8x7u\">[72]</a></sup></span></p><p>Overall, we think that since it allows us to include much more data&nbsp;into our results, such a combination remains a sensible approach, as long as we keep in mind that the assertion \u201cthis intervention has been shown to improve subjective wellbeing\u201d can mean non-trivially different things when we examine the details.</p><p>But what measures did we favour&nbsp;including when we had the choice? Following recommendations found in the literature and taking into account the prevalence of certain measures,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0dysshemf2s6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0dysshemf2s6\">[73]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;we preferred&nbsp;life satisfaction then&nbsp;positive and negative affect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Calculation of an overarching effect size</u></h3><p>After the compilation of all the individual studies information in our <i>Data</i>&nbsp;sheet, we aimed to calculate an \u201coverarching\u201d effect size for each intervention.</p><p>We considered several options for the overarching calculation:</p><p>a) Calculating the mean of all effect sizes weighted by the numbers of studies included.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiortpm9dqr\"><sup><a href=\"#fniortpm9dqr\">[74]</a></sup></span></p><p>b) Calculating the unweighted mean of all effect sizes.</p><p>c) Calculating the mean of all effect sizes weighted by the inverse of the confidence interval&nbsp;square.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl7goe0bnegp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl7goe0bnegp\">[75]</a></sup></span></p><p>d) Only taking the effect size of the highest quality meta-analysis.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>After some internal and external discussion, we opted for option a), which seemed to be a satisfying compromise between a reasonable weighting of the evidence (i.e. taking into account the \u201cstatistical quality\u201d of the results) and legibility.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhddm7rikbt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhddm7rikbt\">[76]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;At any rate, our methods don\u2019t constitute a bulletproof (meta-)aggregation process, but should rather serve as a solid heuristic to head towards the very best interventions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Time efficiency</u></h3><p>Although we want to stress that we think you shouldn\u2019t put too much weight on them, we also calculated time efficiency scores for each intervention. To do&nbsp;that, we first searched through the meta-analyses and sometimes their included&nbsp;studies themselves to find descriptions of the duration of interventions as tested in the studies, which we listed in the <i>Descriptions of interventions</i>&nbsp;sheet as a range between the shortest and longest duration. We then divided the middle of the range by the&nbsp;\u201coverarching\u201d effect size of the intervention to calculate a score. This time efficiency score is best interpreted as a rough indication of the time you need to invest to get to a certain level of results.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo9z3d5f216m\"><sup><a href=\"#fno9z3d5f216m\">[77]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But it loses some&nbsp;of its meaning when interventions start being practised&nbsp;on a regular basis as habits, as the time commitment becomes stable - not only a one-off endeavour&nbsp;- and it\u2019s unclear what happens to the initial boost all else equal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Categories for the interventions</u></h3><p>Though we kept the ranking in terms of effect size for both of them, we separated the interventions into two subsets: the <i>interventions with a strong evidence base</i>&nbsp;and the <i>interventions with a weaker evidence base</i>. To belong to the strong evidence base category and not be downgraded to the weaker evidence base category, an intervention had to meet these four criteria: (1) the total number of included studies across meta-analyses had to be 10 or above,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsw7ibml7jb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsw7ibml7jb\">[78]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(2) the effect size had to be mostly&nbsp;standardised mean differences and not correlation coefficients, (3) the population had to be mostly non-clinical adults in the majority of meta-analyses, and (4) the wellbeing outcomes measured had to be mostly life satisfaction, positive or negative affect, or another established wellbeing scale,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcvma4p4q2t\"><sup><a href=\"#fncvma4p4q2t\">[79]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and not close but distinct measures like mental illness, stress or quality of life, in the majority of meta-analyses. For both of these categories we further splitted interventions according to their <i>higher</i>&nbsp;or <i>lower</i>&nbsp;effect size.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Selection of resources for practising the interventions</u></h3><p>For each intervention, we searched for empirically supported and quality self-help resources to recommend, like books, apps, or online programs. We followed roughly the process below:</p><p>1) Look, directly in all the meta-analyses reviewed for the intervention, for relevant RCTs evaluating wellbeing with one of the words \u201cself-help\u201d, \u201conline\u201d, \u201cweb\u201d, \u201cinternet\u201d, \u201cbook\u201d, \u201capp\u201d in their title.</p><p>2) Check inside each of the selected RCTs whether there is a usable resource to link to or describe.</p><p>3) Check the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/\"><u>EA Forum</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/\"><u>LessWrong</u></a>&nbsp;and then other sites like <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\"><u>80,000 Hours</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/five-steps-to-mental-wellbeing/\"><u>NHS</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://ggia.berkeley.edu/\"><u>Greater Good in Action</u></a>&nbsp;to find resources that seemed good and close to what the studies evaluated.</p><p>4) Sometimes conduct a broader online search, with a focus on how close the resources are to what the studies evaluated, and how popular or recognized they seem to be.</p><p>In general, we would have liked to find more resources with direct empirical support, and it\u2019s still quite possible that we missed some very good ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Limitations of our research</strong></h2><p>The aim of our research is to produce rigorous quality results on which we can base our recommendations. However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are several limitations worth keeping in mind, in particular to avoid over-interpreting the results.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>First, note that, while&nbsp;we strived to follow a methodical and transparent research process, we still had to make many judgement calls. For instance, the choices of which effect size to select among several wasn\u2019t always straightforward, as well as which meta-analyses to include or not. As much as possible, we tried to explicitly state the reasons for our decisions (e.g. in the notes of the Evidence table), but one should be aware that we unavoidably relied on several subjective assessments.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, our classification of interventions is somewhat debatable. Coming up with coherent categories for interventions wasn\u2019t too hard in many&nbsp;cases, but we came across difficulties in a few instances. For example, even if compassion and mindfulness/meditation interventions are clearly distinct as a whole, we found out that the sub-intervention mindful&nbsp;self-compassion had been included in either&nbsp;of these two interventions, depending on the meta-analyses.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref697dqfqcf56\"><sup><a href=\"#fn697dqfqcf56\">[80]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;More generally, it occurred to us that protocols of interventions in theory distinct&nbsp;commonly overlapped.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoef3s4t9gtb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoef3s4t9gtb\">[81]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Third, the reviewed meta-analyses also overlap in terms of the individual RCTs they include. For instance, we counted that, for the Best Possible Self intervention, 10 out of the 16 RCTs included in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01093-w\"><u>van Agteren et al. (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;had already been included in <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2020.1716052\"><u>Heekerens and Eid (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;(which itself included 34 RCTs in total).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefymdzkpdz1f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnymdzkpdz1f\">[82]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In hindsight, it was maybe a bit redundant to review so many meta-analyses. Nonetheless, the inclusion of several ones is a way to smooth out their differences in effect sizes and arguably increase the robustness of results.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, as we mentioned in the section <i>The choices of wellbeing outcomes</i>, a combination of this many measures - or sometimes only proxies - of wellbeing, makes the interpretation of our results more equivocal.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref07wqtyi9w3es\"><sup><a href=\"#fn07wqtyi9w3es\">[83]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It\u2019s therefore wise to go check the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GIYcCkXY2jbIjBBGvDL2fw9k2CzsScfPM_AzdmErL8\"><u>Evidence table</u></a>&nbsp;to see in detail the outcome tested in each study.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Fifth, we could have included even&nbsp;more information in the <i>Data</i>&nbsp;sheet, such as details on the control group type (e.g. active or passive), a measure of <a href=\"https://www.statsdirect.com/help/meta_analysis/heterogeneity.htm\"><u>heterogeneity</u></a>, of publication bias, or follow-up information more methodically collected when it was available (but it most often was not).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh99m8fa5lh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh99m8fa5lh\">[84]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Sixth, we reviewed studies mostly&nbsp;focused on non-clinical participants from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#WEIRD_bias\"><u>WEIRD</u></a>&nbsp;cultures,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk9y0rji8t9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk9y0rji8t9\">[85]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which casts some doubts on the broad generalizability of the results. The farther you are from this type of demographics, the less you should give weight to our findings for yourself, although they probably should still remain quite informative. If you suffer from a clinical condition (whether mental or physical), you can check Table 3 of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01093-w\"><u>van Agteren et al. (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;for effects on wellbeing of various interventions on mentally and physically ill populations, as well as <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29945603/\"><u>Chakhssi et al. (2018)</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefen9g7stvknb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnen9g7stvknb\">[86]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We also came across papers of interest on interventions on <a href=\"https://www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/index.php/ijow/article/view/711\"><u>non-western populations</u></a>&nbsp;and on <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fsgd0000365\"><u>sexual and gender minorities</u></a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Seventh, keep in mind that our \u201coverarching\u201d effect size calculation process, on which our ranking of interventions is mostly based,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhe1pewn76ze\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhe1pewn76ze\">[87]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;should best be seen as a sort of heuristic way of approximating a global meta-analytical effect size, and not as the result of a more advanced statistical analysis.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Eighth, features&nbsp;of current psychological research&nbsp;itself, in particular on happiness interventions, can lead us to question the strength&nbsp;of our recommendations. Several researchers mention the&nbsp;limited evidence quality and field maturity in wellbeing interventions research.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcaji4o2u2qc\"><sup><a href=\"#fncaji4o2u2qc\">[88]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In addition, it\u2019s possible that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict\"><u>dodo bird verdict</u></a>&nbsp;applies to happiness interventions stemming from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology\"><u>positive psychology</u></a>, which is the claim originally pertaining to&nbsp;psychotherapies that all forms of treatments yield roughly equivalent outcomes regardless of their specific components.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9xwe8hal7tj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9xwe8hal7tj\">[89]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Finally, psychology\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis\"><u>replication crisis</u></a>&nbsp;should lead us to generally take empirical findings from psychological experiments with caution, with meta-analyses suffering from publication bias and selective reporting,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj4am0mgm61f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj4am0mgm61f\">[90]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;leading to a potential substantial overestimation of effect sizes by a factor of three.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Ninth, there might be a gap in effectiveness between the interventions as tested in the reviewed studies and the way we\u2019re assuming you\u2019re mostly going to follow them, that is as (self-)guided self-help. As you can see in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GIYcCkXY2jbIjBBGvDL2fw9k2CzsScfPM_AzdmErL8/edit#gid=78952966\"><i><u>Description of interventions</u></i></a>&nbsp;sheet, the modes of administration were diverse, but the self-guided format is sometimes considered less effective.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjkr1m2j7yxd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjkr1m2j7yxd\">[91]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Discussion of Interventions<br>&nbsp;</h1><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:624px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KGqAvdxN6KypkmdPb/dvgyuuvmbqbpnnp5gy9q\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

Indeed, although it can be really useful&nbsp;to direct readers preferentially to the most promising ones at the collective level, the concordance between the activity and yourself is arguably a central factor of&nbsp;intervention individual effectiveness.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnu0rsm97bnr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnu0rsm97bnr\">[93]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;You may also find <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/w9hKmNvhEnHo2wcr7/many-therapy-schools-work-with-inner-multiplicity-not-just?commentId=tRsCrXAC7cpkXdQCA\"><u>this comment</u></a>&nbsp;by David Althaus on interindividual effectiveness variability and self-experimentation useful.</p><p>So we suggest you adopt an open-minded and curious approach towards the ranked list of interventions, by trying out several of them, even for a brief moment, with a priority given to the ones at the top. Then you can select the one(s) you want to pursue further, based on personal appeal and sense of effectiveness.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpd1f2csa9xk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpd1f2csa9xk\">[94]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A particularly judicious one to start with would be a Multi-component&nbsp;Positive Psychology intervention, as practising&nbsp;the various exercises it contains would allow you to try out several others of our listed interventions. And generally, mixing elements from the different interventions <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/w9hKmNvhEnHo2wcr7/many-therapy-schools-work-with-inner-multiplicity-not-just?commentId=LvxyEd4yWvwt8ayC8\"><u>seems relevant</u></a>&nbsp;if you find ways to do it.</p><p>As for the way to select the specific resource you want to use for an intervention, personal preferences should also probably be one of your main decisive factors. We erred on the side of listing many options, so that you can choose yourself which&nbsp;one is most appealing. A basic process is to at least have a glance at several of the resources you think may suit you before committing to one of them. But we still tried to give a sense of how solid the recommendation is in the way we present each resource, and in most cases you can treat the order in which they are mentioned as an indication of how relevant they seemed to us.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>What are the best ways&nbsp;to sustain the happiness boosts you may get from following some of these interventions for a certain amount of time?</p><p>Our answer to this large question is that it\u2019s not entirely&nbsp;clear.

Leisure engagement simply refers to the amount of time, diversity, or frequency of your participation in leisure activities, such as social activities, playing sports, games, cultural experiences, creative arts, or any activity you view as leisure.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffnmpel6v3b9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfnmpel6v3b9\">[198]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>The increase in wellbeing&nbsp;from leisure activities is thought&nbsp;to come from the satisfaction of a wide range of&nbsp;psychological needs, most notably from the experience&nbsp;of intrinsic motivation and perceived freedom fostered by such activities. Theoretical models and empirical evidence indicate that these two features, intrinsic motivation and perceived freedom, can be seen as defining characteristics of leisure activities, distinguishing leisure from other activities like work. And the experience&nbsp;of intrinsic motivation and perceived freedom&nbsp;has been shown to enhance subjective wellbeing. Additionally, engaging in leisure activities might influence SWB through the fulfilment of one or several other needs, like detachment from work-related thoughts, recovery from work stress, autonomy, mastery, meaning, and affiliation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwdfm3yhj0j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwdfm3yhj0j\">[199]</a></sup></span></p><p>Not surprisingly, interventions with a longer duration and a higher number of leisure hours were found to be more effective.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsmaxh5a69wm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsmaxh5a69wm\">[200]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And cross-sectional data indicate that leisure engagement is more strongly associated with SWB for retired than working samples.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeavl2f06x1k\"><sup><a href=\"#fneavl2f06x1k\">[201]</a></sup></span></p><p>The interventions included in the meta-analysis we reviewed were mostly programs specifically designed to improve the quality of participants\u2019 leisure activities, called leisure education programs. They typically consist of weekly sessions spanning two or three months led by a professional facilitator such as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_therapy\"><u>recreational therapist</u></a>. They first&nbsp;explore with the participants the benefits of leisure activities, then seek to familiarise them with a wide range of potentially satisfying leisure experiences, with a consideration for each participant\u2019s preferences and constraints. Lastly, time is often dedicated&nbsp;to the practice of the individually chosen activity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4ty2rszi47\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4ty2rszi47\">[202]</a></sup></span></p><p>One major limitation of leisure interventions is that the programs are designed for and have been tested on either retired or disabled populations: out of the six RCTs included in the reviewed meta-analysis, half of them are on older people and the other half on physically or mentally disabled participants. The sample sizes are also notably small, and half of the RCTs are not peer-reviewed. So the effect size of 1.02 should definitely not be taken at face value, even more so given that it\u2019s in big part coming from one of the six studies that is likely very&nbsp;unrepresentative of an actual implementation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl0mbqk3ag5b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl0mbqk3ag5b\">[203]</a></sup></span></p><p>Having said that, while it\u2019s clear&nbsp;that this is&nbsp;at least a bit different from following a leisure program strictly speaking, taking actions to improve the quality of your leisure experience still holds promise for enhancing your SWB. You can do it by focusing on the three obvious dimensions of leisure engagement: (1) the diversity of your leisure activities, i.e. how many different ones you engage in, (2) their frequency, i.e. how often you participate in different leisure activities, and (3) the amount oftime you spend on leisure, i.e. how many hours you spend on&nbsp;leisure experiences.</p><p>Spending your leisure time on mostly one single activity can be conducive to SWB, as the acquisition and expression of special skills and knowledge it allows can&nbsp;generate feelings of accomplishment, meaning and growth. However, engaging in a broader range of activities is plausibly more effective for satisfying a wide range of needs, because no single type of leisure activity is likely to satisfy them all at once. Furthermore, maintaining a \u201cbroad leisure repertoire\u201d - a reasonable variety&nbsp;of activities you enjoy and practice - may be a more prudent&nbsp;strategy, since it can help protect your leisure satisfaction in the face of risks of increasing leisure constraints associated with ageing, injury, loss of leisure partners or other life changes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd4ruulioxr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd4ruulioxr\">[204]</a></sup></span></p><p>All in all, improving your leisure is mostly just about finding activities you enjoy and you can fit into your lifestyle and routines.

A theoretical reason for this increase is that, from an evolutionary psychology perspective, \u201cthe experience of positive emotions in many natural environments was likely adaptive throughout the majority of our evolutionary history\u201d. A positive emotional response to natural environments rich in useful resources for survival, like food, water, shelter or raw materials, would encourage \u201capproach-oriented\u201d behaviours, i.e. it would increase the motivation to take action to acquire&nbsp;these resources.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm24u399904s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm24u399904s\">[215]</a></sup></span></p><p>Excluding non-experimental studies, the RCTs included in this intervention category examined \u201cthe effects of exposure to nature through direct physical or sensory contact or through laboratory simulations of nature\u201d.

First, life circumstances are typically stable and are therefore vulnerable to the emotionally desensitising effects of hedonic adaptation (Lyubomirsky, 2009; Sheldon &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2004, 2006a). For example, Sheldon and Lyubomirsky (2006a) found that positive circumstantial changes (e.g., receiving an unexpected scholarship or initiation into a fraternity) were associated with only a temporary boost in well-being. Second, attempting to produce changes in life circumstances can consume time, energy, or resources that a person may not have and, in some cases (e.g., a real estate downturn when one desires to move) is practically impossible.

In a clinical and counselling&nbsp;context, reminiscence-based therapy is one form of intervention that focuses on the retrieval of AMs, as well as reflection on their content.\u201d and \u201cThe guided recalling and reviewing of [problem-solving and identity related] personal memories is thought to represent an adaptive process that can enhance self-concept and improve well-being, whilst also balancing or redressing dysfunctional or unhelpful views of the self.\u201d</p><p>And they confirm that the intervention has a beneficial effect independently of the pleasantness of recalling positive memories: \u201cAs the reminiscence conditions did not differ on positively valenced outcomes and feelings relating to the AMs, the observed effects of problem-solving and identity reminiscence activities did not appear to be due simply to recalling positive memories. If the sole factor in change was that memories were evaluated in a positive way, then effects on measures in the control condition should have been observed. Instead, these findings suggest that reminiscence for problem-solving and identity purposes has an intrinsically adaptive role in improving self-concept and well-being.\u201d</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfhecpjbefmd\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffhecpjbefmd\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16810662/\"><u>Wing et al.
