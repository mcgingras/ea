I think a lot of this is plausible and it is similar to my own expectations in many ways. Thank you for writing this.</p>\n<p>That said, I think your vision is too conservative. AI the field that will change the world massively this century where transformative changes are already certain. But there are other candidates as well. Space development, self replicating macro and nano machines, human enhancement and new physics are options I consider likely in descending order. The interactions between those fields are the truly scary thing.  You acknowledge that your predictions are very likely to be false, but I think the biggest error people make when trying to predict the future is that they look at only a single dimension and ignore the interactions. For example, a power seeking AI could reasonably prioritise gambling on an interstellar land grab in the forties.</p>\n<p>Another point where I disagree with you is that AI's will cause more damage with spreadsheets, medical procedures and legal procedures. The human standard is already pretty dismal here, but we are wired to trust people in those positions. I think that while it is certain that AI will fail in some cases, it is far from certain that it will perform worse than the human baseline.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jens Brandt"}}, {"_id": "gajgYgWWiPhn2Ngjd", "postedAt": "2022-12-15T21:32:39.830Z", "postId": "2AiuvYoozXeHBGnhd", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for pointing out the mistake.

E.g. it took less than 3 years to go from GPT-3 to Chat-GPT, and Chat-GPT might already be changing the nature of knowledge work (see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamNeumannsCoS/status/1603203940010455040\">this story on Twitter</a>), whereas GPT-3 mostly has not. I think it's plausible that code-writing AI will cause similar disruptions for software engineering within the next 5 years. In contrast, people had several decades to respond to changes from the industrial revolutions.</li><li>Automation and autonomy. AI breakthroughs are especially useful for automating tasks compared to previous technologies (although previous technologies certainly enabled some automation), and automated tasks require less human labor.</li><li>Higher time costs to transition between jobs. Some of the new jobs that AI creates may be more technical in nature and require coding skills that take years to develop. Truck drivers can't retrain as AI researchers. A counterpoint is that there will be new manual labor jobs as well. I like your example of self-checkout enabling curbside pickup.</li><li>Performance improvements at many new tasks with a single AI breakthrough. E.g. language models demonstrate <a href=\"https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/in-context-learning/\">in-context learning</a>, and fine-tuning them produces <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Codex\">coding </a>and <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/06/minerva-solving-quantitative-reasoning.html\">math</a> models. A counterpoint is that there have been other general purpose technologies like electricity and the digital computer.</li></ol><p>I do think it's plausible that we'll see a period of radical abundance before any serious unemployment difficulties, but I'm not sure that this abundance will reach everyone equally. I could imagine low-income countries missing out on many of the benefits for years, which might cause dangerous political unrest.</p>", "parentCommentId": "8wMbMQnmbKwcvFMBq", "user": {"username":

An effect of this is that the overall amount of code explodes and the quality degrades because it just becomes impossible for humans to properly check and verify the code.</p></blockquote><p>I strongly doubt this part, and my expectation is the opposite - human-written code is pretty mediocre, and most production systems rely on millions of lines of code, much of which is unnecessary. The reason code isn't better is because programmer time is more expensive than the short-term benefits of improving the code. &nbsp;Automated tools are likely to reduce this gap, and write far tighter and simpler code. In addition, maintainability becomes far easier when automated rewrites are possible. And checking code generated by narrow AI isn't actually as hard as checking human code for correctness when there are NAI systems which are far better than humans at writing well documented unit tests.
