For instance, I would be more open to this system for hiring new graduates than for hiring mid-career professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>While the availability of true 100% remote, location-flexible jobs has blossomed in the last few years, those jobs still are very much in the minority and were particularly non-existent for those of us who started our careers 10-15 years ago. We acted in reliance on the then-dominant nature of work, in which more desirable careers with greater salaries were available in major cities than in rural Kansas. As a result of that reliance, we created financial and non-financial ties that would be costly to break. We might have -- for instance -- bought a condo (which would take 10% of its value to sell), married someone whose career is dependent on being in a one of a few high-COL cities, and raised children who do not want to leave their friends and schools.&nbsp;</p><p>These realities do not reflect a \"luxury good[] like rent in expensive places\"; they reflect the consequences of living life after making a sensible location decision under the then-prevailing circumstances. Avoiding the transaction costs of having to sell a condo, having one's spouse continue in their established field successfully, and having stability for one's kids are not forms of consumption that people in major cities somehow get while people who live in lower-COL places do not.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, you're right in that there is a consumption effect of chosing to live in a higher-COL city; I would enjoy being in (say) Dallas more than I would enjoy being in Peoria.

I noticed two issues, which may be edge cases or non-issues for GWWC, but could be relevant elsewhere:</p><p>(1) One of my bright-line rules for nonprofit compensation is that an employee should not earn <strong>more </strong>compensation than the private sector would award for comparable work. In my view as a donor, breaking this rule makes the employee a beneficiary of the charity, which is both inconsistent with donor intent and risks the usual problems when a charity is run partially in the interests of its employees. The lowest pay band is close to the average salary in Oxford even at zero experience,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefia9vue7okwm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnia9vue7okwm\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the average worker in Oxford might be more educated than the UK average, and at least the US benefit package looks fairly generous for median-wage work. That means that, for my proposed bright-line test to be satisfied, the lowest-paid GWWC employee needs to be performing work that the market would compensate at least at the median pay/benefits level in Oxford. That may well be the case at GWWC, but I submit that making sure the formula doesn't produce above-market compensation with any inputs might be a worthwhile bounds-checking exercise.</p><p>(2) I'd consider a further case-by-case adjustment for graduate-school debt where the employee incurred debt for a graduate degree that is substantially related to their duties.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz82nf6qbv9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz82nf6qbv9\">[2]</a></sup></span>From a US perspective where debt can be catastrophic, the competitive skills bonus doesn't really address this. GWWC probably isn't hiring (e.g.) lawyers or physicians to practice their professions, so this is probably not needed at present.

Paying $20 is consistent with my bright-line rule. One would not speak of the widget-seller who sells to a charity at market rate as a <i>beneficiary</i> of the charity; nor would an employee who makes no more than market rate be such.</p><p>In contrast, there are organizations that employ individuals (e.g., individuals with disabilities) at more than the market rate for their services for the purpose of benefitting those individuals. Those employees are properly considered beneficiaries of the program. If you're running a vocational rehabilitation charity, that's fine -- because the very purpose of your charity is to benefit your employees. But that model is not appropriate for most charities. While vendors and employees may <i>incidentally</i> benefit from the charity (by receiving fair compensation for their wares and labors), they should be giving something of at least equal value (their wares and labors) as determined by the market.</p><p>What I said would be perfectly consistent with someone taking a 20% pay cut from market rate to do charitable work, or even that person being paid full market rate. I would generally oppose someone being paid <strong>more </strong>than market rate to do the same work. And that can be a problem with lower grades in standardized pay scales, especially those in which compensation for the top grades is only 2-3 times higher than that for the lowest grades. Looking at the payroll of many government organizations reveals this potential issue with those kinds of pay algorithms.</p><p>If the market is paying \"obscene bonuses,\" then the charity paying similar bonuses to similarly-situated employees with similar levels of performance is acting consistently with a cap of market-rate compensation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs6907o3mv4j\"><sup><a href=\"#fns6907o3mv4j\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>I do think that too many nonprofits -- not speaking of EA, just in general -- are run too much in the interests of employees and not enough in the interests of the claimed beneficiaries. To pick two examples from different sides of the social spectrum, I specifically think this about many churches and universities. In contrast, in a medium+ sized for-profit, executives usually have strong financial incentivizes to not authorize salaries that do not further the corporation's profit objectives. In smaller ones, the owner usually is involved enough that the principal-agent problem is mitigated.&nbsp;</p><p>There isn't any similar mechanism available for most non-profits. Boards, donors, and other potential checks often aren't that effective. Thus, I think a norm that non-profits shouldn't pay more for the same work than for-profits would pay for that work makes sense. Given generally prevailing patterns of non-profit compensation, that boundary check will rarely be an issue . . . but I think it is an important check to have in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fns6907o3mv4j\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefs6907o3mv4j\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Moreover, this is neither the rationale that GWWC gave for its pay scale nor one that would make much sense for a grade-based pay scale such as the one under discussion.

A fully unadjusted salary expects candidates with sticky ties to a higher-COL location to sacrifice more, either by breaking those ties or by accepting a much deeper drop in standard of living / consumption than candidates in other locations. It will lead to many of those candidates opting out.</p><p>Given the current distribution of EAs, unadjusted salaries would take many candidates off the table, and in many cases that would be pretty problematic. I'm thinking of an analogy to non-EA nonprofit salaries. As people have pointed out elsewhere, often these are set at a level where only those who rely on a wealthier partner or parent to provide the financial support are able to stay in those positions long-term. That's a shrewd strategy for non-EA nonprofits if their applicant pool is deep, and having the third-best rather than the best candidate in a position doesn't make a huge difference. I'm not convinced that is presently the situation in most EA orgs.</p><p>The org could, of course, pay salaries high enough to keep SF-based candidates in the pool no matter where the employee was located.

My sense of where feels like \"home\" is influenced by where I grew up. If one of my goals is for my son to have a deep relationship with his grandparents, the grandparents are located where they are and the costs of semi-frequent travel are what they are. These considerations are not \"create[d]\" by the candidate in a way that is responsive to incentives. Moreover, unless someone immediately lands an EA job, their location incentives are more likely shaped by the general employment market in their field -- not by EA employers.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnusyua61v0i\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefusyua61v0i\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I do have some concerns that this could create bidding dynamics that could be unhealthy.
