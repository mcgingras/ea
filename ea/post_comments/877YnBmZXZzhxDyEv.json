Making a vaccine that does not require refrigeration would cut down on costs related to maintaining and creating a &quot;cold chain&quot; (continuous refrigerated storage and transportation), but I don't anticipate these costs being that high and I'd expect them to be offset by significantly increased manufacturing costs per dose for making such a vaccine.</p>\n<p>We'll have more conclusions on cost and cost effectiveness in future posts.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "8ZuKPDAARHeCKmDSu", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}]
