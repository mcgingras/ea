If not properly aligned, such systems could pose catastrophic risks. Understanding, forecasting, and addressing alignment is critical.</p><p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p><ol><li>Foundation models exhibit capabilities across domains, facilitate downstream tasks via fine-tuning, and incentives point to their continued scaling. However, scale could also yield unforeseeable behaviors.</li><li>Historical and modern examples show computational leverage enables systems to surpass human expertise. Formal scaling laws now guide efficient allocation towards model scale over datasets.</li><li>A continuum of AI capabilities is proposed. Thresholds are identified where systems could surpass narrowly-defined through more general human capabilities over varying timespans.</li><li>Orthogonality notes intelligent systems can have any goals. Convergent instrumental goals like self-preservation suggest risks even from systems not specifically seeking harm.</li><li>Takeoff dynamics around the speed and continuity of transitions remain debated. Forecasts provide timelines for critical capabilities.</li><li>Addressing alignment, value specification, and cooperation around potentially transformative systems is essential.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
