It\u2019s possible that not enough students or recent graduates are aware of the reasons why this could be a good option for them, so I wanted to lay out my thoughts in this post. My central claim is that <strong>running an EA or cause area group at a top university can provide very useful career capital for individuals in the early stages of their careers.</strong></p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref2\">The specific work I\u2019m referring to is currently funded through <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/open-philanthropy-university-organizer-fellowship/\">Open Philanthropy\u2019s University Group Organiser Fellowship</a>. This usually involves running an Effective Altruism or cause area (e.g. AI Safety) group at a university. Open Philanthropy provides funding for organisers working at least 10 hours per week, though in this post I\u2019m mostly thinking of people doing this work full-time (or something close to that)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"n3l4hlbyp7\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn3l4hlbyp7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn3l4hlbyp7\">[1]</a></sup></span>. My understanding is that Open Philanthropy is willing to fund people at any university, though in this article I\u2019m mainly referring to community builders based at top-ranked universities<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"0f9dwjlt4p1b\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0f9dwjlt4p1b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0f9dwjlt4p1b\">[2]</a></sup></span>. Doing other local community building work (perhaps funded through CEA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/community-building-grants\">CBG program</a>&nbsp;or the <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community\">EA Infrastructure Fund</a>) could have many of the same benefits, but I know less about this.</p><p>If you want to do this work, you can<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/open-philanthropy-university-organizer-fellowship/\"><strong>apply to Open Philanthropy</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for funding. </strong>The Cambridge and Oxford EA groups are both interested in bringing on new community builders for the next academic year. I\u2019m also happy to talk to anyone considering working on university community building in the near future.</p><p>This post is mostly based on my personal experience working as a community builder at EA Oxford for the last few months, as well as some conversations with community builders at other universities. In this post, I\u2019ll mostly refer to EA community building, though I think most of what I say is equally applicable to running cause area groups (e.g. AI safety groups like <a href=\"https://haist.ai/\">HAIST</a>&nbsp;or existential risk groups like <a href=\"https://www.camxrisk.org/\">CERI</a>).</p><p>I have some concerns that my beliefs here are just a post-hoc justification for my own career decisions. Overall, I think that community building has been a good move for me, but I still recognise a lot of mistakes I\u2019ve made in getting to the point I am at now. An important caveat I want to make clear is that <strong>for </strong><i><strong>most</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;people, this is not the right career choice. However, I believe it can be a great choice for </strong><i><strong>some</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;people</strong>. I have some worries that this post will result in the wrong people counterfactually pursuing this path. I encourage any readers to think very carefully about what work to pursue.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/ijnhx5e6locy35zzaiqv\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/rfqu2j8aau8vwqbiaqos 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/bnsz6t4idsgdzdzqcqnz 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/uaotx4u7dguqpmwihkw5 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/ewxoshsfyduf2cjgatna 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/w1olnfpfsxhe3asm4mvc 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/m69t8mevywpjmzdxmwmd 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/pojwwaqpd5p0whzj3acx 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/bqz4octthsz0u5ruuctq 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/lieevpsmcpnpvvjlwk1o 1620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5kgqKQbczJQY2jSMB/sgw8bjhg9jmyenk7mfzr 1792w\" alt=\"A group of hikers\"><figcaption><i>Perhaps organising an EA group is like leading a hike. Perhaps your whole career is like a long hike. I like hikes and nice pictures.</i></figcaption></figure><h2 data-internal-id=\"What_do_you_gain_from_doing_community_building_professionally_\">What do you gain from doing community building professionally?</h2><h3 data-internal-id=\"1__The_opportunity_to_form_deeper_models_on_important_problems\">1. The opportunity to form deeper models on important problems</h3><p>A significant part of your job as a community builder involves engaging deeply with EA content both at an introductory and in-depth level. You are likely to be regularly reading, discussing or presenting important ideas from across the EA space. Facilitating multiple introductory fellowships has deepened my understanding of fundamental concepts \u2013 every cohort has been an opportunity to learn something new or take a fresh angle on a seemingly uncontroversial idea.</p><p>To some extent, you can also follow your own interests. For example, if you want to learn more about wild animal welfare, you can use your work hours to organise a wild animal welfare reading group. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/how-to-be-brilliant/201206/the-protege-effect\">The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Effect</a>&nbsp;suggests that one of the best ways to learn may be by teaching others. It can be surprising how often something useful for you as an individual is also valuable for the wider group. If you have something you want to learn or make progress on, somebody else in the community will likely also find that helpful. In particular, I\u2019m excited about promising early career people using this as an opportunity to think very carefully about what problems they should work on in the future.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"2__A_wide_variety_of_experience\">2. A variety of experience</h3><p>In many ways, being a group organiser is like running a small organisation or business. Most of the time only one or two people will be responsible for managing all necessary workflows.</p><p>Here are some things you might do while on a community building grant:</p><ul><li>Developing brand new programmes to support community members.</li><li>Running retreats, including all logistical planning and content design.</li><li>Running social media channels, writing social media and website content, and designing graphics.</li><li>Running 1-on-1 advising or coaching conversations.</li><li>Acting as a manager for teams of student volunteers.</li><li>Designing and delivering workshops or talks.</li><li>Doing research for reading groups or workshops.</li></ul><p>This gives you the chance to develop skills that can be incredibly useful for a range of generalist roles. Some skill areas you might develop that I think are quite widely applicable include:</p><ul><li>Operations management</li><li>People management</li><li>Marketing and outreach</li><li>Public speaking, presenting, and facilitation</li></ul><p>The scope of other entry-level roles is often more limited since very specific deliverables are required from you. As with learning, you can use your work to make progress on things that are important to you. If you want to develop your writing abilities, spend time making your newsletter awesome. Likewise, if you want to get better at public speaking, run more workshops.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"3__A_wide_network_within_EA\">3. A wide network within EA</h3><p>A byproduct of being a community builder is that you end up knowing a lot of people in the EA community.&nbsp;You\u2019ll spend a significant amount of time talking to and being around people who care about important problems. Part of your job is to know who\u2019s who in the community and be able to connect people who could benefit from knowing each other. You are likely to interact with professionals who are more senior to you, both within the EA community and perhaps adjacent fields as well. It\u2019s also worth noting that your work can often be highly visible \u2013 if you organise a great event, people get to know about it.</p><p>Your network is an important part of your career capital, and building a strong network early in your career can set you up in a great position to accelerate progress on your next steps. You could find collaborators or mentors, future employers or funders, as well as supportive friends. Regularly interacting with people who are more experienced in specific domains can also help you build better models of the world.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"4__Actual_impact_\">4. Actual impact!</h3><p>Community building, if done well, can have a lot of impact. Your work could counterfactually result in talented students pursuing high-impact work, which is a great outcome for the world. That said, I think people should be wary of optimising too much for impact early in their careers since <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/\">most of your impact is likely to come later in your career.</a>&nbsp;It often makes more sense to prioritise building career capital early on. However, community building can be an opportunity to do something impactful while <i>also </i>developing career capital.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Other_benefits\">Other benefits</h3><ul><li>Flexible and self-directed work.<ul><li>Community building comes with many of the usual perks of self-employment. You have the autonomy to work on whatever you think is most valuable. You can also (to some degree) set your own work hours and days off, with the main limiting factor being university term/semester dates. However, depending on your personality, this flexibility could end up being a downside (more on that later).</li></ul></li><li>It is (currently) well paid.<ul><li>University Group Organiser fellowship grant amounts are between $60,000 \u2013 $95,000&nbsp;(US), or \u00a335,800 \u2013 \u00a355,900 (UK), per year for non-undergraduates, which is on par with a lot of other competitive graduate jobs like consulting. Getting paid well can be good for building a financial runway which allows you time to explore your next steps or alternative paths.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 data-internal-id=\"What_skill_profile_is_good_for_community_building_\">What skill profile is good for community building?</h2><p>As with any role, community building won\u2019t be a good fit for many people. I\u2019ll mention some characteristics which I think are valuable for community building work, but I don\u2019t think all of these are necessary and lacking one or more shouldn\u2019t dissuade you.</p><ul><li>Being self-motivated \u2013 you are proactive and comfortable working without external accountability.</li><li>Strong interpersonal skills \u2013 you are comfortable spending lots of time talking to people and can create a positive social environment.</li><li>Conscientious and organised \u2013 you can manage multiple workflows and prioritise between tasks.</li><li>Good communicator, both written and verbal \u2013 you can explain complex ideas to both newer and more experienced audiences.</li></ul><p>If you led an EA group as a student, or have facilitated fellowships and reading groups, this is a decent signal you might possess some of these skills. If you want to know more about how to find out what you\u2019re good at, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/personal-strengths/\">this 80,000 Hours article</a>&nbsp;is quite helpful.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Why_might_community_building_not_be_the_right_career_move_for_you_\">Why might community building not be the right career move for you?</h2><ul><li>A lack of external support.<ul><li>By default, you don't have a manager. You have to set your own goals and metrics and keep track of projects yourself. There is usually no organisational structure to support you if you have any issues.</li><li>There are some ways to mitigate this \u2013 you should almost certainly assign yourself a manager or mentor, get support from peers, and potentially consider paying for a coach.</li></ul></li><li>You struggle with having to be social or interfacing with people a lot.<ul><li>Some community builders I know can find this work emotionally draining and the overlap of personal and professional life can sometimes be difficult to manage.</li></ul></li><li>Reputational risks.<ul><li>Especially for EA groups, your work is very tied to the reputation of the Effective Altruism brand. Despite some recent controversy, I believe the reputation of EA is still relatively good, though it\u2019s possible that this could change quickly.</li></ul></li><li>You need very specific career capital.<ul><li>Community building can be great for building general career capital, but if you need to build evidence of very specific skills or expertise (e.g. for certain technical roles), it likely isn\u2019t a good option.</li></ul></li><li>Community building work appears to have a fairly high rate of attrition and burnout.<ul><li>A few previous community builders I know have faced burnout or left their roles prematurely. There\u2019s a host of reasons why this may happen. I think this is unlikely to be something inherent to the work itself, but rather that the current support systems for community builders have flaws. I\u2019m also unsure how the prevalence of these problems compares to work in similar categories (eg. startups or PhDs).</li></ul></li></ul><h2 data-internal-id=\"What_are_some_next_steps_after_running_a_university_group_\">What are some next steps after running a university group?</h2><p>This is not a comprehensive list of all the things that university group organising might set you up for, but these are some things previous community builders have gone on to do:</p><ul><li>Working at other community building organisations like CEA or 80,000 Hours.</li><li>Founding a new impactful organisation, doing either meta or direct work&nbsp;(e.g. <a href=\"https://bluedot.org/\">BlueDot Impact</a>, <a href=\"https://futureimpact.group/\">Future Impact Group</a>).</li><li>Working in operations at an impactful organisation.</li><li>Policy careers.</li><li>Research (perhaps especially relevant for people running cause area groups).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I\u2019m excited for people to consider running university groups as a viable early career option.

We\u2019ll publish individual posts on our website and release a comprehensive report at the end of this series.</i></p><h2>What are disclosures and why do they matter?</h2><p>The public and regulators have legal rights to understand goods and services. For example, food products must have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/food-labelling-giving-food-information-to-consumers\"><u>clear nutritional labels</u></a>; medications must&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs/finding-and-learning-about-side-effects-adverse-reactions\"><u>disclose their side effects and contraindications</u></a>; and machinery must come with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0202&amp;from=EN\"><u>safety instructions</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of AI, these legally mandated disclosures can cover several topics, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Clearly labeling AI-generated content</strong>: This allows people to immediately recognize that the image (or text or audio etc) they\u2019re looking at was AI-generated. For example, the proposed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3831/text\"><u>AI Disclosure Act</u></a> would require all generative AI content to include the text \u201cDisclaimer: this output has been generated by artificial intelligence.\u201d</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking\"><strong><u>Watermarking</u></strong></a><strong> content generated by AI</strong>: This involves adding some detectable but not necessarily obvious mark. Watermarking has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking#Applications\"><u>several purposes</u></a>, for example letting us identify the provenance or source of AI-generated content.</li><li><strong>Disclosure of training data: Since models are trained on huge amounts of data, but this data isn\u2019t identifiable or reconstructable from the final model, some regulators require AI developers to disclose information about the data used to train models. For example, the EU AI Act requires AI developers to publicly disclose any copyrighted material used in their training data.</strong></li><li><strong>Notifying people that they\u2019re being processed by an AI</strong>: For example, if video footage is analyzed by an AI to identify people\u2019s age, the EU AI Act requires those people to be informed.</li></ul><h3>Labels and watermarks</h3><p>Labels and watermarks vary in design; some are subtle, some conspicuous; some easy to remove, some difficult. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2\"><u>Dall-E 2</u></a> images have 5 coloured squares in their bottom right corner, a conspicuous label that\u2019s easy to remove:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:42.26%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqGLDLjhKPJaZZp3p/cd2gldb1ebuoc7czfje3\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqGLDLjhKPJaZZp3p/qn7p55ztjjtmyhxw8a1n 153w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqGLDLjhKPJaZZp3p/zy9u5cftn7fk6hhpgqbm 233w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqGLDLjhKPJaZZp3p/auoajcumn7peyiynlapm 313w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqGLDLjhKPJaZZp3p/v7f4hcempmizw2xrnytq 393w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqGLDLjhKPJaZZp3p/s7qdgvjkr4gydhmi9uqo 473w\"></figure><p>However, Dall-E 3 will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8912793-c2pa-in-dall-e-3\"><u>add invisible watermarks</u></a> to generated images, which are much harder to remove.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05483\"><u>Watermarking techniques</u></a> are less visible than labels, and are evaluated on criteria such as perceptibility and robustness. A technique is considered&nbsp;<i>robust&nbsp;</i>if the resulting watermark resists both benign and malicious modifications;&nbsp;<i>semi-robust</i> if it resists benign modifications; and&nbsp;<i>fragile</i> if the watermark isn\u2019t detectable after any minor transformation. Note that fragile and semi-robust techniques are still useful, for example in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352664515000152\"><u>detecting tampering</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Imperceptible watermarking methods might embed a signal in the \u201cnoise\u201d of the image such that it isn\u2019t detectable to the human eye, and is difficult to fully remove, while still being clearly identifiable to a machine. This is part of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-steganography\"><u>steganography</u></a>, the field of \u201crepresenting information within another message or physical object\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering#Least_significant_bit_in_digital_steganography\"><u>Least Significant Bit</u></a> (LSB) technique adjusts unimportant bits in images or sound files to carry messages. For example, 73 represented in binary is 1001001. The leftmost \u201c1\u201d is the most significant bit, representing 2<sup>6</sup>, while the rightmost \u201c1\u201d just represents 1, meaning it can be adjusted to carry part of a message without much significant change. LSB is relatively fragile, while other techniques like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vocal.com/video/dct-transform-digital-watermarking/\"><u>Discrete Cosine Transform</u></a> (DCT) uses Fourier transforms to subtly adjust images at a more fundamental level, and thus is robust against attack techniques such as adding noise, compressing the image, or adding filters. Other popular techniques include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/982816\"><u>DWT</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/985560\"><u>SVD</u></a>, and there are open-source technical standards such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://c2pa.org/about/\"><u>C2PA</u></a> that have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8912793-c2pa-in-dall-e-3\"><u>adopted by organizations like OpenAI</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Text is harder to watermark subtly, as the information in text is far less noisy than in an image, for example. Watermarking can still be applied to metadata, and there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01496.pdf\"><u>techniques derived from steganography</u></a> that add hidden messages to text, though these can be disrupted and aren\u2019t under major consideration by legislators or AI labs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, all these labeling and watermarking techniques&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@techlatest.net/how-to-watermark-sign-in-ai-models-f751e1cc0447#:~:text=Watermarks%20are%20typically%20embedded%20by,architecture%20in%20a%20subtle%20way\"><u>can be embedded in the weights of generative AI models</u></a>, for example in a final layer of a neural network, meaning it is possible to have robust but invisible signals in AI-generated content that, if interpreted correctly, could be used to identify what particular model generated a piece of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Watermarking also involves tradeoffs between robustness and detectability; robust watermarking techniques alter the content more fundamentally, which is easier to detect. This means robustness can also trade-off against security, as more obscure and undetectable watermarking are be harder to extract information from, and thus more secure.

Developers must also label the data they use in training AI clearly, and disclose the users and user groups of their services.&nbsp;</p><h3>The EU</h3><p><strong>Article 52</strong> of the draft EU AI Act lists the&nbsp;<i>transparency obligations</i> for AI developers. These largely relate to AI systems \u201c<i>intended to directly interact with natural persons</i>\u201d, where natural persons are individual people (excluding&nbsp;<i>legal persons</i>, which can include businesses). For concision, I will just call these \u201cpublic-facing\u201d AIs. Notably, the following requirements have exemptions for AI used to detect, prevent, investigate, or prosecute crimes (assuming other laws and rights are observed).</p><ul><li><strong>Article 52.1:&nbsp;</strong>Requires developers to ensure users of public-facing AI are informed or obviously aware that they are interacting with an AI.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Article 52.1a</strong>: Requires AI-generated content to be watermarked (with an exemption for AI assisting in standard editing or which doesn\u2019t substantially alter input data).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Article 52.2:&nbsp;</strong>Requires developers of AI that recognizes emotions or categorizes biometric data (e.g. distinguishing children from adults in video footage) to inform the people being processed.</li><li><strong>Article 52.3:&nbsp;</strong>Requires deep fakes to be labeled as AI-generated (with a partial exemption for use in art, satire, etc, in which case developers can disclose the existence of the deep fake less intrusively). AI-generated text designed to inform on matters of public interest must disclose that it\u2019s AI-generated, unless the text undergoes human review, and someone takes editorial responsibility.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Article 52b</strong>: Requires developers of&nbsp;<i>general purpose AI with systemic risk</i> to notify the EU Commission within 2 weeks of meeting any of the following requirements defined in article 52a.1:&nbsp;</li><li>Possessing \u201chigh impact capabilities\u201d, as evaluated by appropriate technical tools.&nbsp;</li><li>By decision of the Commission, if they believe a general purpose AI has capabilities or impact equivalent to \u201chigh impact capabilities\u201d.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Article 52c</strong>: Requires providers of GPAI to make publish a summary of the content used for training the model, and 60f and 60k require developers to disclose any copyrighted material in their training data in their summary.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Convergence\u2019s Analysis</h2><p><strong>Mandatory labeling of AI-generated content is a lightweight but imperfect method to keep users informed and reduce the spread of misinformation and similar risks from generative AI.</strong></p><ul><li>Labeling AI-generated text, images, video, and so on is a simple way to make users clearly understand that content is AI-generated. Further, it\u2019s not expensive or complex to add labeling mechanisms to generative AI.</li><li>Labeling has extensive precedents in most legislations, such as food and medication labels.&nbsp;<ul><li>While compliance can be high for such mandatory labeling, there\u2019s variance in efficacy. For example, the World Health Organization&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/42682/9241545992.pdf\"><u>found that</u></a> inadequate labeling of medication plays a role in non-adherence to medication prescriptions, and some studies have found that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669859/\"><u>improving labeling improves health outcomes</u></a>.</li><li>Further, compliance can be low, especially when violations by smaller organizations or individuals aren\u2019t actively addressed.

This is especially important when generative AI is used to generate harmful content, such as misinformation, deep fake porn, or other provocative material, as models should be trained not to produce such content. Watermarking allows us to find and address the root of the problem and hold the developers legally accountable.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Labels and watermarks can be disrupted or removed by motivated users, especially in text generation</strong>.</p><ul><li>Labels and watermarking involve adding information to content, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/detecting-ai-fingerprints-a-guide-to-watermarking-and-beyond/\"><u>it is usually possible to manually (or even automatically) remove or disrupt this information</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>This means that it\u2019s unlikely any content platform could guarantee that AI-generated content is always clearly distinguishable to people.&nbsp;</li><li>Despite the potential fragility of labeling and watermarking, they can still be important aspects of a larger, layered strategy, making it more difficult to produce misinformation, or for AI developers to avoid accountability.<ul><li>In particular, societal education about AI will be a critical aspect of such a layered strategy.</li></ul></li><li>Research orgs such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15435.pdf\"><u>Meta</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/identifying-ai-generated-images-with-synthid/\"><u>DeepMind</u></a> are researching more advanced methods of watermarking during AI development.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Unclear definitions of what constitutes an application of AI will lead to inconsistent disclosure requirements and enforcement.</strong></p><ul><li>AI is becoming embedded in many creative tools, such as image-editing tools like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop/ai.html\"><u>Photoshop</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/unleashing-the-power-of-gimp-with-artificial-intelligence-518114\"><u>GIMP</u></a>.

We will do this in pairs to allow for direct feedback to improve those skills and make it less likely to fool yourself. Fill out this <a href=\"https://forms.gle/SCA2RhUzkjARCwv57\">Google Form</a> to register for the retreat.</p><h3>Aim of the Retreat</h3><p>Do you feel constrained in your ability to pursue your Effective Altruism goals effectively because anxiety is holding you back, you're struggling with procrastination, have recurring negative thoughts or other unhelpful behavior, and standard therapy or meditation doesn't seem to give you much progress?</p><p>These feelings, thoughts, or behaviors that are holding you back come from internal conflict. For example, you may wish you could apply for that job but also feel scared and don't like doing it. You can't both want to do and not want it simultaneously, so there is a conflict somewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, both perspectives, in this case, of wanting to apply for a job and feeling scared, have something useful to offer. Uncovering the true motivations behind these feelings and bringing this to our attention is important for resolving the internal conflict and integrating it into a coherent set of behaviors with which we are fully on board.</p><p>This retreat will give you the time and space to go much deeper than usual in investigating what is driving these internal conflicts. This can be a difficult process to master, so practicing it deliberately with a facilitator and other like-minded people who can give you direct feedback can make the learning of these skills much more effective.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Retreat content and methods we use</strong></h3><p>On this day, we focus on three popular methods to resolve these internal conflicts: Focusing, a Cognitive Behavior Therapy technique called the Downward arrow, and Internal Double Crux. Those techniques complement each other well and help us investigate our feelings, behavior, and beliefs from different angles and perspectives.&nbsp;</p><p>The first technique we will practice is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/KAv8z6oJCTxjR8vdR/p/f3o9ydY7iPjFF2fyk\">Focusing</a> (<a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/Focusing-Audiobook/B006GVPBY2\">audiobook</a>); this method helps you bring more clarity to something you're aware of on some level but isn't entirely clear what it is. For example, tensing up when someone specifically walks into a room, but you do not exactly know why you are tensing up. The second technique is a specific Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) method and a variant of the <a href=\"https://www.betweensessions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uncovering_Unhelpful_Core_Beliefs_Using_the_Downward_Arrow_Technique_083121_ad.pdf\">Downward arrow technique</a> explained in this <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/456PbL9Ik8VUKjz2FE2n39?si=7afe99215c8a422a\">podcast (start at 1:48:06)</a> to investigate whether your unconscious beliefs make sense. The third technique is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x2KrcscqgKDk6pMeD/internal-double-crux-1\">Internal Double Crux</a>, which investigates contradictory beliefs as contradictory beliefs can't both be true (by definition).</p><p>All these methods will be practiced in pairs. While most of these methods can be done alone, my experience is that they can be considerably more effective with another person as the listener. The methods seem relatively simple, but many pitfalls can prevent them from working effectively. I will explain them and help you make sense of the method during your practice time, as direct feedback while practicing the method is one of the core ways to learn a skill.&nbsp;</p><p>Towards the evening, we will do a breathwork session, which can be a powerful experience for many people to process the emotions we worked on during the rest of the day. This is optional and totally fine if you don't feel comfortable with it.</p><p>At the end of the day, we will do a sharing round and make an action plan for how you can best integrate these practices into your daily life to continue getting benefits out of them.</p><h3><strong>How do I participate?</strong></h3><ol><li>Fill out this <a href=\"https://forms.gle/SCA2RhUzkjARCwv57\">Google Form</a> to register for the retreat.</li><li>You can optionally book an intro call (see Google form for instructions). During this call, we can address any uncertainties, confusion, or questions you might have or point you to resources to help you get the most out of the retreat.</li></ol><h3><strong>Is this retreat suitable for me?</strong></h3><p>This retreat is suitable for you</p><ul><li>If you want to make progress on mental health issues that have been bugging you for a while, and you are unsatisfied with the things you have tried so far.</li><li>You want to go deeper than usual on some tricky mental health issues in a safe space with people who can support you.</li><li>If you are curious about learning more about the tools that can help make sense of your emotions and want a dedicated time and space to practice them.</li><li>If you want accountability to work on stuff bugging you but procrastinate on it.</li><li>If you have no experience with emotional processing or are already experienced, people at any stage of their mental health journey are welcome to join.</li></ul><p>This retreat might not be suitable if you have severe depression, severe anxiety disorder, or any other heavy mental health issue. In that case, this retreat might be too overwhelming, and seeking professional support might be more helpful.</p><p>Note that there will be a lot of sharing. I will create a safe and non-judgemental space where all sharing will be respected and optional, you don't have to share more than you want to but you might still feel uncomfortable.</p><p>If that's the case, or if you have any other uncertainties or doubts you'd like to discuss, don't hesitate to <a href=\"https://cal.com/raymondk/intro-call-week-retreat?duration=60\">book a call</a> with me or reach out on Meetup or in any other way.</p><h3><strong>Logistics and other essential things</strong></h3><ul><li>The event will take place in the EA Office in Amsterdam, arriving at 10:00, and the program starts at 10:30 and ends around 21:00. Open socializing until 22:00. The address is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/HNK+Amsterdam+Houthavens/@52.3901224,4.888974,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47c608331c306fbb:0x72a3449a43c1cbdd!8m2!3d52.3901224!4d4.888974!16s/g/11cjp7q6yw?entry=ttu\">HNK Houthavens 20-200 building, Van Diemenstraat 92, Amsterdam</a></li><li>I will provide a safe container and the structure &amp; guidance of the retreat. Bring anything you need yourself, including food, drinking bottles, meditation pillows, and yoga mats. We can use the yoga studio in addition to the office space; there are a few yoga mats. There is also a small kitchen, fridge with limited space, and microwave, but no cooking possibility, and the cafeteria is closed on the weekend. There are a few cafes and restaurants nearby, and ordering food is possible</li><li>Joining or leaving later or earlier during the breaks is possible, but the idea is that you join for the whole day. In case you do join or leave earlier/later, let me know</li><li>If something gets too much, you can always opt out of an exercise and take some quiet time yourself</li><li>The retreat might bring up some personal things. You do not have to share anything you don't want to share. If you decide to share something, the default policy will be not to share it further in a way that might identify the person who said it.</li><li>You are welcome to bring along anyone you would like, but they need to fill in the Google Form as well so I know who is coming.</li><li>Open socializing until 22:00 after the event is over</li><li>I will ask for a donation at the end via a QR code so other people don't know how much you donate. How much you donate is completely up to you, considering your current financial status, how much value it has brought to you, and how much you want to support me in organizing future events.</li></ul><h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3><p>This is an independently organized event (not an official EA Netherlands event) by me, Raymond Koopmanschap. I have been engaged in effective altruism for more than 5 years now. I have run several mental health-related workshops at the EA Summer camp and the LessWrong Community weekend, managed a four-day event for CFAR alums, and organized a day retreat like this in Amsterdam, which was well-received and excited me to organize another retreat.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that we will not dive into EA-specific content. The target audience is people who are already trying or want to bring EA into practice but experience psychological barriers to doing so.</p><h3><strong>Further reading and preparation for the retreat</strong></h3><p>The retreat is self-contained, and all necessary material to practice the techniques will be explained during the retreat.

If you're not familiar with this area of philosophy, see <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html\">Wait But Why's introduction</a>.</p><p>I think most people in EA circles subscribe to the computational theory of mind, which means that any computing device is able to instantiate a sentient being. (In the simplest case, by simply simulating a physical brain in sufficient detail.)</p><p>Computationalism does not, on its own, solve the identity problem. If two computers are running the exact same simulation of a person, is destroying one of them equivalent to killing a person, even though there's a backup? What about just turning it off, capable of being turned on later? These are moral questions, not factual ones, and intuitions differ.</p><p>Treating each simulation as its own separate moral patient runs into problems once the substrate is taken into account. Consider a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw\">2-dimensional water computer</a> that's instantiating a person, then <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0225/html?lang=en\">slice the computer in half lengthwise</a>, separating it into two separate sets of containers for the water. Does this create a second person, despite not changing the computation or even adding any water to the system? If two digital computers running the same computation can be two different people, then two water computers also must be. But this implies that it would be unethical to slice the computer in half and then pour out the water from one half of it, but it would not be unethical to pour out half the water from the original without any slicing, which doesn't make a lot of sense.</p><p>Some computationalists resolve this by saying that identity is the <i>uniqueness</i> of computation, and multiple identical simulations are morally equivalent to just one. But how is unique computation defined exactly? If one simulation adds A+B, storing the result in the register that originally held A, and another simulation does B+A, does that implementation difference alone make them entirely different people? Seems odd.</p><p>The natural resolution to these problems is to treat uniqueness as a spectrum; killing a sentient simulation is unethical in proportion to the amount it differs from the most similar other simulation running at the time.</p><h3>Common-sense morality</h3><p>Interestingly, we see ideologies reminiscent of this uniqueness-of-mind approach arise elsewhere too.</p><p>In mainstream environmentalism, a hawk killing a sparrow is not seen as a bad thing; it's just the natural order of things, and perhaps even interfering with it would be unethical. But hawks hunting all sparrows to extinction <i>would</i> be seen as a tragedy, and worthy of intervention.</p><p>That is, most people don't care very much about preserving individual animals, but they do care about preserving <i>types</i> of animal.</p><p>I don't think this is the same underlying philosophy as the computational one I described, since mainstream environmentalism cares more about how a species <i>looks</i> than about its mental activity. (A rare variant of flower that is a different color but is otherwise identical to the normal variant would be worth saving under normal environmentalism, but not really under computationalism.) But it's similar.</p><p>And the same sort of intuitions tend to persist when thought about more rigorously. Hedonistic utilitarians who want to tile the universe with hedonium are the exception; <a href=\"https://philosophybear.substack.com/p/the-view-from-utopia\">most people intrinsically value diversity of experience</a>, and see a large number of very similar lives as less of a good thing.</p><h3>Shrimp</h3><p>The shrimp brain has around 100,000 neurons, allowing for 2^100,000 distinct brain states if we ignore synapses and treat neurons as binary. That's a lot, but it seems unlikely that any significant fraction of those brain states are actually attainable through natural processes, and most of the ones that are reachable will be subjectively extremely similar to each other.</p><p>(Humans have about 86 billion neurons, but there obviously aren't 2^86 billion meaningfully different experiences a human could have.)</p><p>Shrimp welfare has focused on the absolute number of shrimp that are killed every year; about <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food\">500 billion in farms, and 25 trillion in the wild</a>. The logic being that even if shrimp only carry 0.1% of the moral worth of a bird or mammal, there are so many of them that it's still worth focusing on shrimp interventions.</p><p>But under diversity-valuing ethical theories, if we take a reasonable estimate of 10,000 meaningfully distinct shrimp minds at birth times 1 million possible external environmental inputs to those minds, that's only 10 billion distinct shrimp lived experiences. Most of those lives are simply duplicated a massive number of times, rendering all the duplicates morally irrelevant.</p><h3>Practical consequences</h3><p>This has significant impact on the effectiveness of welfare interventions. The existence of a finite number of distinct shrimp lives imposes a ceiling on the total moral value of the species, and means that simply multiplying by the number of physical shrimp bodies is invalid.</p><p>In particular, an intervention that improves quality of life in 10% of shrimp farms is not worth 10% as much as the same intervention applied to all farms; it's worth about 0, since ~all the negative utility shrimp lives that are averted in the affected farms are still instantiated in other farms.</p><p>It would therefore be better to pursue interventions that affect all farms worldwide, even if the magnitude of the improvement is much less than could be achieved by focusing on a specific farm. Global improvements may be able to actually eliminate every single shrimp body instantiating a particularly unpleasant life, whereas local interventions cannot. (Or interventions that focus on all farms within a subset that use particularly cruel methods.)</p><p>This also implies that wild shrimp welfare improvements are proportionately more impactful than those that focus on farmed shrimp. Farmed shrimp live extremely similar lives; it wouldn't surprise me if only a few million distinct experiences are possible in a farm, meaning that less than 0.01% of farmed shrimp are morally relevant. Wild shrimp live in a much more diverse environment, and probably have a larger percentage of individuals living distinct lives.</p><p>The diversity theory of moral value also opens up an entirely new avenue of welfare intervention: standardization. If shrimp farms can be made more homogenous, the number of distinct lives experienced by shrimp in those farms will decrease. If the number of distinct lives being lived decreases sufficiently, this could be a net moral positive even if the average life becomes worse.</p><p>In the ideal case, trillions of shrimp could be farmed in atomically-identical environments; enough to feed the world while yielding only the negative moral impact of torturing a single shrimp.</p><h3>Further research</h3><p>There are two main lines of investigation needed in order to be confident in these prescriptions, one philosophical and one empirical.</p><p>Firstly, we must work out whether computational theories of mind and diversity theories of identity are the values systems we actually want to follow. Torturing two identical human bodies does intuitively seem worse than torturing just one, so perhaps this is not the path humanity wants to go down. It will be difficult to square this intuition with the slicing problem, but perhaps it is doable. The <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/#ArgAgaCom\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> also contains some other objections to computational theories of mind.</p><p>I also glossed over some relevant details of the theory. In particular, temporal considerations. If simulating two bad lives at the same time is not worse than simulating one, then presumably simulating them in sequence is not worse than simulating them simultaneously. This would mean that there is no value in preventing bad experiences that have already been had in the past. Since trillions of shrimp have already been tortured and killed, further repetitions of identical lives are irrelevant, and our focus should be on preventing new types of bad lives from being brought into existence. In practice this probably translates into trying to prevent innovation in the shrimp farming sector, keeping everyone using the same technologies they've used in the past. But again, the idea that torturing a person for millions of years is perfectly ethical as long as they had already experienced the same torture in the past would perhaps raise a few eyebrows.</p><p>Secondly, we need to pin down the actual number of different mental experiences involved. My estimates above were complete guesses. If the actual number of distinct shrimp lives is just a few orders of magnitude higher, then the discussed ceiling effects become irrelevant, and standard interventions are still most effective. And if the true number is much lower, then we need to look into whether these ceiling effects may apply to chickens and other factory farmed animals as well.</p><p>There are potentially experiments to this effect that can be performed with existing technology. Behavior is a reasonable proxy for mental experiences, since the evolutionary purpose of mental experience is to produce behavior, so measuring the number of distinct shrimp behaviors in response to identical stimuli should allow us to estimate the number of different brain states among those shrimp without needing to intimately understand what those brain states <i>are</i>.</p><p>Chaos theory makes this challenging, as, for example, the different eddies of water that form as the shrimp swims could impact its behavior. But with a rigorous enough protocol and large enough sample size, it seems feasible to get meaningful results from something like this.</p>", "user": {"username": "Isaac King"}}, {"_id": "CB9Awq3FXBLP72Rtx", "title": "Do you have a duty to point out another's cognitive bias?", "postedAt": "2024-03-29T10:13:57.615Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Say, hypothetically, you have a coworker you work well with, but get in heated political arguments with as well.

I propose a collective, issue-agnostic observatory with a mix of algorithmic and human moderation for the purposes of aggregating information, <i>separate from advocacy</i> (i.e. \"what is happening\", not \"what should happen\").</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>There is a crisis of information happening right now. <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/\">500 hours of video</a> are uploaded to Youtube every minute. Extremely rapid news cycles, <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/empathy-fatigue-how-stress-and-trauma-can-take-a-toll-on-you\">empathy fatigue</a>, the emergence of a theorised and observed <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23920997/polycrisis-climate-pandemic-population-connectivity\">polycrisis</a>, and the general breakdown of traditional media institutions in favour of algorithms designed to keep you on-platform for as long as possible means that we receive more data than we have ever before, but are consequently more easily overwhelmed than ever before. The pace of research output has increased drastically while the pace of research intake (i.e. our reading speed) has not. The recent emergence of <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">AI technology </a>able to manufacture large amounts of spurious disinformation or \"<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4678265\">botshit</a>\" has added to this breakdown in information.</p><p>Any kind of corrective or preventative action to address global issues requires an accurate understanding of those issues first. John Green's video on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xk_SfS5UTVs?feature=shared&amp;t=116\">The Only Psychiatric Hospital in Sierra Leone</a> gives a powerful example why: charities with ample resources but incorrect information donated electrical generators that were <i>too powerful</i> for the hospital's electrical grid, <i>causing more harm than good</i>. In the same way, misguided, ill-informed, and over-aggressive \"assistance\" can be worse than no assistance at all.</p><h2>Why existing traditional information sources are insufficient</h2><p>Most of us likely rely on some form of news media for information on world events. They are updated around-the-clock by teams of dedicated staff who provide broad-based coverage on a wide variety of events. However, these sources are plagued by well-documented issues surrounding bias, censorship, misaligned economic incentives, billionaire owners etc. Furthermore, they are unlikely to feature a particular focus on cause areas that most EAs are concerned about.</p><h2>Why existing specialised information sources are insufficient</h2><p>Good work is currently being done by organisations like <a href=\"https://bluedot.org/\">BlueDot Impact</a> who work to collect information on cause areas like <a href=\"https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/\">AI Safety </a>and <a href=\"https://biosecurityfundamentals.com/\">Biosecurity</a>. However, these sources are also limited in specific ways that may be hard to discern at a first glance.</p><h3>Update delay</h3><p>Since these sources position themselves as authorities within their cause areas, they rightfully feature a delay before incorporating speculative announcements or new developments. However, in fast moving fields like AI safety developments are happening at a pace that exceeds the ability for expert review. As such, resources can quickly become outdated or incorrect without being updated as such.</p><h3>Topical focus</h3><p>Limited resources means that sites usually focus on one cause area or area of interest. As a result, information becomes fractured and siloed into specialist communities, and opportunities for inter-group interaction falls. This encourages readers to hyper-specialise into one field and may lead them to discount <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07836.pdf\">common systemic factors</a> that lead to heightened x-risk across many fields.</p><p>More broadly, having many such fractured information sources reduces the visibility of information as a whole by diluting the space of information sources, making it easier for vital resources to become lost in the noise. This results in information transmission being based on ad-hoc sharing rather than coordinated dissemination, reducing the efficiency of information spread.</p><h3>Cause advocacy</h3><p>The people designing resources for a cause area usually have preconceived notions about what should be done in that area. More importantly, they have usually come to these conclusions <i>before putting together these resources</i>. This can of course be helpful in setting priorities, but can also reduce the diversity of ideas in complex, fast moving fields.&nbsp;</p><p>Since researchers are likely put material they find useful and relevant into a resource for others, specialised resources (especially those which collate links to other resources) are likely to suffer from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a>. This narrows the possibility space for interventions by preventing readers from learning about interventions the authors may not find useful or productive. Furthermore, if small groups of similarly-opinionated experts create entry-level resources that are not subject to scrutiny, a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect\">anchor bias</a> is likely to take hold in the cause area community as a whole.</p><p>To be clear, <strong>I am not accusing Bluedot Impact or any other resource of intentional or unintentional bias</strong>. I am also not suggesting that these resources are counterproductive. However, the nature of specialised cause groups performing advocacy work is that they are likely to find information which agrees with their position more valuable. In a high risk world where many conclusions are often counterintuitive, putting all of our eggs in one basket, however well designed, is a dangerous risk.</p><h2>Why community forums are insufficient</h2><p>While forums like this one are a valuable resource to collect news, insights, and updates, they are diluted due to their multipurpose functions as discussion forums. The moderators of these forums do not have disseminating the news as their first priority, nor should it be. News collection, news presentation, and journalism are also specialised skillsets that are not easily replaced by AI bots or content algorithms.</p><h2>Proposed model: Joint algorithmic-human observatory</h2><p>The proposed model involves a separate website with two functions:</p><ol><li><strong>Crowdsourced information collection: </strong>Modelled on sites like <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> or Reddit, users should be able to submit links for other users and moderators to vote on. Unlike thoe sites, there will be no generic \"upvote\" or \"downvote\" button. Instead, users will tag content with a variety of emojis based on whether they feel it is relevant to a cause area, of general interest, fair and balanced etc. Comments will not be enabled except as user-submitted factual corrections (i.e. further points of clarification or points of information). Discussion is reserved for forums like the present forum. Ranking of links/comments will be based on the reddit algorithm, with a bias towards recent, broadly relevant, and high-quality content.</li><li><strong>Human information collection: </strong>A team of paid editors with subject matter expertise or journalism skills should be retained as staff to process both user submitted links and any news they themselves receive. This would function as a specialised newsroom producing weekly digests or long read articles that act as manual filters for the week's events. Access to such articles might be gated behind a subscription to recoup costs for running the site.</li></ol><p>Critically, this source of information is <strong>not an advocate for action</strong>. Only news or factual corrections are presented without calls to action. Cause advocacy organisations will <i>not </i>be able to submit op-eds or articles for publication at the observatory. This does not mean that the observatory is \"neutral\": global warming is real, but the observatory will not host a post about geoengineering being the answer.</p><h2>Potential counter-arguments</h2><h3>Possible biases</h3><p><strong>Counter-argument: </strong>The human moderators and editors of the observatory would hold a position of power through which to determine which sources of information are important and which are not. In effect, they would replicate the position of specialist authors collecting information for specialised resources. Even if the observatory has a position of non-advocacy, how information is presented affects how it is received. Something being described as a \"1-in-1000 moonshot\" is very different from something being described as \"a rapidly maturing technology\".</p><p><strong>Response:</strong> Biases are present in all sources of information. There is no such thing as a non-biased source, as even neutrality is a position on a subject-the position that all the parties involved are equally credible. The existence of the community submitted section should act as a counterbalance to the editorial team and hopefully alert them to developments that they have missed or erroneously dismissed as unimportant.</p><h3>\"Source of Truth\" risks</h3><p><strong>Counter-argument: </strong>Sources of truth refer to authoritative sources that other actors in a system refer to as verifiers to determine if their information is accurate. For example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module\">TPM</a> (Trusted Platform Module) in a computer is a tamper-resistant piece of hardware that certifies the computer's OS or hardware has not been compromised at boot time. Importantly, information only flows one way from sources of truth: the computer cannot change the TPM, otherwise, malware in the computer would be able to certify itself as safe.</p><p>As you can already imagine, any such authoritative source, if compromised, provides a massive security risk. If the TPM is compromised (scroll down to the \"Attacks\" section of the Wikipedia article), the computer has no way of correcting itself and will blindly trust the compromised TPM. Similarly, a single authoritative information source for a community can produce information gaps or the possibility of spreading misinformation to the community as a whole.</p><p><strong>Response: </strong>The observatory does not position itself as a single source of truth. Many other sources of truth exist and are used by the observatory as a link hub, reducing the likelihood that the observatory can be compromised to spread misinformation. Furthermore, users in this model would be able to submit corrections to the observatory which can be acted upon by the human staff.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope this idea is useful and sparks a fruitful discussion.

In the book, he describes the phenomenon with an example of his poker-playing friends:</p><p data-internal-id=\"_Liv_and_Igor_are_at_a_pub__and_Liv_bets_Igor_that_he_can_t_flip_and_catch_six_coasters_at_once_with_one_hand__If_he_succeeds__she_ll_give_him__3__if_he_fails__he_has_to_give_her__1__Suppose_Igor_thinks_there_s_a_fifty_fifty_chance_that_he_ll_succeed__If_so__then_it_s_worth_it_for_him_to_take_the_bet__the_upside_is_a_50_percent_chance_of__3__worth__1_50__the_downside_is_a_50_percent_chance_of_losing__1__worth_negative__0_50__Igor_makes_an_expected__1_by_taking_the_bet__1_50_minus__0_50__If_his_beliefs_about_his_own_chances_of_success_are_accurate__then_if_he_were_to_take_this_bet_over_and_over_again__on_average_he_d_make__1_each_time__\">\u201cLiv and Igor are at a pub, and Liv bets Igor that he can\u2019t flip and catch six coasters at once with one hand. If he succeeds, she\u2019ll give him \u00a33; if he fails, he has to give her \u00a31. Suppose Igor thinks there\u2019s a fifty-fifty chance that he\u2019ll succeed. If so, then it\u2019s worth it for him to take the bet: the upside is a 50 percent chance of \u00a33, worth \u00a31.50; the downside is a 50 percent chance of losing \u00a31, worth negative \u00a30.50. Igor makes an expected \u00a31 by taking the bet\u2014\u00a31.50 minus \u00a30.50. If his beliefs about his own chances of success are accurate, then if he were to take this bet over and over again, on average he\u2019d make \u00a31 each time.\u201d</p><p>More theoretically, he breaks expected value theory down into three components:</p><ol><li>Thinking in probabilities</li><li>Assigning values to outcomes (What economists call Utility Theory)</li><li>Taking a decision based on the expected value</li></ol><p data-internal-id=\"This_logic_served_EA_well_during_the_early_neartermist_days_of_the_movement__where_it_was_used_to_answer_questions_like___Should_the_marginal_dollar_be_used_to_buy_bednets_against_malaria_or_deworming_pills_to_improve_school_attendance___\">This logic served EA well during the early neartermist&nbsp;days of the movement, where it was used to answer questions like<i>: \u201cShould the marginal dollar be used to buy bednets against malaria or deworming pills to improve school attendance?\u201d.</i></p><h1 data-internal-id=\"The_Train_to_Crazy_Town\"><strong>The Train to Crazy Town</strong></h1><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref1\">Yet problems arise when such reasoning is followed into more extreme territory. For example, based on its consequentialist nature, EA-logic prescribes pulling the handle in the Trolley Problem<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"e03ozfuu3ee\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe03ozfuu3ee\"><sup><a href=\"#fne03ozfuu3ee\">[1]</a></sup></span>. However, many Effective Altruists (EAs) hesitate to follow this reasoning all the way to its logical conclusion. Consider for instance whether you are willing to take the following gamble: you're offered to press a button with a 51% chance of doubling the world's happiness but a 49% chance of ending it.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref2\">This problem, also known as Thomas Hurka's St Petersburg Paradox, highlights the following dilemma: Maximizing expected utility suggests you should press it, as it promises a net positive outcome. However, the issue arises when pressing the button multiple times. Despite each press theoretically maximizing utility, pressing the button over and over again will inevitably lead to destruction. Which highlights the conflict between utility maximization and the catastrophic risk of repeated gambles.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"ecacr3tvia\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefecacr3tvia\"><sup><a href=\"#fnecacr3tvia\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In simpler terms, the impact of repeated bets is concealed behind the EV. &nbsp;</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref9\">In EA-circles, following the theory to its logical extremes has become known as catching \u201cThe train to crazy town\u201d[<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"ycuvjetkvvo\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefycuvjetkvvo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnycuvjetkvvo\">[3]</a></sup></span>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"j8ez56mgp7e\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj8ez56mgp7e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj8ez56mgp7e\">[4]</a></sup></span>]. The core issue with this approach is that, while most people want to get off the train before crazy town, the consequentialist expected value framework does not allow one to get off. Or as Peter McLaughlin puts it: \u201c<i>The train might be an express service: once the doors close behind you, you can\u2019t get off until the end of the line\u201d</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"9bpfk6qdgak\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9bpfk6qdgak\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9bpfk6qdgak\">[5]</a></sup></span>.

On the one hand, the fanaticism camp preaches consistency within the consequentialist-expected value theory framework. They are, therefore, willing to bite all bullets on the way to crazy town. Philosophical leaders like Toby Ord and William MacAskill are part of this camp. When pressed on this issue by Tyler Cowen, MacAskill urges us to try harder with our moral reasoning:</p><p data-internal-id=\"Cowen___Your_response_sounds_very_ad_hoc_to_me__Why_not_just_say__in_matters_of_the_very_large__utilitarian_kinds_of_moral_reasoning_just_don_t_apply__They_re_always_embedded_in_some_degree_of_partiality__\">Cowen: <i>\u201cYour response sounds very ad hoc to me.

In this manner, the pluralist view urges us to not solely rely on utilitarian calculations of maximizing happiness or reducing suffering.&nbsp;This allows one to not follow utilitarianism to its logical extremes but, by doing so, undermines the moral philosophy on which it is built. To stick with the analogy, this allows one to get off the train to crazy town at the expense of derailing the EA train.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PnW7RAZjCwfsfiExz/ssaj2wqzojkerzajtd2v\"></p><p>But what if there is a way to - at least partially - reconcile these two perspectives?

To understand how this works, we must take a look at Ole Peter\u2019s work. Ole Peters<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"13\" data-footnote-id=\"y7a5icxhpk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy7a5icxhpk\"><sup><a href=\"#fny7a5icxhpk\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;is a physicist at the London Mathematical Laboratory who started the field of Ergodicity Economics.</p><h1><strong>Ergodicity view: Additive versus multiplicative games</strong></h1><p>Ole Peters points out that many economic models assume our world is ergodic\u2014that is, they assume looking at an average outcome over time or across many people can tell us what to expect from an individual. If a process is ergodic, the average over time will be the same as the ensemble average, an average over multiple systems. A simple example in which this is the case is the following: When one person plays head-or-tails 1000 times, and when 1000 people play once, both situations are expected to hit heads 500 times. Just like the expected value theory would suggest. But real life, especially long-term population ethics, often doesn't work that way.</p><p data-internal-id=\"For_example__consider_playing_a_game_where_you_flip_a_coin__and_if_it_s_heads__you_increase_your_wealth_by_50___but_if_it_s_tails__you_lose_40___Mathematically__the_average_outcome_looks_positive__But__if_you_play_this_game_repeatedly__because_of_the_multiplicative_nature_of_wealth__losing_40__can_t_just_be__averaged_out__by_gaining_50__later___you_re_likely_to_end_up_with_less_money_over_time__This_game_is_non_ergodic___the_long_term_outcome_for_an_individual_doesn_t_match_the_seemingly_positive_average_outcome_\">For example, consider playing a game where you flip a coin, and if it's heads, you increase your wealth by 50%, but if it's tails, you lose 40%. Mathematically, the average outcome looks positive. But, if you play this game repeatedly, because of the multiplicative nature of wealth (losing 40% can't just be \"averaged out\" by gaining 50% later), you're likely to end up with less money over time. This game is non-ergodic - the long-term outcome for an individual doesn't match the seemingly positive average outcome.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref15\">The attentive reader will have realised the similarities between the aforementioned St Petersburg paradox and this gambling problem. In both cases, one following the expected value theory would take the bet. Yet, playing repeatedly results in losing money over time<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"14\" data-footnote-id=\"nuu6tajgvi\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnuu6tajgvi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnuu6tajgvi\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;or the destruction of the world<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"15\" data-footnote-id=\"zq3guocwwia\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzq3guocwwia\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzq3guocwwia\">[15]</a></sup></span>. It is like someone playing Russian roulette on repeat. There are two factors at play here that create this dynamic. First, due to its multiplicative nature, all the wealth of a person is at stake at once instead of only a part of it, as in the example of MacAskill\u2019s poker friends. The second dynamic is repetitiveness. It is correct that, a single flip of the coin does yield a positive expected value. Yet, a consequentialist caring about one\u2019s wealth at the end of the 1000 periods would decide not to play.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref15\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PnW7RAZjCwfsfiExz/w8wrqkjafqigaocycqgb\"></p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref18\">The dynamics at play in Ergodicity Economics seem counterintuitive at first, especially for economists and EAs who have become hardwired to think in terms of Utility Theory and Expected Value Theory, respectively.

Let\u2019s modify the St. Petersburg Paradox to the one that Cowen puts in front of MacAskill: <i>\u201cyou're offered to press a button with a 90% chance of doubling the world's happiness but a 10% chance of ending it. But, we play 200 times\u201d</i>. Below one can see the amount of worlds still existing after the amount of rounds played, simulated for 500 worlds.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PnW7RAZjCwfsfiExz/b61qk4wwhh33debcxarq\"></figure><p><i>This figure shows the number of worlds that still exist in a total of 500 simulations of the Tyler Cowen St. Petersburg Paradox. The last world dies after 59 rounds in this simulation. &nbsp;</i></p><p>MacAskill struggles with the paradox and, when put on the spot during the interview, jumps to moral pluralism as a solution. Yet, it is possible to answer these questions from within a consequentialist framework when taking Ergodicity seriously.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref25\">It is true that the total happiness in round 59, the last round in which a world exists, is <img> times as high as in the initial state, which in a consequentialist framework, would outweigh the loss of 499 worlds. However, every consequentialist asked to evaluate whether to take the gamble for 200 consecutive rounds would not take the bet. These dynamics are caused by certain absorption barriers from which one cannot recover<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"25\" data-footnote-id=\"3ns9sqt72z8\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3ns9sqt72z8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3ns9sqt72z8\">[25]</a></sup></span>. They are characterized by the system's eventual transition into one of these absorbing states, regardless of the initial state, thus capturing long-term behaviours and outcomes. Ruin games are therefore a special case of ergodicity. Not only do ruin games have a different time average than the ensemble average, but their end state also creates a point of no return.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref26\">My argument to this point can be summarised as; Expected value theory misrepresents ruin games and obscures the dynamics of repetitions in a multiplicative environment. Or, as Nassim Taleb\u2019s<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"26\" data-footnote-id=\"e0uskxgspm9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe0uskxgspm9\"><sup><a href=\"#fne0uskxgspm9\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;states it: <i>\u201c[S]equence matters and ruin problems don\u2019t allow for cost-benefit analysis.\u201d</i>. &nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Non-ergodicity for EA: a framework</strong></h1><p>So, instead of <i>a priori</i>&nbsp;assuming that one can follow the expected value theory. One should first ask the question: What game are we playing? Or, which dynamics are in play?</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref27\">MacAskill can be forgiven for not being aware of the implicit ergodicity assumption in expected value theory when writing the book. The first paper by Peters and Nobel laureate Gell-Man was only written in 2016<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"27\" data-footnote-id=\"r7vpgonu6d\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr7vpgonu6d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr7vpgonu6d\">[27]</a></sup></span>, and Ergodicity Economics still forms a niche within the discourse. Yet, ergodicity should be intuitively appealing to EA as it is a mathematical concept. &nbsp;</p><p>In a sense, it is not consequentialist reasoning that breaks down in this particular extreme. What breaks down is the implicit assumption of ergodicity within expected value theory. In other words, the core issue is its failure to consider time, which is exposed in the limit. Therefore, it is not consequentialism that breaks down in the extreme, it is the Utility Framework.</p><p>From a purely philosophical perspective, the singular instance remains a challenge for utilitarianism. Yet, the ergodicity perspective provides a clear stop on our way to crazy town in the case of repeated multiplicative dynamics. The figure below provides a flowchart of when expected value theory suffices and when an ergodicity framework is necessary.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PnW7RAZjCwfsfiExz/vypoouh4vzzimqzvcbvr\"></p><p><i>Figure: A new consequentialist framework for how to \u2018Think in Bets\u2019 depending on the dynamics at play.</i></p><h1><strong>Some implications</strong></h1><p>Taking ergodicity seriously can strengthen the EA longtermist movement both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. First, it allows for a resolution of the St Petersburg Paradox and similar thought experiments. It does so by incorporating the importance of compounding sequence effects and ruin states in the consequentialist framework. For EAs, this allows for a stop on the train to crazy town within the consequentialist framework, at least in the case of St. Petersburg-like paradoxes.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref28\">As a consequence, in a repeating multiplicative environment, the ergodicity framework allows one to consider sequence effects. By doing so, it allows one to reject risky \u2018positive expected utility bets\u2019 from within the consequentialist framework. This holds as long as these bets are expected to be multiplicative. To illustrate this point, let\u2019s look at the example Hayley Clatterbuck gave during the EAG Bay Area conference last month<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"28\" data-footnote-id=\"p4ys103gciq\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp4ys103gciq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp4ys103gciq\">[28]</a></sup></span>.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref28\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PnW7RAZjCwfsfiExz/ejolxipabtmqxcgn0von\"></p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref29\">The highest EV intervention given here is \u2018virus hunting\u2019, which involves having labs research and create viruses that could produce the next extinction-level pandemic. The EV of this intervention could be high if we find these viruses ahead of time and are able to develop vaccines upfront. Yet, when the virus breaks out of the lab\u2014a backfire event\u2014 the outcomes would be devastating. Let\u2019s now assume that EA grantmakers double down on this X-risk intervention over the upcoming years, because it has the highest EV. Since this is a nascent field, the effect that the marginal lab will have is proportional to the current level of biosecurity risk. In other words, since the field has not hit its limits to growth, multiplicative dynamics are in play. In this scenario, the average over time will be different than its ensemble average, so non-ergodicity is in play. Additionally, depending on the values given to the different probabilities<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"29\" data-footnote-id=\"iznr462wnm\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiznr462wnm\"><sup><a href=\"#fniznr462wnm\">[29]</a></sup></span>, X-risk might increase. This can be true even for high EV scores. Thus, a grantmaker who repeatedly makes decisions on interventions to reduce X-risk based on EV scores could inadvertently increase X-risk. All while he is trying to save the world. &nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the prior argument requires many assumptions. Given this, my point is not to argue that all the assumptions above are true. It is to show that the ergodicity framework elicits the assumptions obscured in the EV framework. Additionally, it allows one to reject discounting and risk aversion, core longtermist and consequentialist positions, and still decide not to take <i>\u2018risky positive expected utility bets\u2019</i>.</p><p>Let\u2019s also be clear about what I do not attempt with this post. This post does not provide an answer to the repugnant conclusion or other thought experiments on the train to crazy town. Thus, it is not an all-encompassing solution to the controversial consequences of consequentialism. It is only a first attempt at being more ambitious with our moral reasoning, as MacAskill called for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"e03ozfuu3ee\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fne03ozfuu3ee\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"e03ozfuu3ee\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefe03ozfuu3ee\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27902416\">KILLING, LETTING DIE, AND THE TROLLEY PROBLEM</a>&nbsp;The trolley problem is a thought experiment where you must decide between taking action to divert a runaway trolley onto a track where it will kill one person, or doing nothing and allowing it to continue on its current path, killing five.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"ecacr3tvia\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnecacr3tvia\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"ecacr3tvia\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefecacr3tvia\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2380627\">Value and Population Size* - Thomas Hurka</a>&nbsp;Thomas Hurka (1983) <i>Value and Population size.</i></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"ycuvjetkvvo\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnycuvjetkvvo\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"ycuvjetkvvo\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefycuvjetkvvo\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.samstack.io/p/the-train-to-crazy-town\">The train to Crazy Town - by Sam Atis - Samstack</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"j8ez56mgp7e\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnj8ez56mgp7e\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"j8ez56mgp7e\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefj8ez56mgp7e\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ajeya-cotra-worldview-diversification/\">Ajeya Cotra on worldview diversification and how big the future could be - 80,000 Hours</a>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"9bpfk6qdgak\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9bpfk6qdgak\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"9bpfk6qdgak\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9bpfk6qdgak\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8wWYmHsnqPvQEnapu/getting-on-a-different-train-can-effective-altruism-avoid\"><i>Getting on a different train: can Effective Altruism avoid collapsing into absurdity?

The goal is to accelerate industry adoption of this more humane stunning method ahead of expected buyer demands and regulations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why is it impactful? </strong>Scientific literature establishes shrimp sentience. In addition, consumer demand for higher welfare standards is increasing globally. Electrical stunning is also recognised as the most humane pre-slaughter method currently available for shrimps. It renders shrimp unconscious faster and more effectively than ice slurry immersion or asphyxia. Leading retailers like M&amp;S and John Lewis Partnership have already committed to using electrical stunning, setting the stage for industry-wide adoption.<br><strong>What will you find on the page?</strong> This page serves as your go-to resource for our initiative, offering an in-depth overview, a breakdown of how Ace Aquatec and Optimar equipment function, and a summary of the eligibility requirements.

I think it exemplifies the profoundly weird way people think about experiments.</p><p>The article says:</p><blockquote><p>In 2018, an RCT run by two development economists, in partnership with the World Bank and the water authority in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital, tracked what happened when water supply was cut off to households in several slum settlements where bills hadn\u2019t been paid. Researchers wanted to test whether landlords, who are responsible for settling the accounts, would become more likely to pay as a result, and whether residents would protest.<br><br>Hundreds of residents in slum settlements in Nairobi were left without access to clean water, in some cases for weeks or months; virtually none of them knew that they were part of an RCT. The study caused outrage among local activists and international researchers. The criticisms were twofold: first, that the researchers did not obtain explicit consent from participants for their involvement (they said that the landlord\u2019s contracts with the water company allowed for the cut-offs); and secondly, that interventions are supposed to be beneficial. The economists involved published an ethical statement defending the trial. Their research did not make the cut-offs more likely, they explained, because they were a standard part of the water authority\u2019s enforcement arsenal (though they acknowledged that disconnections in slums had previously been \u201cad hoc\u201d). The statement did little to placate the critics.</p></blockquote><p>You know what <i>didn\u2019t</i> get an article in The Economist? All the times that slum dwellers in Nairobi were left without access to clean water for weeks or months <i>without anyone studying them</i>.</p><p>By the revealed preferences of local activists, international researchers, and The Economist, the problem isn\u2019t that people are going without clean water, or that the water authority is shutting off people\u2019s water\u2014those things have been going on for decades without more than muted complaining. The ethical problem is that someone is checking whether this unthinkably vast amount of human suffering is actually accomplishing anything.</p><p>The water authority is presumably not shutting off people\u2019s water recreationally: it\u2019s shutting off people\u2019s water because they think it will get them to pay their water bills. Therefore, the possible effects of this study are:</p><p>The water authority continues to do the same thing it was doing all along.</p><p>The water authority learns that shutting off water doesn\u2019t get people to pay their bills, so it stops shutting off people\u2019s water, and they have enough to drink.</p><p>If you step back from your instinctive ick reaction, you\u2019ll notice that this study may well improve water access for slum dwellers in Nairobi, and certainly isn\u2019t going to make it any worse. But people are still outraged because, I don\u2019t know, they have a strongly felt moral opposition to random number generators.</p><p>I really don\u2019t understand the revulsion people feel about experimenting on humans. It\u2019s true that many scientists have done great evil in the name of science: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study\"><u>the Tuskegee syphilis experiment</u></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra\"><u>MKUltra</u></a>, Nazi human experimentation, the Imperial Japanese Unit 731.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"rbwj6yz8jqp\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrbwj6yz8jqp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrbwj6yz8jqp\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But the problem isn\u2019t the experiments. It\u2019s not somehow okay to deny people treatment for deadly diseases, force them to take drugs, or torture them<i> if you happen to not write anything down about it.</i></p><p>If it\u2019s fine to do something, then it\u2019s fine to randomly assign people to two groups, only do it to half of them, and then compare the results. We should, of course, be mindful of how the greater good and the thirst for knowledge can tempt scientists to commit atrocities. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we should go \u201cah! I see that you\u2019re bothering to check whether the thing you\u2019re doing works! You have opted in to Special Ethics and now you can\u2019t cross the street unless you have signed consents from the drivers and have shown that your street-crossing benefits them.\u201d</p><p>One of the people quoted in the article goes beyond questioning experimental ethics to questioning the concept of followup studies:</p><blockquote><p>The children of the original recipients are now themselves research subjects: Miguel and several other colleagues are currently collecting data which will assess whether the health and developmental consequences of rcts might be passed down the generations. This lengthy duration is a virtue, Miguel believes: \u201cA lot of the value in the research is in the longitudinal data set.\u201d<br><br>Yet other researchers have questioned the ethics of continuous data collection in general. \u201cWhen does the cycle of collecting data stop?\u201d asked Joel Mumo from the Busara Centre. \u201cWhat\u2019s enough? How do you justify experimenting on people over and over again?\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Well, you see, I justify experimenting on people over and over again, because sometimes our actions have consequences long in the future, and it\u2019s good to know what those consequences are. It stops when the experimenters no longer think they\u2019re collecting useful information, when they can\u2019t find people to fund the studies, or when they\u2019ve lost enough of the participants to attrition that they can no longer meaningfully generalize about the whole sample.</p><p>Part of the reason The Economist is comfortable with absurdly high standards of behavior for experimenters is that they\u2019re skeptical that we need experiments at all, and can\u2019t just go on vibes:</p><blockquote><p>The randomistas have a tendency to operate as if they have little prior knowledge about how the world works. But for Duflo, experiments are the only way to challenge assumptions. \u201cOften one\u2019s intuitions are incorrect,\u201d she said. But do you really need an experiment to tell you whether pillows and blankets will help children fall asleep, or whether access to clean water will improve health?</p><p>It\u2019s as if \u201cthere was no source of knowledge ever, except for RCTs,\u201d said Lant Pritchett, a development economist. He pointed to a paper that used an RCT to conclude, in part, that girls in Afghanistan were more likely to go to community school when there was one in their village. (\u201cI am not shitting you,\u201d he said.)</p></blockquote><p>Look at this chart of the cost-effectiveness of various developing-world educational interventions:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oeTHdxe8zkM558RWa/v8rkhrvtahhy9ejaymmh\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oeTHdxe8zkM558RWa/voiqzh0zsnxgp01k7rh9 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oeTHdxe8zkM558RWa/p7vagdg5jurkzkuha8b8 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oeTHdxe8zkM558RWa/o090mmqej0aqjplyr6mp 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oeTHdxe8zkM558RWa/v8rkhrvtahhy9ejaymmh 1456w\"><figcaption>From the <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-interventions-deliver-most-quality-years-education-and-what-price\"><u>Center for Global Development</u></a>. A LAYS is a Learning-Adjusted Year of Schooling.</figcaption></figure><p>Better incentives for teachers and structured lesson plans both seem, intuitively, like they\u2019d improve education\u2014and they do. It turns out that structured lesson plans are about 150% more effective than better incentives. Would you have been able to guess that ahead of time?</p><p>The purpose of an RCT about clean water or school access isn\u2019t necessarily to establish whether there\u2019s an effect at all: it\u2019s to establish how <i>big</i> the effect is. If you run the health department or the department of education for a developing country\u2014one that doesn\u2019t have a lot of resources\u2014it\u2019s important to know not only what works but also what will let you squeeze the most health or education out of your limited budget. Afghanistan doesn\u2019t exactly have a lot of money.</p><p>But even that\u2019s giving the Economist too much credit. Intuitively, it seems like teacher training and new textbooks would improve children\u2019s education. I can imagine Lant Pritchett going \u201cI am not shitting you\u201d about a study of whether textbooks improve learning outcomes. But it turns out the effects are indistinguishable from zero.</p><p>Similarly, it could be true that girls in certain countries aren\u2019t meaningfully more likely to go to school if there\u2019s one in their village\u2014for example, if girls being educated is extremely stigmatized, or if families need girls to work to support the family. Even if girls are much more likely to go to school if there\u2019s a school in their village, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they learn anything. And even if they learn more, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they earn more money, have more ability to control their lives, or otherwise benefit. We need to check.</p><p>As my dad used to say, when you assume you make an ass out of you and me.</p><p>In fact, some of the purported harm of RCTs is actually a reason we need to do RCTs:</p><blockquote><p>Cash-transfer studies can be especially divisive. \u201cSome of the men married a second wife, some homes broke apart, some wives left their husbands,\u201d said Andrew Wabwire, a field manager for REMIT, a research company. As with Okela-C, rumours have spread that the money is cursed \u2013&nbsp;that people would turn into snakes if they accepted it.</p></blockquote><p>You know, I would not have predicted \u201crecipients believe money will turn you into snakes\u201d as a potential outcome of cash transfers? Isn\u2019t it great that someone is following up with recipients to ask about these things?</p><p>And we don\u2019t have to rely on anecdotes from Andrew Wabwire, because we\u2019ve done randomized controlled trials. In spite of the divorces and polygamous marriages, cash transfers have <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01252-z\"><u>a small but significant positive effect on wellbeing and mental health among recipients</u></a>.

Even Kremer\u2019s and Miguel\u2019s deworming project, which is considered one of the most successful RCTs to date, may have done little to augment overall student success. \u201cDeworming is trivial as compared with practical educational improvement,\u201d said Pritchett. (Miguel said this view is a caricature of RCTs that minimises their insight when aggregated.)</p></blockquote><p>As far as I can tell, the deworming project being \u201cone of the most successful RCTs to date\u201d is just wrong. There is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9031909/worm-wars-explained\"><u>widespread disagreement</u></a> about what we can conclude about deworming from the available evidence, with many respected academics saying that deworming has no effect on education at all. Many RCTs show a much larger effect.</p><p>Improving education\u2014in the developing or the developed world\u2014is really really hard. Lots of programs that seem like they ought to work don\u2019t. (<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-1-2-billion-afterschool-program-that-doesnt-work/\"><u>For example</u></a>.) There are a number of promising programs, such as <a href=\"https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/teaching-right-level-improve-learning\"><u>Teaching At The Right Level</u></a>, in which students are taught based on what they already know instead of having a bunch of illiterate children stare blankly at the blackboard while the teacher tries to get them to read the Ramayana. These programs have generally been identified <i>through randomized controlled trials</i>.</p><p>Some policymakers don\u2019t like randomized controlled trials:</p><blockquote><p>Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, told me that during his time in office, rcts did not figure into his calculations. \u201cThey were never meant to analyse big macroeconomic questions \u2013 they\u2019re about small, microeconomic interventions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability of RCTs to answer any of these big questions is close to zero.\u201d The rise of RCTs, in his view, is due to the influence of a \u201cvery incestuous club of prominent academics, philanthropy and mostly weak governments. That\u2019s why you will see RCTs used disproportionately in sub-Saharan African contexts, where\u2026state capacity is weak.\u201d<br><br>Gulzar Natarajan, a leading Indian development economist who is currently secretary of finance for the state of Andhra Pradesh, has argued that RCTs merely provide \u201cstandalone technical fixes\u201d that do not work in practice. When it comes to implementation across entire countries, the same features that initially seemed appealing about RCTs begin to look like failures. \u201cThe state\u2019s capacity to administer and monitor, masked by the small size and presence of energetic research assistants in the field experiment, gets exposed. Logic gets torn apart when faced with practical challenges,\u201d he argues. (Duflo points out that jpal has a long-term partnership with Tamil Nadu, an Indian state, to make policy out of findings from RCTs.)</p></blockquote><p>Maybe Subramanian and Natarajan should talk to each other. Is it that RCTs are only useful when a government lacks state capacity, or is it that you can\u2019t scale up RCTs because the government is too bad at administering and monitoring things?</p><p>It\u2019s true that RCTs are sharply limited in what questions they can answer: you can\u2019t randomly assign half of all countries to one central bank policy and one to another. But there are a number of questions that governments face\u2014health, education, infrastructure\u2014that RCTs do answer. I agree it\u2019s weird that RCTs are so associated with economists and mostly do well answering questions that aren\u2019t traditionally economic; such are the consequences of economists being the only social scientists who are mathematically literate. That doesn\u2019t mean that health, education, or infrastructure are somehow unimportant.</p><p>And it\u2019s true that RCTs are often hard to turn into policy programs. If you scroll up to the chart I posted, you\u2019ll see that \u201cgiving information on education costs, benefits, and quality\u201d has <i>widely</i> variable cost effectiveness. This is because it only works if parents are ignorant about the benefits of education. In places where parents already know that education is important, it does no good. As a policymaker, you have to understand not only <i>what</i> the RCT found but <i>why</i> it found that. And any program is more difficult to implement for everyone in a country than it is for a small number of people in a study. New challenges arise. Compromises have to be made for the sake of political expediency. You don\u2019t have researchers checking up that the teachers are in fact Teaching At The Right Level and haven\u2019t gone back to teaching the grade-level curriculum.</p><p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that empiricism is valueless. As a policymaker, you may not be able to straightforwardly implement Teaching At The Right Level as it was implemented in the RCT. But you know to ask \u201care our teachers teaching grade-level material even though our students are near-universally below grade level and have no hope of understanding it?\u201d You have a toolkit of things that worked on the small scale, such as hiring tutors that specialize in teaching below-grade-level material. Regardless of whether an RCT has been conducted, you\u2019d have to adjust things for your own context and capacities. But RCTs are your best chance of knowing whether it ever worked for anyone at all.</p><p>I\u2019ve been quite critical of this article, but there is one thing in it I find troubling:</p><blockquote><p>Officially, all researchers are required to secure informed consent from their subjects. But that doesn\u2019t mean a subject understands what exactly they are signing up for, that they are presented with the option to decline or that the trial might go on for an indefinite period of time. \u201cPeople are constantly trying to work out, \u2018What is the value exchange that is going on here?\u2019\u201d said Kingori. \u201cThey understand that some extraction is taking place, but they can\u2019t quite work out what the value is.\u201d</p><p>Virtually every field worker I spoke to told me stories of locals demanding to know why they were placed in the control group, challenging the randomisation techniques or refusing to speak to the researchers who return to their villages year after year. Eric Ochieng, a research manager based at the Busia office of IPA, told me that he had been approached on the street by subjects asking why they were given nothing when others received electricity or cash. Others don\u2019t understand why, despite opting to participate in several trials, they always seem to end up in the control group. \u201cSometimes they come and ask, \u2018What is it with my name that the computer never selects me?\u2019\u201d Many remain doubtful that participants are truly selected at random. One group of recipients was so suspicious that they asked researchers to draw names out of a hat in public\u2026<br><br>Magero told me that in the 16 years she has worked on RCTs, she had only ever encountered one man, a \u201clearned man\u201d, who actually understood how the studies work. \u201cThere is something good that comes out of this research, it\u2019s just that some people can\u2019t really understand,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just want [to see the] direct benefit to them, they don\u2019t want the communal benefit that is coming.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>For many reasons, it\u2019s not realistic to hold off on RCTs in the developing world until the respondents can correctly explain why studies need a control group. (<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/03/28/what-americans-know-about-science/\"><u>Only 60% of Americans have this concept down</u></a>.) But I do think the respondents\u2019 informed consent isn\u2019t especially, well, informed.</p><p>Development economists should consider more carefully how to do right by their respondents. Instead of applying ethical standards developed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WEIRDest_People_in_the_World\"><u>WEIRD</u></a> people as if they make sense in every country, we should develop appropriate standards for different groups. How can we explain what the study is for in a way that actually makes sense to the respondents? Can we randomize in a way verifiable by respondents (I love the hat idea)? Can we do a phased rollout of a program instead of denying it to half the participants, and if we do how do we explain what a \u201cphased rollout\u201d is? Does it even make sense to try to explain randomization, or does it just make participants confused and upset? Maybe in a particular country \u201cwe\u2019re trying to learn about your health\u201d will actually give respondents a more accurate understanding of what\u2019s going on than trying to explain what an RCT is. Can we pay people an amount of money or goods that makes responding to surveys feel fair to them, even if they don\u2019t get to take advantage of the program?</p><p>I think it would be well worth running focus groups to try to figure out best practices for conducting studies in a particular context.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"wegpduvnypm\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwegpduvnypm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwegpduvnypm\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As a person from the developed world, I don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers here. But I think it\u2019s something worth considering\u2014as long as we\u2019re working from the premise that empiricism is important and RCTs aren\u2019t inherently morally suspect.</p><hr><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"rbwj6yz8jqp\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrbwj6yz8jqp\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"rbwj6yz8jqp\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrbwj6yz8jqp\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>I am leaving out the Wikipedia link for Unit 731 because learning about Unit 731 will replace any of your plans for the day with staring at the wall contemplating the limitless depths of human evil.

While the coup was thwarted and Gorbachev restored to power, this event underscored the precariousness of the Soviet status quo and made clear to many observers outside the USSR that its collapse was potentially imminent. Sam Nunn, U.S. senator for Georgia and chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was one of those observers. An expert on the USSR, Nunn happened to be in Moscow at the time of the coup:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref7\">on a crowded street in Moscow in August 1991, all of Nunn\u2019s experience, knowledge and fears about nuclear danger came together once again. Who would protect thousands of small atomic bombs spread all over the Soviet Union? What if the Soviet Union plunged into chaos and civil conflict? Who was responsible for command and control? What if the Russian military were as demoralized as the American soldiers had been after Vietnam? As he flew home, Nunn said, \u201cI was convinced of two things. One, that there would be no more Soviet empire. And two, that they and we had a huge, huge security problem.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"xjd5s323ie\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxjd5s323ie\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxjd5s323ie\">[7]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>On his return, Nunn worked with the chair of the House Armed Services Committee and fellow Democrat, Les Aspin, to try to secure U.S. funding both to help address the Soviet nuclear risk and to provide humanitarian aid. But they encountered a \u201cfirestorm\u201d of opposition and had to withdraw the legislation:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref8\">The Nunn-Aspin bill came at just the wrong moment. Polls showed Americans were opposed to sending direct aid to the Soviet Union. Aspin recalled, \u201cYou could feel the wind shift.\u201d \u2026 The politicians in Washington seemed oblivious to the dangers. Some senators told Nunn they could not explain in one-minute sound bites why they should support his legislation, so they would not vote for it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"ip4h11b6c97\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefip4h11b6c97\"><sup><a href=\"#fnip4h11b6c97\">[8]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref10\">Changing tack, Nunn partnered with Indiana senator Dick Lugar: a Republican, a friend of Nunn\u2019s, and an international relations expert. Nunn and Lugar were already engaged in the Carnegie Corporation of New York\u2019s Prevention of Proliferation Committee (POP), a group of experts from academia, policy, and politics who \u201cmet regularly to talk about what the United States could do in the world to minimize proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"qf0a2tv93y\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqf0a2tv93y\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqf0a2tv93y\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Following the coup against Gorbachev, several of the POP members contributed to a report identifying the precise locations of Soviet nuclear weapons and materials,<i>&nbsp;Soviet Nuclear Fission: Control of the Nuclear Arsenal in a Disintegrating Soviet Union.</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"10\" data-footnote-id=\"1w7eqk257x8\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1w7eqk257x8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1w7eqk257x8\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref11\">On the morning of November 21, 1991, Nunn and Lugar gathered a group of senators for a breakfast presentation in which Ash Carter, one of the report authors, presented the group\u2019s findings and tried to persuade the senators of the urgency of the situation. This meeting was apparently a pivotal moment; within a few weeks, the senate approved the rebranded Nunn-Lugar Act by a vote of 86\u20138. It was signed by president George H.

According to two people closely involved with events, the \u201cNunn-Lugar idea came from academics\u201d and \u201cnon-governmental thinking under-girded the thought process of CTR.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"17\" data-footnote-id=\"ngqqauxshh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefngqqauxshh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnngqqauxshh\">[17]</a></sup></span></p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref18\">Two central figures in this effort were David Hamburg and Jane Wales, who worked together at the Carnegie Corporation of New York under Hamburg\u2019s presidency starting in 1982. Hamburg was an eminent professor of psychiatry who moved into policy in 1975, becoming president of the National Academy of Sciences. In that role, he was one of the organizers of the 1978 Pugwash conference on crisis management and prevention involving US and Soviet scientists,&nbsp;which Hamburg recalled as his first direct involvement in nuclear risk reduction.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"18\" data-footnote-id=\"73naitof9m2\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref73naitof9m2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn73naitof9m2\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after becoming Carnegie president, Hamburg brought in Wales, an expert in arms control who had previously served in the Carter administration. Together, they started the Avoiding Nuclear War program at Carnegie which was a brand new policy area for the foundation. From 1982 to 1991, Hamburg and Wales brought together experts from academia, think tanks, and politics, from both the US and the USSR, in a succession of interdisciplinary and international working groups and committees as well as making grants to many related research projects.</p><p>This network eventually linked many of the main players in developing CTR as a policy concept and getting the Nunn-Lugar Act passed, including Nunn and Lugar themselves, Ash Carter, William Perry, John Steinbruner, several Soviet scientists and politicians&nbsp;including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Velikhov\">Evgeny Velikhov</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/person/?7292/AndreiKokoshin\">Andrei Kokoshin</a>, and a collaborative partnership between the Carnegie and MacArthur Foundations. By 1991, the network\u2019s endeavors over the previous nine years contributed to its members having the policy, networks, and resources&nbsp;to act quickly to address the imminent \u201cloose nukes\u201d threat.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref19\">I haven\u2019t found precise documentation of the chronology of the various groups and committees, but the following comes from David Hamburg\u2019s oral history interviews with Carnegie in the mid-late 90s. The 1978 Pugwash conference on crisis prevention that Hamburg helped to organize brought together \u201ca small group of U.S. scholars and Soviet scholars and West European scholars.\u201d Then, \u201cafter the '78 conference there gradually evolved -- rather quickly evolved -- a pattern of interaction between some of us [US scholars] and some of them [Soviet scholars] about how to learn more of what to do in preventive terms with respect to crises.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"19\" data-footnote-id=\"50hlyw023bu\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref50hlyw023bu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn50hlyw023bu\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Next, Hamburg recounted:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref20\">we had these interdisciplinary groups working at a number of universities and research institutes, and then pretty quickly moved to get some joint study groups between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, mainly through their Academy of Sciences, the only chance we had to have some stature of independence beyond the political control of the dictatorship \u2026 We got working groups starting with arms control and crisis prevention.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"20\" data-footnote-id=\"p04g278uheo\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp04g278uheo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp04g278uheo\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Elsewhere in the Carnegie oral history interviews, Hamburg dates the crisis prevention group starting soon after he became Carnegie president in 1982:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref21\">It was twice a year formally meeting, once here and once there, and a lot of flow back and forth of younger scholars in between to prepare for the meetings and exchange materials. It got to be a broader discourse of not only crisis prevention, but ways to wind down the Cold War. That's what evolved from it. I think it was a significant part of the mechanism, with feedback to Gorbachev years down the road.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"21\" data-footnote-id=\"4xeeul7pej7\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4xeeul7pej7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4xeeul7pej7\">[21]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Hamburg also described work over the course of the 1980s cultivating \u201clinkage with policy-makers:\u201d</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref22\">getting independent experts together with policy-makers in our own country, in both houses and both parties in the Congress and with the administration -- Reagan, Bush, on up -- and then after Gorbachev came to power [in 1985], with policy-makers in the Soviet Union.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"22\" data-footnote-id=\"cj29w2x4hdr\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcj29w2x4hdr\"><sup><a href=\"#fncj29w2x4hdr\">[22]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Scott Kohler notes a joint U.S. group starting in the mid-80s funded by three foundations including Carnegie (this may be the same group as one of the above?):</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref23\">Soon after Gorbachev became the Soviet president, the Carnegie Corporation of New York joined with the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the W. Alton Jones Foundation, as Jane Wales, then a Carnegie program officer, recounts, \u201cin supporting a group of U.S. and Soviet scientists that served as a brain trust to the Soviet president developing options for nuclear arms control and disarmament.\u201d This partnership marked the first time nuclear scientists from the two nations had had any sort of sanctioned collaboration.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"23\" data-footnote-id=\"k0dol9v21bc\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk0dol9v21bc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk0dol9v21bc\">[23]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Finally, Hamburg was also part of a steering committee on \u201cPrevention of Proliferation:\u201d</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref24\">The steering committee consisted of me and William Perry, who was then a professor at Stanford, later to be Secretary of Defense, and John Steinbruner from the Brookings Institution, who headed their international program, a very respected scholar, and Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar, the five of us.

The main focus of this piece is considering the qualities of some of the individuals who helped to make CTR a success, for which it\u2019s enough to start from the widely-accepted premise that CTR has been impactful. With that caveat aside, the following is a non-exhaustive summary of points around CTR\u2019s impact and limitations, and some of the factors behind its origin.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Impact\">Impact</h3><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref47\">As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_C._Weber\">Andy Weber</a>&nbsp;puts it, \u201cyou don\u2019t get credit for the catastrophe that didn\u2019t happen, but [CTR] is an extraordinary story.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"47\" data-footnote-id=\"mfxsvzlakcs\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmfxsvzlakcs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmfxsvzlakcs\">[47]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The collapse of the USSR happened relatively quickly and unexpectedly; David Hamburg recalled an episode after a 1988 meeting with Gorbachev:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref48\">Senator Nunn and I chatted with [Gorbachev] together at the end of the process. I said to him something to the effect, \"If you keep on the path you're now on, the Cold War could be over by the turn of the century.\" \u2026 When I was walking out, I said to Sam Nunn, \"Do you think I got carried away by the occasion?\" And he said, \"No, you're exactly in the right direction, even though you might have been a little optimistic in your time scale.\" And of course, that's what we all thought -- maybe if he could stay in office long enough, maybe by some time early in the [21st] century, it could be over.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"48\" data-footnote-id=\"5rch5j34hak\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5rch5j34hak\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5rch5j34hak\">[48]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>That Hamburg and Nunn, two contemporary experts, shared these expectations suggests that the U.S. could easily have not been ready to take the kind of action that it did at the end of 1991. The actual level of readiness that enabled CTR was at least in part due to the preparatory work and relationship-building conducted by Hamburg, Nunn, and their network.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref50\">Also, passing Nunn-Lugar was one thing, implementing CTR another. A counterfactual reference point here is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention#Soviet_Union_and_Russia\">1992 Trilateral Agreement</a>&nbsp;between the US, UK, and Russia which \u201creaffirmed the three states\u2019 commitment to full compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention\u201d and noted that Russia had ceased biological weapon research and production. Dr. David Kelly, a British participant in the Trilateral-related inspections, wrote that the agreement \u201cfailed dramatically.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"49\" data-footnote-id=\"aivytv2ucxk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaivytv2ucxk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaivytv2ucxk\">[49]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While Russia signed it, they refused to uphold their commitments and continued a bioweapons program that may still be active today.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"50\" data-footnote-id=\"pzzwy10yc3q\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpzzwy10yc3q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpzzwy10yc3q\">[50]</a></sup></span></p><p>To give a contrasting sense of some of CTR\u2019s implementation successes since 1991, here\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Holgate\">Laura Holgate</a>\u2019s sample list of counterfactuals in a world without CTR:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref51\">What if we\u2019d had to contend with four post-Soviet nuclear successors instead of just one? What if the trains shipping warheads back to Russia had been hijacked, like in the famous Peacemaker movie? What if Iran had purchased the plutonium-laden spent fuel from the BN-350 reactor in Kazakhstan? What if Libya had held on to their centrifuges? What if criminals had stolen biological strains from a veterinary clinic in Georgia? What if there were still 50 kg of HEU in Kharkiv, Ukraine today [2017]? What if we had failed to intervene in West Africa with combined military and development contributions to halt the spread of Ebola? What if terrorists had stolen HEU from the research facility they appear to have targeted in Belgium?

In 2023, Bill Clinton said of Ukraine:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref52\">I feel a personal stake because I got them to agree to give up their nuclear weapons \u2026 They were afraid to give them up because they thought that's the only thing that protected them from an expansionist Russia \u2026 I feel terrible about it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"52\" data-footnote-id=\"ga5s8nzlgr9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefga5s8nzlgr9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnga5s8nzlgr9\">[52]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>However, Mariana Buderyn of the Belfer Center, has said:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref53\">I would say after having researched this topic for nearly a decade, Ukraine did the right thing at the time. It did the right thing by itself and also by the international community. It reduced the overall number of nuclear weapons in the world. That makes everyone safer.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"53\" data-footnote-id=\"8win1nd8ki7\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8win1nd8ki7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8win1nd8ki7\">[53]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The counterfactual seems pretty uncertain here; if Ukraine had retained its nuclear weapons, perhaps Russia might not have acted as aggressively as it has in recent years, but perhaps also conflict with Russia might have escalated sooner with the heightened tension of another nuclear weapon state on its western borders. Recently declassified documents also suggest that, while Ukraine was under U.S. and international pressure to acquiesce, they also had some intrinsic motivations to do so:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref54\">Ukraine lacked the resources to maintain the nearly 1,700 Soviet nuclear weapons on its soil, many of them on intercontinental ballistic missiles that were nearing the end of their service lives. \u2026 [Ukrainian president] Kravchuk and almost all Ukrainian politicians were eager to dispose of the weapons, fearing that their nuclear cores might melt down in a manner reminiscent of the Chernobyl power-plant disaster.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"54\" data-footnote-id=\"pbwfquovl0k\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpbwfquovl0k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpbwfquovl0k\">[54]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref55\">Early criticisms of CTR centered included \u201cimplementation delays, which have been commonly caused by funding problems, procedural disagreements, lacking coordination between U.S. agencies, or difficulty in negotiating appropriate access.\u201d Some viewed its development and expansion as \u201cmission creep,\u201d with one critic describing CTR as a \u201cprogram that began as a response to [the U.S.'s] most urgent national security challenge has simply become another Pentagon bureaucracy and foreign aid boondoggle.\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"55\" data-footnote-id=\"r3o5tpu3hg\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr3o5tpu3hg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr3o5tpu3hg\">[55]</a></sup></span></p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref56\">Another concern has been the challenge of measuring its impact: \u201cas the programme expanded and developed a life of its own\u2026it became increasingly complex, and...few objective standards of success could be applied to it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"56\" data-footnote-id=\"gfugio25eki\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgfugio25eki\"><sup><a href=\"#fngfugio25eki\">[56]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;More recently, Laura Holgate has argued for a need to move beyond the concept of CTR to a mindset of \u201ccooperative risk management\u201d that better reflects the realities of the 21st century:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref57\">I really am trying to move the way we think and talk about material security from a threat reduction model to a risk management model \u2026 [There are] nine countries [with nuclear weapons] and they're going to have nuclear materials for the foreseeable future \u2026 It's not about threat reduction, it's about risk management, and a number of other countries have ongoing civilian uses of highly enriched uranium \u2026 so we really need to stop thinking exclusively about the notion that threat is something that begins and ends, and that you reduce it in kind of a binary \u201cyou got it or you don't\u201d kind of way, to the notion that this is an enduring problem: that risks are going to exist whether they're terrorist risks, whether there are other kinds of risks that we haven't been able to perceive \u2026 the risks change, but your ability to manage those risks is going to be the hallmark of success.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"57\" data-footnote-id=\"aqz4nb02g7u\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaqz4nb02g7u\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaqz4nb02g7u\">[57]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Given the scale and duration of CTR, it\u2019s unsurprising that it\u2019s had many challenges and limitations along the way, and that it may need to evolve in the near future. But none of this seems to significantly undermine the premise that CTR has been at least somewhat impactful.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"The_role_of_philanthropy_and_academia_in_CTR_s_origins_\">The role of philanthropy and academia in CTR\u2019s origins</h3><p>Another relevant premise to this piece is that the academic and policy work conducted from roughly 1978 onwards was at least a somewhat significant factor in both the passing of Nunn-Lugar and the CTR implementation successes that followed. According to a senior U.S. official interviewed by Sarah Kutchesfahani:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref59\">Without the ready availability of the project\u2018s [<i>Soviet Nuclear Fission</i>]<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"58\" data-footnote-id=\"x943f6acgv\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx943f6acgv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx943f6acgv\">[58]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;early findings and analytical support, Congress may not have had the content with which to fill its legislative response to a very real and dangerous problem, but without the wisdom and legislative skill of Nunn, Lugar, Aspin and others, we at CSIA [Harvard Center for Science and International Affairs] would certainly never have been [able to] bring our ideas into law or policy. And of course, without a platform of established prior relationships among the principal actors, these two elements may never have connected at all.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"59\" data-footnote-id=\"ecchwwi39h4\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefecchwwi39h4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnecchwwi39h4\">[59]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Relatedly, Benjamin Soskis writes:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref60\">Philanthropy-funded research likely convinced a number of other senators to sign onto the Nunn-Lugar initiative; it might have also convinced Lugar himself. And clearly the content of the final Nunn-Lugar legislation was highly indebted to that research, but to what extent is still an open question for me.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"60\" data-footnote-id=\"j36i2yy28tl\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj36i2yy28tl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj36i2yy28tl\">[60]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Scott Kohler notes that while foundation funding and activity was evidently not solely responsible for CTR, it was nonetheless a key factor:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref61\">To draw a straight line from the grants made by Carnegie and MacArthur to the passage of the Nunn-Lugar Act would be a gross oversimplification, and would probably exaggerate the foundations\u2019 role in a story that is far bigger than any one of its parts. But it is undeniable that, from at least the mid 1980s, those two foundations were promoting strategic collaboration between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., particularly in the area of WMD control. The foundations helped shape the research agenda as described in a Brookings report stating that \u201cthe purposes of the MacArthur Foundation effort have been made integral to our research planning. . . .\u201d They organized and supported the consortium that produced a groundswell of research and analysis, culminating in the work of Carter, Perry, and Steinbruner to propose a cooperative threat reduction plan. The two foundations also helped to orchestrate the crucial meeting at which the arguments of the former were presented to Senators Nunn and Lugar.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"61\" data-footnote-id=\"cg4460w7tzl\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcg4460w7tzl\"><sup><a href=\"#fncg4460w7tzl\">[61]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Soskis also considers the counterfactual that CTR might have happened without any philanthropic support:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref62\">Similar legislation might have been passed even without the intervention of philanthropy, given the intense interest of Nunn on the issue, and the knowledge of his own staff \u2026 in response to the counterfactual, it is possible that Nunn might have been able to get a similar bill passed through his own devices without the \u201cSoviet Nuclear Fission\u201d report, but almost undoubtedly not as fast, and in this case, that difference in time might have meant the difference [between] secure and unsecure nuclear material.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"62\" data-footnote-id=\"ftywoesw9b\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefftywoesw9b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnftywoesw9b\">[62]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><h1 data-internal-id=\"CTR_attributes__interpersonal_skills\">CTR attributes: interpersonal skills</h1><p>The first group of CTR contributors\u2019 qualities that stands out is around their application of interpersonal skills to bring about successful outcomes.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Building_trust_and_relationships\">Building trust and relationships</h2><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref63\">Building trust and relationships seems to have been a strength of David Hamburg\u2019s, who personally knew and worked with global leaders including Gorbachev, Reagan, Clinton, Mandela, and Tutu,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"63\" data-footnote-id=\"bq065htn08t\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbq065htn08t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbq065htn08t\">[63]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and was very well connected and respected in both US government and academia. Here's how he described his relationship with Gorbachev:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref64\">It was a very important experience for me, and I think it augmented the contribution that Carnegie could make during the Cold War, the fact that a relationship did form and continues to the present time [1997] \u2026 to some degree I became a broker, to bring or send people to meet with him and some of his closest colleagues, to discuss arms control and crisis prevention and then the winding down of the Cold War altogether, what they might do about Eastern Europe and so on.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"64\" data-footnote-id=\"irddxuspkl\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefirddxuspkl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnirddxuspkl\">[64]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Hamburg recalled&nbsp;that he\u2019d been building personal connections with Russian scientists since 1980 when he was a member of a collaborative US-USSR arms control group:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref65\">In my participation, I became friendly with a couple of leading scientists in their group, the chairman at that time, a physicist named Velikhov, who was well respected by our physicists. So I would meet on the side with one or two of their leading people and have other discussions. I figured maybe there was something else I could do with the [National Academy of Sciences] or with the foundations or universities, apart from the arms-control issue.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"65\" data-footnote-id=\"5dabx55x2xl\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5dabx55x2xl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5dabx55x2xl\">[65]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This connection with Velikhov led directly to his later access to Gorbachev:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI said to him, \"You've got a new leader. I don't know anything about him. I apologize for my ignorance. I'd never heard of him before he was appointed. I'm certainly nowhere near a Soviet expert. I don't know if he's good for us, for the cause of peace, for the United States, for friendship, any of that. I don't know. Maybe good, maybe bad. But I do know this. New leaders, when they come to power, like to have a distinctive ecological niche, to say to yourself, 'There's some way in which I can make a contribution different from my predecessors or exceeding my predecessors, whatever.\u2019 I wonder how he feels about that? I wonder if we could help him see that a contribution he could make might be to begin to wind down the Cold War. Is that possible?\"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref66\">So Velikhov got very excited, said, \"Let me think about it. I have to think about it. I'll get back to you in a while.\" What I didn't know was, he was going to talk to Gorbachev overnight.

Jane Wales\u2019s description of Dick Lugar&nbsp;strikes a similar note:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref67\">He was very well-liked in the Senate \u2026 people on both sides of the aisle trusted him, liked him, took him seriously, knew he was thoughtful and knew how to listen \u2026 and as a result, when he needed to persuade, he could \u2026 He was thoughtful, he would stick with an issue \u2026 he was the opposite of a grandstander and as a result he got a whole lot done.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"67\" data-footnote-id=\"3ksjgmtthia\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3ksjgmtthia\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3ksjgmtthia\">[67]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Gloria Duffy says that:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref68\">In my experience the most ethical and collaborative approaches have always been the most successful.

As outlined above, these efforts, with roots in the late 70s and starting in earnest after Hamburg became president of Carnegie in 1982, seem to have helped create the conditions for the initial success of the CTR legislation. According to Ash Carter and William Perry:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref74\">Hamburg had a knack for bringing the right people together at the right time to work on the right problems, stimulating common thoughts and common action.

Ash Carter\u2019s breakfast presentation to a group of senators in November 1991 seems to have played an important role in helping persuade Congress to vote in favor of Nunn-Lugar after the failure of the Nunn-Aspin bill:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref82\">[Nunn] told them what he had seen in Moscow and turned the floor over to Carter, who delivered a presentation without notes. Carter said command and control over nuclear weapons could not be isolated from the troubles of society. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you can take for granted, that it\u2019s all wired up in some way, and it will be okay,\u201d Carter recalled telling the senators. The clarity of his presentation had an instant impact \u2026 Within days, Nunn and Lugar had turned around the Senate and gathered the votes for new legislation to set aside $500 million to deal with the Soviet nuclear dangers.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"82\" data-footnote-id=\"4k4uo6gh1rh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4k4uo6gh1rh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4k4uo6gh1rh\">[82]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>There were multiple factors that persuaded senators to vote for the Nunn-Lugar bill; it seems that Carter may have motivated his audience by making the threat feel more couched in the volatility of human behavior rather than being abstract and mechanical. As Carter described it to Sam Nunn:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref83\">a nuclear custodial system is only as stable as the social system in which it is embedded \u2026 And it\u2019s really made up of people and institutions and standard operating procedures and so forth, not just gizmos.

He tossed it on a table and told Clinton there were perhaps eighty thousand of those filled with uranium or plutonium, and not one with an inventory number on it. The institute had no monitors to stop someone from carrying one out in their pocket. Bunn thumped on the table a two-inch stack of press clippings he\u2019d assembled, including a Time magazine cover with the headline \u201cNuclear Terror for Sale.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"84\" data-footnote-id=\"8mms6ttsd72\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8mms6ttsd72\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8mms6ttsd72\">[84]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>David Hamburg valued leading with solutions to get people engaged:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref85\">Our emphasis was always on what can you do about the problem. If you sound an alarm without anything to do, people will run away from it. They will try to avoid the problem.

In that context, he identified evidence, clarity, and visibility as three virtues of communication:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref86\">[Foundation] reports have to be credible because they're based on the strongest evidence, research-based to the extent possible. They have to be intelligible because they're expressed in clear language, not in technical jargon, and they have to be visible in the best sense, to have a fighting chance to be effective.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"86\" data-footnote-id=\"8ykgiuclfba\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8ykgiuclfba\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8ykgiuclfba\">[86]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And to achieve visibility, Hamburg noted the need to draw on both expertise and prominent, credible advocates:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref87\">I believe that even the finest reports can be largely ineffective if you just put them out and they sink without a trace. I believe that it works better if you have strong representation from different sectors involved in it. If you have not only specialized experts, but \u2026 [well-known advocates] on those bodies, so that they have a certain visibility and a certain credibility and legitimacy at the outset.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"87\" data-footnote-id=\"q6pfhv3zeyk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq6pfhv3zeyk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq6pfhv3zeyk\">[87]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>In Hamburg\u2019s view, Carnegie\u2019s efforts to promote their studies played a significant role in increasing awareness of the need for greater controls over nuclear weapons:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref88\">The studies we supported got out into the general discourse, certainly in the democratic countries at home and abroad, and to a certain extent in the Soviet Union through their scientific community \u2026 For example, the studies that we supported on arms control and crisis prevention \u2026 they were in newspaper columns and op-ed pieces and magazine articles. In congressional hearings, I think it's fair to say that after, I don't know, let's say about 1985, in the ensuing decade, probably, there was hardly ever a congressional hearing that didn't have reference to one of the Carnegie-supported studies or having testimony from one of the Carnegie-supported experts or members of one of the Carnegie-supported panels \u2026 We were largely alone in the field in the darkest days of the Cold War, in the early and mid eighties \u2026 So I think the contribution to broadening and elevating the discourse was considerable.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"88\" data-footnote-id=\"2p7xfdt4v1x\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2p7xfdt4v1x\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2p7xfdt4v1x\">[88]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><h1 data-internal-id=\"CTR_attributes__strategy_and_leadership\">CTR attributes: strategy and leadership</h1><p>I\u2019ll focus mostly on David Hamburg and Carnegie in this section. There were many figures who played leading roles in the success of CTR, and the MacArthur and W. Alton Jones Foundations contributed alongside Carnegie. But Hamburg is someone who 1) is widely credited as a significant non-governmental contributor to CTR and Nunn-Lugar, 2) doesn\u2019t feature as often in overviews of CTR as Nunn, Lugar, or Carter, for example, and 3) spoke and wrote extensively about his work and experiences.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Vision\">Vision</h2><p>Former Carnegie curator, Brenda Hearing, said to Hamburg that he was widely regarded as \u201ca very strong, dynamic leader of Carnegie, that put your own stamp on the programming here right away,\u201d and that he was \u201ca little unusual in coming into an office such as this, with such a very well formulated set of goals.\u201d</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref89\">Yet Hamburg&nbsp;had started out as a reluctant leader: \u201cI came into leadership positions at a young age and I didn't expect to, and really didn't want to.\u201d On being asked to join the Carnegie board (which preceded his presidency), he said \u201cthey couldn't have picked a less well-informed, less well-prepared board member.\u201d And he was even less bullish when asked to become Carnegie president: \u201cI was very surprised when they asked me to become president, and I at first said, almost reflexively, no, both from their standpoint and mine.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"89\" data-footnote-id=\"m672zkg0tm\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm672zkg0tm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm672zkg0tm\">[89]</a></sup></span></p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref90\">Hamburg already had a strong interest in nuclear risk and the Cold War through his work as president of the National Academy of Sciences. While Carnegie had no history in the area, they were interested in Hamburg exploring it and he was swayed. But, Hamburg recalled, \u201cIt was nowhere then near the current agenda of the foundation, and it seemed to me that would be kind of a wrenching transition to make \u2026 it was strange to everybody.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"90\" data-footnote-id=\"7bljgdldyid\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7bljgdldyid\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7bljgdldyid\">[90]</a></sup></span></p><p>All this context makes Hamburg\u2019s success at Carnegie even more impressive\u2014that he was able to introduce a new and very different program area, and grow it to the extent that the foundation played an important role in establishing CTR less than a decade later. There must have been many factors that contributed to this, including Hamburg\u2019s personal qualities and abilities referenced elsewhere in this piece. But he clearly placed a high value on both defining a vision and empowering his board and staff to deliver on it:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref91\">I do think that an important part of it was to get people interested in or enthusiastic about a mission \u2026 [and] the capacity to communicate the vision, get people excited about it, and, above all, get terrific people to work on it. The idea that any one leader can do very much him or herself, I think, is farfetched. If you're talking about a big mission, you've got to kind of mobilize a lot of people to work on it, and that's an important aspect of leadership.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"91\" data-footnote-id=\"r4or4u212n\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr4or4u212n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr4or4u212n\">[91]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><h2 data-internal-id=\"Big_picture__long_run_mindset_and_speculative_bets\">Big picture, long-run mindset and speculative bets</h2><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref92\">Hamburg worked on nuclear threat reduction across his roles at the National Academy of Sciences, Harvard, and Carnegie from the late 70s to his retirement in 1997; he described his work at these organizations as \u201call broad, policy oriented, big picture, large issue, tough problems that brought together many disciplines.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"92\" data-footnote-id=\"oy9c2cvu01\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoy9c2cvu01\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoy9c2cvu01\">[92]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>He and Jane Wales set up a succession of conferences, working groups, committees and research initiatives which are credited as having contributed both to the initial passing of Nunn-Lugar and the subsequent implementation of CTR. In hindsight, this process might look carefully planned out, but Hamburg made clear that it was often highly speculative. He was a lead organizer of the 1978 Pugwash Conference, which he said \u201cwas kind of improvised and which had no obvious follow-up, [but it] grew into this joint study mechanism and major follow-up in crisis prevention in other fields.\u201d He describes the arms-control ventures at Carnegie similarly:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref93\">We simply wanted to get the ablest people we could anywhere in the world to do the analytical work that might be useful, if and when the political leaders wanted it \u2026 it was not uncommon for me to say to the groups we were supporting something like this, \"I don't know when, if ever, the work you put in will be put to use\u201d \u2026 great physicists and engineers and other scientists spent a huge amount of time, energy, and aggravation in that work, knowing the importance of it potentially, but not knowing if it would ever be put to use. Now as it turned out, it was hugely valuable once Gorbachev and Reagan got around to making the political decisions \u2026 It shows you have to be patient and you have to take some risks, and people have to invest valuable time in a mission they believe to be terribly important.

We would say to members of Congress, \"The idea is to help you get the facts straight for the long term. You're going to have to make momentous decisions this year, in three years, in ten years, and the more you have a solid factual basis, the better off you'll be.\" They were enthusiastic about that notion, always have been.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"94\" data-footnote-id=\"fgiuxjotqz\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffgiuxjotqz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfgiuxjotqz\">[94]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>He also recalled the high value that members of Congress placed on these learning opportunities:</p><blockquote><p>People with highly consequential responsibilities, leadership of people in the country, were exposed to a wider range and a greater depth of knowledge on the subject [of arms control] from more independent sources than they would otherwise have had, and they would give testimonies, fervent testimonies, to the value of it. We periodically examined the question, should we back off now? Should we fade out of this business? We got the most enthusiastic responses. I was shaken by the shoulders, \"David, do not stop this.

After the failed coup against Gorbachev in August 1991, the Prevention of Proliferation steering committee was able to mobilize in the response to the pressing dangers:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref96\">One of the things that became clear was that we needed to know to the extent possible: Where were the Soviet nuclear weapons? There was a lot of information available, and we had a quick and dirty study, led primarily by Ashton Carter of Harvard, with a number of colleagues, and we therefore had a quite reliable map in a couple of months' time of where the weapons were and some knowledge of how well they were supervised and all that sort of thing, because our concern was, what would be the fate of the nuclear weapons in the disintegrating Soviet Union?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"96\" data-footnote-id=\"nedz3lp1alo\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnedz3lp1alo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnedz3lp1alo\">[96]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>As covered earlier, Carter presentation of the report\u2019s findings then played a role in Nunn and Lugar\u2019s efforts to persuade senators to vote for their legislation in November 1991.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Entrepreneurial_approach\">Entrepreneurial approach</h2><p>Hamburg\u2019s speculative approach to building collective expertise and leverage was rooted in his conception of foundations as \u201cthe venture capital of the nonprofit sector\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>They get into problem areas that are complex and difficult and sensitive. They support gifted people who may be unconventional. They do work in poor communities in this country or abroad where it may be very hard to monitor the use of the funds in detail.

But, he also said, \u201cthere is a considerable risk-averse tendency in the foundation community,\u201d so he may have been swimming against the tide to a certain extent. His introduction of Avoiding Nuclear War as a new program area \u201cwas strange to everybody\u201d at Carnegie, and represented something of a risk for the foundation:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref98\">Did a nongovernmental organization [NGO] have a role in this field? It seems ridiculous today because NGOs have burgeoned so in this conflict field. But it wasn't ridiculous in 1982, '83, '84. Did we have a role? There were people who thought we didn't. Should foundations be supporting universities to do independent work that might contradict the government? We might be a pebble in the shoe of our own government, let alone other governments.

We want to work on those same goals and in some cases with some of the same people, both in the United States and overseas, and in a way that is more flexible, more creative, and more active, and we\u2019re really going to be a \u201cdo tank\u201d rather than a \u201cthink tank.\u201d\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"99\" data-footnote-id=\"shpjkebt9q\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefshpjkebt9q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnshpjkebt9q\">[99]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><h2 data-internal-id=\"Good_epistemics_and_norms\">Good epistemics and norms</h2><p>As president of the National Academy of Sciences and Carnegie, David Hamburg aimed to establish a range of norms and practices to optimize for collaborative truth-seeking and problem solving:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref100\">I really tried to bring out the best in people to look at new problems or readjust their sights on old problems and to see how we could \u2026 get the facts straight in the first place, and then to see what we could do about those facts.

I don't know how the balance worked out, but I tried to get that balance into it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref101\">\u2026 I do think that's an important subject, of how we strengthen the capacity of leaders at every level, from presidents to, say, department chairmen at universities, to make better decisions by virtue of their ability to process information in a small-group setting that's not sycophantic, not dogmatic. I think that's extremely important, and also to have, in terms of the larger institutional arrangements, to have procedures that are likely to get adequate information and a fair-minded consideration.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"101\" data-footnote-id=\"j9mrutpa3no\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj9mrutpa3no\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj9mrutpa3no\">[101]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>When Hamburg assembled expert groups, he did so carefully and while prioritizing a diversity of ideas and backgrounds. He said of selecting the Carnegie board:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref102\">I did a huge amount of homework, checking out very, very carefully how people had functioned in other board situations. The best predictor of behavior is behavior in similar situations. I wanted people who were extremely able, maybe visible, had earned a great deal of respect, came from different backgrounds, different professional backgrounds, different social backgrounds, black, white, green, whatever you want.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"102\" data-footnote-id=\"chtr6wnkkyw\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefchtr6wnkkyw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnchtr6wnkkyw\">[102]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>A further goal was ensuring his board members were inclined towards both collaboration and respect:</p><blockquote><p>I wanted very strong and able people, but I didn't want authoritarian personalities \u2026 I wasn't looking for people who would be \"yes\" people to me. Not in the slightest. I wanted people of great stature and accomplishment in their own right. But I did want people who could work well across disciplinary lines, across programmatic lines, were fundamentally collegial and respectful of others. I didn't want people who were spoiled brats grown up, or egos out of control.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref103\">\u2026 We had on this board during my time, and at my initiative, eminent people \u2026 who had commanded organizations. But I think it's also fair to say that they were not people who were inclined to push others around. They were inclined towards a very collegial, mutually respectful give-and-take with other high-level accomplished people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"103\" data-footnote-id=\"jm1cpf0ksge\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjm1cpf0ksge\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjm1cpf0ksge\">[103]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><h1 data-internal-id=\"CTR_attributes__personal_qualities_and_values\">CTR attributes: personal qualities and values</h1><h2 data-internal-id=\"Mission_orientation\">Mission orientation</h2><p>In an 80,000 hours interview, Andy Weber emphasizes the importance of mission orientation for those thinking of going into policy work:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref104\">What it takes is somebody who wants to be a public servant, not necessarily working for the government, but working in public service, whether it\u2019s in journalism, or science. Making a contribution to solving the world\u2019s hardest problems has to be what motivates people to go into these fields. \u2026 The true public servant isn\u2019t so much worried about themselves or their own careers, what motivates them and what they care about is the mission, it\u2019s making the world safer.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"104\" data-footnote-id=\"0x8ykferro4i\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0x8ykferro4i\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0x8ykferro4i\">[104]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>This chimes with themes in David Hamburg\u2019s recollections. As a professor at Caltech in 1975, a group of his research students were taken hostage while doing fieldwork in Tanzania. He references his experiences flying out and negotiating for their release as a catalyst for his shift from academia into mission-driven policy work:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref105\">I had been immersed in the worst problems of the world during those few months -- of disease and abject poverty and ignorance and deception and violence. My nose was rubbed for months in all these dreadful problems. I had some feeling that maybe, maybe in some way, if I could turn my energies to settings and institutions that could do something about those problems, the tiniest little bit, could affect policies that would have some kind of ameliorative or preventive effect on terrible problems of that kind, that maybe that would be a good thing to do.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"105\" data-footnote-id=\"hbsttiyxjnw\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhbsttiyxjnw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhbsttiyxjnw\">[105]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Hamburg\u2019s family background also provided motivation for his desire to reduce conflict and suffering:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref106\">I grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust. My grandfather came to this country about 1900, fleeing from severe pogroms in Latvia, and devoted his life to bringing relatives who were subject to violent anti-semitic behavior from Eastern Europe to America. It was first hand knowledge how brutal people could be.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"106\" data-footnote-id=\"31l5va70sgl\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref31l5va70sgl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn31l5va70sgl\">[106]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>This heritage, combined with his first-hand experience growing up as one of very few Jewish kids in interwar Indiana, was part of what drove him to use his influence to make a difference:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref107\">[Meeting Gorbachev] was very dramatic, and it was one of many points in my career when I really had to pinch myself. I have to say I wish my grandfather could be around to see it. I always was concerned. I mean, to some degree there was always within me the kid who grew up in a small town in Indiana, close to people who had fled from persecution, and feeling a little bit marginal, a little bit insecure, and lacking in chutzpah. But I felt if you had a chance, you should try. President Kennedy once said something to the effect that, \u201cWhat's influence for except to use it?\u201d If you have it, you should use it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"107\" data-footnote-id=\"p1bs9nik7gi\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp1bs9nik7gi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp1bs9nik7gi\">[107]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><h2 data-internal-id=\"Boldness_and_risk_taking\">Boldness and risk-taking</h2><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref108\">In 1997, Anne Harrington and Andy Weber saw a clear need to expand the scope of CTR to include Russian scientists who\u2019d worked on biological weapons. The director of one of the biggest Russian labs, Lev Sandakchiev, was seriously considering working for Iran; Weber had already had multiple informal meetings with him but there were no official communications yet because \u201cthere was tremendous resistance in the U.S. government, especially in the intelligence agencies, to using any of [the CTR funds] to stop the spread of biological weapons.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"108\" data-footnote-id=\"u5032fwdpwo\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu5032fwdpwo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu5032fwdpwo\">[108]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Sensing the urgency of the situation, they took a potential career-threatening risk to try to force the issue:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref109\">Weber and Harrington decided to take a chance and reach out to Sandakchiev on their own. They would not go through the usual bureaucratic channels: embassies, cables, government ministries. On Harrington\u2019s office computer, they tapped out an email to Sandakhchiev. It was brief, noncommittal, but inviting, suggesting closer cooperation and asking if Weber could visit Vector. They didn\u2019t know what would happen. \u201cWhat are your employment options if this doesn\u2019t work?\u201d Harrington asked Weber.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"109\" data-footnote-id=\"uh74jwno5jh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuh74jwno5jh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuh74jwno5jh\">[109]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Gloria Duffy recounts a related occasion when Les Aspin, then Secretary of Defense, took an off-piste approach to break through a CTR impasse:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref110\">At the beginning dealing with Ukraine we had a dance going on where the Ukrainians wouldn't let us come to talk to them. \u2026 So at one point, Les Aspin\u2014who was briefly the Secretary of Defense\u2014was on a trip to Russia, and he just diverted his plane and called in to Kiev and asked if the Secretary of Defense of the United States could land in Kiev and meet with his counterpart. \u2026 He came back and gave me the phone number of the Secretary of Defense, and we started calling up the Ministry of Defense ourselves because \u2026 working through the diplomatic cables and the formal methods for requesting access were not working.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"110\" data-footnote-id=\"0ynkv4nh1ntj\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0ynkv4nh1ntj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0ynkv4nh1ntj\">[110]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>David Hamburg also seems to have been unafraid to act boldly in high-stakes situations, for example in his first meeting with Gorbachev:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref111\">Toward the end, I said to him, \"It seems to me you're very interested in ideas outside. If I could be of any help -- \" I felt he's going to kick me out of the room for being so presumptuous to say I could bring in people or ideas, but, no, he put his arm around me and he said, \"That would be a great thing.

Somebody somewhere will take umbrage that we've done this, but we should do it as respectfully as we can in the pluralism of our democracy and the pluralism of the world. \u2026 I got teased that, in the first [Carnegie] board meeting, I said, \"The only thing I will promise you is that I will bring you intractable problems.\"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref112\">\u2026 You can take up almost any problem. I used to say in my psychiatric days to the patients, there's nothing too awful to talk about. That applies to Carnegie, to foundations.

Andy Weber shares that:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref113\">[The policy/national security field] tends to be a little bit hierarchical, which is why I liked working in small embassies in places like Almaty, Kazakhstan and not in big embassies like London, because you get a lot more responsibility at a younger age.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"113\" data-footnote-id=\"q7m2hv7wef\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq7m2hv7wef\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq7m2hv7wef\">[113]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref114\">As a young analyst working in the U.S. embassy in Moscow in summer of 1991, Anne Harrington volunteered to help identify and support Russian weapons experts who might be tempted to work for a rogue state \u201cbecause no one else was interested. \u201cI put up my hand and said, \u2018I can do that,\u2019\u201d\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"114\" data-footnote-id=\"7mt7nczwgew\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7mt7nczwgew\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7mt7nczwgew\">[114]</a></sup></span></p><p>Harrington and her fellow female policy experts also had the additional challenge of having to navigate a highly male-dominated field. Jane Wales, already an experienced authority in national security by her late 20s, says:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref115\">I was a young woman in a world full of old men \u2026 I remember walking into the Council on Foreign Relations and having everybody just turn and look: \u201cwhy is that person wearing a dress?\u201d And you feel like this weird oddity walking into the room.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"115\" data-footnote-id=\"t3ra6ts7t9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft3ra6ts7t9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt3ra6ts7t9\">[115]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall shares a similar experience:<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref116\">When I started out in this field, there were no women who were role models for me\u2014and I had the good fortune to have male mentors who wanted to see women in previously male-dominated fields, and who opened doors for me and encouraged me.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"116\" data-footnote-id=\"8o8ik4fz93\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8o8ik4fz93\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8o8ik4fz93\">[116]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Nonetheless, Wales was ready to jump at the opportunity to take on high stakes, high impact work:</p><blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref117\">My focus was nuclear arms control primarily at that point in my life [in the early 1980s], and the president of the Carnegie Corporation [Hamburg] asked me to have breakfast with him and said \u2026 \u201cI think that our system of non-proliferation isn't working\u2014can you come up with a new one?\u201d And so here's another piece of advice for your careers: when you get asked that by a foundation president, the answer\u2019s yes! You could have no idea what you're talking about, but the right answer is yes.

For the original post and downloadable Note please visit: </i><a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/1-trillion-paradox-why-reforming-research-publishing-should-be-global-priority\"><i>https://www.cgdev.org/publication/1-trillion-paradox-why-reforming-research-publishing-should-be-global-priority</i></a><i> .</i></p><p><i>----</i></p><p>Our research system is a perplexing paradox. Each year, approximately&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20225/cross-national-comparisons-of-r-d-performance\">$1 trillion</a> of public funds are spent on research worldwide. Whole careers are spent making incremental improvements to research methods. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on a single clinical trial. And yet, the global system for sharing research results is a costly mess. Rooted in antiquated journal structures and marred by market failures, our research systems prioritise profit at the expense of accessibility, equity, and affordability, hindering our ability to fully reap the benefits of research.&nbsp;</p><p>A prior CGD <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/way-we-access-research-isnt-working-development-we-need-fix-it\">blog</a> argued that research reform is a critical issue for global development and in a subsequent <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/urgent-need-reform-research-publishing-call-g20\">blog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/research-publishing-under-recognised-global-challenge-opportunities-g20-act\">policy paper</a>, we make the case for G20 engagement. This note further unpacks why research publishing reform should be a global priority using the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\">Importance-Tractability-Neglectedness (ITN) framework</a>\u2014a framework that estimates the value of allocating marginal resources to solving a problem, considering its significance, feasibility for intervention, and the degree to which it has been overlooked\u2014and back-of-the-envelope estimates of the potential costs and benefits. Research and evidence are upstream from almost all kinds of human progress and research publishing reform promises substantial benefits compared with the catalytic investments necessary to achieve it. We have the technological capability, proven alternative publishing models and an established movement to build on. What is needed is analysis and engagement at the policy and political level to enhance national and international leadership and encourage more progressive publishing alternatives.</p><h2>The problem: Current global research publishing systems are ineffective, inefficient, and inequitable&nbsp;</h2><p>The problems with global research publishing are myriad and more comprehensively described in a <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/research-publishing-under-recognised-global-challenge-opportunities-g20-act\">recent CGD policy paper</a>. In short, research is most impactful when it is a global public good\u2014able to be accessed, used, and iterated upon by anyone, anywhere. However, despite the immense sharing power of our digitally interconnected age, our current research publishing systems fall woefully short of this ideal. At least <a href=\"https://deltathink.com/news-views-open-access-market-sizing-update-2022/\">55 percent</a> and up to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29456894/\">70 percent</a> of research remains locked behind paywalls that require costly pay-to-read subscriptions. Five for-profit publishing companies\u2014Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley Blackwell, Taylor and Francis, and Sage Publications\u2014dominate the market, generating more than <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/research-publishing-under-recognised-global-challenge-opportunities-g20-act.pdf\">50 percent of revenues</a> (over <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/research-publishing-under-recognised-global-challenge-opportunities-g20-act\">$7 billion in 2022</a>) with profit margins up to 38 percent\u2014<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/neuroimage-elsevier-editorial-board-journal-profit/\">higher than big tech companies.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Recent decades have seen a range of initiatives seeking research publishing reform and \u201cOpen Access\u201d publishing. However, so far, the predominant solution has involved transitioning from a pay-to-read to a pay-to-publish model, where researchers or their institutions cover article processing charges to make articles free to access. This approach swaps one set of barriers for another, excluding many researchers and research funders in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) who cannot pay the exorbitant publishing fees. Meanwhile, this shift continues to line the pockets of publishers, who earn an estimated <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-022-04407-5\">$2 billion from article processing charges each year. </a>Despite the drawbacks, a prestige economy keeps researchers beholden to these publishers. Researchers must publish in well-recognised journals (almost always owned by one of the big five) to elevate their research and progress their careers.</p><h2>Should addressing the shortcomings of research publishing be a global priority?</h2><p>The research publishing system is failing, yet fixing it will take work and there are competing demands on our attention and resources. Should reforming global research publishing be a priority? Prioritisation frameworks including economic evaluation approaches like cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and their rougher cousin, the back-of-the-envelope calculation (BOTEC), help identify priorities that offer the maximum benefit at the least cost, while the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\">ITN framework</a> provides additional criteria to prioritise interventions than will have the most marginal benefit. Part of the challenge in answering this question is that research contributes to progress on most, if not all other priorities, and the link between research and impact\u2014while potentially profound\u2014can be difficult to establish. In this article we use the ITN framework with a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/24509/chapter-abstract/187635547?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">cost-consequence</a> summary and simple BOTEC to highlight some considerations. However, this is only a light-touch assessment and deeper analysis to better understand the potential value of reforms would be valuable.&nbsp;</p><h3>Importance: Research publishing reform would bring large-scale benefits</h3><p>First, to assess the importance of research publishing reform we outline a very simple BOTEC that explores the total value of global research investments and what marginal improvements to value could be worth. Because the total size of the research sector is so large and the expected downstream value of this aggregate research even larger, even small increases in value through publishing reforms imply a high willingness to invest to achieve such improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>We can broadly consider the return on investments in research publishing reform to be:</p><p><i>R = E / c</i></p><p>And if we define the value of reforms to be:</p><p><i>E = a * b * d * t</i></p><p>Where:</p><p><strong>Table 1.

But even if reforms only increase research value by 1 percent it would still result in <strong>$400 billion to up to $1 trillion over ten years</strong> or up to<strong> $9 trillion to $24 trillion of value over 50 years. </strong>If we assume minimum costs to achieve reform of $1 billion (roughly double what has been spent to date) up to more conservative estimates of five times this amount, then the return could range from 1800x up to 372,000x.</p><p>The most significant uncertainty is the extent to which investments in reform initiatives will improve research impact and over what time period it is reasonable to consider the accrual of these gains. However, we can see that even scenarios pessimistic of sweeping impact (or, equivalently, those that place a significant chance of failure on investments) have a high expected value.&nbsp;</p><p>A risk with all efforts to boil costs and benefits down to a single calculation is that we often lose information in the process, particularly that which is challenging to quantify. Cost-consequence analysis (CCA) is an economic evaluation framework which intentionally avoids this and instead seeks to compile relevant evidence (both quantitative and qualitative) into a single balance sheet-style table. The table follows a balance sheet layout and invites the reader to judge whether the aggregate of the positive consequences outweigh the likely costs. This bottom-up approach complements top-down estimation, by identifying specific mechanisms through which benefits are realised. In Table 1, we draw together evidence on the potential costs and consequences of reforms. The categories follow those laid out in our <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/research-publishing-under-recognised-global-challenge-opportunities-g20-act\">previous paper</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The most often highlighted goal of research publishing reform is improved access to, and therefore impact from, research outputs\u2014as explored by the BOTEC. In addition, we could anticipate improved efficiency and productivity of researchers. Rough estimates suggest potential savings of $25 billion annually by reducing duplication in research efforts and $7.7 billion annually through researcher productivity gains. Thirdly, reform could address the critical issue of inequitable publishing opportunities, particularly for researchers in LMICs. These inequities not only undermine research systems and economic development in such countries, they deprive the wider world of the results of their work. Lastly, on consequences, we note that accessible research can increase societal trust in research, the importance of which was underscored by research distrust during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the cost side, while the cost to achieve comprehensive reform is unknown, we find the transition towards an equitable research publishing reform model to have only attracted at least $411 million in investments to date. However, this should be balanced not only against the significant potential benefits but potential direct cost savings of up to $6.5 billion each year, by moving away from high-cost Article Processing Charges to lower cost models. At minimum, independent analysis by the Max Planck Institute finds that current resources within the existing publishing system are sufficient to sustain costs following the transition.</p><p><strong>Table 2.

New commercial digital publishing models such as F1000 and MDPI have seen success. Similarly, the expansion of preprint servers and the growth of publicly owned platforms like <a href=\"https://www.scielo.org/en/about-scielo\">Scielo</a> have demonstrated the potential of non-commercial models. <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/academic-journals-the-mos_b_6368204\">Alternative publication and peer-review models that discard traditional journal structures</a> are also emerging. These include platforms like <a href=\"https://unjournal.pubpub.org/\">Unjournal</a> that assess research quality and curate articles in a given field. The emergence of <a href=\"https://blog.mdpi.com/2023/09/05/ai-open-access/\">AI will only hasten the development of new Open Access technologies</a>. Yet the prestige economy means that radical changes in digital publishing are not yet revolutionising the sector in the way that the music industry has been transformed by digital platforms like Spotify.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past decade, a range of initiatives seeking publishing reform have sprung up including<a href=\"https://www.coalition-s.org/\"> COAlition S,</a> perhaps the leading voice for Open Access reform, alongside the <a href=\"https://oa2020.org/\">OA2020</a> campaign, the <a href=\"https://open-access.network/en/information/policy-frameworks/open-access-transition\">Open Access Network</a>, the <a href=\"https://sparcopen.org/\">Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cos.io/open-science\">Centre for Open Science</a>. These initiatives have contributed in large part to pushing many philanthropic and public funders to implement Open Access mandates, sparking conversations and creating momentum for change. Yet while these initiatives have made important progress, their influence remains predominantly at the institutional level, primarily within Europe and the US, and often with a focus on conventional pay-to-publish solutions at the expense of more economical and innovative alternatives. While such initiatives have been instrumental in creating a groundswell of grassroots change, they remain fragmented and lack significant, sustained engagement at higher national and international political levels that is needed to propel research publishing reform from an issue of institutional importance to international significance.</p><p>It is not so much a question of whether change in research publishing is tractable; emerging technologies mean that change is inevitable and already happening, with public funders and initiatives already creating some momentum for research publishing reform. What is needed now and in the future is sufficient political leadership and international coordination to achieve the right <i>kind</i> of change.&nbsp;</p><h3>Neglectedness: Too often seen as a niche concern for academics rather than a global system that underwrites economic and societal progress&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>While numerous research funders, initiatives, and universities advocate for research publishing reform, their efforts often frame research publishing reform as a technical or niche concern, rather than a pressing national or international policy issue. Despite its global relevance and need for international cooperation, discussions of <a href=\"https://www.s4d4c.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S4D4C_REPORT_Science-Diplomacy-in-the-Making.pdf\">Open Access in science diplomacy</a> have been sporadic and ad hoc. This is slowly starting to change with India putting research publishing reform on the 2023 G20 agenda, resulting in a <a href=\"https://www.g20.org/content/dam/gtwenty/gtwenty_new/document/G20_CSAR_Outcome_Document_and_Chair_Summary_28Aug.pdf\">communique</a><a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/questions/gms1-2/\"> </a>from the G20 group of Chief Scientific Advisors. Still, there is much more potential for leveraging political support, including the Brazil and South Africa G20 presidencies, <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/urgent-need-reform-research-publishing-call-g20\">as we have highlighted</a>. To keep research publishing reform prominently on the international policy agenda, further investment in political engagement is needed.</p><p>The role of think tanks and policy influencers in shaping effective national and international policies is <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/30/how-to-change-the-policy-of-the-british-government\">well documented,</a> yet the discourse around research publishing reform has so far seen limited participation from these entities too. An examination of the global <a href=\"https://onthinktanks.org/open-think-tank-directory/\">Open Think Tank Directory</a> shows only 0.1 percent (n=5) mention Open Access, research reform, or Open Science in their organisational descriptions. In contrast, other comparable global issues like universal healthcare are covered by ~13 percent of think tanks (n=513). This lack of policy engagement can make navigating research reform policy more difficult for officials and decision-makers.</p><p>Research publishing reform must be framed as a national and international policy issue. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-landscape-of-the-open-science-community/\">Catalytic investment in political engagement</a>&nbsp;for research reform has so far been neglected. Setting aside investment in large-scale Open Access journals and platform infrastructure, we estimate around $53 million is invested per year to fund research reform advocacy, education, and interoperability initiatives, of which an even smaller fraction goes specifically towards political engagement. This is small change compared, for example, to the <a href=\"https://humanrightsfunding.org/strategies/advocacy/year/2019/\">$1.6 billion granted globally in 2019</a> for human rights advocacy, systems reform, and implementation.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Further work to rigorously assess the potential costs and benefits would be welcome to strengthen the evidence base and case for reform amongst the public and policymakers. However, the light-touch assessment sketched out in this note supports the notion that research publishing reform should be a far higher global priority than it currently is. While the potential benefits of reform are complex and hard-to-pin-down, they have the potential to be of global importance, touching all aspects of human progress.</p><p><i>Photo by </i><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@impatrickt?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\"><i>Patrick Tomasso</i></a><i> on </i><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/open-book-lot-Oaqk7qqNh_c?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\"><i>Unsplash</i></a></p>", "user": {"username": "sophie-gulliver"}}, {"_id": "gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF", "title": "Free Tabletop Exercising Course and Resources", "postedAt": "2024-03-28T01:38:46.419Z", "htmlBody": "<ol><li>LGP year in review</li><li>Highlights</li><li>Learnings</li><li>Free Content</li><li>Game system</li><li>Experts needed</li></ol><p>But first, a <i>wholesome </i>photo of us on 'launch day' over a year ago now.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/iy1eeqamh4cv8c0h5epu\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/vfnx1dyqbzyuavdn639n 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/wrpzggrghm4ek7jwznrz 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/rzwa8vp163rix13urecu 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/z6hm3mvkkhzi7ir5s55m 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/rxjagyz62odbhit48jpy 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/j0znvibbmgacbqzju2cc 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/lzptadc97b3cweky6vnw 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/aza3qlbb5c6lwpsgffwd 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/acwm8ix0tre01wna4sys 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gvHEWZFD7a9zsqRPF/msc6vfffhh9obpccwzd3 1200w\"></figure><p>The Long Game Project (LGP) aims to improve institutional decision-making (IIDM), planning, forecasting and creative thinking using tabletop exercises (TTXs) and scenarios.</p><p>We aim to improve the way leaders practise decision-making and thinking when the stakes are low to prepare for when the stakes are high.

Learnings</strong></h2><p>We achieved great impact in our first year, but we could only design and deliver services on-to-one in our current model, not one-to-many.</p><p>To address this, we need a solution that would leverage our services and scale our impact. We also identified a severe mismatch in the marketplace around demand and supply of tabletop exercising skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Many impactful organisations want to run more exercises but are limited usually by:</p><ol><li>No internal capacity/skills to design and run exercises</li><li>Limited budget strategy to assign to low chance/high impact expected outcome work</li><li>Limited access to trained professionals equipped with scope and run exercises with effectiveness</li></ol><p>However, we trialled during the year a model where we upskilled and helped 2 internal facilitators co-design their own games and the outcomes were almost as good (on NPS) as when we designed and facilitated. So this is soft directional data that we can scale impact with a teach-how-to-fish approach.</p><p>Our new strategy is to educate, empower, and certify professionals to conduct TTXs internally and broaden the adoption of tabletop exercises inside organisations. We also want LGP to become financially viable and self-sustaining via a certification-member subscription model. This will allow us scalability and separation from reliance on grants for operation.</p><h3>Implementation Strategy:</h3><p>The Long Game Project is developing <a href=\"https://courses.longgameproject.org/courses\">three comprehensive courses</a> tailored to professionals in TTX facilitation, designed to elevate skills and expertise across various proficiency levels: Foundation, Advanced, and Master.

Game system</strong></h2><p>I have been working for 18 months now on a game system for tabletop exercises. The design aim is for a game system that is simple to learn, flexible for many scenarios but deep enough for subject fidelity when required. We want it to be the default go-to system for quick and dirty tabletop exercises across organisations.</p><p>It is also important to create a community of practice around tabletop exercising, so our approach is to use 5th Edition DnD compatible mechanics as a core to appeal to the widest possible addressable audience for transitional Game Master skills.</p><p>A Game Master should feel comfortable who has played DnD, like, once. The lower the barrier to entry, the better.&nbsp;</p><p>Players should understand the rules and format in 5 minutes of explanation time.</p><p>It should be modular to fit many simulations, exercises, roleplay, and red teaming scenarios to be clipped on top of the core rules, like Lego blocks.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a hard design brief. I have spent hours building a rulebook that got to (at one stage) 160 pages and then whittled it down to core rules that fit on 2 pages. I have made over 100 pages of random tables as supplementary material.</p><p>For now, it is a skeleton. I will give out some beta copies for playtesting soon. Again, if the words '<i>playtest copy' </i>gets you hot under the collar, drop into the <a href=\"https://sendfox.com/trk/click/jyr44xek/kp45g4\">discord</a> and @ me.</p><h2><strong>7.

This is so we can tap shoulders for really deep content. If you would like to be an expert, we can shoulder tap, please let us know.</p><p>Lastly,</p><p>One thing Sanjana the Operator made me think about is an organisational mission statement. What do we stand for? What is our driving purpose?

Still, lots of good ideas are left unexplored. I think one factor here is that it\u2019s unclear how useful most EA forum posts actually end up being, and the incentive to write them isn\u2019t as strong as it could be. Also, there's a coordination problem between people with important questions and people with the time and talent to answer them.</p>\n<p>One way to solve this would be a bounty board on this website for research writeups. In my mind, it could take the form of donation-directing \u2014 e.g. \u201cI will donate $2000 to a nonprofit of the authors\u2019 choice for anyone who can provide a post answering 'How do political campaigns affordably identify undecided voters?' or 'Which common cockroach control methods will cause the least suffering?'\"</p>\n<p>I imagine this as a long bulletin board full of requested forum posts and their associated bounties. Any user who wants to research and produce a writeup on any of these questions is offered some guaranteed impact in the form of getting to direct a donation. The person offering the bounty would get to have their research question answered while also paying in the form of a donation to a highly-effective charity. The bounty could have some minimum standards that need to be met before being paid out, or the payment could be based entirely on the bounty issuer's judgment.</p>\n<p>Here's a short Q&amp;A I made regarding this idea. I haven't thought through it too much, so I'd be curious to continue the conversation in the comments.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why use donation-directing bounties as opposed to normal cash bounties?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Normal cash bounties could be useful here, but I think donation-directing (1) fits the spirit of the EA movement more, (2) may eliminate some incentives for people to game the system out of personal interest, and (3) reduces the perceived cost for the person offering the bounty, since they know the payment will probably go to a high-impact charity and thus have positive effects in and of itself, even if the research doesn't prove useful. I also suspect there would be greater legal implications for the EA Forum in the case of unconditional cash bounties, since it becomes a sort of marketplace. I'm not sure though. In some small way, the EA forum also already does this via <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/bounty-open\">the bounty tag</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is the EA forum the best venue for this sort of thing?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Probably not. But it's the best I can think of right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Let's say the issuer was going to donate a certain amount to effective charities no matter what, and they create a set of bounties for questions they'd like answered, where the bounty total represents the total amount they planned to donate regardless. In this case, what's the incentive to actually pursue a bounty, if it's not causally responsible for a donation to a highly-effective charity?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Lots of people on the forum have different priorities about where money can be best used. Bounty pursuers can still find value in directing the donation to the specific cause and org that they find most promising, even if the money would have been donated anyway. This also rewards causes and orgs that are supported by people with the research skills / general thoughtfulness needed to win a bounty \u2014 people who may also have better judgment when it comes to charitable giving. Of course, this represents an equivalent cost for the bounty issuer, as they lose control of which cause and org will receive their donation. But some bounty issuers are probably fairly excited about various cause areas and feel this cost less strongly than the pursuer feels the benefit.</p>\n<p>Also, some bounties might have a real causal role in increasing the issuer's total charitable giving. I'd be excited to pay for answers to key questions I have above and beyond the amount I plan to donate, and I imagine the same is true for lots of people here.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Should bounties be competitions that reward the best entry or open solicitations that reward the first entry which meets the minimum requirements? If the latter, what if someone completes a bounty first but their contribution is still low-effort, flawed, or misses the central question?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Competitions could be good, and this is most similar to what groups like Open Philanthropy have done in the past, but it also might disincentivize people from pursuing the bounty (as they see a lower likelihood of collecting it) or lead to wasted, duplicative effort as multiple bounty pursuers look into the same question and potentially come to the same answer. However, if multiple bounty pursuers find different answers, that would also be useful and help clarify key uncertainties or identify more room for research.</p>\n<p>If bounties aren't a contest but instead are awarded to the first person meeting the minimum requirements, I'm not sure how to handle determining what the minimum requirements are. Bounty issuers could have full discretion to determine whether bounties pay out or not based on the perceived quality of the bounty collecter's contribution, but the uncertainty might discourage people from pursuing the bounty, and once the research is complete, the issuer has little incentive to follow through and award the donation (especially if they disagree with where the bounty pursuer might want to direct the donation).</p>\n<p>I think the best way to handle this is that bounty pursuers would issue short proposals \u2014 saying that they are interested in collecting the bounty, what their relevant experience is, on what timeframe the post can be done, a \"karma\" system reflecting satisfaction of previous bounty counterparties, etc. Then, if the issuer agrees, they lock-in the arrangement and the issuer commits to paying out a bounty when the research is done. Even if this fails some small percentage of the time, there could be an insurance fund where the EA forum covers bounties in the event that the issuer walks back their agreement. This proposal system also minimizes duplicative effort.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Tyler Johnston"}}, {"_id": "EcWxbHL4eHahQKtQt", "title": "Why we\u2019re entering a new nuclear age \u2014 and how to reduce the risks (Christian Ruhl on the 80k After Hours Podcast)", "postedAt": "2024-03-27T19:17:07.159Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We just published an interview: <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/after-hours-podcast/episodes/christian-ruhl-nuclear-catastrophic-risks-philanthropy/\">Christian Ruhl on why we\u2019re entering a new nuclear age \u2014 and how to reduce the&nbsp;risks</a>.

Other states eventually did acquire nuclear weapons, but in terms of arsenals, those two just towered over all of them. We\u2019re talking orders of magnitude bigger. And that had been the case for a long time, this kind of bipolar order.</p><p>After the Cold War, people in many cases kind of stopped paying attention to this altogether. And what\u2019s happened in the last couple of years is that China seems poised to expand its own arsenal. So in 2020, their number of warheads, <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2021/Nov/03/2002885874/-1/-1/0/2021-CMPR-FINAL.PDF\">best estimate</a>, is in the low 200s \u2014 220 or so. Last year, that was up to 400 something. And now we\u2019re talking 500, and the projections suggest it could be as high as 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035 \u2014 so really this massive increase.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Wow. Yeah. In thinking through the significance of this, I remember <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MCim4PoqmFPCcPy9m/updated-estimates-of-the-severity-of-a-nuclear-war\">when I was learning about nuclear war</a> and nuclear weapons a few years ago, I remember kind of concluding for myself that nuclear war between the US and Russia seemed most terrifying, because they had so many warheads between them that you could get this terrible, scary thing called nuclear winter \u2014 which theoretically seems only likely to happen when you have thousands of nuclear warheads detonated. So one thing that just sticks out to me immediately is like, agh, there\u2019s another global power that might eventually, potentially have enough warheads to create this kind of catastrophic-type outcome.</p><p>Are there other things significant about this, besides just that nuclear wars could be much worse? Well, at least the ones involving China now? For example, things about the kind of game theoretic dynamics of how all of these countries relate to each other?</p><p><strong>Christian Ruhl:</strong> Yeah, that\u2019s exactly right. Not all nuclear wars would be the same, and the very biggest wars would be by far the worst. So I think what you\u2019ve written in the past is exactly right on the issue.</p><p>But yeah, I think there are some structural changes too that happen. So negotiations just become more complex when you have three parties rather than two, and there are issues with targeting when you\u2019re potentially facing two adversaries.</p><p>I think it\u2019s helpful to think about this with an analogy. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an outlaw, and a fellow outlaw has challenged you to a duel. And you\u2019re outside, and the tumbleweed is rolling, and the vultures are flying overhead \u2014 it\u2019s a standoff, and we\u2019ve been in that standoff for a while. And suddenly a third person joins, and you don\u2019t know what to do. Are they going to point their gun at you? And that totally changes the structure of the game.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How AI could change the pace of war</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Christian Ruhl:</strong> AI-enabled warfare changes the risk of nuclear war. You can even just have AI integrated in conventional warfare \u2014 where, let\u2019s say, you automate more and more of the process, where AI-enabled weapon systems are just faster. You have AI-enabled ships, support systems, and many things start happening at machine speed, and shaving off some time here and there. The cumulative result of that might look like <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/12/a-million-mistakes-a-second-future-of-war/\">speeding up the pace of war</a>. In China, they sometimes call this idea \u201cbattlefield singularity.\u201d And in the West, it\u2019s sometimes called \u201c<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/the-future/hyperwar-ai-military-warfare/\">hyperwar</a>.\u201d</p><p>I think it\u2019s kind of a subset of the broader point that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2106/2106.04338.pdf\">AI is this general purpose technology</a>. So we might expect it to transform a whole lot of how our world works, and this is a subset of that.</p><p>To maybe make this more concrete, there\u2019s this article from Michael Horowitz called \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2019.1621174\">When speed kills</a>,\u201d and that gets at some of the intuitions. One of those could be that, with this increasing speed of war, you\u2019re compressing a two-week crisis into two hours, right?</p><p>So imagine the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis\">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> playing out much, much faster. So that might not leave time for people like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Arkhipov\">Vasily Arkhipov</a>, this Soviet naval officer who famously helped prevent a nuclear torpedo launch during the crisis. When things happen so fast, there just might not be time for that.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Interventions to the \"right of boom\"</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Christian Ruhl:</strong> The logic here is we should have a layered defence against catastrophic risks. There\u2019s this great article, I think from 2020, called \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12786\">Defence in depth against human extinction</a>.\u201d So imagine you live in a world, again, with cars \u2014 but no seatbelts, no airbags, or any other safety features. That\u2019s the world we live in right now when it comes to nuclear war. And fundamentally, that\u2019s why I think we should be dedicating more resources to right-of-boom interventions.</p><p>So that\u2019s the general idea, but it\u2019s also, as you suggest, a subtler argument about philanthropic strategy here, and about making allocations in philanthropy under high uncertainty. So fundamentally, this is about taking not just one step back but like 10 steps back, and thinking about the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sops0AM_kTvsKEHnFmwSCbI3pufTujOI9kjUxyDHvQY/edit#heading=h.h6y3yfmlw7ze\">structure of the problem</a> at a really high level, to kind of figure out the most effective ways to do good at the margins.</p><p>So we know a few things about nuclear war. First of all, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sops0AM_kTvsKEHnFmwSCbI3pufTujOI9kjUxyDHvQY/edit#heading=h.ivsf10o9ivxl\">not all nuclear wars are created equal</a>. There\u2019s a qualitative difference between a single weapon going off, and the superpowers unleashing their full arsenals. One of those is, as you said, a truly horrific humanitarian disaster, but it\u2019s mostly local. And the other one is this unprecedented global cataclysm that might well threaten modern civilisation itself.</p><p>So Herman Kahn, the Cold War strategist, has this phrase from his book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Thermonuclear_War\"><i>On Thermonuclear War</i></a>, in which he points to \u201ctragic but distinguishable postwar states.\u201d What he\u2019s saying is the largest nuclear wars are disproportionately worse than smaller nuclear wars, which means that much of the total expected cost there lies with those largest wars. It\u2019s a familiar feature in catastrophic risk; I think <a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/global-catastrophic-biological-risks-a-guide-for-philanthropists\">we see something very similar when looking at pandemics and biosecurity</a>.</p><p>That\u2019s for a few reasons. One of those is, as you pointed out, nuclear winter potentially kicking in. And now it turns out that these very interventions that, as we just established, might be the most important ones from keeping a limited nuclear war from turning into the largest possible nuclear wars, also happen to be the interventions that are very neglected. And from a philanthropist\u2019s point of view, that\u2019s a philanthropic jackpot. That\u2019s exactly what you want.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Nuclear hotlines</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Christian Ruhl:</strong> So back to the car analogy. Let\u2019s say your car suddenly breaks down on the highway: you can honk your horn, you can turn on your warning lights to signal to other drivers you had an accident, you can call somebody to help take care of your car.</p><p>So in nuclear crises, that might include that leader-to-leader hotlines exist, and that they\u2019re actually used as intended if, god forbid, something goes wrong and a nuclear weapon accidentally goes off. I have a report on this called <a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/hotlines-and-global-catastrophic-risk\"><i>Call Me, Maybe?</i></a> that goes into this a bit more, but essentially the US and Russia have this long history of working together to reduce nuclear risks, and that includes the hotline that was established after the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p><p>So if, god forbid, something goes wrong, you can contact the other state and say, \u201cHey, sorry, please don\u2019t nuke us back.\u201d This actually isn\u2019t a literal phone; it\u2019s called the DCL \u2014 the direct communications link. It used to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter\">teletype</a> via cable. Now it\u2019s basically email via satellites.</p><p>One big concrete problem here is that China is very bad at answering during crisis situations. There\u2019s one example here where Chinese leaders didn\u2019t respond to repeated US contact attempts during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan_Island_incident\">Hainan Island incident</a> that was in 2001. So in this incident, Chinese fighter jets got too close to a US spy plane doing routine operations, and the spy plane had to make an emergency landing on Hainan Island. And the US plane contained highly classified technology, and the crew sort of tried to destroy as much of it as possible as they could before being captured. If you read through some of the reports, apparently <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/01/the-online-threat\">they were pouring coffee on it at one point</a>.</p><p>Throughout the incident, US leaders tried to reach Chinese leaders via the hotline, but the Chinese didn\u2019t answer. So the deputy secretary of state at the time <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/RL30946.pdf\">remarked</a>, \u201cIt seems to be the case that when very difficult issues arise, it\u2019s sometimes hard to get the Chinese to answer the phone.\u201d</p><p>So this was 2001. Scary enough back then. I think with heightened tensions now over Taiwan and over the South China Sea, we can imagine what might happen. A Biden administration official recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/06/hotlines-ring-out-chinas-military-crisis-strategy-needs-rethink-says-biden-asia-chief-kurt-campbell\">said</a> that hotlines that have been set up have just \u201crung kind of endlessly in empty rooms in China.\u201d So here we have a concrete problem, a concrete funding opportunity that people actually haven\u2019t looked into much: basically to fund a study to understand Chinese attitudes towards these systems, fund <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_II_diplomacy\">track two diplomatic dialogues</a>, see if they can find common ground on, \u201cHey, maybe pick up the phone?\u201d</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "jCcgAHoN6MKEce9ph", "title": "Come to Manifest 2024 (June 7-9 in Berkeley)", "postedAt": "2024-03-27T21:30:17.275Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>TLDR</h1><p><a href=\"https://manifold.markets\">Manifold</a>&nbsp;is hosting a festival for prediction markets: <a href=\"http://manifest.is\"><strong>Manifest 2024</strong></a>!

I felt like I didn\u2019t have a great picture of all the considerations here, and I felt that people were conflating many different types of arguments for why it might be bad. So I decided to try to write down an at-least-slightly-self-contained description of my overall views and reasoning here.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Tabooing__Race_Dynamics_\">Tabooing \u201cRace Dynamics\u201d</h1><p>I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say that this \u201cis bad for race dynamics\u201d. I think that this conflates a couple of different mechanisms by which releasing Claude-3 might have been bad.</p><p>So, taboo-ing \u201crace dynamics\u201d, a common narrative behind these words is</p><blockquote><p>As companies release better &amp; better models, this incentivizes other companies to pursue more capable models at the expense of safety. Eventually, one company goes too far, produces unaligned AGI, and we all die\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s unclear what \u201cat the expense of safety\u201d means, so we can investigate two different interpretations:</p><p>If X increases \u201crace dynamics\u201d, X causes an AGI company to</p><ol><li>Invest less in evals/redteaming models before deployment</li><li>Divert resources away from alignment research &amp; into capabilities research</li></ol><h2 data-internal-id=\"Did_releasing_Claude_3_cause_other_AI_labs_to_invest_less_in_evals_redteaming_models_before_deployment_\">Did releasing Claude-3 cause other AI labs to invest less in evals/redteaming models before deployment?</h2><p>If OpenAI releases their next model 3 months earlier as a result. These 3 months need to come from *somewhere*, such as:<br>A. Pre-training<br>B. RLHF-like post-training<br>C. Redteaming/Evals<br>D. Product development/User Testing</p><p>OpenAI needs to release a model better than Claude-3, so cutting corners on Pre-training or RLHF likely won\u2019t happen. It seems possible (C) or (D) would be cut short. If I believed GPT-5 would end the world, I would be concerned about cutting corners on redteaming/evals. Most people are not. However, this could set a precedent for investing less in redteaming/evals for GPT-6 onwards until AGI which could lead to model deployment of actually dangerous models (where counterfactually, these models would\u2019ve been caught in evals).</p><p>Alternatively, investing less in redteaming/evals could lead to more of a Sydney moment for GPT-5, creating a backlash to instead invest in redteaming/evals for the next generation model.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Did_releasing_Claude_3_divert_resources_away_from_alignment_research___into_capabilities_research__\">Did releasing Claude-3 divert resources away from alignment research &amp; into capabilities research?</h2><p>If the alignment teams (or the 20% GPUs for superalignment) got repurposed for capabilities or productization, I would be quite concerned. We also would\u2019ve heard if this happened! Additionally, it doesn\u2019t seem possible to convert alignment teams into capability teams efficiently due to different skill sets &amp; motivation.</p><p>However, *future* resources haven\u2019t been given out yet. OpenAI could counterfactually invest more GPUs &amp; researchers (either people switching from other teams or new hires) if they had a larger lead. Who knows!</p><p>Additionally, OpenAI can take resources from other parts such as Business-to-business products, SORA, and other AI-related projects, in order to avoid backlash from cutting safety. But it\u2019s very specific to the team being repurposed if they could actually help w/ capabilities research. If this happens, then that does not seem bad for existential risk.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Releasing_Very_SOTA_Models\">Releasing Extremely SOTA Models</h3><p>Claude-3 isn\u2019t very far in the frontier, so OpenAI does have less pressure to make any drastic changes. If, however, Anthropic released a model as good as [whatever OpenAI would release by Jan 2025], then this could cause a bit of a re-evaluation of OpenAI\u2019s current plan. I could see a much larger percentage of future resources to go to capabilities research &amp; attempts to poach Anthropic employees in-the-know. &nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Anthropic_at_the_Frontier_is_Good_\">Anthropic at the Frontier is Good?</h1><p>Hypothetically if Anthropic didn\u2019t exist, would OpenAI counterfactually invest more in safety research? My immediate intuition is no. In fact, I don\u2019t think OpenAI would\u2019ve created their version of RSPs either, which is a mix of AI research &amp; commitments (although I believe ARC-evals/now-METR started RSPs so OpenAI might\u2019ve released RSPs due to that influence?)</p><p>One could argue that Anthropic caused OpenAI to invest *more* resources into alignment research than they would\u2019ve. One could counter-argue that OpenAI could\u2019ve invested the same resources in other alignment areas as opposed to \u201ccatching up\u201d in RSPs/etc (although RSPs are pretty good relative to whatever else they could\u2019ve done at the time, imo).</p><p>So, there is a real effect where Anthropic being near the frontier has allowed them to become trendsetters for the other labs, leading to more resources being used for safety.</p><p>There\u2019s an additional point that Anthropic releasing Claude-3 allows them to gain more resources. Some of these are taken from OpenAI\u2019s profit margins; others from a higher valuation.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Anthropic having more resources will cause Anthropic to skimp on redteaming/evals or divert resources away from alignment to capabilities. In fact, I believe that extra resources will be poured into evals &amp; other alignment work.</p><p>However, both of these points rely on you liking/trusting Anthropic\u2019s current safety work that they\u2019ve trendsetted &amp; published. One can argue that Anthropic being in the frontier is bad because they\u2019re anchoring AGI labs on safety research that *won\u2019t work*, so it\u2019s actually negative because they\u2019re leading everyone into a false sense of security.</p><p>The tradeoff overall then, is whether Anthropic staying on the frontier &amp; acquiring resources is worth the potential risk of OpenAI not redteaming/evaluating their models as much or OpenAI investing less in alignment in the long-term.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"What_I_Currently_Think\">What I Currently Think</h1><p>I currently believe it\u2019s unlikely that Claude-3 will cause OpenAI to release their next model any sooner (they released GPT4 on Pi day after all), nor for future models. I think it\u2019s possible they counterfactually invest less in alignment then they would\u2019ve if they had a larger lead (w/ Anthropic being one part of that &amp; Google DeepMind being the other).</p><p>I also believe that, historically, Anthropic being at the frontier has had positive effects on OpenAI\u2019s alignment research &amp; commitments (maybe Google Deepmind will release RSPs themselves sometime too?), and Anthropic having more resources is net-positive for leading to aligned AGI.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h1><p>There are many stances people can have regarding \u201crace dynamics\u201d.</p><ol><li>[OpenAI] maintaining a lead is good because they will then do a proper amount of redteaming/evals. I\u2019m concerned that [releasing Claude-3] will cause AGI companies to skimp on redteaming/evals specifically<ol><li>GPT-5 could end up causing catastrophe</li><li>GPT-N could cause a catastrophe &amp; OpenAI skimping on GPT-5 evals will set a precedent for doing for later models<ol><li>Unless this backfires in a Sydney-esque moment</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>[OpenAI] maintaining a lead is good because they\u2019ll then invest more GPUs/researchers into alignment work. I\u2019m concerned that [releasing Claude-3] will cause future GPUs/researchers to be diverted from alignment work to capabilities.</li></ol><p>There is also an opposing Anthropic-specific viewpoint:</p><ol><li>Anthropic being at the frontier has caused more resources from other AGI labs to be poured into evals, RSPs, &amp; government outreach than otherwise would.<ol><li>Counter-point: this trendsetting is bad because the safety work is not sufficient &amp; causes a false sense of security.</li></ol></li><li>Anthropic being on the frontier is good because they can raise more funding &amp; do more alignment research.</li></ol><p>This is likely not all particular stances, so please mention them in the comments!</p><p>I would like to especially thank Buck Shlegeris, Zach Stein-Perlman, &amp; Carson Ezell for comments &amp; discussion.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Appendix_\">Appendix:</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"Capabilities_Leakage\">Capabilities Leakage</h1><p>Capabilities leakages don\u2019t really \u201cincrease race dynamics\u201d. If you publish research that significantly increases in SOTA on [Transformer-RL-3000], that doesn\u2019t mean that OpenAI will skimp on redteaming/evals or counterfactually invest less in Alignment research. You can argue this is negative *for other reasons*, but I\u2019m only saying it\u2019s not the same as a race dynamics argument.</p><p>There are a few paths to capabilities leakage:</p><ol><li>Directly publishing capabilities details &nbsp;Architecture details being inferrable with API access</li><li>Anthropic employees tell others</li><li>Showing what\u2019s possible leaks where to focus research attention</li></ol><p>(1) A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634\">recent paper</a>&nbsp;was able to reverse-engineer the model dimension &amp; weights of the unembedding layer of LLMs only through the API. &nbsp;Their method does not extend to learning the weights of other layers due to nonlinearities; however, they did show you could learn if the model used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06634.pdf#page=15\">RMSNorm or LayerNorm</a>&nbsp;using a very similar method. Other architectural details might also be inferrable. However, I don\u2019t predict anything that actually makes Claude-3 SOTA will be inferred from the API.</p><p>(2) is more of an argument whether Anthropic should pursue capability increases *at all*, because they can do internal research, never release a product, and still have employees tell others at e.g. parties or get hired by other orgs. The cruxes for me would then be (A) does Anthropic select x-risk caring people to work on their capabilities research &amp; (A.2) is there historical precedence for employees leaving for capabilities research. Both of which I don\u2019t have enough information to speculate on.</p><p>But again, this isn\u2019t relevant to whether releasing Claude-3 as a product is net-negative.</p><p>(3) is a most likely argument, imo.</p><p>A few years ago, OpenAI released the capability for GPT to insert text. But how could a uni-directional model insert text? GPT transformers can only output the next token, not middle tokens like BERT. Janus speculated that OpenAI could easily generate massive amounts of data for this by formatting data like<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Original Data: [Paragraph-1] [Paragraph-2] [Paragraph-3]<br>Formatted Training Data: [Paragraph-1] [Paragraph-3] &lt;|specialtoken|&gt; [Paragraph-2]</p><p>Then, during deployment, users can format text like:</p><p>User Data: [Paragraph-1] &nbsp;&lt;|specialtoken|&gt; &nbsp;[Paragraph-3]<br>Formatted Data: &nbsp;[Paragraph-1] [Paragraph-3] &nbsp;&lt;|specialtoken|&gt; &nbsp;[GPT write this part]</p><p>So from just hearing that OpenAI developed a capability, a researcher familiar w/ LLMs can speculate \u201cOh maybe they trained it this way\u201d.</p><p>The same could be true for Claude-3 which is indeed SOTA.\\<img style=\"width:624.00px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DJZkso7xaomcML3wB/ujbogvc6vvtlcvwr9ttw\" alt=\"\"></p><p>So this now becomes dependent on whether any capability advances specific to Claude-3 are ones that OpenAI doesn\u2019t already have (after 12 months after GPT-4). If OpenAI is currently not able to hit the results of the evals, then it\u2019s plausible they could be inspired to speculate how Anthropic achieved these results; to focus their research attention on areas that aren\u2019t dead-ends.</p><p>Additionally, Gemini Ultra evaluations came out before Claude-3, so the counterfactual impact has to include capability advances that are only specific to Claude-3 &amp; not Gemini.</p><p>This is mainly a question that OpenAI employees will know the answer to, but my personal speculation is that there aren\u2019t novel capability advances that OpenAI doesn\u2019t already know.</p><p>However, this would only have a marginal impact. I could see a -3 months effect on timelines at worse.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Is_Increasing_Capabilities_Bad_\">Is Increasing Capabilities Bad?</h1><p>Capabilities research is not bad on its own. Increased capabilities in coding, math, and idea generation could help automate alignment research. Increased bio-weapon capabilities (&amp; evals) could allow larger government asks such as moratoriums on large training runs or confiscation of large compute clusters.</p><p>My current framework on this topic &nbsp;is heavily based off of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zswuToWK6zpYSwmCn/some-background-for-reasoning-about-dual-use-alignment\">Charlie\u2019s Excellent post</a>&nbsp;(I highly recommend). He argues you should view research (alignment or capabilities) as unlocking branches in a tech tree, where some branches end in aligned superintelligences (yay) &amp; others in misaligned superintelligences (booo).</p><p>It makes sense to consider each piece of research w/ the existing research &amp; political landscape, but I\u2019ll leave a fuller exploration of tech trees to future posts.</p>", "user": {"username": "Elriggs"}}, {"_id": "couP8n3BTrpFA5YDJ", "title": "Open Philanthropy: Our Progress in 2023 and Plans for 2024", "postedAt": "2024-03-27T17:03:55.221Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Like many organizations, Open Philanthropy has had multiple founding moments.

While they represent approximately a third of the organizations we contacted, this suggests that a sizable proportion of environmental organizations whose work aligns in some way with animal advocacy (e.g., conservation, sustainability, tackling deforestation) are receptive to the idea of working with animal advocates. Half of interviewees mentioned they would like to collaborate with organizations focused on wild animals, while some are open to partnering with organizations focused on dietary shifts. Others are open to partnering with advocates helping farmed animals, companion animals, or any animal advocacy organization as long as they share some commonalities. These can include sharing similar interests, tactics, values, and/or audience.</li><li><strong>Environmentalists are especially interested in collaborating with animal advocates on legal advocacy, education, and promoting plant-based diets. </strong>Multiple organizations would like to take legal action and develop and/or improve policies and regulations to protect the environment and animals, particularly when it comes to industrial animal agriculture. They\u2019re also open to collaborating on educating the public on the intersection of animal advocacy and environmental issues, as well as working with animal advocacy organizations to promote a reduction in animal products and a shift towards more sustainable diets. Although these were some of the most mentioned collaboration strategies, they are just a few of the many potential tactics described by interviewees.</li><li><strong>The most common challenge animal advocates and environmentalists may encounter in a partnership is having differing views.&nbsp;</strong>Six out of the eight organizations we interviewed recognized there may be differing views and approaches between the environmental and animal protection movements that could pose a challenge for collaboration. In particular, they brought up concerns about differences in opinion about certain topics, differences in the strategies generally implemented by each organization, and differences in what they consider to be the best messaging strategy to address a common audience (e.g., environmental vs. animal welfare messaging; promoting veganism vs. animal product reduction). Organizations also voiced concerns about society\u2019s (negative) perception of animal advocates, the power of the animal agriculture industry in government, the movement\u2019s marginalization of BIPOC and other historically disadvantaged groups, and more.</li><li><strong>By collaborating with animal advocacy organizations, environmental organizations hope to gain more support, resources, funding opportunities, and to add new perspectives to their efforts. </strong>Nearly all interviewed organizations would benefit from sharing resources and support with an animal advocacy organization, such as sharing connections to each other\u2019s networks, knowledge of animal advocacy and environmental issues, and experiences with various advocacy tactics (e.g., diet campaigns). Partner organizations could also seek funding together, granting each other access to funding opportunities normally unavailable to them.</li><li><strong>Environmental organizations\u2019 willingness and ability to collaborate with animal advocates depends on a number of factors, but especially on there being some alignment between them.</strong>&nbsp;It\u2019s important that potential partner organizations share similar values, interests, audience, and/or advocacy tactics (e.g., education or policy work). Other factors that can influence the potential for collaboration include the animal advocacy organization\u2019s reputation, whether the animal advocacy group has an inclusive approach (of historically disadvantaged groups and of people who lead non-vegan lifestyles), and the environmental organization\u2019s capacity to take on a collaboration given the time, money, and personnel involved.</li><li><strong>High-priority countries for farmed animal advocacy are also the world\u2019s top greenhouse gas emitters.&nbsp;</strong>Our research found a strong relationship between countries\u2019 emissions rankings and their potential for effective farmed animal advocacy \u2014 China, the U.S., and Brazil are responsible for over one-third of global emissions (about 40%) and slaughter the highest numbers of farmed animals. The animal agriculture industry is responsible for serious environmental damages in each of these countries, and we see this especially play out as the Global North drives animal agriculture and associated environmental destruction and degradation in the Global South.</li></ol><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Climate change and environmental degradation have harmful effects on the lives of humans and non-human animals alike. Across the globe, we\u2019re seeing the extinction of countless species, destruction of habitats, more frequent and severe natural disasters, food and water insecurity, and more. One key driver of this worldwide destruction is the animal agriculture industry, which indirectly helps unify the causes of animal advocacy and environmental protection.&nbsp;</p><p>Agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gas emissions and has extensive environmental impacts throughout the world.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1086822\"><u>Over one-third</u></a> of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the food sector, and most of these emissions can be attributed to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econofact.org/the-importance-of-the-food-industry-for-climate-change\"><u>animal agriculture industry</u></a>. Emissions from the food sector alone will take the world beyond the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold by 2100 (<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7357\"><u>Clark et al., 2020</u></a>), meaning serious societal, economic, and ecological&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/features/whats-number-meaning-15-c-climate-threshold#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20climate,to%20try%20to%20stay%20below.\"><u>consequences</u></a> for the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the emissions resulting from animal agriculture, the industry is responsible for deforestation, land degradation, air and water pollution, water stress, and biodiversity loss. Nearly half of the world\u2019s habitable land is used for agriculture, and of that land, it\u2019s estimated that 77% is used by the animal agriculture industry for maintaining livestock and for producing animal feed (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food?insight=half-of-habitable-land-is-used-for-agriculture#key-insights-on-the-environmental-impacts-of-food\"><u>Ritchie et al., 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from animal agriculture\u2019s impacts on the climate and environment, there are various other areas of overlap between environmental issues and animal advocacy. For instance, wild animal poaching causes immense harm to individual animals and entire species that may go extinct. This can result in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140212082007.htm\"><u>changes to ecosystems</u></a>, as animals who play a particular role in their functioning are removed. The same is happening in the world\u2019s oceans and freshwater ecosystems as a result of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/plenty-of-fish#:~:text=Apart%20from%20the%20obvious%20issues,degrades%20habitats%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Hubbard.\"><u>overfishing</u></a>, further contributing to biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, and climate change (especially when trawling is involved). Another example is the environmental impact that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sustainablereview.com/protecting-biodiversity-keeping-your-pets-from-harming-local-ecosystems/\"><u>free-roaming companion animals</u></a> like dogs and cats can have, contaminating ecosystems with their feces and greatly reducing biodiversity by hunting other animals.</p><p>Given the overlap that exists between animal advocacy and climate and environmental issues, as well as research indicating that environmental sympathizers are more likely to take pro-animal actions (<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/different-strokes-for-different-folks/\"><u>Faunalytics, 2023</u></a>), this study sought to evaluate the potential for collaboration between organizations working in the animal protection space and those in the environmental movement. Focusing particularly on Brazil, China, and the U.S. due to their high potential for environmental and animal advocacy efforts alike, we used a combination of desk research and interviews with environmental organizations to identify areas of overlap between the two movements and to consider environmentalists\u2019 perspectives about partnering with animal advocates. By doing so, this study complements recent research looking at environmental organizations' willingness to incorporate animal agriculture messaging into their tactics (<a href=\"https://go.mercyforanimals.org/l/939853/2023-11-30/4945y/939853/1701366193YwINkysU/Willing_but_Uncertain.pdf\"><u>Mercy for Animals, 2023</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Research Team</strong></p><p>The project\u2019s lead author was Constanza Ar\u00e9valo (Faunalytics). Dr. Andrea Polanco assisted with the interviews and analysis, and Dr. Jo Anderson (Faunalytics) reviewed and oversaw the work. Interview support was also provided by Zach Wulderk (Faunalytics).</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>With this study, we set out to determine whether there is potential for collaboration between the animal protection movement and the environmental/climate movement in Brazil, China, and the U.S. As our results indicate, the short answer is \u2018yes\u2019\u2014interviewed environmental organizations made it evident that there is indeed interest in such collaborations, with some organizations already partnering with animal advocates. The long answer is more complicated, though still promising, and it involves a combination of environmental organizations\u2019 understanding of what animal advocacy is, the perception that exists of animal advocates both within the environmental movement and by the general public, and potential challenges that should be addressed before an official collaboration is set in motion.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "JLRiedi"}}, {"_id": "cfwxiG8ovaAA9us6t", "title": "[Linkpost] Leif Wenar's The Deaths of Effective Altruism", "postedAt": "2024-03-27T15:35:24.293Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Leif Wenar thoughtfully critiqued EA in &nbsp;\"<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/34412/chapter-abstract/291948395?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false\">Poverty is No Pond</a>\" (2011) &amp; just wrote a critique in WIRED.

GPIs can be used to stimulate competition between countries or states, thereby placing pressure on policymakers to enact particular policy reforms.</p><p>The evidence shows that GPIs can cause policy change, at least in some cases. There are some risks to creating GPIs, like the risk of triggering an emotional public backlash within a country. There are many characteristics that can help increase the chance that a GPI will be successful in its goals and decrease the chance of backlash.</p><p>Here, we consider establishing a new organisation whose sole purpose is to create GPIs for use in animal advocacy campaigns. This organisation would create new GPIs that rank jurisdictions against each other on the basis of the animal welfare policies that can do the most good for animals. For example, GPIs might focus on key welfare protections for farmed chickens, fish, or shrimp, or on government policies that support plant-based foods.</p><p>Overall, we believe that it is indeed worthwhile for the animal advocacy movement to establish a new organisation that creates GPIs for use in animal advocacy campaigns. Establishing this organisation is a relatively small investment for the movement (a couple of full-time staff members), and the GPIs would improve the probability of success for existing animal advocacy campaigns around the world.

Introduction</h1><h2 data-internal-id=\"1_1_What_are_global_performance_indicators__GPIs__\"><strong>1.1 What are global performance indicators (GPIs)?</strong></h2><p>Global performance indicators (GPIs) are sets of rankings in which the performance of various countries (or states, supranational bodies, etc) in a given policy area are compared. GPIs are used, at least for our purposes, as a lobbying tool - by stimulating competition between countries or states, GPIs can place pressure on policymakers to enact particular policy reforms. GPIs also attract attention from the media and the public, making them one way to keep particular policy issues on the political agenda.</p><p>GPIs are also known as rankings, indicators, indices, composite indices, scorecards, or performance assessments. They exist in virtually all policy areas, from climate to corruption to human rights (1). It should be emphasised that we are here discussing GPIs as a political tool for placing pressure on policymakers, not as a scientific tool (1).</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"1_2_GPIs_in_animal_advocacy\"><strong>1.2 GPIs in animal advocacy</strong></h2><p>World Animal Protection produces the <a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/\">Animal Protection Index</a>&nbsp;(API).

The API is frequently cited in the media, and we have heard from many animal advocacy organisations that the API has been a helpful tool during corporate relation campaigns. However, there will always be limits to what any one indicator can achieve. The main limitations specific to the API are:</p><ul><li>The API has a very broad focus, meaning that it is not targeted towards specific policies. This might make policymakers less keen to adopt the lessons from the API.</li><li>The API includes all types of animals affected by humans. This may dilute the message and draw attention away from the most high-impact policy areas (e.g. farmed chicken and fish welfare).</li><li>The API operates at the level of countries. This is useful for countries where the national government has jurisdiction over animal welfare policy; however, in many countries, it is state or subnational governments that have most of the power over animal welfare. In countries where power over animal welfare is held by state governments, it may be more effective to produce indicators ranking the different states.</li><li>The API only measures 50 countries, meaning that it cannot be used by animal advocacy organisations in the rest of the world's countries.</li><li>The API is only updated every few years, rather than every year. This means that the API has fewer opportunities to gain media attention for animal welfare policy.</li><li><a href=\"https://vaci.voiceless.org.au/\">The Voiceless Animal Cruelty Index</a>&nbsp;builds on the Animal Protection Index by focusing more explicitly on farmed animals. The index includes measures for the total volumes of production and consumption of meat and animal products in countries, penalising countries with higher rates of production and/or consumption.</li><li>Animal Legal Defense Fund publishes the <a href=\"https://aldf.org/project/us-state-rankings/\">U.S. State Animal Protection Laws Rankings</a>. This GPI is subnational, comparing different states within the US against each other on the basis of their animal protection legislation.</li><li>Sand\u00f8e <i>et al.</i>&nbsp;show how benchmarks can be used to compare the performance of western European countries in animal welfare during pig production and broiler production (2\u20134). This was mostly an academic/educational exercise, but it gives an example of how countries can be scored on pig and chicken welfare.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.bbfaw.com/\">Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare</a>&nbsp;assesses the animal welfare and regulatory performance across 37 criteria of the top 150 largest food companies. This benchmark targets companies, not governments.</li></ul><p>We are aware of four other GPIs in animal advocacy:</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"1_3_Should_we_launch_a__GPI_Squad__\"><strong>1.3 Should we launch a \"GPI Squad\"?</strong></h2><p>For this approach, we consider establishing a new organisation whose sole purpose is to create GPIs for use in animal advocacy campaigns. This organisation would create new GPIs that rank jurisdictions against each other on the basis of the animal welfare policies that can do the most good for animals. For example, GPIs might focus on key welfare protections for farmed chickens, fish, or shrimp; alternatively, GPIs might focus on government policies that promote plant-based foods. The GPIs could also involve weighting criteria such that the GPI scores are a proxy for the total animal suffering caused (e.g. chicken and fish protection laws carry greater weight than cow protection laws).</p><p>These GPIs could be created at various levels, whether global, regional (e.g. all countries in the EU; or all African countries), or subnational (e.g. all states in Australia). The organisation would then circulate these rankings among local animal advocacy organisations to encourage the rankings' use as a tool in campaigns. A greater number of GPIs would mean that any given jurisdiction has a greater chance of scoring poorly by any one GPI, and therefore having a GPI that can be adopted by animal advocates for campaigns in that jurisdiction. Furthermore, GPIs could be specific to regions (e.g. western Europe; south-east Asia) - regional GPIs could increase the competitive spirit among regional rivals wanting to perform well, and regional GPIs could ensure that policy improvements are seen as more achievable by policymakers (5,6).</p><p>A GPI squad would be a hits-based approach. Many of the new GPIs might have minimal impact, but a handful could have enormous impact by triggering policy reform in a country.</p><p>Campaigns rarely get cheaper than this. A GPI squad would basically require a couple of full-time staff members with an internet connection, plus some way to circulate complete GPIs to animal advocacy organisations in the relevant jurisdiction(s).</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"1_4_Theory_of_change\"><strong>1.4 Theory of change</strong></h2><p>The following diagram summarises the main ways that GPIs could cause policy change (5,7\u201312). There are also some risks that can interfere with policy change (8,13\u201315). Not all of the mechanisms visualised in the diagram are well-supported by the evidence. The evidence behind each of these various mechanisms are discussed further in the following section.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/gafhzic69npynnjrbsuv\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/kubh9dl1yz0nbu8u47m0 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/namanyx6ihismiu6pjgf 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/qtuft1loeewyefvthaoj 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/v454eppuuqpprogdw0td 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/klfub0mjwhizu3qalkh2 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/fhfmcvlw8cxpy9bl4tot 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/acgsaevhtqrqkutz09hf 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/bzbkmsdhmzqizcebygfx 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/z6upedkoywbhlmj72y6f 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pkePa4NSAS5GeGGPN/qx5emkfrmffpagzrldto 1118w\"></figure><h1 data-internal-id=\"2__Do_GPIs_cause_policy_change_\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"2__Do_GPIs_cause_policy_change_\">2. Do GPIs cause policy change?</h1><p>Yes, at least sometimes. The evidence suggests that GPIs can causally influence policy in a desired direction, at least occasionally and in some contexts. GPIs are similar to other forms of lobbying: definitely impactful in some cases, but difficult to measure (16).</p><p>Some of the key publications that provide evidence in favour of GPIs are as follows:</p><ul><li>Western (15)&nbsp;finds a clever way to study the causal effects of GPIs, at least in some policy contexts. The author compares states' positions in GPIs to the speed with which those states ratify various treaties. Since treaties come with a clear \"adopted / not adopted\" signal, the author is able to provide counterfactual evidence about whether GPIs increase the probability of policy change. The author concludes that \"states in the mid-range of the indicator are faster to ratify than states that are not ranked, whereas the other categories are statistically insignificant. These findings imply that indicators matter for those in the middle, but not as much for those at the extremes.\"</li><li>In a book edited by Malito <i>et al.</i>&nbsp;(7), there are many cases of GPIs that have become very powerful (e.g. Human Development Index). There is even mention of \"a civil society organisation (Human Rights and Displacement Consultancy, CODHES) that does activism by producing indicators on internally displaced people and then confronts the national governments with the figures.\"</li><li>The book edited by Kelley and Simmons (9)&nbsp;reviews the evidence of the effects of GPIs. The evidence is limited to a few policy domains, but there are some general insights. As the authors conclude: \"We have shown that GPIs can influence how an issue is discussed and understood and that some GPIs have ultimately altered the content or speed of reforms in the policy areas targeted [...] Sometimes specific laws and practices change as a result of GPIs.\" The authors argue that GPIs \"can have very real effects on the targeted state through a status mechanism\". Policymakers \"know that their state is being ranked\", and that \"their performance will be splashed across the internet\", and so \"they experience social pressure to conform\". The authors point out that \"the media is particularly fond of reporting relative rankings\", so GPIs can help gain media attention for an issue. Finally, the authors emphasise the importance of the GPIs being produced by organisations that are perceived as having expertise.</li><li>One specific chapter in that book deals with the Aid Transparency Index, created by an NGO that was \"small, with nine staff members and a 2017 budget of less than \u00a3600,000\", \"housed in a modest one-room office above an Italian restaurant on London\u2019s South Bank\", and had \"no direct material power\". Nevertheless, this NGO \"used its political independence and first-mover advantage to establish the gold standard for funding transparency\" (9).</li><li>Schleicher (17)&nbsp;reviews international GPIs with a focus on the education system. The author concludes that GPIs are a \"powerful instrument for policy reform\". GPIs can show what is possible; set policy targets and identify policy levers; establish trajectories for reform. GPIs transform a specialised/technical debate into a public debate. The author also gives examples in education where international GPIs have raised public awareness, engaged stakeholders in support of policy reform, and created political momentum - in many cases leading to concrete reforms. Notably, reform has typically occurred when countries score poorly, but reform has also occurred when the scores revealed specific problems that stakeholders were not already aware of (e.g. socioeconomic disparities in learning opportunities in Germany). The author does warn that \"policymakers tend to use them selectively, often in support of existing policies rather than as instruments to challenge them and explore alternatives.\"</li><li>Kelley (18)&nbsp;focuses on \"scorecard diplomacy\", where GPIs are embedded in traditional diplomacy. In other words, Kelley focuses on GPIs that are created by governments to place pressure on other governments. Kelley argues that GPIs have \"the power to shape the reputations of states.\" The author provides evidence that policymakers do become upset when they receive scores that are worse than those of their peers. However, evidence that GPIs actually affect policy remains mixed, largely due to the confounded variables involved in this question.</li></ul><p>There are also many contexts where GPIs have not appeared to cause any policy change. There are many null findings, and some GPIs never matter (9). To illustrate, Dominique<i>&nbsp;et al.</i>&nbsp;(19)&nbsp;provide a pessimistic view of GPIs, drawing on interviews with ICT policy experts in the US and Europe. The authors argue that \"policy-makers use international benchmarking [GPIs] strategically to advance their agendas\". Rather than allowing themselves to be manipulated by GPIs, policymakers \"select those that best suit their agenda and interests, citing results that are favourable and eschewing those that are unflattering.\" Policymakers typically resist \"adopting the 'lessons' of international comparisons\" on the basis of \"the exceptional nature of their national circumstances\".</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"3__The_risk_of_backfire\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"3__The_risk_of_backfire\">3. The risk of backfire</h1><p>There are four main mechanisms that have been identified as potential risks of GPIs:</p><ul><li>Backlash.&nbsp;When the people in a country feel shamed by outsiders, there may be public and political backlash: \"a strong, negative, public, and often angry societal reaction\" (14). A negative emotional reaction can cause policymakers to become <i>more </i>resistant to policy change, which might actually make policy change more difficult than it was in the first place.&nbsp;As Snyder (8)&nbsp;writes, there is a \"well-established risk that backlash of shaming can produce outcomes that are counterproductive for rights\". This is most relevant in jurisdictions that receive a negative score. This is probably a big risk, and there is strong evidence that this does occur (8,13,20\u201327).</li><li>Trade-offs. Increasing the amount of attention for specific animal welfare reforms could take attention away from other important issues (within or outside of animal advocacy) (14). This is probably not a huge risk.</li><li>Counteraction. When policymakers do indeed reform policy, they may strategically weaken policy in other areas at the same time (14). This can allow the policymaker to meet the specific demands placed on them while compensating in other areas (e.g. keeping the industry happy overall). This is probably not a huge risk.</li><li>The tortoise and the hare. If a jurisdiction performs well on a GPI, the policymakers in that jurisdiction may be incentivised <i>not</i>&nbsp;to adopt any new animal welfare policies (15,28,29). However, there is not much evidence that this would actually decrease the probability that jurisdictions would adopt new policies, relative to the scenario where that jurisdiction was not ranked at all.</li></ul><p>Could these risks be a reason <i>not</i>&nbsp;to produce animal welfare GPIs? We think not\u2014while these risks are certainly a reason to exercise caution, they are not a reason to forego GPIs altogether.</p><p>Firstly, the evidence for some of these risks is weak. Strezhnev <i>et al. (14)</i>&nbsp;argue that the \"burden of proof [...] should be as rigorous as those for\" the idea that GPIs work in the first place. As Strezhnev <i>et al.</i>&nbsp;conclude: \"These claims may be plausible; all merit serious attention. But only a few researchers provide systematic evidence for such claims. Even fewer provide evidence that supports their causal arguments.\"</p><p>Secondly, there are ways that the creators of GPIs can reduce these risks. We think that the most significant risk is that of an emotional, public or political backlash\u2014fortunately, there are characteristics that can be adopted when designing GPIs to reduce this risk. We list many of these characteristics below (see \"5. Good GPI design\"). We agree with the conclusion of Strezhnev <i>et al. (14)</i>, who write in the context of human rights: \"The risk of discouraging promotion of international human rights norms based on underidentified causal mechanisms is very serious indeed. Statistical science aside, we would argue that even if committing to and advocating international human rights sometimes cause some harm, this would not necessarily justify silence. Rather, it should prompt consideration of means to blunt the effects of counteraction.\"</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"4__Good_GPI_design\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"4__Good_GPI_design\">4. Good GPI design</h1><p>There are many characteristics that can help increase the chance that a GPI will be successful in its goals (5,7\u20139,14,15,20,21,23\u201325,28,30\u201333). While no GPI will have all of these characteristics, adopting the characteristics that are appropriate for the local context can increase the chance of desired policy change and decrease the chance of an emotional backlash.</p><p>Characteristics of the GPI:</p><ul><li>The GPI focuses on actionable policies to measure/recommend. It is clear what policies are driving the scores.</li><li>The national policies that are measured/recommended are relevant for the local context/situation of the target (6). This might be a reason to make region-specific GPIs; expecting Uganda to adopt the same policies as Switzerland, for example, is not realistic.</li><li>Target policymakers are made to feel like they can readily move up in the rankings, and it is clear how they can do so.</li><li>The GPI focuses on practices with low cultural salience (e.g. animal husbandry practices that nobody feels too strongly about), rather than practices that are perceived to be important for culture and tradition (e.g. bullfighting).</li><li>GPIs are updated and released regularly (e.g. annual reports).</li><li>GPIs presented in a visually appealing format.</li><li>Low-ranking jurisdictions are targeted using absolute, homogenising standards (e.g. a single category of \"leading animal welfare countries\" that they could join). High-ranking jurisdictions are targeted using relative standards that make explicit comparison to other countries (e.g. a numbered ranking/comparison of multiple rival countries against each other) (34).</li><li>The GPI's creator is perceived as fair, knowledgeable, competent, and independent from political actors. The GPI's creator has existing authority and respect, especially in the culture of the target country. The organisation could be a cultural insider or a highly respected outsider.</li><li>The target of the GPI is specific and acceptable. For example, a GPI may target specific ministries or even individual policy makers, rather than non-elite farmers or the country/culture as a whole.</li><li>The GPI is used to place pressure on the peers of the target, especially if the target is elite. For example, a high-ranking politician may be insulated from criticism, so the GPI could instead aim to have the politician's colleagues, associates, or friends and family be the ones to place pressure on the politician.</li><li>Target policymakers have political buy-in; they are given the opportunity to be involved in the creation of the GPI and/or to review the scores before publication.</li><li>The target jurisdiction has an existing, functional civil society. There are enfranchised individuals and organisations who already oppose, or are not strongly attached to, the government in power.</li><li>Criticism is respectful, focused on policy, and aimed towards solution. The criticism does not centre on character flaws.</li><li>The GPI is framed as technical advice for solving a specific problem, not as moral criticism.</li><li>Neither the GPI creator nor the criticism itself is perceived as threatening (e.g. farmers feeling threatened by activists; public feeling threatened by risks to food security/wealth).</li><li>Local culture and norms are respected. Criticism is framed as an inconsistency between the target's identity (e.g. if a country values having a sustainable food system) and the poor policy performance. Alternatively, animal welfare is tied to the identity of a high-status out-group with which the target policymakers want to identify (e.g. countries that are \"internationally competitive\" for investments; \"environmentally responsible\" countries). Care is taken to reduce the ability of the target to invoke sovereignty and/or cultural traditions as justification for avoiding policy change.</li></ul><p>Characteristics of a GPI's creator:</p><p>Characteristics of the target policymakers:</p><p>Characteristics of the way that policy critiques is framed:</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"5__Cost_effectiveness_analysis__CEA_\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"5__Cost_effectiveness_analysis__CEA_\">5. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)</h1><p>Basically every researcher (including us) who has published on the topic of GPIs trips over themselves to emphasise how difficult it is to measure the policy impact of GPIs precisely. The context is critical. This presents a problem if we want to understand the cost-effectiveness of GPIs.</p><p>There are two ways of looking at this problem. Firstly, we could make a back-of-the-envelope calculation. For example, let's make some reasonable assumptions:</p><ul><li>A GPI squad would need a couple of talented employees, together costing somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000 USD per year.</li><li>Such a team could probably produce, say, a dozen sets of GPIs each year. We would not expect every GPI to have a policy impact. We might expect, conservatively, that one set of GPIs every few years causes a policy to be implemented where that policy would not have otherwise been implemented. It is also worth noting that each set of GPIs would target multiple countries, making this a very conservative estimate.</li><li>Under these assumptions, it would cost the movement a few hundred thousand US dollars to buy a counterfactual policy.</li><li>These GPIs would typically be aimed at the most numerous groups of farmed animals in a particular region, like chickens, fish or shrimp. It is standard for an averaged-sized country to have somewhere in the vicinity of 10 million chickens alive at any one time.</li><li>If you divide the impact (millions of animal-years benefitted per year) by the costs (a few hundred thousand dollars), the number of animals helped per dollar does seem potentially high (e.g. comparable to corporate cage-free campaigns (35)). Also, after the first couple of years of operation, the GPI squad would have a much more informed view about these assumptions.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, rather than the quantitative back-of-the-envelope calculation, we could instead consider this qualitative argument:</p><ul><li>We know two things with medium or high confidence. Firstly, GPIs <i>do</i>&nbsp;cause policy change, at least sometimes (see above section, \"Do GPIs cause policy change?\"). Secondly, producing GPIs is dirt cheap. A GPI squad could consist of just a couple of full-time staff members and an internet connection, as long as there is a way to circulate the resulting GPIs to animal advocacy organisations in specific countries.</li><li>Therefore, the cost-effectiveness probably hinges not on the cost of producing GPIs, but the relative balance of benefits versus risks.</li><li>We believe that the risks are probably pretty small, for reasons explained in the above section (\"The risks of backfire\").</li><li>Therefore, a GPI squad is probably a worthwhile investment for the animal advocacy movement.</li></ul><h1 data-internal-id=\"6__Conclusion\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"6__Conclusion\">6. Conclusion</h1><p>Here, we have considered establishing a new organisation whose sole purpose is to create GPIs for use in animal advocacy campaigns. We believe that it is a worthwhile investment for the animal advocacy movement to launch such an organisation. It would be critical for this organisation to: focus on the most numerous farmed animal populations (e.g. chickens, fish and shrimp); design the GPIs to minimise the risk of backfire; and, after a couple of years, produce a better-informed cost-effectiveness estimate to test whether it is worthwhile for the organisation to continue operating.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"References\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"References\">References</h1><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broome A, Homolar A, Kranke M.

The number primarily depends on the total donations we receive for the program. In previous rounds, we have awarded between 35 and 52 grants per year. We expect that this year\u2019s number of grants will be similar.&nbsp;</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=9ERSExhzNSmEofTST\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p><strong>\u2192 What do you anticipate the range of grant amounts to be?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The minimum we will award an individual or organization is $5,000 USD, and this year, we have removed the cap on the maximum amount we will award grantees. However, we are unlikely to award many grants above the previous cap of $50,000 USD\u2014this is because Movement Grants remains focused on supporting earlier-stage organizations and organizations working in countries with emerging animal advocacy movements. In both cases, most applicants typically apply for less than $50,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, we awarded several partial grants. This was because the Movement Grants Committee felt that those projects could still be completed with reduced funding and that it would be more impactful to award the additional funds to another organization. Based on feedback from our grantees about the challenges some have faced with partial funding, we anticipate fulfilling the full amount of more grant requests this round. This is likely to result in fewer grants being awarded. That being said, we are still likely to award some partial grants.&nbsp;</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=9ERSExhzNSmEofTST\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p><strong>\u2192 What are some speculative or early-stage programs that you've funded that were deemed successful investments later on?</strong></p><p>Many of the projects we fund via Movement Grants are happening at younger, smaller organizations, so there are two \u201cearly-stage\u201d groups: (i) early-stage organizations in regions with a nascent animal advocacy movement, and (ii) early-stage projects happening at either newer or more established organizations that are expanding their programmatic work.&nbsp;</p><p>We funded several early-stage organizations in 2023 that we think are doing impactful work in their global region. Most (but not all) of those organizations received general operating funds rather than funding for specific projects. One such group is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goodgrowth.io/\"><u>Good Growth</u></a>, which received a Movement Grant to continue work in two areas to accelerate the growth of sustainable and ethical food systems in Asia. The first area is open-access market research to understand local stakeholders, farming systems, and consumer attitudes and identify locally relevant interventions. They launched a website that makes public datasets more accessible for advocates and funders, and this grant allowed them to scope out the demand for and potential impact of this project. The second area was community engagement and capacity-building to facilitate knowledge-sharing and build advocates\u2019 research skills. This included conducting outreach by delivering workshops at animal advocacy events and producing content for their website.</p><p><i>See the original FAST Forum post for more examples of early-stage projects we funded in 2023.</i></p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=coc6paHpDiu8Ky5TL\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><h2>Eligibility</h2><p><strong>\u2192 I received a Movement Grant last year, am I eligible to apply again?</strong></p><p>Yes!

This means that the grant awarded is only meant to be used for the work described in the application. On the other hand, the general support grant agreement allows the organization to spend the grant at their discretion, so we evaluate the applicant based on all areas of work in their organization. If you are applying for a particular project and there is no specific end date or final milestone, we recommend setting the end date as June 2025, which is one year from when the grant is awarded.&nbsp;</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=iisuwoAbCbTefFtgC\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p><strong>\u2192 Do you accept grant applications from organizations preferring to remain anonymous or not publicly acknowledged as grantees?</strong></p><p>You can apply and request to remain anonymous. If successfully awarded a grant, we would only publicly list the amount and that it went to an anonymous organization.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no question in the application form asking if you would like to remain anonymous, but you can note \u201canonymous\u201d in the preferred name field so we are aware of your preference. If awarded a grant, we will ask you for feedback on our announcement post, providing another opportunity to request that your grant remain anonymous if you have not already made us aware.&nbsp;</p><p>(Source: Email query)</p><p><strong>\u2192 Can master\u2019s and Ph.D. students apply for Movement Grant for their research projects?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;The program is open to applicants undertaking research, so master\u2019s and Ph.D. projects are eligible to apply for funding. Note that we typically award grants to research organizations, mid-stage career researchers, and research programs because their work is often more likely to have real-world outcomes for animals than master\u2019s or Ph.D. students\u2019 research projects. However, we don't want to discourage you from applying, and we strongly advise that in your application you include how the research will ultimately help animals. For example: Will the findings of your research be used by animal advocacy organizations, governments, or industry? How will you ensure the users of your research will see your work and adopt its findings? This is needed so that we can understand the potential impact of your work.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, we are unable to award grants to individuals working outside of the U.S. Please ensure your university or another organization can act as a fiscal sponsor to receive a grant if awarded.&nbsp;</p><p>(Source: Email query)</p><h2>Application and Decision-Making Process</h2><p><strong>\u2192 What are the differences between the project-specific and general support applications?</strong></p><p>Through our Movement Grants program, we provide funding for both specific projects (restricted funding) and general operational support (unrestricted funding), including salaries. Unless you need funding for a specific project, we recommend applying for general operational support. You will not be favored for applying for one over the other.&nbsp;</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=JC5bpsw9pJtqM5idX\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p><strong>\u2192 If an organization has been previously funded, is it better to request funding for a specific project or general funding?</strong></p><p>This year, we are asking applicants to either apply for a single project through our project-specific application or for general support.

If you spend the grant before that period concludes, you are welcome to report on your achievements earlier (there is a question in the application that invites you to provide a date to report earlier), but this is not required.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information, see our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/movement-grants/process-and-timeline/\"><u>Process and Timeline</u></a> for Movement Grants.&nbsp;</p><p>(Source: Email query)</p><p><strong>\u2192&nbsp; What points should a good proposal include?</strong></p><p>If you fill out all the required fields in the application form, we will have enough information to make a decision on your proposal. Some questions on the application have additional guidance written in gray that should give you a better understanding of the points we are looking for in those answers. If we have any additional questions about your proposal, we will ask you during the second stage of the application process.&nbsp;</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=Z4cT2qhaWyYKkqXKB\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p><strong>\u2192 Do you conduct interviews with applicants at any point in the process?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We receive several hundred applications, so we do not have the capacity to interview applicants.

Or is it best to apply for the lowest possible amount needed to carry out the project?</strong></p><p>We have previously awarded partial funding to organizations that we thought could complete their project with less funding, and where disbursing the additional funds to another organization would benefit animals more. We do this because our program is highly funding-constrained compared to the number of quality applications we receive.</p><p>Depending on the size of the grant being considered (if it is over $20,000), we will often follow up with the applicant to understand whether they would be able to deliver the project with partial funding. Requesting more in the first stage is unlikely to hurt your chances of being awarded a grant, provided you sincerely believe that being awarded more will substantially improve the impact of your project\u2014we might well agree! Conversely, if it appears that an applicant has excessively padded their budget with unnecessary line items, we would look unfavorably upon this.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a question in the application form about breaking down your budget. This is where you note what is necessary for your project and what is nice to have. We suggest you also explain how the nice-to-have line items would further help animals; this will help us decide whether to fulfill the requested amount or offer partial funding.&nbsp;</p><p>(Source: Email query)</p><p><strong>\u2192 The bottom of the grant application states, \u201c</strong><i><strong>Use this area to submit additional documents&nbsp;requested by the funder, outside of those normally required in each step.</strong></i><strong>\u201d Can this section be used to provide documents that describe the project in more detail, or is it strictly meant for documents ACE requests during the application process?</strong></p><p>If you fill in all mandatory questions in the application form, that will be sufficient information to make our grantmaking decisions. You can include extra documents like the ones mentioned, but they won\u2019t be the focus of our decision-making. In the second stage of the process, we usually ask follow-up questions to applicants if we need more clarification.&nbsp;</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=fK6nt5vap55W9MKrG\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p><strong>\u2192 What criteria, tools, and factors do you consider when determining if a salary is too high or too low?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We look at staff salaries to get a sense of what we think is fair and realistic to achieve the goals of a project. However, we err on the side of trusting charities to set suitable salaries for their particular region. We are not experts in global nonprofit salaries and tend to do more of a high-level red flag check than a deep dive into proposed salary budgets.&nbsp;</p><p>Some examples of past red flags we have raised are if we see a salary that we think is unjustifiably low for the role and aims of a project or if we see a salary line item that we are unsure is necessary or should perhaps be paid by an institution rather than ACE. We rarely (if ever) receive applications that include seemingly unjustifiably high salaries. In cases of red flags, we tend to ask the applicant direct follow-up questions rather than making assumptions with no additional information. A salary line item would rarely be why we reject a proposal.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=xZTftuncHd6sjagbS\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p><strong>\u2192 Do you consider the number of organizations you have funded in a particular country as a cause for not funding all applicants?</strong></p><p>No, we do not. We often fund multiple organizations in a single country. That said, reviewing numerous applications in a country can make it easier to compare interventions and often allows us to identify which ones appear more promising. We ask applicants to provide their Theory of Change and their geographical, political, or cultural context so we can determine which projects in a given country are likely to be the most impactful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=GabZsiG5LCaENXgXb\"><u>Source</u></a>)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u2192&nbsp;Are you likely to fund projects that involve supporting both volunteers and staff (e.g., full-time lawyers or project coordinators)?</strong></p><p>Our likelihood of awarding a grant for the type of work you describe depends on the number of applications we receive, the strength of those applications, and the amount of funding we have available. It also depends on the jurisdictions you are working in, the number of animals that may be impacted by your work, and how well-funded the type of work is.

A number of other funders in the animal advocacy space use Granti, so some applicants may already be familiar with the platform. Although we are using the same platform, our grantmaking programs are separate. We cannot see any applications you have submitted to other funders, and they cannot see the application you submitted to ACE.&nbsp;</p><p>This is our first time using Granti.

We prioritize applicants based on whether they are using novel interventions, target large numbers of animals, and/or operate in regions that are underrepresented in animal welfare. While we\u2019ve previously funded more projects working on farmed animal advocacy, this is due to the fact that limited organizations are working on wild animal welfare. We would like to see more projects addressing wild animal suffering apply for Movement Grants.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://forum.fastcommunity.org/posts/YCavu5eBHXJGy2Wx3/hi-fast-we-re-from-animal-charity-evaluators-ace-and-we?commentId=uHAFNGmFKxiqQR9Rd\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p><strong>\u2192 Are there any restrictions on using grant funding for lobbying activities, and if so, is there a threshold for how much of the funding can be allocated to lobbying?</strong></p><p>Movement Grants has a restriction on the amount we can award to lobbying, but this restriction applies to the total Movement Grants program, not to any individual grant.

Yet, a wide variety of wild animals continue to make their homes in and around dense urban areas. Experts increasingly accept that human, animal, and environmental health are intrinsically linked. In this vein, cities have the opportunity to consider how they can adapt their built infrastructure to promote the wellbeing of the human as well as nonhuman residents that share these spaces.</p><p>This panel will bring together experts in local policy, building sustainability, and wild animal welfare to discuss how cities and other local actors can shape their policies for land use and the built environment to better promote the welfare of wild animals. As part of the discussion, researchers from NYU will present findings from a newly-released report that identifies promising policy options for cities to consider, ranging from bird-friendly building materials to green infrastructure design and prohibitions on gas leaf blowers.</p><p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://guarinicenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Wild-Animal-Welfare-in-Local-Policies-Policy-Brief.pdf\"><strong>full report</strong></a>.</p><p>Read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://guarinicenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Wild-Animal-Welfare-Local-Policies-Highlights.pdf\"><strong>highlights</strong></a>.</p><h3>Speakers</h3><p><strong>Alisa White</strong>,&nbsp;<i>Legal Fellow</i>, Guarini Center<br><strong>Alexandra Silver</strong>,&nbsp;<i>Director</i>, New York City Mayor's Office of Animal Welfare&nbsp;<br><strong>Cecil Scheib</strong>,&nbsp;<i>Chief Sustainability Officer</i>, NYU Office of Sustainability<br><strong>Dr. Mal Graham</strong>,&nbsp;<i>Strategy Director</i>, Wild Animal Initiative<br><strong>Jeff Sebo</strong> (moderator), <i>Co-Director of the Wild Animal Welfare Program &amp; Associate Professor of Environmental Studies</i>, New York University</p>", "user": {"username": "Group Organizer"}}, {"_id": "TvqmoNc3n6PQM8NG9", "title": "What is the nature of humans general intelligence and it's implications for AGI?", "postedAt": "2024-03-26T16:22:21.844Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Humans seems to have some form of generality.

There are at least two options that I've thought of.<br>1) A general intelligence is intrinsically better at solving problems<br>2) A general intelligence is better at solving problems in general because it is capable of absorbing social information about problems. And society has information about solving lots of different problems.<br><br>Option 2 is the one I lean towards as it fits with the evidence. Humans spent a long time in the stone age, with the same general architecture, but now can solve a much larger set of problems because of education and general access to information.<br><br>The difference is important because it has implications for the solving of novel problems (not solved by society today).

This is related to the classic worry about a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/repugnant-conclusion\">repugnant conclusion</a>&nbsp;where a very large world with low average welfare may have more total welfare than a far smaller world with very high average welfare.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"ijm6itdoay\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefijm6itdoay\"><sup><a href=\"#fnijm6itdoay\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I think there is some theoretical plausibility to the existence of this tradeoff: as we introduce more people into a world, there are more interests that warrant moral and political consideration, and sometimes these interests will clash and not all be satisfiable. As a toy example, if too large a fraction of people have a strong desire to have a private planet not shared with others, achieving a larger future will necessarily require countering these welfare interests of existing people.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref10\">However, there are also reasons to think people will benefit from being in larger worlds: there may be more and better art produced, faster scientific and technological progress, and a greater diversity of social/cultural niches people can choose from.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"rdh7k2ps6d\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrdh7k2ps6d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrdh7k2ps6d\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Moreover, if there is a transhumanist future with digital minds and significant influence&nbsp;over what our future selves or descendants will value,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"bepyz4tpgj4\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbepyz4tpgj4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbepyz4tpgj4\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;it seems quite likely people will choose to not have hard-to-satisfy tastes, to avoid being dissatisfied.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"10\" data-footnote-id=\"61pgkmmbxt3\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref61pgkmmbxt3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn61pgkmmbxt3\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Instead, we may choose to prefer the simple pleasures of e.g. doing abstract maths and writing poetry with our digital friends. These \u2018simple tastes\u2019 could be very cheap to satisfy in terms of energy and materials, which would mean the tradeoff between average welfare and population size could be very weak.</p><p>The framing of a \u2018repugnant conclusion\u2019 feels repugnant to many people for precisely cosmic NIMBY reasons - in the thought experiment we generally identify more with the people in the small utopia and don\u2019t want to imagine ourselves losing that in favour of the large mediocre world. So the fact that many people share the repugnant conclusion intuition is perhaps some evidence in favour of cosmic NIMBYism&nbsp;being the default future, as most of us don\u2019t intuitively feel the (putative) moral importance of the future being large as strongly as we feel the importance of average welfare being high.&nbsp;It may also be hard to separate out the often co-occurring views that \u2018I personally don\u2019t want to live in a large mediocre world, for self-interested reasons\u2019 and \u2018I think having a high average welfare is more morally important than having a high total welfare\u2019.

While it caught the majority of us by surprise, the occurrence of a global pandemic was, and continues to be, something we must learn to expect. In the last 500 years, there have been at least 15 epidemics with a death toll in excess of 1 million (that is one every 33 years on average), and historically, pandemics were able to nearly wipe out whole civilizations. Even if the risk of a global pandemic occurring in any given year is small, it is not zero or negligible, resulting in a substantial threat to the future of humanity in the long run. In fact, there are other contributors to the gravity of this risk. While in the past we may have had to deal with natural pathogens only, the technological developments in biological engineering we have seen over past decades create a tangible risk of malicious actors designing and building synthetic pathogens. AI has been seen as an enabling technology across a range of domains, and it is a matter of concern to which extent it can contribute to biological risk.</p><p>Recent&nbsp;empirical evaluations of large language models (LLMs) have found that AI assistance can improve human attempts to plan biological attacks, at least to some extent (<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/building-an-early-warning-system-for-llm-aided-biological-threat-creation\">OpenAI 2024</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03809\">Soice et al. 2023</a>), although other reports have claimed no effect (<a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2977-2.html\">Mouton et al. 2024</a>, <a href=\"https://www.biotech.senate.gov/press-releases/aixbio-white-paper-4-policy-options-for-aixbio/\">NSCEB 2024</a>). Even though responsible AI labs may release biologically capable AI models only when they have been trained to be safe (for example, generally refusing to assist with bioterrorism), skilled actors could overcome these guardrails&nbsp;through jailbreaks or other means (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04249\">Mazeika et al. 2024</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693\">Qi et al. 2023</a>). Moreover, capable AI models released with public weights can have these safeguards entirely removed, eliminating the&nbsp;ability to prevent malicious use (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18233\">Gopal et al. 2023</a>). Several groups are actively researching these risks of AI-assisted bioterrorism including the use of LLMs, but model evaluations have limitations as a means for ensuring safety (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-capabilities-and-risks-discussion-paper\">UK DSIT 2023</a>). In contrast, some perspectives suggest that carefully guiding technological advancements could lead to a more secure world&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4213670\">Sandbrink et al. 2022</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13916.pdf#page=11\">Hendrycks et al. 2022</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html#dacc\">Buterin 2023</a>). In this vein, the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/\">2023 Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence</a>&nbsp;calls for an assessment of \u201cthe ways in which AI applied to biology can be used to reduce biosecurity risks, including recommendations on opportunities to coordinate data and high-performance computing resources.\u201d Despite this potential, there is limited research on how thoughtful development and scaffolding of AI models may be able to differentially advance biosecurity, without&nbsp;contributing to their pre-existing biological risk potential.</p><p>This report centers on LLMs as their usefulness in various applications, including language processing, data analysis, and decision-making, has increased markedly over the last year, creating a gap in understanding how this new technology could be leveraged to enhance biosecurity.&nbsp;We note that various special-purpose machine learning algorithms have been developed to make biosecurity-relevant predictions (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19612-0\">Alley et al. 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00459-8\">Syrowatka et al. 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34719136/\">Sykes et al. 2022</a>); continued developments in classic machine learning for biosecurity will be valuable, although it is not the focus of our report. The use of LLMs and LLM agents in biotechnology has been perceived as offense-dominant, in which defensive improvements in biosecurity may not keep pace (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18233\">Gopal et al. 2023</a>). Given the disproportionate number of individuals working on biosecurity relative to bioterrorism, we hypothesized that assisting scientists with&nbsp;relevant LLM-based assistants could accelerate progress in developing safety measures that prevent and tackle a range&nbsp;of biological&nbsp;threats, including pandemics, without assisting biorisk (<a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/practices-for-governing-agentic-ai-systems.pdf\">Shavit et al. 2023</a>).</p><p>While a substantial portion of biological research that can be accelerated by LLMs has dual-use potential, for many roles in the biosecurity field, there need not be overlap with the type of work being done by potential bad actors. Many helpful interventions seem to be purely beneficial such as research on public health, far-UVC, and metagenomic sequencing, among others. However, the application of AI in these domains is under-explored and we are still far behind in being able to prevent or even respond to an engineered pandemic. Without strategic application and control, more advanced AIs make this risk increasingly likely. Therefore, there is a significant motivation for developers of AI to aid biosecurity researchers as soon as possible.</p><p>This report outlines our findings and progress from five weeks of research and interviews. Here, we attempt to define the specific roles LLMs could play in supporting biosecurity researchers to tip the scales toward defense, laying the groundwork for future research. Our interviews with biosecurity experts (Table 1 and Materials and Methods)&nbsp;highlighted current limitations of AI in biosecurity, such as issues with data hallucinations and lack of domain-specific functionalities. This report aims to lay the conceptual groundwork for future development in this area.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><i>Table 1: Overview of the dataset (n = 9)</i></td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Number of interviewees per industry type</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Nonprofits and Charitable Organizations</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">5</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Academic and Educational Institutions</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Corporate and Think Tank Entities</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Governmental and Regulatory Bodies</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">1</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Number of interviewees in a leadership position</strong></td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">3</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h1 data-internal-id=\"Materials_and_Methods\">Materials and Methods</h1><p>The initial phase of the project involved conducting interviews with nine external biosecurity experts in various industries (Table 1).

However, LLMs are recent technological developments (OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard/Gemini were released 14 and 9 months ago, as of the time of writing, respectively) and far from having reached maturity. We thus wondered about their current use among biosecurity professionals. The majority (7/9) of interviewees do use LLMs in their work, and a third do so frequently (Fig. 1)</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zdf68ussjyAgtSmw4/q37aaus0sswkxilmcq5v\"></p><p><i>Fig. 1: Current levels of LLM adoption among surveyed biosecurity professionals. Prompt: Do you use LLM services in your work?</i></p><p>Interviewees listed experiencing a range of shortcomings using the current versions of LLMs in their work (Table 5). Most notably, LLMs are seen as providing low-insight information which contains inaccuracies and is poorly referenced. LLMs are unable to correctly intuit the relative importance of a range of parameters and stakeholders\u2019 views that influence the information in its inputs (either user-provided or in the data it has been trained on). This is a particularly important consideration in the area of policymaking, where unwritten rules, informal relationships, and diverging interests are important and common. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, current versions of LLMs also struggle to fully obey user\u2019s instructions, although this is likely to improve as the technology develops.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><i>Table 5: Perceived shortcomings of LLMs</i></td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\"><ul><li>Poor trustworthiness (hallucinations, excessive creativity)</li><li>Missing and incorrect referencing</li><li>Insufficient information depth and lack of insight</li><li>Inability to correctly intuit relative weights of input and external parameters</li><li>Inability to fully follow instructions (disregarding some of the input, not respecting boundaries)</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 data-internal-id=\"Development_of_new_LLM_based_tools_can_advance_biosecurity\">Development of new LLM-based tools can advance biosecurity</h2><p>The adoption of LLMs is poised to transform a number of work-related tasks and increase worker productivity across a wide range of occupations. Knowledge workers in particular are more likely to see a larger portion of their work-related tasks exposed to the effects of LLMs (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130\">Elondou et al. 2023</a>). As an example, users adopting GitHub Copilot for programming report less time spent on coding tasks, increased productivity, improved code understanding, and a greater sense of satisfaction (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15033\">Dohmke et al. 2023</a>). Among our interviewees, the majority report using LLM tools in their work (Fig. 1), despite their perceived shortcomings (Table 5).</p><p>Broadly speaking, adapting LLMs to specific domains can improve their usefulness. When LLMs can read relevant information before responding to user queries (retrieval-augmented generation), they can provide more factual answers that avoid hallucination (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07559\">L\u00e1la et al. 2023</a>). Pretraining models on code is well-known to be necessary for coding performance (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12950\">Rozi\u00e8re et al. 2023</a>), and likewise for math (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300\">Shao et al. 2024</a>). Fine-tuning language models to follow user instructions makes them substantially easier to use (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155\">Ouyang et al. 2022</a>), but available chatbots are fine-tuned with human preference data that is not adapted for biosecurity.</p><p>It was our goal to better understand the needs of biosecurity professionals and arrive at concrete suggestions for future development of LLM-enabled tooling that would be the most useful in their work. To do so, we directly prompted the interviewees for their needs and wishes, as well as conducted independent research and ideation. This led us to identify a range of directions for future development including a DURC potential evaluation tool, AI lab safety officer, and chatbots to aid generating and proposing implementable policies (the top five are summarized in Table 6). These LLM applications could be conceivably prototyped through a combination of high-quality prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, and excellent user interface design.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" rowspan=\"1\"><i>Table 6: Examples of LLM-based tools that could be helpful to biosecurity</i></td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" rowspan=\"1\"><ul><li>General-purpose research assistant for biosecurity<ul><li>Integrated with a search tool to retrieve relevant biosecurity articles and papers, perhaps similar to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://consensus.app/\"><u>Consensus</u></a> but with better curation of sources</li><li>Suggest diverse stakeholders that may be affected and relative importance/impact</li><li>Suggest and help defuse counter-arguments</li></ul></li><li>Chatbot for assisting biosecurity policy<ul><li>Attempt to generate implementable policy ideas</li><li>List stakeholders, open calls, related funding, and so on</li><li>Given this and user-provided input data, generate a draft</li><li>Train on previous successful and failed policy proposals</li></ul></li><li>Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) potential evaluation tool<ul><li>Red-team research proposals and, if applicable, suggest ways that they could be made safer from a biosecurity perspective</li><li>Grant applications could be a natural place to integrate this tool, as many biology researchers may not seriously think through dual-use concerns, though it is important that the tool does not inspire bioterrorism</li></ul></li><li>Biosecurity text style adjustment tool<ul><li>Reflect the role, status, and political views of the target audience</li><li>Adjust style to appeal to a target audience or medium (such as report, memo, blog post, e-mail)</li></ul></li><li>Virtual lab safety officer<ul><li>Review experimental plans and lab books based on safety protocols</li><li>Review video footage to highlight potential unsafe practices (assuming vision-language model)</li></ul></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 data-internal-id=\"Biosecurity_specific_datasets_to_aid_the_development_of_new_LLM_tools\">Biosecurity-specific datasets to aid the development of new LLM tools</h2><p>As our research highlights, biosecurity is a niche with specific user profiles and requirements that determine how the users interact with and benefit from LLMs. A large part of the perceived LLM shortcomings (Table 5) reflect the tools\u2019 lack of appreciation for the specifics and subtleties of research and policy-making. While we have suggested a few examples of LLM-based tools to help with biosecurity (Table 6), we also realize that any LLM is only as good as the data it has been trained on. In view of this, we created a <a href=\"https://github.com/martinholub/awesome-biosecurity-datasets\">list of 75+ publicly available datasets</a>. This repository also includes a community wishlist for datasets and resources that do not yet exist.</p><a class=\"ck-cta-button ck-cta-button-centered\" data-href=\"https://github.com/martinholub/awesome-biosecurity-datasets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub: awesome-biosecurity-datasets</a><h1 data-internal-id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h1><p>As a dual-use technology, advanced LLMs could have the potential to exacerbate biological risk by aiding bioterrorists, especially given concerns around the rapid advancement in general LLM capabilities. To help mitigate this risk, it is valuable to explore the development of biosecurity-focused LLM assistants that can accelerate biosecurity research. In our exploratory interviews with biosecurity professionals, we have found that the majority use LLMs like ChatGPT, at least on occasion, but to a limited extent, in their work. Current LLM tools in use have a number of shortcomings, such as poor trustworthiness and lack of insight, which mean that they have a limited impact on the interviewees\u2019 workflows. We suggest various LLM-based assistants that could be developed for biosecurity tasks. These could be created as AI agents with access to custom biosecurity tools, or as specially fine-tuned models, for example. We also contribute a list of datasets that could be integrated with AI for biosecurity purposes.</p><p>Our report is an initial foray into investigating how LLM-based technologies could be leveraged to improve biosecurity. &nbsp;It is worth noting that improvements in general AI capabilities can improve their usefulness for biosecurity but can also increase their potential to assist with bioterrorism. We emphasize efforts that differentially improve biosecurity, especially ones that are neglected by standard market forces. We propose several topics for future research:</p><ul><li><strong>Comprehensively outlining biosecurity tasks</strong>: Biosecurity is a broad and interdisciplinary field, and our selection of experts interviewed does not cover all promising areas of biosecurity. Similar to the <a href=\"https://www.onetonline.org/\">O*NET database</a>, it would be valuable to create a thorough inventory of tasks involved in biosecurity and evaluate their susceptibility to automation by LLMs or LLM agents. After prioritizing these tasks by what is most impactful for reducing catastrophic biological risk, this could serve as a basis for developing AI biosecurity assistants.</li><li><strong>Prototyping and evaluating AI biosecurity assistants</strong>: One direction for future research is to develop AI assistants that have improved performance for biosecurity \u2013 for example, through tools that allow them to retrieve relevant information from trusted sources, or fine-tuning data that trains them to produce higher-quality responses. Similar to how OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3814132622/\">recruits expert AI trainers</a>&nbsp;to improve an LLM\u2019s software engineering capabilities, AI labs could have dedicated efforts to curate data for biosecurity performance. Iterative development in response to user feedback and ongoing model evaluations are important to ensure that the AI assistants are actually useful for biosecurity.</li><li><strong>Forecasting how AI advancements aid bioterrorism vs biosecurity</strong>: As our interviewed experts leaned towards believing that AI advancements would generally increase biorisk rather than decrease it, it is valuable to have advance understanding of the most likely ways they&nbsp;would do so, and which developments in biosecurity could alleviate this.</li><li><strong>Clarifying safe and unsafe biological capabilities for AI</strong>: Some types of expertise (e.g., in virology) may have applicability with biosecurity but also could aid with bioterrorism. While recommending the development of AI biosecurity assistants, we do not recommend generally accelerating AI capabilities, especially with respect to expertise that presents dual-use national security risks. Relatedly, we recommend the creation of safety standards for AI models that could increase biological risk (<a href=\"https://www.biotech.senate.gov/press-releases/aixbio-white-paper-4-policy-options-for-aixbio/\">NSCEB 2024</a>).</li><li><strong>Field building for innovation in AI for biosecurity</strong>: In the realm of cybersecurity, the White House has partnered with major AI companies to launch a two-year competition for AI to improve the software security of critical infrastructure (<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/09/biden-harris-administration-launches-artificial-intelligence-cyber-challenge-to-protect-americas-critical-software/\">White House 2023</a>). We believe that biosecurity could benefit from analogous efforts to discover ways that AI could help mitigate biological threats (see also, <a href=\"https://www.biotech.senate.gov/press-releases/aixbio-white-paper-4-policy-options-for-aixbio/\">NSCEB 2024</a>).</li></ul><p>As foundation models have a growing impact on society, it is essential to steer their development to ensure the potential to increase biological risk is minimized. To complement ongoing evaluations of potential LLM-assisted biorisk and research into safety mitigations, we recommend developing LLM assistants specialized for biosecurity tasks. If this topic is adequately studied, a society with advanced AI capabilities could be prepared for biological threats through two means: by preventing the release of AIs with unsafe biological capabilities, as well as through the deployment of AIs continually working to improve biosecurity.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"DURC_Statement\">DURC&nbsp;Statement</h1><p>We have asked several security professionals to review this paper in order to flag any content that may have DURC potential. We believe that this final version advances biosecurity without contributing to biorisk.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h1><p>The project is grounded in the broader context of global catastrophic biological risks (GCBRs) and is incubated through BlueDot Impact\u2019s Pandemics Course, which aggregates a diverse pool of biosecurity professionals.

They\u2019ll be assessing projects <i>retro</i>spectively using the same criteria they would use to assess a project <i>pro</i>spectively. Scott Alexander explains:</p><blockquote><p>[Retro] funders will operate on a model where they treat retrospective awards the same as prospective awards, multiplied by a probability of success. For example, suppose [the Long Term Future Fund] would give a $20,000 grant to a proposal for an AI safety conference, which they think has a 50% chance of going well. Instead, an investor buys the impact certificate for that proposal, waits until it goes well, and then sells it back to LTFF. They will pay $40,000 for the certificate, since it\u2019s twice as valuable as it was back when it was just a proposal with a 50% success chance.</p><p>Obviously this involves trusting the people at these charities to make good estimates and give you their true values. I do trust everyone involved; if you don\u2019t, impact certificate investing might not be for you.</p></blockquote><p>As a (very) rough approximation, the four philanthropic retro funders usually disburse about $5-33 million per year. They are:</p><h2><strong>1.

We don\u2019t have enough time or space to talk about all of the ones we\u2019re excited about, but here are a few of our faves, from each of:</p><h2>Austin</h2><h3><strong>\u201c</strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/run-a-public-onl\"><strong><u>Run a public online Turing Test with a variety of models and prompts</u></strong></a><strong>, by </strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/cameron\"><strong><u>camrobjones</u></strong></a><strong>.\u201d</strong></h3><p>Cam created a Turing Test game with GPT-4. I really like that Cam has already built &amp; shipped this project, and it appears to have gotten viral traction and had to be shut down due to costs; rare qualities for a grant proposal! The project takes a very simple premise and executes well on it; playing with the demo makes me want to poke at the boundaries of AI, and made me a bit sad that it was just an AI demo (no chance to test my discernment skills); I feel like I would have shared this with my friends, had this been live.</p><p>Research on AI deception capabilities will be increasingly important, but also like that Cam created a fun game that interactively helps players think a bit about how for the state of the art has come, esp with the proposal to let user generate prompts too!</p><h3><strong>\u201c</strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/commission-an-ac\"><strong><u>Quantifying the costs of the Jones Act</u></strong></a><strong>, by </strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/BalsaResearch\"><strong><u>Balsa Research</u></strong></a><strong>.\u201d</strong></h3><p>Balsa Research is funding an individual economist or a team to conduct a counterfactual analysis assessing the economic impact if the Jones Act was repealed, to be published in a top economics journal.</p><p>I like this project because the folks involved are great. Zvi is famous enough to almost not need introduction, but in case you do: he's a widely read blogger whose coverage of AI is the best in the field; also a former Magic: the Gathering pro and Manifund regrantor. Meanwhile, Jenn has authored <a href=\"https://jenn.site/2023/05/things-i-learned-by-spending-five-thousand-hours-in-non-ea-charities/\"><u>a blog post about non-EA charities</u></a> that has significantly shaped how I think about nonprofit work, runs an awesome <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/jenn/how-many-paper-units-will-be-in-the\"><u>meetup in Waterloo</u></a>, and on the side maintains this great <a href=\"https://codexcc.neocities.org/\"><u>database of ACX book reviews</u></a>. (seriously, that alone is worth the price of admission)</p><p>I only have a layman's understanding of policy, economics or academia (and am slightly bearish on the theory of change behind \"publish in top journals\") but I robustly trust Zvi and Jenn to figure out what the right way to move forward with this.</p><h3><strong>\u201c</strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/write-and-publish-handbook?tab=comments#d32aacb2-1457-4eeb-b354-fd49e9ee4f34\"><strong><u>Publish a book on Egan education for parents</u></strong></a><strong>, by </strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/brandonhendrickson\"><strong><u>Brandon Hendrickson</u></strong></a><strong>.\u201d</strong></h3><p>Brandon wants to publish a book on education for parents based on Kieran Egan's educational theory. He walks the walk when it comes to education; his <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-book-review-the-educated-mind\"><u>ACX Book Review</u></a> contest entry on the subject was not only well written, but also well structured with helpful illustrations and different text formats to drill home a point. (And the fact that he won is extremely high praise, given the quality of the competition!) I'm not normally a fan of educational interventions as their path to impact feels very long and uncertain, but I'd be excited to see what Brandon specifically can cook up.</p><p>(Disclamer: I, too, have some skin in the game, with a daughter coming out in ~July)</p><h2>Lily</h2><h3>\u201c<a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/start-an-online-\"><strong><u>Start an online editorial journal focusing on paradigm development in psychiatry and psychology</u></strong></a><strong>, by </strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/Psychcrisis\"><strong><u>Jessica Ocean</u></strong></a><strong>.\u201d</strong></h3><p>Jessica\u2019s project takes up the mantle of a favorite crusade of mine, which is \u201cactually it was a total mistake to apply the scientific method to psychology, can we please do something better.\u201d She\u2019s written extensively on psychiatric crises and the mental health system, and I would personally be excited to read the work of people thinking seriously about an alternative paradigm. I\u2019m not sure whether the journal structure will add anything on top of just blogging, but I\u2019d be interested to see the results of even an informal collaboration in this direction.</p><p>(Note that I probably wouldn\u2019t expect the SFF or LTFF to fund this; ACX Grants 2025 maybe, and the EAIF I\u2019m not sure. But <i>I\u2019d</i> be happy to see something like it exist.)</p><h3><strong>\u201c</strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/an-online-scienc\"><strong><u>An online science platform,</u></strong></a><strong> by </strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/pravsels\"><strong><u>Praveen Selvaraj</u></strong></a><strong>\u201d</strong></h3><p>I think generating explanatory technical visuals is both an underrated use of image models, compared to generating images of mysteriously alluring women roaming the streets of psychedelic solarpunk utopias, and an underrated use of genAI for education, compared to chatbots that read your textbook over your shoulder. I\u2019d like to see more 3Blue1Brown in the world, and in general I\u2019m optimistic about people building tools they already want for their personal use, as Praveen does.</p><h2>Saul</h2><h3><strong>\u201c</strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/educate-the-publ\"><strong><u>Educate the public about high impact causes</u></strong></a><strong>, by </strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/alexkhurgin\"><strong><u>Alex Khurgin</u></strong></a><strong>.\u201d</strong></h3><p>Alex wants to build a high-quality YouTube show, and seeks funding to make three episodes of the show on AI risk, antimicrobial resistance, and farmed animal welfare. This is something that I could pretty easily imagine the LTFF, EAIF, and possibly SFF retrofunding, and I'd additionally be excited about more people knowing about them &amp; reducing their expected negative impact on the world.</p><p>Alex\u2019s (and his team\u2019s) track record is also pretty great: they\u2019re clearly experienced &amp; know what they\u2019re talking about. I\u2019d be interested in getting a better path to impact \u2014 what do they plan to do after they click publish on the videos? \u2014 but I\u2019m sufficiently excited that I\u2019ve invested a token $50 in Alex\u2019s project to credibly signal my interest.</p><h3><strong>\u201c</strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/distribute-hpmor?tab=comments#43bcf7dd-c866-409b-baf2-befd86f855af\"><strong><u>Distribute HPMOR copies in Bangalore, India</u></strong></a><strong>, by </strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/adityaarpitha\"><strong><u>Aditya Arpitha Prasad</u></strong></a><strong>.\u201d</strong></h3><p>Anecdotally, the answer \u201cI got into HPMOR\u201d has been quite a common response to the question \u201chow did you become interested in alignment research?\u201d Mikhail Samin has had (from what I\u2019ve seen) a lot of success doing something like this in Russia, and I\u2019m excited about starting a similar initiative in India. This grant seems to fall pretty clearly within the range of retrofunding from the LTFF and/or EAIF. I\u2019ve invested a token $50 in Aditya\u2019s project to credibly signal my interest.</p><h1>Links &amp; contact</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Click&nbsp;<a href=\"https://manifund.org/causes/acx-grants-2024?tab=certs\"><u>here</u></a>&nbsp;to browse open projects and start investing; click <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-hheZ__cNFm6yRXgKs8biY_D7ZOOSkmHD-aTn54CEBBQG9Q/viewform\"><u>here</u></a> to apply to our micro-regranting program.</p><p>If you\u2019re interested in learning more about investing on an impact market, donating to projects directly, or even just chatting about this sort of thing, you can email&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/\"><u>saul@manifund.org</u></a>&nbsp;or book a call&nbsp;<a href=\"https://savvycal.com/saulmunn/manifund\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><hr><p><i>Note: this is a slightly edited linkpost of \"</i><a href=\"https://manifund.substack.com/p/acx-grants-2024-impact-market-is\"><i>ACX Grants 2024: Impact market is live!</i></a><i>\" In particular, that writeup included details about our micro-regranting program, applications for which are now closed.

Abstract thinking, setting our schedule, recalling facts, and other measurable skills will take us far. Every project brief or job description I see has the phrase \"data-driven\" in it. Data is very, very important.&nbsp;</p><p>We should be content with any form of improving our cognitive skills. When Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) platforms like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera</a>&nbsp;launched, I was excited about learning from universities I saw in movies. I could finally access&nbsp;<i>the best&nbsp;</i>education. A better future was one math test away.</p><p>The Standards Movement of the 1990s made it easy to measure the quality of education. The best student scored the highest in measurable skills, and the best teacher taught the students with the highest scores. I often speak with educational non-profits, EdTech, and institution leaders, and they agree that we must move away from standardization.</p><p>This is not a modern stance. Education critics from the 20th century opposed standardized delivery methods, curriculums, and classroom tests.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Savage-Inequalities-Children-Americas-Schools/dp/0770435688\">Jonathan Kozol</a>&nbsp;said they conditioned conformism, hindering creativity. Paul Goodman warned how planning the same future for all children would lead to idle consumers in a rat race of competitive, meaningless work. Similar debates happen today daily on and off campuses; if only we had more numbers to finally listen.&nbsp;</p><p>These leaders also highlight another skill set crucial for educational and socio-emotional success: non-cognitive skills. Non-cognitive skills include perseverance, ability to act on long-term plans, socio-emotional regulation, attentiveness, and self-confidence. They impact earnings, employment, labor experience, college attendance, teenage pregnancy, participation in risky activities, compliance with health protocols, and participation in crime.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262535052/giving-kids-a-fair-chance/\">Economist James Heckman</a>&nbsp;found:</p><blockquote><p>\"One percent increase in either type of ability has roughly equal effects on outcomes across the full distribution of abilities.<i>\"</i>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Now that many educators agree that non-cognitive skills can be equal or more important predictors of success, it doesn't make sense (for-profit decisions aside) not to walk the talk.</p><p>It is frustrating that many people in leadership positions recognize these issues but can't disrupt how their institutions operate. There is too much bureaucracy. Higher-ups show up for unscheduled meetings to talk about profit. Alternative education methods, such as those from Waldorf, Montessori, and St. John's, seem to work on developing cognitive and non-cognitive skills, yet nothing beats the reliable \"strategy\" of running summer classes.</p><hr><p>AI tutors and MOOCs seem to solve so many issues in traditional education. Khan Academy's AI tutor,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.khanmigo.ai/\">Khanmigo</a>, offers self-paced, personalized tutoring. Another,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.synthesis.com/tutor-trial?_stsgnoredir=1&amp;_configname=webflow_experiments\">Synthesis Tutor</a>, teaches children about Egyptian hieroglyphics and algebra while weaving in Drake memes. There can be a lesson plan, but it's flexible and adapted to each student. Expanding access to education yields large returns on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hec.4565\">well-being</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096319?origin=crossref\">health</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B978008044894701215X\">financial future</a>. Often, any education is better than no education; it is better if personalized.&nbsp;</p><p>However, AI tutors, at least for now, don't address any of the problems they say they want to solve or imply they are solving. AI isn't a <strong>\"great equalizer</strong>\" simply because it increases the supply of cognitive skills at a lower cost and on a bigger scale. Believing this diminishes the influence of crucial variables affecting someone's long-term future. These factors include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-015-9351-1\">parents and children who do not value education</a>, being born into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17441730600700598\">families without both parents or abusive parents</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-Radical-Rethinking-Poverty/dp/1610390938\">lack of encouragement to learn from parents, teachers, and institutions</a>, biases towards specific knowledge and people deserving of education, competition between siblings, living in high-risk areas and other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01403.x\">unfavorable social environments</a>.</p><p>It seems that the current versions of AI tutors could actually further widen the gap between students who wait to be told what to do (most) and those who can own their self-education (minority). Most of last century's students didn't have these non-cognitive skills, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Global-Achievement-Gap-Survival-Need/dp/0465002307\">Education Researcher Tony Wagner</a>&nbsp;argues, and current ones don't.</p><p>Wagner assessed classroom rigor and college readiness during a visit to early colleges funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. In a chemistry course, there were three students whose mixture was the only one giving off a spiral of smoke. Wagner asks what went wrong, and they say, \"Donno, we must have mixed it wrong.\" They don't dare to hypothesize about what went wrong or even know what a hypothesis is. All they knew was that they had followed a recipe, something had gone wrong, and an authoritative figure could fix it.</p><p>It's nice I can ask a 24/7 AI tutor what went wrong and how to be guided to an answer. It's nice to feel like there is always an answer. Nevertheless, even if there were always one, most people would only seek it if told to do so.</p><p>There are exceptions; there are always exceptions.</p><p>The founder of an alternative education school for children shared that some of its alums formed a study group to complete an Ivy League Computer Science program independently. They taught themselves through peer-to-peer tutoring, discussions, and accountability and later got jobs at enviable startups.</p><p>I would be more convinced by the great equalizer narrative if everyone possessed the non-cognitive skills of these teenagers, but most of us lack this inner motivation. At 19, I began to self-teach myself communications and went on to work for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasforerocommunications/\">around fifty startups</a>. I'm a nerd who reads about five books a month. I can easily schedule every hour of my day. Not everyone is like me, and I am not a sample of someone with incredible non-cognitive skills. I do not enroll in MOOCs, use AI tutors to build curriculums of what I'm learning, or have Socratic dialogues with ChatGPT. I know these tools exist, but I don't use them for self-learning. I, a privileged nerd devoted to literacy, resist these tools. <strong>How could we assume a child living with one parent in rural Peru who has to work after classes would do any better just because they have 5G?</strong></p><p>I do not expect infant versions of AI tutors to solve global educational and wealth inequalities. I do not expect them to ever target foundational causes of poverty, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00453/full\">malnutrition</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay0214\">the cycle of mental illness</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/99/3/1176/5810068?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">divorce rates</a>, generational poverty's correlation to the present one, lack of affordable housing, etc. However, some advocates for AI tutors frame them as if they could solve these issues, and I am saying no, their current versions can't.</p><p>We must find a middle ground when discussing the benefits of AI education. While we should acknowledge AI's potential and encourage researchers, educators, and scientists to continue improving it, we must also avoid over-glorifying the benefits that, while valuable, are mostly limited to the scaling of education supply. Most of us agree that we are more than just numbers on a board and require unmeasurable skills to navigate the world. Only by acting as such can we truly educate more people.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Nicolas Forero"}}, {"_id": "dSz3n5XvpFCmRtqo7", "title": "Podcast: Interview series featuring Dr. Peter Park", "postedAt": "2024-03-26T00:35:29.458Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Check out the Into AI Safety podcast on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5AGzrA4jo6mgZuibVabTLM\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/into-ai-safety/id1720206246\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/b2071152-dac7-4225-ab09-460b1e59eb82/into-ai-safety\">Amazon Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@IntoAISafety/podcasts\">YouTube Podcasts</a>, and <a href=\"https://linksta.cc/@intoaisafety\">many other podcast listening platforms</a>!</p><p>As always, the best things come in 3s: dimensions, musketeers, pyramids, and... 3 installments of my interview with Dr. Peter Park, an AI Existential Safety Post-doctoral Fellow working with Dr. Max Tegmark at MIT.</p><p>The sub-series runs approximately 3 hours and 40 minutes in total, during which Dr. Park and I discuss <a href=\"https://www.stakeout.ai/\">StakeOut.AI</a>, a nonprofit which he cofounded &nbsp;along with Harry Luk and one other cofounder whose name has been removed due to requirements of her current position.&nbsp;</p><p>The non-profit had a simple but important mission: make the adoption of AI technology go well, for humanity, but unfortunately, StakeOut.AI had to dissolve in late February of 2024 because no granter would fund them.

During the late summer and early fall of 2023, I spent a very large number of hours researching/writing a 10k+ word post directed toward the Effective Altruist community. &nbsp;My proposal was that the use of genetic enhancement technology could be used to benefit humanity, and that it was an overlooked potential cause area. The title was \"<a href=\"/posts/gaSHkEf3SnKhcSPt2/the-effective-altruist-case-for-using-genetic-enhancement-to\">The Effective Altruist Case for Using Genetic Enhancement to End Poverty</a>.<strong>\"&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The thesis of the article is that cognitive ability (as measured by IQ) influences many positive outcomes at the individual and national level. National IQ is positively associated with development and highly associated with the log of GDP/c. I next discussed the unfortunate fact that environmental interventions on IQ are typically either short-term, \"hollow\", or ineffective. I then explained several possible genetic enhancement technologies and how the potential returns could be absolutely massive, and how these could have positive societal returns from all. Finally, I proposed several potential ways of accelerating progress on this front.</p><p>The post was not particularly well-received initially. And it recently came under scrutiny again. Part of the motivation for this post is that the post currently has -16 karma (<a href=\"https://archive.fo/Iniaw\">archive</a>), but an average read-time of only 4 minutes and 56 seconds according to analytics. Since the article is a 42 minute read, it would appear likely that some people may be spending little time on it before voting. It appears that this has caused the post to be hidden from search with (<a href=\"https://archive.fo/LhuZG\">archive</a>) and without quotes (<a href=\"https://archive.ph/WAwQA\">archive</a>)-- perhaps on account of the negative votes? I contacted EA help who thanked me for flagging this and said they would pass it to the tech team (thank you!).&nbsp;</p><p>This is unfortunate since it means that it is practically undiscoverable using the forum. At least one EA forum member, felt this wasn't enough, saying: \"That said, your post contributes quite a lot to me feeling embarrassed to be an EA, and of my feeling of not being at home here. I think more so because it is tolerated and implicitly endorsed by CEA by virtue of not being removed or something like that.\" With the downvotes, it seems others may feel similarly. So, I want to pose this as a question of how I can better advocate for genetic enhancement and possibly be better received by EA and the forum more generally? I don't want to give up on this cause because I think it's important.</p><p>Here are some of the criticisms I have already receieved and how I responded or would respond now:</p><ul><li><strong>Criticism for whiteness/talking about non-white countries/eugenics</strong>: According to analytics, the post received a large number of downvotes following a post by Ulrik Horn's post \"<a href=\"/posts/PvzdP6T5KQDSXWiSm/why-i-care-so-much-about-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-1\">Why I care so much about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in EA</a>\" in which he said: \"A few examples of my bad experiences in EA (and this is from me generally steering clear of EA events because I have been disappointed so many times now): [...] EAF posts on eugenics (e.g. posts like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/ives-parr?from=post_header\"><u>this&nbsp;</u></a>by white people on eugenics in poor, non-white countries) [...]\" Horn says he should have dropped the word \"white\" from his comment but that he still feels worse if the author is white and that the post \"contributes quite a lot to me feeling embarrassed to be an EA.\" (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PvzdP6T5KQDSXWiSm/why-i-care-so-much-about-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-1?commentId=8w9K7pc7NhZpHsGtu\">comment</a>)<ul><li>my post is broadly applicable to the whole world, but the point is that poverty could be highly alleviated in the least developed nations. EAs are constantly focusing on the less developed countries, so I cannot see why that is particularly bad. I never said \"non-white\" countries, so Horn contrasting me being white (which he assumed) with the article focusing on non-white countries seems to be trying to introduce a racial framing into the argument which I did not myself make. I responded to the \"eugenics\" accusation in the article. My proposal is advocating for consensual reproductive choices, not coercive eugenics.&nbsp;</li><li>I don't see the relevance of my race as to whether or not my article is true or good. Is that fair? or how should I overcome the issue of my whiteness (I'm neither confirming nor denying that I'm white) so as not to give bad experiences to or embarrass or alienate EA's like Horn? I could (a) not write articles on EAF at all, (b) recruit non-white coauthors, (c) ask a non-white person to write the article for me, (d) only focus on improving the lives of whites &nbsp;(that doesn't seem right).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Criticism for citing Manking Quarterly: </strong>Bob Jacobs spent a long time discussing one of my citations of MQ, noting that it has nasty associations saying he does not want to pay to see the article. I respond, and he clarifies that \"to clear up any confusion I don't think a journal being made by horrible people allows you to conclude that their conclusions are false, but I do think it allows you to not give them any money.\" (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gaSHkEf3SnKhcSPt2/the-effective-altruist-case-for-using-genetic-enhancement-to?commentId=bgKWHtbnwqFpyFx8W\">comment here</a>). I offered to email him the pdf of the article twice, but he did not take me up on the article. How could I be better? I'm not sure on this one.</li><li><strong>Criticism for neglect of cultural/education: </strong>Bob Jacobs says that one of my citations mentions the possibility of cultural factors or education. Which I discussed at length the issue with (fadeout/hollow), so he responds that the gains may be hollow but we don't know what actual intelligence is. I preemptively addressed this point in the article &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gaSHkEf3SnKhcSPt2/the-effective-altruist-case-for-using-genetic-enhancement-to#II__Institutions_and_Intelligence\">II. Intelligence and Institutions</a>) and then again in my response (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gaSHkEf3SnKhcSPt2/the-effective-altruist-case-for-using-genetic-enhancement-to?commentId=WmrjLwXkrMCQRoBjY\">comment here</a>).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Criticism of Lynn: </strong>Bob Jacobs criticizes the quality of Lynn's data. He mentions one of Wicherts et al.'s articles. I made a point to mention that Lynn updated the estimates in the original article over the past ~20 years. Moreover, I pointed to many other researchers who produced highly correlated estimates with Lynn (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gaSHkEf3SnKhcSPt2/the-effective-altruist-case-for-using-genetic-enhancement-to?commentId=WmrjLwXkrMCQRoBjY\">comment here</a>). Once again, I feel as though I preemptively addressed this criticism in the original article (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gaSHkEf3SnKhcSPt2/the-effective-altruist-case-for-using-genetic-enhancement-to#III__The_Importance_of_National_IQ\">III. The Importance of NIQ</a>). See below. I don't think we should just throw out the idea because the most important figure in NIQ is controversial. <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GX7qdCaFfzdk4KoKf/mefa6lhlu3l2yezphssj\"></li><li><strong>Criticism of NIQ generally</strong>: another commenter said \"Not an expert in the area, but the data on National IQ seems <a href=\"https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39\">shoddy</a> at best, fraudulent at worst. Due to the number of potential confounds, I don't put much stock in cross-country regression analyses, especially when run on such poor data.\"<ul><li>I thought that I asked constructive questions in response: \"Can you point me to a measure of cognitive ability that is both better and does not show a moderate-strong correlation with NIQ scores? From the article, I provided several studies that use testing data like PISA to create scores of mental ability (some calling it \"harmonized learning outcomes\" or \"universal basic skills\"), but these have a moderate to strong correlation with NIQ scores anyway. What other good data on cognitive ability are you using to inform your beliefs? I provided an estimate of NIQxlog(GDP/c) at 0.82. What do you think the actual value is and how do you reach that number?\"</li></ul></li></ul><p>You can read the comments <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gaSHkEf3SnKhcSPt2/the-effective-altruist-case-for-using-genetic-enhancement-to\">here</a>. I felt I responded in a respectful manner and addressed the point or responded constructively. There was not a lot of engagement overall, but the article still ended up downvoted to the point of being unviewable on the forum.</p><p>In my mind it seems that this is something that could be a real positive force in the world, but it seems that it has been highly rejected by the EA forum (-16 karma).

For this reason, we suspect that there is likely substantial work that ought to be done at a smaller scale first to better understand consciousness and its implications for alignment.

As a result, many also believe that the right software could in principle allow there to be something it is like to inhabit a digital computer, controlled by an integrated circuit etched in silicon. A recent expert report concludes that if consciousness requires only the right causal relations among a system\u2019s inputs, internal states, and outputs, then \u201cconscious AI systems could realistically be built in the near term.\u201d (Butlin et al. 2023: 6) If that were to happen, it could be of enormous moral importance, since digital minds could have superhuman capacities for well-being and ill-being (Shulman and Bostrom 2021).</p><p>But is it really plausible that any system with the right functional organization will be conscious - even if it is made of beer-cans and string (Searle 1980) or consists of a large assembly of people with walky-talkies (Block 1978)? My goal in this paper is to raise doubts about what I take to be our strongest argument supporting the view that consciousness is substrate independent in something like this sense.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"lty5qhhnjub\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflty5qhhnjub\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlty5qhhnjub\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The argument I have in mind is Chalmers\u2019 Fading Qualia Argument (Chalmers 1996: 253\u2013263). I show how it is possible to resist the argument by appeal to two key assumptions: that consciousness is associated with vagueness at its boundaries and that conscious neural activity has a particular kind of holistic structure. Since these assumptions are controversial, I claim only to have exposed important weaknesses in the Fading Qualia Argument.</p><p>I\u2019ll begin in section 2 by explaining what the Fading Qualia Argument is supposed to show and the broader dialectical context it inhabits. In section 3, I give a detailed presentation of the argument. In section 4, I show how the argument can be answered given the right assumptions about vagueness and the structure of conscious neural activity. At this point, I rely on the assumption that vagueness gives rise to truth-value gaps. In section 5, I explain how the argument can be answered even if we reject that assumption. In section 6, I say more about the particular assumption about the holistic structure of conscious neural activity needed to resist the Fading Qualia Argument in the way I outline. I take the need to rely on this assumption to be the greatest weakness of the proposed response.</p><h3><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/how-to-resist-the-fading-qualia-argument-mogensen/\">Read the rest of the paper</a></h3><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"lty5qhhnjub\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnlty5qhhnjub\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"lty5qhhnjub\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreflty5qhhnjub\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>See the third paragraph in section 2 for discussion of two ways in which the conclusion supported by this argument is weaker than some may expect a principle of substrate independence to be.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Global Priorities Institute"}}, {"_id": "cFFv6bXSKAaT2u8tW", "title": "Congrats to our newly certified Operations Managers!", "postedAt": "2024-03-25T23:51:14.094Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Congratulations to <strong>Alex Rahl-Kaplan </strong>(community coordinator for <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.nyc/\">EA-NYC</a>), <strong>Ruben Dieleman </strong>(campaign manager for Existential Risk Observatory and incoming co-director of <a href=\"https://www.effectiveenvironmentalism.org/\">Effective Environmentalism</a>), and <strong>Myriam Vanderzwalmen</strong>, project manager at Eurogroup for Animals, the graduates of the second Operations Fellowship (now called HIA Organization Accelerator) program!</p><p>In this second iteration of the program, I've gotten to watch our &nbsp;participants absorb the content, becoming excellent nonprofit leaders and helping both themselves and their organizations grow.</p><p>Here are some notes of their key takeaways from this experience, which were similar to the takeaways from our first cohort:</p><ul><li>They all felt that they gained useful knowledge and experience to be able to do their jobs better</li><li>They all felt that the program gave them good experience as career capital in nonprofit leadership and management</li><li>The coaching sessions and the content sessions and homework were independently valuable, and together they made their gains stronger</li><li>Some especially valuable takeaways included:<ul><li>Exposure to different areas of expertise and experts available to play a role as service providers and support the organization, especially ones that are not focused on naturally (eg, marketing and strategy)</li><li>Highly relevant day-to-day and strategic content</li></ul></li></ul><p>Some things we're going to change going forward for future cohorts; some of these changes are already in place with our 3rd cohort:</p><ul><li>Moving the session on a business plan to the beginning, so that it can be developed throughout the life-cycle of the course</li><li>Meetings twice a month instead of once a month</li></ul><p>As a recap, this program is an experiential learning style and hands-on educational experience designed to support nonprofits and infuse nonprofit leadership with strong operations and management skills.

Are there dominant actors that wield most of the power, or is it more equally distributed?</p><p>We can ask this question on two levels:</p><p>On the national level, how powerful is the central power\u2014the government\u2014relative to smaller actors, like private companies, nonprofits, and individual people?&nbsp;</p><p>On the global level, how powerful are the most powerful countries\u2014in particular, the United States\u2014relative to smaller countries?</p><p>I think there are some common heuristics that lead people to think that power is more decentralised than it is, on both of these levels.</p><p>One of these heuristics is what we can call \u201cextrapolation from normalcy\u201d:&nbsp;</p><p><i>Extrapolation from normalcy</i>: the view that an actor seeming to have power here and now (in relatively normal times) is a good proxy for it having power <i>tout court</i>.</p><p>It\u2019s often propped up by a related assumption about the epistemology of power:&nbsp;</p><p><i>Naive behaviourism about power</i> (<i>naive behaviourism</i>, for short): the view that there is a direct correspondence between an actor\u2019s power and the official and easily observable actions it takes.</p><p>In other words, if an actor is powerful, then that will be reflected by official and easily observable actions, like widely publicised company investments or official government policies.</p><p>Extrapolation from normalcy plus naive behaviourism suggest that the distribution of power is relatively decentralised on the national level. In normal times, companies are pursuing many projects that have consequential social effects (e.g. the Internet and its many applications). While these projects are subject to government regulation to some extent, private companies normally retain a lot of leeway (depending on what they want to do). This suggests (more so, the more you believe in naive behaviourism) that companies have quite a lot of power relative to governments in normal times. And extrapolation from normalcy implies that that this isn\u2019t just true in normal times, but holds true more generally.</p><p>Similarly, extrapolation from normalcy plus naive behaviourism suggest that power is relatively decentralised on the global level, where we compare the relative power of different countries. There are nearly 200 independent countries in the world, and most of them make a lot of official decisions without overt foreign interference. While it\u2019s true that invasions do occur, they are relatively rare (the Russian invasion of Ukraine notwithstanding). Thus, naive behaviourism implies that power is decentralised under normal times, whereas extrapolation from normalcy extends that inference beyond normal times.</p><p>But in my view, the world is more centralised than these heuristics suggest. The easiest way to see that is to look at crises. During World War II, much of the economy was put under centralised control one way or another in many countries. Similarly, during Covid, many governments drastically curtailed individual liberties and companies\u2019 economic activities (rightly or wrongly). And countries that want to acquire nuclear weapons (which can cause crises and wars) have found that they have less room to manoeuvre than the heuristics under discussion suggest. Accordingly, the US and other powerful nations have been able to reduce <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation\"><u>nuclear proliferation</u></a> substantially (even though they\u2019ve not been able to stop it entirely).</p><p>It is true that smaller actors have a substantial amount of freedom to shape their own destiny under normal times, and that\u2019s an important fact. But still, who makes what official decisions under normal times is not a good proxy for power. On the national level, you\u2019re typically not allowed to act independently when national security is perceived to be threatened. And on the global level, smaller nations are typically not allowed to act independently if global security, or the security of the most powerful nations, is perceived to be threatened. Thus, if you look beyond surface appearances, you realise that the world is more centralised than it seems.</p><p>Indeed, more sophisticated analyses of power reveal that that\u2019s true even under normal times. As Steven Lukes argued convincingly in his classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Lukes\"><u>Power: A Radical View</u></a>, naive behaviourism is not a good way of thinking about power. Actors often refrain from taking certain actions because of veiled threats from more powerful actors\u2014an exercise of power that naive behaviourism fails to classify as such. In other cases, the more powerful actors don\u2019t have to do anything at all\u2014the less powerful will simply know (e.g. based on general knowledge of global politics) that it would be unwise to challenge them in certain ways. Both on the national and the global level, different actors try to second-guess each other all the time. They often reason \u201cno, we won\u2019t do this thing, because then that other actor will do that thing, and that\u2019ll upset this third powerful actor\u201d. (Sometimes these chains of reasoning can be long and intricate.) This means that official and easily observable decisions will not mirror power structures in a straightforward way. Instead, the underlying power structure is often more centralised than surface appearances suggest.</p><p>In his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow\"><u>Thinking, Fast and Slow</u></a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman\"><u>Daniel Kahneman</u></a> argues that we intuitively think that \u201cwhat you see is all there is\u201d (WYSIATI). We overemphasise the importance of what\u2019s easily observable, and fail to properly consider factors that are harder to observe. That might be an underlying reason that people employ extrapolation from normalcy and naive behaviourism. It\u2019s easy to observe what\u2019s going on here and now, and it\u2019s easy to observe official decisions. Therefore, people might overemphasise what they say about power in general.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc751bc2a-b30a-4cca-9f01-f7aa9afba35a_639x490.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LDPiCjh6tcjaaoiZL/i22pn5qdxb1dzo3mjfkb\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LDPiCjh6tcjaaoiZL/ml1gz0xohpehhhptpt1t 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LDPiCjh6tcjaaoiZL/cbs8s6tpwfailcle21yg 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LDPiCjh6tcjaaoiZL/modjy59n5rkuubqnvfui 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LDPiCjh6tcjaaoiZL/i22pn5qdxb1dzo3mjfkb 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The President of the United States is very powerful, actually.</p><p>Relatedly, I think <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gEShPto3F2aDdT3RY/sleepwalk-bias-self-defeating-predictions-and-existential\"><u>sleepwalk bias</u></a>/<a href=\"https://www.stafforini.com/docs/elster_-_explaining_social_behavior.pdf\"><u>the younger sibling fallacy</u></a> plays a role: \u201cthe failure to see others as intentional and maximising agents\u201d, who predict others\u2019 behaviour and act accordingly. To understand power, we have to consider the fact that we\u2019re looking at sophisticated actors who engage in complex reasoning. They\u2019re thinking several steps ahead, trying to model each other. But we often fail to take that into account, tacitly assuming that people are implausibly myopic. And if people had been myopic, then they wouldn\u2019t have refrained from taking action for fear of retaliation from more powerful actors. As a result, such hard-to-observe manifestations of power would have been rarer, and easy-to-observe behaviour would have been a better proxy for underlying power structures. As such, sleepwalk bias supports naive behaviourism.</p><p>Moreover, sleepwalk bias suggests that powerful actors won\u2019t take proper action even when their security is threatened\u2014that they\u2019ll sleepwalk into disaster. That means (besides a greater risk of a catastrophic outcome) that the distribution of power will remain relatively decentralised even in a crisis. Thus, sleepwalk bias supports extrapolation from normalcy as well. But in my view, these assumptions are not right, since <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gEShPto3F2aDdT3RY/sleepwalk-bias-self-defeating-predictions-and-existential\"><u>powerful actors do tend to take action to prevent disaster</u></a>, which in turn typically increases their effective power.</p><p><a href=\"https://stefanfschubert.com/blog/2022/2/7/ideological-epiphenomenalism\"><u>Ideological epiphenomenalism</u></a>, which says that much talked-about ideology actually has little causal influence on events, may also contribute to extrapolation from normalcy. In my view, ideology is a key reason that smaller actors have a fair amount of leeway under normal times. It\u2019s largely because of (liberal) ideology that individuals have a fair amount of liberty to pursue their own projects without government interference under normal times. Likewise, it\u2019s at least in part because of ideology that smaller countries usually don\u2019t have to do exactly what more powerful countries tell them (cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_system\"><u>the Westphalian system</u></a>).</p><p>However, if you deny that ideology has these effects, then you have to come up with some other explanation for why powerful actors don\u2019t constrain weaker actors more. The most obvious candidate is that they simply lack the requisite power. If that\u2019s your view, then you might also think that those powerful actors won\u2019t be able to bend weaker actors to their will even in a crisis. But I think that\u2019s wrong: they often can, and the reason that they don\u2019t do so under normal times is largely ideology. Under extreme circumstances, they let liberal and Westphalian values be trumped by security considerations. (Though they, too, are typically infused with ideology; e.g. regarding government responsibilities for its people).</p><p>***</p><p>If this analysis is correct, it has some implications for how to think about AI risk. As long as AI systems are relatively weak, we are living in relatively normal times, and consequently, companies are by and large left to their own devices. Similarly, powerful countries don\u2019t interfere with AI developments elsewhere. If extrapolation from normalcy was right, then such hands-off policies would continue under more extreme circumstances as well. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. If the US government saw AI progress initiated by a domestic company or a foreign actor as a security threat, they wouldn\u2019t sit idly by. At that moment, the true power structure would reveal itself.</p><p>This isn\u2019t to say that there will be such a moment. There are several reasons why there might not\u2014including technical reasons I won\u2019t cover here\u2014but one that\u2019s of special interest to me is that weaker actors are of course aware of the possibility of an intervention from the US government. Therefore, they will, in turn, likely not just sleepwalk into such an intervention, but will try to prevent it in some way; e.g. by reducing the threat the US government might perceive, and/or by maintaining a close dialogue. As discussed, such dynamics can get pretty complex, making predictions difficult. But regardless of whether push ever comes to shove, the power of the US government will likely influence these dynamics in a big way. Whether overt or covert, power is more centralised than it may seem.</p>", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}]
