I'll let Kerry respond in more detail as he is leading on EA Global, but IIRC the main reasons we had in mind were around fostering more of a sense of community, excitement, and illustrating the global scale of the movement.  It might also make it easier to use the events to promote the books on EA that are coming out if they are near one of the book launches.  Finally, having them simultaneously would make it easier to get pre- and post-event media coverage, especially if we have tie-ins with the books.  I know that these sorts of benefits are hard to define, but I think that having the events simultaneously will help foster a sense, both within the movement and among the public, that EA is a rapidly growing, exciting and influential global movement, which I think could be quite helpful to us.  </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "y4qWpqQZhrj5Hcdj7", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "P6bJqSeJDWCHEkwqN", "postedAt": "2014-12-12T14:11:00.591Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey Brian. This is an interesting idea which I've thought about a bit. Here are a few considerations in favor of holding it simultaneously:</p>\n<p>1) Stronger feeling of community: By hosting it simultaneously we can do things to make us feel like one community. For example, we can livestream what's going on in other locations, have EAs ask questions of the speak live on Twitter etc.</p>\n<p>2) Better movement PR: One of the things I noticed in coming up with the idea is that non-EAs instantly get the wow factor of holding multiple events simultaneously all over the world. It helps give EA a globa This would be lost by holding multiple events at different times. Since this event helps attract new EAs, I think the PR matters a good deal.</p>\n<p>3) Less organizational attention devoted to EA Global: Holding the events in sequence means that EA Global steals attentional resources for longer. Since staff attention is one of our scarcest resources, I think it would be good to finish the event all in one weekend and then devote attention elsewhere.</p>\n<p>That said, I'm not confident that simultaneously holding the events is the best option, so I'd be happy to have someone convince me otherwise.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "y4qWpqQZhrj5Hcdj7", "user": {"username": "Kerry_Vaughan"}}, {"_id": "k5jTzkBMmPcko9B5c", "postedAt": "2014-12-12T21:40:44.130Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>Six questions:</p>\n<p>1.)

We would like to co-ordinate and collaborate with anyone who is working on marketing EA.  Currently the only person we know who is working on this full time is Tyler Alterman from Leverage, and we work so closely with him that he practically feels like part of the team!  We will be collaborating closely with LYCS, not least on Peter Singer's book, and we talk with Giving What We Can on a daily basis.  We are teaming up with 80,000 Hours on the EA Fellow's Programme, and we have been working with CEA to create its own branding that will make it more relevant to the movement as an incubator.  We've been talking with Tom Ash and looking for ways that we can best collaborate with effectivealtruismhub.org, which hosts many .impact projects.  As I mentioned in the plan we have been helping advise FHI on their efforts to make the discussion on AI in the media more accurate.  We have also been advising the Norwegian EAs on media strategy, and they've been helping us think through movement branding.  We've been talking with some of the German EAs about their plans to create &quot;superteams&quot; to work on new EA projects.  We've also been collaborating with the Australian EAs on the EA Forum, and we are currently in conversation with them about their hosting of EA Global.  If there are other groups that would like to collaborate with us, I'd love to hear from them! </p>\n<p>1b.  I won't speak for the Global Priorities Project (GPP) as I haven't been working on that project since August and so I'm not so up to date on their current plans.  It is worth noting though that Seb Farquhar has been hired from McKinsey to join GPP as its director and project manager, so their plans and outputs may change substantially from January when he starts.  </p>\n<p>On EA Outreach though, we do indeed plan to write up some of our lessons learned.  We have a draft post ready on our learnings from engaging with the media in 2014 that we hope to post soon.  You have probably seen my post on what I learned from engaging in policy work earlier this year: <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/7e/good_policy_ideas_that_wont_happen_yet/\">http://effective-altruism.com/ea/7e/good_policy_ideas_that_wont_happen_yet/</a>    Writing up these learnings takes quite a lot of time and so we probably won't be able to share everything we learn, but we try to pass on any particularly useful information to teams that might benefit from it.  We love getting questions from different projects and people on their outreach strategies, and I really enjoy talking with all of these projects and helping them think through their work, so if there are people reading this who would be interested in talking through some questions about their EA project then please do get in touch. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Nnp2aRZqYeZk28a48", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "s58k68AgMtTq9ypRr", "postedAt": "2014-12-13T11:57:26.295Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>On question two:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2.)

We've tried to talk with everyone who we think might have useful insights or learnings we might be able to use on EA Outreach.  Kerry Vaughan in particular has been doing a lot of this (as he is coordinating the movement-facing side of our work) and he is regularly Skyping and talking with half a dozen people a day to ask for advice and feedback on things that he is working on.  I won't bore you with a long list of everyone we are currently getting advice from, but I can assure you that it is extensive!</p>\n<p>2b.  On your questions about learning within CEA, I am fortunate enough to have led on outreach for Giving What We Can, VIP engagement for CEA, and outreach for 80,000 Hours in previous roles I've had at CEA, so much of the project plan (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/EAO2015\">http://bit.ly/EAO2015</a>) is built off the back of things I felt I learned while in those roles, and I regularly discuss strategy and learnings with the current teams working on those projects.  Finally, at CEA we have 'training lunches' which all the teams are invited to, in which someone presents on a topic that they have experience with, or a topic that they have recently been studying, and the group gets to discuss and give feedback.  We regularly have these on outreach-related topics, and in fact on Wednesday Steph Crampin from GWWC will be giving one on what she has learned from the marketing diploma that she is in the final stages of getting. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Nnp2aRZqYeZk28a48", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "muWyCBJ3eboxphyMs", "postedAt": "2014-12-13T11:59:25.979Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>On question three (the forum keeps renumbering my answers to I'm writing the numbers in text):  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3.)

The strategy that we tend to use at CEA is to experiment on a number of different things when we move into a new area and then scale up the things that work well.  For example when we created 80,000 Hours we experimented with making it a campaigning movement, an online app, a community, and a lecture series, before settling on the current model of it being a service to help people choose their careers.  Without this experimentation it is easy to commit too many resources to sub-optimal projects that we end up pivoting away from.  This is why this list does look long, and why we expect it will narrow at the end of this year, and possibly even during the year if one or more of the projects seem particularly bad on closer inspection. </p>\n<p>It is also notable that we have also taken one bigger bet, in the books that we are publishing.  In including writing time, William MacAskill's book and marketing campaign will have at least one person-year of time put into it.  This is because we were presented with a particularly good publishing deal - pretty much the best deal that it is possible to get as a non-celebrity first-time author.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Nnp2aRZqYeZk28a48", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "mGdKRAgKcrJToZWC7", "postedAt": "2014-12-13T12:00:46.905Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>On question four:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4.) Why is EA Ventures included in this? It doesn't even seem thematically related.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a number of ways of interpreting your question on EA Ventures.  The benefits of the project (increased coordination, less matching costs for donors and projects, incentives for and ease of creating new EA projects, etc.) are outlined here: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/EAVentures\">http://bit.ly/EAVentures</a> (note that the intended audience of this document is donors, and so it doesn't stress the benefits to entrepreneurs as much as it could)</p>\n<p>I agree that EA Ventures is less thematically relevant to the rest of the programme than many of the other projects, but I think it is unfair to say that it is not thematically related: this project is about making it easier for EAs to get the funding they need to start new projects, and it is in the plan in the context of  getting EAs access to the skills and resources they need to have impact. </p>\n<p>The idea was suggested by a number of different EAs in a number of different forums, and multiple people asked whether we were interested in leading on the project as no-one else seemed to want to take the lead on it.  We mentioned it to a couple of donors, who seemed pretty interested in the idea, and after writing it up in more detail and discussing its merits relative to the other things we would have been spending the time on, we decided to take it on. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Nnp2aRZqYeZk28a48", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "FWWBrFq3qGpumXgXJ", "postedAt": "2014-12-13T12:01:31.003Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>On question five: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5.)

We have already successfully spun two projects out of CEA (Animal Charity Evaluators and Life You Can Save), and these reforms would also potentially make it easier for projects to spin out of CEA should they wish to.  I won't go into the details of these reforms publicly until we are able to finalise the package and discuss it with the trustees, but we are certainly taking steps to make CEA more resilient, adaptable, and ultimately less likely to be a failure mode within the movement. </p>\n<p>As for whether EA Ventures should try to start up some of these initiatives instead, I see CEA and EA Ventures as occupying two different roles.  EA Ventures is a project to make it easier for projects to get financing, whereas CEA is an incubator of new projects.  EA Ventures primarily provides funding, whereas CEA provides: office space, book-keeping, hr and logistics support, fundraising support, legal support, charity status, and mentoring and strategy advice.  It would take a considerable amount of setup time for EA Ventures to be able to provide all of these services, and I don't think this would be the best use of resources.  Similarly, projects at CEA are always welcome to spin-off from CEA and source these services independently, but they find it beneficial enough that they choose not to do this as it allows them to focus purely on their project and not on non-profit administration which is largely handled by CEA.  For this reason I would like to continue using CEA's incubation services for the projects that I am starting and working on, at least until they reach sufficient scale, because it allows me to focus my attention directly on the project itself.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Nnp2aRZqYeZk28a48", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "y9wpwzv2LWab9s2BJ", "postedAt": "2014-12-13T12:02:03.075Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>On question six:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6.)

They ask where the donations came from and they saw a large spike in donations citing online media at the time when I did a national radio segment with Elie from GiveWell on why to donate to SCI rather than ALS in the ice bucket challenge, which was the reproduced on BBC online and in the Financial Times.  They also asked a few of the donors and they said that our articles were the cause. </p>\n<p>I agree with you that it would be nice to be able to compare the impact of the different projects.  The impact metrics we are tracking for each of the projects are different in places, but we try and measure similar metrics across the projects such as direct money moved wherever we can.  We have also been attempting to monitor whenever one of the projects leads to a new Giving What We Can member, and GiveWell have been giving us numbers on new traffic to GiveWell as a result of our media (we will set this up for other projects as well once they reach scale).  For example multiple articles we have placed in the media have driven 1000s of new visitors to GiveWell (Approximately 1 in every 200 new visitors donates to GiveWell and the average donations size is $1000, though I imagine the visitors we sent over were substantially less likely than average to donate large amounts).  We hope to use direct money moved as one indicator of the impact of each project, though this is quite an imprecise metric that doesn't capture many of the other benefits of the projects, so we will be monitoring others as well such as the number of people who sign up to an EA org as a result of these projects, the number of people who become actively involved in the movement because of these projects, etc. </p>\n<p>I hope this answers some of your questions, and feel free to get in touch if you have further questions. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Nnp2aRZqYeZk28a48", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "rxppDsyeKA7uKgNjK", "postedAt": "2014-12-13T12:22:38.369Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>It may also be worth mentioning that if anyone would like to track what EA Outreach are doing in more detail, we send out monthly updates on our activities which you can sign up for here: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ea-outreach-updates\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ea-outreach-updates</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Nnp2aRZqYeZk28a48", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "n7h4LpKwSii95xL8T", "postedAt": "2014-12-13T13:08:24.223Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>Yes, I believe so.

On p2 <a href=\"http://bit.ly/EAO2015\">here</a> I outline how our activities can be thought of as fitting into this pipeline.  Some of them are earlier in this pipeline (making it easier for people to get up to speed on the ket ideas in EA at effectivealtruism.org), while others are later (the EA Fellows Programme). The main activities targeting the later stages of this pipeline are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EA Global, which is designed to allow lots of people to meet face-to-face to make it easy for people to dive into the community.  </li>\n<li>EA Fellows Programme, which is intended to provide an opportunity for a handful of high-potential people who are interested in EA to make it a much bigger part of their life.  </li>\n<li>And finally EA Ventures which we hope will providing funding for more people to work full-time on EA projects.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my experience becoming very engaged in EA often comes about as a result of a large amount of one-on-one interaction with people in the community, so we hope to build some tools into EffectiveAltruism.org to make this easier.

I hear that you're doing great work in this area already, so perhaps you have some suggestions?  </p>\n<p>Ultimately I think there is so much work to be done in the area you've mentioned that I would hope that there are people dedicated specifically to this aim in the future, and this is something that we are hoping to develop in CEA in time.  </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ec6PBG4hRstYvjr5f", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "PPMtHW2xMyEw7aFjw", "postedAt": "2014-12-15T11:19:39.997Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Two.

Historically, unrestricted donations to CEA have been split following an algorithm between the different projects that it incubates.  In 2015, the use of unrestricted donations is likely to change somewhat, and is likely to include some fraction going to the different projects within CEA, as well as some used to support the creation of new projects, and potentially some to be assigned discretionarily by the trustees.

Unfortunately there are just so many books published each year (~1m per year) that the outside-view chances of ours being one of few that gain considerable attention and sell well is slim.  Even when you account for the fact that we have a substantial advance and top-tier publisher, the outside view says that we'll only sell a moderate number of books and will be unlikely to make more than the advance.  Inside view says that we'll do better than this because of the amount of resources going into the book, the fact that there is a movement behind the book, and because people seem pretty interested in EA-style questions at the moment.  The reason we are doing this is not for the median case though, it's for the upper tail in which we become a best-seller and EA becomes well known enough that media hosts feel the need to include it in their discussions of charity, philanthropy, and doing good.  The outside-view chances of this happening are slim, and the inside-view chances are better but not huge, though we have been told by publishers, publicists, etc. that it is a real possibility.  I will be working very hard over the coming year to give these books the best possible launches I can, but unfortunately the risk is still probably the biggest one that we are taking.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>My most salient worry for EA Global is that it doesn't sell tickets, people don't come, and it makes a major loss.  We are going to be marketing it hard, and part of the reason for moving to a global model is that it makes it easier for more people to come as they won't have to travel as far.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>My biggest worry for EffectiveAltruism.org is that it doesn't get much traffic.  There are now many popular sites that discuss EA, and though EA.org is ranked at no. 5 when I do an incognito search for 'Effective Altruism', my main worry is that it won't get enough traffic.  My other worry is that we will never actually finish building it as other higher-priority projects will take precedent, but I don't see that as as much of a risk.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I suppose my worries can be put into two broad categories, either we fail to get enough attention for EA, or we get the attention and fail to convert it sufficiently into growth of the movement.  I think both of these are very real possibilities that we are working every day to reduce the chances of.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": "ec6PBG4hRstYvjr5f", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "SpZ9jnLtZJF6N4FQ2", "postedAt": "2014-12-15T12:57:40.149Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Chris,</p>\n<p>This is a good question.  Many of the sub-projects that we are doing are one-off opportunities which we are unlikely to seek funding for in future years (e.g. a publicist for Will and Peter).

My guess at this stage is that we will want to seek further funding for EA Outreach activities in future years, as this seems to be an under-invested area within the EA movement and we seem to be well placed to execute on it, however much will depend on how much we achieve over the coming year.  </p>\n<p>I hope that answers your question, and let me know if you have any others.  </p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Niel</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "SzRX3hSabC2XPkbaL", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "5hWMjjh9y6wrvJHAi", "postedAt": "2014-12-15T15:58:52.807Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Interesting - is what Tyler or Leverage are doing written up anywhere?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not as of yet.

Those things are all terrific, but I see the potential for spreading EA (including EA Outreach's 2015 program) more as an effectiveness revolution: millions of people donating a little more, or a little \u201cbetter\u201d, or thinking about impact more when choosing their careers, will benefit the world much more than a couple hundred more GWWC members or movement volunteers. So when you say there's a gap between exposure to EA and having EA as a big part of one's life, I don't think that is the only proxy for success: isn't it better for EA to be a tiny part of many peoples' lives than a big part of the lives of a few? I'm supporting Will's book marketing, not only to maximize sales but mainly to raise his profile so as to make EA more mainstream and hopefully encourage millions of people to increase their heart footprint just a little bit. </p>\n<p>I find that donations/volunteering/career selection is generally self-serving and people don't even try to be effective so just nudging society to think about impact in these areas I think is a low hanging fruit we can pursue right away. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ec6PBG4hRstYvjr5f", "user": {"username": "Austen_Forrester"}}, {"_id": "muDD6LzpMqa63D5Pn", "postedAt": "2014-12-15T20:47:43.425Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Nitpick: are there any plans to fix the fact that effective-altruism.org and effectivealtruism.org are two different sites?

We've been keeping the publishers up to date with the plans of the other authors and publishers that are publishing books on EA in 2015.  Thus the publishers think that these dates are pretty optimal in terms of when we would want them all released: spaced out enough that each can get its own media coverage and attention, but close enough that people can write about the trend and broader movement of EA with so many books coming out around the same time.  I am a little worried that they will compete for attention, which is part of the reason why I'm coordinating both Will and Peter's marketing, so that they can collaborate where possible.  I've been thinking about this quite a bit recently, and I've settled on thinking that each book trying to maximise its own success is actually going to be really quite close to optimal, so I'm going to be adopting a strategy that is not far from that.  Essentially, the chances of any one promotional push putting a lot of media attention on EA is relatively small, and so we want as many rolls of the dice as possible.  </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "LrRhgqXsH4H8HYjKa", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "MqjvehrQWCXmEvKJY", "postedAt": "2014-12-16T16:31:57.602Z", "postId": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "htmlBody": "<p>Google estimates that there are 720 searches a month for &quot;effective altruism.&quot; I expect that to increase over time, but I don't expect search to be the biggest source of traffic initially.
