So a good alternate framing for this post might be &quot;if you're the kind of person who reads books regularly (e.g. you listen to audiobooks on your commute or you hate reading on computer screens), here are some I recommend&quot;.  And yes, I expect the ROI to be lower for people who have already invested substantial time and energy in self-improvement.)</p>\n<p>Did you finish Kahneman, by the way?
